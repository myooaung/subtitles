1
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,100
All right.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:16,110
In the last section, we have achieved getting the data from the API and show it here inside the home

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:16,830
page.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,700
In this section, we're going to add the.

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,330
Error message when something went wrong.

6
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,230
For example if the API doesn't respond or.

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:39,170
For example, if there is an error from the API, we don't the our website doesn't crash.

8
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,310
It just show an message saying something went wrong.

9
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,670
There is a very simple solution from the next.

10
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:48,940
Yes.

11
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,720
13.

12
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:59,400
So inside the next year 13, this app directory, we have this page that JSX, which is four.

13
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,460
The homepage, we can create another file.

14
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,930
And this one is called error.

15
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,240
That G6 and this file.

16
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,110
Is going to replace the error.

17
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:28,650
When error that happens, this file is going to render instead of this page that J6.

18
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:38,230
So this one should be client side as well, because we need to use the use effect from React.

19
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:44,260
So I need to create let's first create a React functional component.

20
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,170
And here at a top.

21
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,480
I changed this one to client component.

22
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,740
I just say use client.

23
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,970
And then.

24
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,210
We need to import.

25
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,640
And use the fact.

26
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,530
From React.

27
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,060
So we need to use it.

28
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,240
And also this file.

29
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,160
This one should be capitalized.

30
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,130
I change this on to this.

31
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,350
And this file is going to give us two things.

32
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:37,920
If you do structure here, this one gives us the error and also gives us something called reset.

33
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,020
So we can get catch the error.

34
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,130
If an error happens, we can console, log it and check it.

35
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,390
And the other things we need, we can do.

36
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:58,630
We can reset by, we can create a button and reset the fetching.

37
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,870
As well, for example, here.

38
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,040
First, let's do the use effect here so we create the use effect.

39
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,630
And this use effect is going to.

40
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,590
Firstly, console.log.

41
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,650
The error.

42
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,160
And also.

43
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:37,970
When an error happens, we are going to render this and console.log the error.

44
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,820
So this use effect is always checked.

45
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,940
If an error happens, it's going to.

46
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,530
Console.log for us.

47
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,180
And also let's create that message here.

48
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:56,400
So I'm going to create an H two tag or H one tag saying something went wrong.

49
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,380
So as you can see, we get the suggestion from.

50
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:01,940
Uh.

51
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,600
Get up, co-pilot.

52
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,670
So something went wrong?

53
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,530
I'm going to, uh.

54
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,180
And I'm going to add a button here.

55
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,970
The button is going to say, try again.

56
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,830
And when we click on the button.

57
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,380
So I'm going to add a click here.

58
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:35,510
When we click on the button, we want to call that reset function.

59
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,520
We just say reset.

60
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,640
You need to call this function.

61
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay.

62
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,000
And let's see.

63
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,120
Let's see what we see here inside our website.

64
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,010
Now we get the result.

65
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,880
But if you purposefully, for example.

66
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,620
I changed the API key to a wrong one.

67
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,960
For example, I add a letter here.

68
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,000
So this is going to get an error.

69
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:19,290
We see this one in the development mode, but in the production you do you don't see this error here

70
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,250
at a bottom.

71
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:27,480
And this is saying something went wrong and try again.

72
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,260
If you click on try again, this is going to fetch another time.

73
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,790
So let's style this one first.

74
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,420
I'm going to bring this one to the center.

75
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:46,920
So let's go back to the G6 and bring it to the left side and let's close the left side as well.

76
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:56,100
So here inside the diff I want to add, I want to make this one and bring it to the center using text

77
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,210
center.

78
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,210
Now I want to add some margin at a top of.

79
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,250
Ten.

80
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,760
So we have some space here at a top.

81
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:14,390
And also when we hover over the button, I want to see a different color.

82
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,060
So I'm going to just say hover.

83
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:23,310
Change the text color to amber 600.

84
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,180
Like this.

85
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:27,490
Cook.

86
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,720
So now if we fix this API key.

87
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,110
And we click on Try Again.

88
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,310
We get the results.

89
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:46,130
So if the problem goes away so we can get the correct result.

90
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,820
So that was it for creating the error message.

91
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,510
So.

92
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,030
It's very simple.

93
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,360
You just need to get the error and reset.

94
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:03,420
You can console.log it for your reference and you just create a message.

95
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,980
Something went wrong and also you can create a button to reset it.

96
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:12,990
So let's add this one to GitHub as well so we can have a reference later.

97
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,100
So this message is going to be handled.

98
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,800
The error.

99
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,010
So let's commit and push it to GitHub.

100
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,230
So let me go to my GitHub IMDB.

101
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:47,160
So now we have nine commands and the last one is handled the error.

102
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:57,310
So we just created a file inside the app directory called Error dot JSX, which is client side because

103
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,530
we are using a hook here.

104
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:11,760
And also there is two reasons it's use client because it it is using use effect, which is a hook.

105
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,860
And also we are using on click.

106
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:20,920
If you're using any of them, you need to change the component to client side.

107
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,760
Okay.

108
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,360
That was it.

109
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,350
For this section.

110
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,040
In the next section, we're going to create the loading effect.

111
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,800
So I show you in the final version.

112
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:36,740
Let me go.

113
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,880
Go to the final version.

114
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:49,730
So when you go to the final version, when we click on trending, you see a loading effect, a spinner.

115
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,250
This happened very fast because the Internet is fast.

116
00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:01,120
But if you have a slow Internet instead of waiting for the empty.

117
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,490
An empty page, you're going to see a spinner which makes a better user experience.

118
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,350
For our and the users that use our website.

119
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:21,020
So in the next section, we're going to work on the loading effect.
