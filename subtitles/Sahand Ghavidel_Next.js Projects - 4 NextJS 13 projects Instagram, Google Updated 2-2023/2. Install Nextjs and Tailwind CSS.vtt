1
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:07.880
All right.

2
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:08.750
Welcome back.

3
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.670
In this section, we are going to install next year and also to assess for styling our project.

4
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.980
First, we need to open the.

5
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.700
Command window.

6
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.650
I use common proverb.

7
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.360
Uh, let me increase the size to.

8
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.060
You can see it better.

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.520
Let's open Google Chrome.

10
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.870
And here we search for next Jace.

11
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:51.600
Here in the search result we click on next year dot org, which is the official website of next year's.

12
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.790
And here we click on documentation.

13
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.750
As you can see, you need Node.js version 12.2 or later.

14
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.680
So you need to install it first.

15
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.140
And also I think you need to have NPM as well.

16
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.700
If you're using NPM or if you're using yarn, you should install John first.

17
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.730
So we scroll down a little bit here.

18
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:35.350
You can see we can use NPC's create NICS app at latest install for next year.

19
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.730
So we can copy this line of code.

20
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.350
And we go back to.

21
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.690
A common prompt.

22
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:56.020
I would like to create a project in my desktop so I go inside my desktop using city desktop.

23
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.890
And I want to go inside a folder called Course.

24
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.500
But you can make the project whatever you want to do.

25
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.850
And here I paste the code.

26
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:23.150
And after a space at the name of the project, I already practiced this project three times, so I want

27
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.540
to put the name.

28
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.920
Twitter version four.

29
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.940
But you can name it anything you like.

30
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.580
After pressing to enter the installation process is going to start and build.

31
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.070
It's going to install packages like React, React, Dom, nex and etc..

32
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.180
I'm going to pause the video and I'll be back when the installation is completed.

33
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.260
All right.

34
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.780
The installation has been completed.

35
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:08.050
As we get suggested here, we should go inside the folder and run NPN, run there to see the result.

36
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.710
But I want to see it first inside the Visual Studio code.

37
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.360
So I first I go to inside the folder.

38
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.870
So city Twitter version four and here we can use code.

39
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:33.860
Space dot to open Visual Studio code or you can open the folder in any text editor you you prefer.

40
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.610
So now you can see that we have installed.

41
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.690
And then next year and we have some followers here and also we have some config files.

42
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:51.780
The folders we have.

43
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.190
The first one is pages that has their APIs of after.

44
00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.330
And next year.

45
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.160
And then we have the app, the dais that covers all of the project rapids.

46
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.880
Then we have index such as which is the homepage.

47
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:16.070
Then we have the public assets there follows that that people can have access inside the browser.

48
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:23.570
Then we have the styles that all the styles goes here as we're using children's access.

49
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:30.440
We don't need to work on this folder as, as much and we can delete them.

50
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.920
Ah.

51
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:39.200
And we can store Taylor and and directly install the project inside the add.

52
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.190
The components and also their home page which is indexed index as.

53
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.070
So let's open.

54
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.360
The terminology using control back tech.

55
00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:01.580
And here inside a terminal, we use npm ron dev to start the server.

56
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.490
The service is started on localhost 3000 and we can open it.

57
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.910
Just keeping the control and click here.

58
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.080
So now, as you can see.

59
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:26.820
We have localhost 3000 inside the browser and this is the template that next year gives us when we install

60
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.970
it.

61
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.050
And these are just the links to the documents inside next js dot org.

62
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:43.690
So as you can see, the, the, the styling is, uh, it's not tail and so just a normal tail style.

63
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:53.620
Now I think it's the time to install Tilman thesis and we just get rid of all of these and we have just

64
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.050
a hello word here.

65
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.850
So in a new tab, we search for television's access.

66
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.570
And in the search result we click on Tillmans.

67
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.260
Yes.

68
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.860
That com.

69
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.530
This is the website where we are going to use.

70
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:23.720
I highly recommend to you read the Dutch documentation in Switzerland says that this is the best documentation

71
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:35.210
available I ever seen and it's very easy to understand and all is with the animations and something

72
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.720
like that.

73
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.140
So it's up to you.

74
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.380
You can read it, but I'm going to explain everything.

75
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.450
All this syntax, this I use on tables to assist in this project.

76
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:56.420
So let's go to get started to install, to have access in our project as we're using next year and next

77
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.620
year is a framework.

78
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:04.640
So here in SA inside the installation, tap it, click on framework guides.

79
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.360
And here we click on Next.

80
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:08.910
Yes.

81
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.780
So we have three steps here.

82
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.930
The first is stamp.

83
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.210
We already done.

84
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.830
We we have installed tanks.

85
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:19.250
Yes.

86
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.670
And also we had seed into the folder.

87
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.340
Now it's time to install it.

88
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:31.670
Tell us you said and it's peer dependencies, the AMPM.

89
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:39.180
So the first line is going to install the auto prefix, sir.

90
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.290
So we copy this and we go back to Visual Studio code.

91
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:50.090
We don't need the command prompt anymore so we can close this.

92
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:57.070
And here is stop the server using see.

93
00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.360
Andy Press, why?

94
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.730
Here, let me clear this.

95
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:11.030
So we paste the link that we have copied from the website and we press enter.

96
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.730
The installation process is very short.

97
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:25.370
And as you can see now, we have terrorist cells in our project.

98
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:34.370
The next things we need to do is to initialize the tailwind thesis by using this code.

99
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:38.810
So this is going to initialize the terrorist.

100
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:39.290
Yes.

101
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:44.600
And add some files like the config file that we're going to need later.

102
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:49.220
So we paste the link and we press enter.

103
00:08:53.430 --> 00:09:01.920
As I mentioned, they're telling us to assess the tailwind that config file is created and we need this

104
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.060
file to add our JS files.

105
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.530
So we go back to Tailwind thesis website.

106
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:17.880
And here as you can see in the step three, we need to configure our template path.

107
00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:19.960
Here.

108
00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:26.290
You can see inside that tailwind, that conflict much as we have to add these.

109
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:27.900
Uh.

110
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:35.130
Past like pages and components you already have pages folder about.

111
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:42.450
We are going to create the components folder later when you're creating the next year's components.

112
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:49.990
So we're going to tell television first that always check these files.

113
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:57.720
Just tears for typist scripts if you're using typist, GIF and G6 and TSX.

114
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.430
So we copy all of them.

115
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:07.870
And we go back to Visual Studio code and inside children that conflict that J.S..

116
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.670
We delete all of them and replace the new codes.

117
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.640
The next step is simple as well.

118
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.040
We need to add the Tillman directives.

119
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:24.980
To our thesis.

120
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:31.010
So this is all just the, uh, installing and.

121
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:38.870
Telling the terrorists just to use their base, basically stores the components and the utilities.

122
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.360
I'm going to explain them later when we are using them the basis salient utilities.

123
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.460
So let's just copy that.

124
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.820
And we go back to Visual Studio code.

125
00:10:51.780 --> 00:11:01.800
And inside this task folder, we go to Globals, that's CSIS, and here we delete everything and we

126
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.890
paste these three lines of code.

127
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.510
I think we have finished everything.

128
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:15.070
We just need to run NPR and run Dev to see the result.

129
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.790
So we just say NPN run death.

130
00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.520
Here and we open our.

131
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.510
Localhost, 3000.

132
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.470
We refresh the page.

133
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:36.980
As you can see, the template is changed and the font is changed as well.

134
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:42.040
So let's get rid of everything and just have some hello world.

135
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:51.650
So we go back, we delete this home that modularity says because we are not using module ceases styling

136
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.040
in our project we just we are using.

137
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.490
So we delete this we go to index searches.

138
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:06.380
Let me decrease the size a little bit so you can see it better.

139
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.680
After the head tag, let's first change the title.

140
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.110
The title would be Twitter.

141
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:15.780
Clone.

142
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:21.780
And, uh, from after the hit.

143
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:33.390
You just choose everything until the last if we delete them and also we delete this install that container

144
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:41.040
because this is related to that home and that file that we deleted here.

145
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:51.810
So now if you saved the file and we go to here, so are getting some errors.

146
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:56.190
The error is because we didn't delete the imports here.

147
00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.980
So we just delete these imports as well and save the file again.

148
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.860
And we come back.

149
00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:05.970
And now it's completely empty.

150
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.850
The title is Twitter clone.

151
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.650
Let's add some helloworld here.

152
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:24.780
So now we're getting Hello World Here, which is completely styled by Taliban CSIS.

153
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:31.230
And also the suggestion that I'm getting is because I installed TAP nine.

154
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.480
I have tapped nine.

155
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:39.930
Uh, and I've got this the pro version of tab nine.

156
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.310
But you can use it if you want.

157
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.690
If you're a student, you can get a pro version for free.

158
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:51.580
Yeah.

159
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:52.990
That was it for the.

160
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.160
Templating and installing next year.

161
00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:07.060
Santillo says the next step is just to add our project to get up there isn't adding the project together

162
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:08.710
because we need to do it.

163
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:16.810
Later when we are deploying the website to our virtual or next defi.

164
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:23.020
So this is going to be much easier when we are deploying our website using GitHub.

165
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:28.330
So let's go to my get hop.

166
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.640
So we go to get hot dot com.

167
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.960
Make sure you're signing with your account.

168
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.460
It's completely free.

169
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:38.090
Then.

170
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.430
Here on the right side.

171
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.470
Let me know what you can see here.

172
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.510
The right top side.

173
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:55.840
If we click on the plus side and click on New Repository here, we add a repository name.

174
00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:01.350
For example, I just say Twitter or a Twitter version for.

175
00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.800
I just leave it to it because I don't have it.

176
00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.210
It's available.

177
00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:13.080
And a description would be to either clone.

178
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:15.270
Using.

179
00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:17.580
Next.

180
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.300
J.S. and Tailwind.

181
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.960
Just leave it public.

182
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.340
Or if you want to make it private, you can make it private for yourself.

183
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:38.420
But as I'm giving this link to you for use, I just leave it to public.

184
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.710
And here we click on Create Repository.

185
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.800
All right.

186
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:53.630
Now, we we can use these lines of codes to add our get up.

187
00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.490
To the Visual Studio.

188
00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.340
So we go back to Visual Studio code.

189
00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.020
Inside the terminal.

190
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:10.440
We stop the server using controversy and I clear it here.

191
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.700
First we need to initialize tickets.

192
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:21.660
So we just ride, get in it and we just add everything to get our.

193
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.610
Using it at DOT.

194
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:31.310
Then we can add a message using get commands.

195
00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.800
With the message of, for example, install.

196
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:42.010
Next chase and tell.

197
00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:43.450
Yes.

198
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:43.860
Yes.

199
00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:49.210
Then we can add the gear to.

200
00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:59.850
We go back to get half and we just copied this line get remote at origin and this is the the link of

201
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.080
our get up.

202
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.020
And we paste it here.

203
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:11.280
After that, we need to copy these two lines as well.

204
00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.490
First we get branches.

205
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.370
And finally we get.

206
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:19.140
Push it to get to.

207
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:28.490
Now if we go back to get half and we refresh the page here.

208
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.500
We see that we have the page.

209
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.640
Twitter.

210
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.000
And we have two commits here.

211
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:47.820
The first comment, it was automatically created by next year's year.

212
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:54.270
But the next one we have done it, which is installed next year and tells us this.

213
00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:01.740
If you go inside, you can see which which change you have done, for example, which packages you have

214
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.910
installed in package.

215
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.060
So Jason, we have installed toilets.

216
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:06.710
Yes, yes.

217
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.580
And it's dependencies.

218
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:16.500
And inside the index such as we have, we have deleted everything except we have the.

219
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.270
Each one tag saying Hello world.

220
00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:30.790
And also in post, uh, the, the other files like this USS Global first we have, we have changed that

221
00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:40.480
and also the conflict that just so whatever you done, uh, you do inside your project, you can see

222
00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:45.820
and check it later inside the, uh, GitHub.

223
00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:51.820
It's very good for reviewing your code and getting better at reading codes.

224
00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:54.620
All right.

225
00:18:55.130 --> 00:19:02.900
So that was it for the first section of our project, the installation and getting the template.

226
00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:11.120
In the next section, we're going to start with this sidebar of our project.

227
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:16.820
This is the final version of project, uh, from this URL.

228
00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:23.590
And, uh, we're going to create this sidebar in the next section.

229
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.310
So see in the next section.
