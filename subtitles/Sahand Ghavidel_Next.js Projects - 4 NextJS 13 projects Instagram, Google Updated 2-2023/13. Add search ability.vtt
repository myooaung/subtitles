1
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.120
All right.

2
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.320
In the last section, we have created the movie page.

3
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.760
In this section, we're going to create the search box and add the search ability through the movies

4
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.400
of the IMDB database.

5
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:30.860
So as you can see from the final version, we have added another search box component to the layout

6
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.390
because this component is available inside all pages.

7
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.490
For example, if you go to the about page, we can still see the search.

8
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:52.420
Uh, and also in trending on other or even the page of the movie, we can see the search bar.

9
00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.780
So we need to add it inside the layout JSX ex, which allows us to have it in all website.

10
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.880
So we go back to Visual Studio Code and we go to layout that gsx.

11
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.980
And we just add in after the search box here.

12
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.050
So I'm going to create this search.

13
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.170
Box and let's create this one inside the components.

14
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.670
So I'm going to come here and create this search.

15
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.820
Dot G6.

16
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:41.700
We just create a reac functional component using our c, and now we come back to layer layouts and we

17
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.120
can import it using contour space.

18
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:54.390
So now if you go to our website, we see the search box here.

19
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.550
So now we need to design it.

20
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.910
We need to add the input and other things.

21
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.300
So let's go back to Visual Studio Code.

22
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.240
And we create this file.

23
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.630
We go to search box that is X.

24
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.590
So instead of a div, I'm going to return a form here because we want to submit a form.

25
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:28.390
So we're going to have a form and this form is going to have an input inside it with the type of text.

26
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.640
So just create an input.

27
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.610
We added clone text, which is going to make input with the type of text.

28
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.090
It doesn't need an idea of name.

29
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:54.720
So but we're going to add a value on change, placeholder and etc. For now we just add the placeholder.

30
00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.630
We just say search because I want to just make the UI now.

31
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.850
So just say search.

32
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.440
Keywords.

33
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.070
Dot, dot, dot.

34
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.210
And let's see what we have inside our website.

35
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.120
Now we have this search bar.

36
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.620
Let's close this one.

37
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.940
So I can see the changes in real time.

38
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.680
Let's close the Explorer section using Contour P.

39
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.900
Now let's style this input first so we can see it better here.

40
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.300
So we add a class name here.

41
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.470
So we're going to style it first.

42
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.600
I want the width to be full.

43
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.400
So 100%.

44
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.480
And for this one we need to.

45
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.990
So we have the width full and we have a height of 14.

46
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.890
Then we want to make it rounded.

47
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.490
Rounded as is.

48
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.760
Hm.

49
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:10.360
So which.

50
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.420
Which is going to have a border radius.

51
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.390
And.

52
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.780
And also, I want the color of the place holder.

53
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.320
So place holder.

54
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.070
I want the color to be gray.

55
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.600
500.

56
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.090
After that, I wanted to have a remove the off line.

57
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.840
I don't want when we click on it, we see something around it.

58
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.290
So we just remove the outline by just saying outline none.

59
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.080
Like this.

60
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.540
And then we remove the background color.

61
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.010
We just say background transparent.

62
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.920
K trance parents.

63
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.730
So now we have completed the input.

64
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.060
Now let's add the button, so we need a button at the end.

65
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:44.440
So I just want to add a button with a type of submit, because when we click on it, we want to submit

66
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.250
the form.

67
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.280
So this is going to have a type of submit and also.

68
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:54.790
Inside it.

69
00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:02.470
We want to just say search and let's add some styling as well.

70
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.170
So we're going to have a class name.

71
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.280
For example, I want to change the color to be Tex.

72
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.590
Amber Burke 700.

73
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.370
Or.

74
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.950
So this is the.

75
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.690
So this button.

76
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.610
Or we can make it 500 so you can see it better.

77
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.340
You should test it.

78
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.020
That is too bright, so 600 would be fine.

79
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:56.420
And then when this is disabled, because we want to be it and make it disabled when there is no text

80
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.800
inside the input.

81
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:05.600
So when this is disabled, I want the text to be gray 400.

82
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.670
Okay.

83
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.140
Now we need to style this one.

84
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.350
So we have the input.

85
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:29.300
The button is here, but we want them to actually to be next to each other.

86
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.870
So for the form, I want to add some classes.

87
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:39.440
First thing first, I want to change the display to flex, so we bring them next to each other.

88
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:50.450
And then I wanted to limit the maximum width of them to be 6xl, which is going to be similar to the

89
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:50.870
head.

90
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.820
And we use m x auto to bring them to the center.

91
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.710
Which is margin X auto.

92
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:07.310
And then we use justify content between.

93
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.430
So we add a space between them.

94
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.860
And also, we want to have an item's center.

95
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:23.530
So now we just have this one here.

96
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:30.520
The other thing is I want to have some space when we have a smaller screen, so we just say

97
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.160
padding in the x axis of five.

98
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.520
We just push it a little bit here.

99
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.980
And then also when we type, I think.

100
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.110
Yeah.

101
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:45.540
This is goes all the way here.

102
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:58.680
Okay for for this one, to be sure, until this one is here, we can add inside the inputs, something

103
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.020
called flex one.

104
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:09.600
This is going to help us to have all the input all the way to the end like this.

105
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.460
And this is also working for the dark mode.

106
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.040
Let's refresh the page.

107
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.360
So this is a light mode.

108
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.270
And for the dark mode, we have this one.

109
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:39.380
So the button, you can see it now, but when this is disabled would be great.

110
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:44.620
So for checking the inputs, now we have a starlet.

111
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:49.460
Now we want to save whatever is inside the input.

112
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.980
To do that, we can use the user state react hook.

113
00:09:54.980 --> 00:10:03.080
But when we when you use any hooks, we need to change the this component to be client side.

114
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.550
Otherwise we get an error.

115
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:11.630
So we just use use client to make this component client side.

116
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:20.640
Know, we can add a piece of state called input and we track the changes inside this input.

117
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.990
So we go here just before the return.

118
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.740
Are going to create a piece of state and we call it.

119
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.360
Uh, for example, search or input.

120
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:38.850
And the initial value for that bond would be an empty string.

121
00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:45.190
And also we're going to create a function here that is going to.

122
00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:55.900
By checking the input is going to redirect a person to the different pages.

123
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.860
So first thing first, inside the input, I'm going to add.

124
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:11.770
And on change event listener, which is going to trigger a function which is going to set the search

125
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.220
to its value and get the event here.

126
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:17.990
I think I've got.

127
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.070
And then.

128
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.210
No, we cannot.

129
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.540
Let's refresh.

130
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.800
First, the error.

131
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.480
The error is that the user set is not defined.

132
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:39.530
We need to import it from React and then we need to add because we are changing this one, but we are

133
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:40.220
not tracking.

134
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:50.540
We don't have the value and we should keep the previous value by setting the value to be the search.

135
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.450
So we get the search, we update the value.

136
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:59.180
So we can keep this value.

137
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:06.360
And also we're going to track the changes here by using this unchanged event listener.

138
00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:15.510
Now, when we submit the form, we're going to add an another event listener called and Submit.

139
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:23.810
Which is going to trigger a function and we call that one handle.

140
00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:29.850
And I'll submit.

141
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:33.380
Okay.

142
00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:36.820
So we need to create the function here.

143
00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:38.990
I'm going to create a function.

144
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:50.160
Called Handle submit, which is going to firstly prevent the default behavior of the browser, which

145
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.570
is refreshing the page.

146
00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:59.850
So when we type something here and we click on search, we're not going to refresh the page.

147
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:06.090
And then this is going to console log the search, but I don't want to console log it.

148
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.820
First thing first, I want to prevent.

149
00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:14.300
If this search is not existed, we're going to return.

150
00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:15.440
It means.

151
00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:22.340
When there is no nothing in the search box, we cannot submit it.

152
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.080
And then.

153
00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.430
If there is something we're going to use.

154
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.440
A router.

155
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:41.410
A hook from the from the next Yes 13 called use router which is coming from next forward slash navigation.

156
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.710
So I'm going to import that one first.

157
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:46.030
I'm going to import.

158
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:50.540
As you can see.

159
00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:55.240
Suggestion we import use rather from next forward slash.

160
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.260
This is for next 12 router.

161
00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.360
The next.

162
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:08.400
Uh, the one for the next 13 is next post like navigation.

163
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.980
And then we need to initialize this one here.

164
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:17.170
We just create a constant called router, which is going to call this used router.

165
00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:21.610
And finally, here we're going to push.

166
00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:27.700
The person to the forward slash search for slash the term.

167
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:34.950
So as you can see, we get all the suggestions from GitHub copilot, which is going to help us to code

168
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.980
faster, but you need to understand the code.

169
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:44.810
Even though you could very fast, so never copy paste or even your copy paste, you understand?

170
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.670
That is quite fine.

171
00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:47.750
All right.

172
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:52.640
So now we when we submit the form, when we write down something.

173
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:59.370
For example, we write down hello and we press enter.

174
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:05.420
We it which we are going to be redirected to the URL for slash.

175
00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:07.350
Search for Slash.

176
00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:07.980
Hello?

177
00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:09.240
All right.

178
00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:13.590
But when there is nothing in the search, I don't.

179
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:17.640
I want to prevent the ability to submit.

180
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:23.220
We have the prevention here, but I want the button to be disabled as well.

181
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:27.210
So inside the button, I'm going to disable this.

182
00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.050
I want to disable when there is no.

183
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.930
Search.

184
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:38.780
K.

185
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.070
Now the button is disabled, so I cannot click on it.

186
00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:48.880
But as soon as I write down something, this is going to be enabled.

187
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.980
Now we can go to the desired page.

188
00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.640
So now we need to create this page.

189
00:15:55.650 --> 00:16:02.880
So for example, I searched something, for example, Wolf, and this is going to redirect us to the

190
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.920
search for slash wolf.

191
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.120
Now.

192
00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.970
What I want to do is.

193
00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:18.750
Get this term here and I'm going to show all the results and all the results related to this fall,

194
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:19.540
Wolf.

195
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.020
So I'm going to create a page.

196
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:28.150
So let's open the Explorer section using contour shift E.

197
00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:37.860
And inside the app directory, I'm going to create a file which includes the folder and the file.

198
00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.450
So the folder is going to be search.

199
00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:50.820
Another folder is going to be this search term.

200
00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:57.150
And finally, we're going to create a file called Pages X.

201
00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:02.220
So this is going to create the two folders and one file for us.

202
00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:06.150
And let's create the file using our FC.

203
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:08.190
And we named the.

204
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.870
Component search.

205
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:23.050
Page K Now, if you go to our website and we just wait a little bit until the compilations finish and

206
00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:29.440
we refresh the page, we should see the search page here inside this.

207
00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:30.520
All right.

208
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.980
Now we want to work on this page.

209
00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.380
This page is server side.

210
00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:47.050
First thing first is server side, because we don't have any user fake or any hoax or any states.

211
00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:51.790
So we can simply keep this for server side, which will be faster.

212
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:53.400
As well.

213
00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:03.710
So we need to make this one asynchronous first thing first, and then we are going to.

214
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:05.500
Uh.

215
00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:07.740
Fitch.

216
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:08.850
Fitch data.

217
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:16.130
We're going to just create a constant and we call it race as before.

218
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.890
It's it's very straightforward.

219
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:25.220
We're going to wait and fetch from from a dynamic.

220
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:27.000
Page.

221
00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.730
As we get the suggestion, it's.

222
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:34.120
API the movie.

223
00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.380
DB dot org.

224
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:36.780
Forward.

225
00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:37.420
Slash three.

226
00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:37.690
Forward.

227
00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:38.380
Slash.

228
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:45.420
A search for slash movie, and then we're going to pass the API key.

229
00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.620
And finally.

230
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:51.680
We're going to pass the query, which is our search term.

231
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:59.210
Sometimes I get surprised with the suggestion that the get GitHub copilot gives me.

232
00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.080
That is nice and.

233
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:09.150
We need to get this search term which can be available from here.

234
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.290
So here we get the params.

235
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.670
And inside the params we have the search term.

236
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:26.070
So we just say params dot search term and we have access to the search term and we have access to the

237
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:34.530
API key because it's located inside the environmental variable and we can just have access to it using

238
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.740
process dot e and v dot API key.

239
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:43.020
So now we get this information.

240
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.870
And also I want to add more things here.

241
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:49.770
The other things I want to do, I want to.

242
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.720
Just showed the English language.

243
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.890
So I'm going to add.

244
00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:57.450
Uh.

245
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.060
Language.

246
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:01.820
English.

247
00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:07.070
And also I want to exclude the adult movies.

248
00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.820
Just I want to include the.

249
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.150
Normal movies, not the adult ones.

250
00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:13.960
And.

251
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.760
We can just get the first page and we don't need it because we just want to get the first page.

252
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:28.730
And later if we we add the pagination, we can use this trick to increase the page so we can just make

253
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.740
the page dynamic as well.

254
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:38.120
So now we are getting just the English movies and also the ones that are not adult.

255
00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.990
So after this.

256
00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:50.270
First, I want to check if this race is not okay.

257
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:51.400
The result?

258
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.690
I want to return, for example.

259
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.700
I want to throw an error.

260
00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.320
I want to throw.

261
00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:03.380
New error.

262
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.740
And then this is going to be with the message.

263
00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.300
Error fetching data.

264
00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:22.760
So this is going to when we do this one, this is going to send an error.

265
00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:27.620
But because we have created the error that JSX, we already have the message.

266
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.560
Something went wrong.

267
00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:29.400
Try again.

268
00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:36.380
So this is going to use the same file for this one because this is the parents of this folder.

269
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.830
So this is the way next year 13 works.

270
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:47.780
You have this error, that JSX layout that G6 hit the G6, all of them works for all the files under

271
00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:48.290
them.

272
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:58.820
But if you want an exclusive message error or anything for this file, you need to add error dots file

273
00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.050
next to this file.

274
00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:09.800
So if you want a specific exclusive and only for this page error, you need to create another file for

275
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:09.980
this.

276
00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.090
Otherwise, this is going to use this file by default.

277
00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.080
So after that we're going to get the data.

278
00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.610
By converting it to JSON file.

279
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:24.020
And finally.

280
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.690
Uh, yes, we got it.

281
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:31.430
And now we.

282
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.510
We can get the results.

283
00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.300
By just getting data that results.

284
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.190
Okay.

285
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.710
So we got the result.

286
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:59.550
And also we can easily show it here because we have a component called results and we can just pass

287
00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:03.540
this data to it and see it inside the results.

288
00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:12.750
So here now, instead of just saying search search page, I want to just create a.

289
00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:17.360
Valuable.

290
00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:22.670
And I just want to say if the results exist.

291
00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.170
And.

292
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:31.280
The results that links.

293
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.040
Is equal.

294
00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:37.640
To zero.

295
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:48.000
So if there is a result, but the result number of results is zero, it means that there is no matching

296
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.670
result for that specific search.

297
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.830
So here we're going to.

298
00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.110
Just the.

299
00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:03.360
We're going to add a message here.

300
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:06.810
So I'm going to I just want to add ah1 tag.

301
00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:14.070
That h one tag.

302
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:18.750
We just want to say no results.

303
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:23.570
Found.

304
00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.750
So now I just want to style this one real quick.

305
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:37.170
I just want to say I just want to add a class name.

306
00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:45.100
You see that it's got a slow every compiling is taking ten second or 20 seconds.

307
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.380
So because we are doing a real time.

308
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:55.150
So it's getting a little bit slow, but we are just getting close to the end of the project.

309
00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:57.460
So we add a class name.

310
00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.720
And the class name.

311
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:07.450
I just want to make bring the text to the center using text center.

312
00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.600
And also, I want to change the.

313
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.890
I want to add some padding at a top of six.

314
00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.560
So that was it for this part.

315
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:23.610
If there is no result, but if the result exists.

316
00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:26.010
So if there is a results.

317
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:29.800
So I want to just.

318
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:36.920
Return date components that we have created.

319
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.760
The results, I'm going to pass the result to it.

320
00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:45.480
So let's see.

321
00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.640
So we have this component.

322
00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:50.930
We have to import it.

323
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:55.130
So I'm going to use contra space to auto import it.

324
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:57.710
So we cannot auto import it.

325
00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:58.960
We need to open the file.

326
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:06.390
So this result at JSS, if it's open here and then you can just easily get this suggestion.

327
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.590
I'm going to close the other parts.

328
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:15.350
So we go to.

329
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:17.360
Here.

330
00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.860
And then we use control space so we don't get the suggestion.

331
00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:22.460
That's fine.

332
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:24.080
Oh, it's already imported.

333
00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:29.150
Okay, that's fine, because I thought this is not imported.

334
00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:30.380
I was trying to import it.

335
00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.520
So it's imported from the components for slash result.

336
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:40.010
Now we just need to pass the data, which is results.

337
00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.190
And this is going to be equal to.

338
00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:50.720
That results that we are getting.

339
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.650
From the API cut.

340
00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:57.000
So.

341
00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:07.630
I suggest you, when you are doing working on the some APIs and requesting you just stop the server

342
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:14.800
code until you understand and then you start the server and then check the results.

343
00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:20.110
Otherwise, it's going to be very slow like that because I want to show you the result in real time.

344
00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.600
I started this server.

345
00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.700
So now.

346
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:30.750
Now we are getting the result for the wolf, as you can see.

347
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:32.550
So.

348
00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.940
This is my favorite movie, The Wolf of Wall Street.

349
00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:38.380
So.

350
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.750
You can see the results are coming.

351
00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.210
So it's a bit slow for the.

352
00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.920
Because still compiling.

353
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:50.150
So that was it for creating the search results.

354
00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:51.020
So.

355
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:59.580
We just fetch the data from this URL which gives us the data and then we got the result.

356
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:07.380
And if the result was true, we pass the data to the component that we have created before.

357
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.780
So we just see it like that.

358
00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:15.880
And if there is no results, if there is an error, we're going to throw the error.

359
00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:24.040
If there is no error, but the length of the result is zero, we're going to say no results found.

360
00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:29.060
So you can see here the result.

361
00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:31.970
Let's try to search something else.

362
00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:36.390
For example, what should I search?

363
00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.080
So, for example, we just say.

364
00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:42.440
Uh.

365
00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:45.670
Terminator.

366
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:58.130
And this is going to bring all the movies related to with the term Terminator in the title or the description.

367
00:28:59.580 --> 00:28:59.910
Okay.

368
00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:02.770
So that is working now.

369
00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:08.230
And also it works with the dark mode or light mode as well.

370
00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:10.310
As you can see, it's a bit slow.

371
00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:13.440
This is just the development mode.

372
00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:13.960
Now.

373
00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.200
I want to deploy it to the Verso.

374
00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:20.350
So this is going to be faster.

375
00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.640
So first thing first, I want to just put this one to GitHub.

376
00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:30.610
So we use Contour shift G and we just click on the plus sign.

377
00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.340
And here we add a message.

378
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:37.080
And we just just say add.

379
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.530
Search ability.

380
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:44.600
And we're going to push this one to GitHub.

381
00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:49.250
So we need to, I think.

382
00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:52.400
This plus sign didn't work.

383
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.610
So now we need to commit and push it.

384
00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.470
So.

385
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:03.600
Let me stop this server so you get a faster fork.

386
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.690
So now I go to the GitHub.

387
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:15.510
If you go to the comments now, we should see a new commit called add search ability.

388
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.090
Let's review what we have done.

389
00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:26.910
So we have added the component, the call search box to the layout of JSX to see it all in all website.

390
00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:33.240
And we have created a file inside two folders.

391
00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.220
Search for size Search term.

392
00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.180
Which is a server side component.

393
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:47.650
We have imported the result component to show the result, and we have changed this one to asynchronous.

394
00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:55.720
And we got the parameters here params here, which gives us the params that search term.

395
00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:03.040
And we have used this URL to get this search query.

396
00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:14.750
And also we have excluded the adult movies and we just said use the United States or English language.

397
00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.080
If the result was not okay.

398
00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:22.130
It means if there is an error, just throw a new error.

399
00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:30.890
Otherwise just the turn the data to a JSON and save it inside a constant called data.

400
00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:35.570
After that we just get the result from data that results.

401
00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:38.030
And we.

402
00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:39.320
We have returned.

403
00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:48.500
If the result was true and the length of the result was zero, we just said no result font.

404
00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:55.370
Otherwise we just pass the result to this component and show it inside the page.

405
00:31:55.370 --> 00:32:01.130
And also we have created another component called Search Box, which is a client side.

406
00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.960
Component because it is using the hawks like.

407
00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:12.920
Use a state and use router from next forward slash navigation.

408
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:19.250
We have created a piece of state called Search to track the search inside the.

409
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:23.150
This term.

410
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:25.300
And.

411
00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.190
We just.

412
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.380
Initialize the router.

413
00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:36.360
And also we have created a function which is going to prevent the default behavior.

414
00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:41.250
And if there is no search in the box, we're going to return.

415
00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:47.920
Otherwise we're going to push or redirect the person to a new page with this URL.

416
00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.020
Forward slash search.

417
00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:49.220
Forward.

418
00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.700
Slash the search.

419
00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:55.870
And this search which is coming from this.

420
00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:59.040
Estate the piece of state.

421
00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:05.670
We have created a form here which is going to submit, and when we submit it, we're going to call a

422
00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:07.830
function called Handle submit.

423
00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:15.900
And we have created an input which which has the value of search and it has an unchanged event listener

424
00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:23.370
which is going to trigger this function, which is going to set the search to the e, the targeted value

425
00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:26.400
which is coming from the value of the input.

426
00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:34.220
And finally, we have created a button which is going to be disabled if there is nothing in the.

427
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.140
Search.

428
00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:40.910
And also the type of this button is submit.

429
00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.550
Also, I forgot to add something here.

430
00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:45.070
You can add it yourself.

431
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:51.860
After we redirect the person to this page, you can set this search term to be an empty string again.

432
00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:52.370
So.

433
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:55.520
So when we search something.

434
00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:01.490
And then when they show the search, we want to delete this search term so you can do it.

435
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:02.320
It's optional.

436
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:03.200
It's up to you.

437
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:08.030
So you just set the search to an empty string.

438
00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:13.630
So now we have created the website, but this is inside the local host 3000.

439
00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.770
So we cannot share it with others.

440
00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:21.140
We just need to deploy this one to the Internet.

441
00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:24.080
The place that we want to deploy it is.

442
00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:26.160
Versal.
