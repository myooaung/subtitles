1
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:07,890
All right.

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:15,360
In the last section, we have finished installing next year and Tillman CSIS for our application.

3
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:23,500
And also, we made our initial template for the index, such as file.

4
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:32,260
In this section, we're going to start with the header section and be able to finish the left.

5
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:40,480
Section of our project before starting this part, I would like to.

6
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,880
And to get.

7
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,710
GitHub repository it for my application also.

8
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:56,450
And you can do it as well because beneath GitHub for deploying our application at the end.

9
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,170
So here in the Google.

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,360
I search for guitar.

11
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,770
And in GitHub, that can.

12
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,610
Let's sign in with our.

13
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,350
Account, my account is Sarhan Capital.

14
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,870
I sign in, so we're on the right corner.

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,430
You can see a plus sign here.

16
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,930
We add a new repository.

17
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,680
And, uh.

18
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,530
And we just named the repository.

19
00:01:53,010 --> 00:02:02,660
I just write down the same as the application and install version for the description will be Instagram.

20
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,520
Clone using next.

21
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,060
Two, yes.

22
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:12,800
And.

23
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,980
Tailwind.

24
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,300
Yes, yes.

25
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,980
It's going to be public and they're going to create the repository.

26
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:42,360
So here this is the commands we need to initialize to get up and push our application inside it up,

27
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,500
so we go back to Visual Studio code.

28
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,860
Let's clear the terminal.

29
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,880
First, we need to add everything to the kit.

30
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,070
Using kit at.

31
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,050
That which means all.

32
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,430
Then we have to commit it.

33
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:14,040
I mean, put the message for the comments and the message will be installed next year.

34
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:23,090
And tailwind CFS and create.

35
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:25,560
The.

36
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,960
First template.

37
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,130
Ben?

38
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,760
We go to.

39
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:51,220
Uh, without a guitar, and we copied this line up, could get remote at.

40
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,620
And we paste it here.

41
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:08,790
So now we just use get push to the first time when you're pushing your application, you need to call

42
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,590
the it's just telling you you need to use this line of code.

43
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,840
So we copy and paste it here.

44
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,660
But the next time you're committing and pushing, you don't need to do that.

45
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,580
So now we already created our GitHub page, as you can see here.

46
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,490
Uh, we just uh.

47
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:40,380
You need to adjust the refresh by clicking on this installation for, as you can see now we the get

48
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,460
hub automatically created our right me.

49
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,790
And we have already two commands.

50
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:57,310
First one is automatically created by the next chess application and the next one is ours, which is

51
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,510
installed next year until the CIUSSS and create the first template.

52
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,260
Click on it.

53
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,300
They see that we installed.

54
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,230
Tilman CCIs.

55
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:14,330
And also, we changed the title of our application that.

56
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,950
Header feet and model.

57
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,510
And also, we changed the.

58
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,270
Conflict that is.

59
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,110
And global first.

60
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,730
Yes.

61
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:30,990
All right.

62
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,100
So now we can start.

63
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,030
Creating the hair section here.

64
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,610
Let me demonstrate you again, that's.

65
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:50,080
Here we have, uh, three parts.

66
00:05:52,210 --> 00:06:02,050
So we have a header section here, which includes three sections the logo, the search bar.

67
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:07,480
And also we have the menu and the profile icon.

68
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:16,600
So in this section, in the in this video, we're going to start with the the this part.

69
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:18,790
All right.

70
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,580
Now in the package touches on level.

71
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,380
They create a folder with coloured components.

72
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,190
All our components will be inside this folder.

73
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,140
And the first component is Heather 30th.

74
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:51,280
In order to create the functional component, you just need to right after see.

75
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,870
And we click on the first auto suggestion.

76
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:05,920
In order to get this suggestion, don't forget to install the package.

77
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:14,080
Ash, the package here is seven React Redux.

78
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:15,950
React native.

79
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,290
All right now, we just yeah, we just right.

80
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,520
Hannah and we go to.

81
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,590
First, we go to the Explorer section and we go to index searches.

82
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,380
And here we are at the header component that we have just created.

83
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:50,310
In order to import it, you can automatically import using country space at the end of the header.

84
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,870
A word here.

85
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,140
You just need to go at the end and.

86
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,710
Use control space.

87
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,200
So we get the auto suggestion.

88
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:09,220
Every click on the first author suggests, and we successfully import this one.

89
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,580
All right.

90
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:13,960
And then.

91
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,160
We don't need this image, I don't know.

92
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:32,020
All right, so we already have our header components inside next year inside the index, such as so

93
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,640
we start this server using npm run dev.

94
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,170
So we're going to see the change here.

95
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:59,400
So as I mentioned, we have three sections inside her left middle and the right section.

96
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,200
So inside the header component.

97
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,550
Instead of this, we're just at three.

98
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,490
Uh, just say left

99
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,680
middle and.

100
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:20,910
Right.

101
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,170
All right.

102
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,750
We start with the left section.

103
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,010
Which is just a local.

104
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,010
Here we at the some.

105
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:46,740
Diff, because we need to install them later and use Flexbox.

106
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:53,940
So we have to death, and inside is the second, do we add the.

107
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:05,430
Image component, which is a component created by next year, we're going to optimize our image and

108
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,110
make them responsive as well.

109
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:21,060
So we're going to all imported using this sort of suggestion at a top here, and it has a source attribute

110
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,020
as see.

111
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:29,880
And the source is going to be the image we're going to find on the internet.

112
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,860
So we just search Instagram on Google, we choose images.

113
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,080
And.

114
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:38,830
Yeah.

115
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:44,840
I choose the color to be transparent, which means doesn't have any background.

116
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,290
And we can choose this one.

117
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,510
Shack.

118
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,330
Or this one at this?

119
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,890
This one would be fine.

120
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,720
We just right click on it.

121
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,560
This is from Gen X Gen Explorer stocks.

122
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:15,680
Com We right click on it and they click on copy image address.

123
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:23,750
We go back to Visual Studio code and we added double codes and inside a double code.

124
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,020
This set of color coded pasted link.

125
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,660
This is going to give us some error, and this is normal.

126
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,670
Everybody gets this error.

127
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:45,830
It's showing that because the image component of the next year, if a little bit is secure, it doesn't.

128
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,990
We have to define the.

129
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:52,070
The links that we are going to use, so.

130
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,170
We need to add this link.

131
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,390
Jan Explorers dot com to next that conflict?

132
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,030
Yes.

133
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,770
So we copy this.

134
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,200
Link.

135
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:10,710
And we go to hear stuff conflict that yes.

136
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,600
And here we just add images.

137
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,490
And in fact, images the ad, the domains, domains.

138
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,810
And, uh, inside.

139
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,750
And Ari, we at the dummy.

140
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,150
Because this is a conflict file, we need to restart the service, so we need to stop the server using

141
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,650
Contra C.

142
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:50,760
And we just use campaign Ron Diff to start the server again.

143
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:01,740
Now we are going to get another error, but this one is already fixed, but the next error is we need

144
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,620
to act with or ha and height or we need to add layout fill.

145
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,370
So we are going to use the layout to fill.

146
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,470
And later, we're going to add the height and width using tailwinds to assist.

147
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,600
So we just say layout feel it means fill the the area it's you can see it's a huge.

148
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:37,360
Now, but we just can add a class name here and the children's justice.

149
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:48,630
A class that is going to make this on the keep the aspect ratio off, the image is object.

150
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,880
Contain.

151
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:59,470
Now you can see the image looks fine.

152
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,280
Let's make it a little bit smaller using.

153
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:12,390
A height of 24 and width of twenty four.

154
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,450
And it should be relative to be applied.

155
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,330
As you can see it very nicely at the top.

156
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:31,810
We don't want this logo to be shown firstly in the mobile size, so we just see hidden and in the large

157
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,610
size we want.

158
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:41,560
We just want to see this logo when the page is in its large scale.

159
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:47,320
So we just right in line with for the large.

160
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,680
Now, if we increase the size.

161
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:57,350
Off the page, in some point we should see the logo.

162
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,100
This is the large size.

163
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,800
And if we decrease, we don't see it.

164
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,390
And when we are smaller, we want to see another image.

165
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,710
So let's ask first the cursor pointer.

166
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:24,760
Before getting to the point that actually it's just at a pointing hand when we hover over the element.

167
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,530
You can see.

168
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,210
All right.

169
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:35,000
We just need to copy this and the second image that we want to replace with this one when we have a

170
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,650
smaller size.

171
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,840
So in this search result, I want to get.

172
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,810
Another one from Wikipedia.

173
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,290
Just let's make it any color.

174
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:58,500
Yeah, this one, the first one from Wikipedia dot org, we click on it and we copy it.

175
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,980
Copy the image address here.

176
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,950
We go back to.

177
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,590
Visual studio code, and we replace this as I see the second assassin with the.

178
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:21,400
This one in the new address, obviously, we're going to get an error because we need to add to Wikipedia

179
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,900
that already to the next that conflict that yes.

180
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,700
So we copy this.

181
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,360
And we go to.

182
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:35,850
Next, that conflict that is and added here.

183
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:45,160
Once again, we need to restart the server because we will change something in the config file.

184
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:52,640
So we can see here to find a change in next aticonfig that restored the server to see the changes in

185
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,180
effect.

186
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,290
So we just started and run their.

187
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,240
We shouldn't get any error now.

188
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,140
But we cannot see the image because this image.

189
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,390
Sorry, so here.

190
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,440
It's healing as well, so we just need to.

191
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:29,570
Instead of being hidden in the mobile side, I want to be see the image, and in the large side, I

192
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,620
want it to be hidden.

193
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:36,200
And also, it's too big now.

194
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,390
Let's change this to 10 with the 10.

195
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,730
So, yeah, that's looks better.

196
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,530
So when we.

197
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:55,310
Now we go to the over the large size, we can see that the logo replaces with.

198
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,540
Instagram.

199
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,230
Yeah.

200
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:01,580
All right.

201
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,470
So let's a little bit work on the.

202
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:12,960
Let's add something on the right side, so we can assign it a little bit more.

203
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:19,630
So we just write down something here like.

204
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,410
Right.

205
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:22,800
Five.

206
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,370
OK, so.

207
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:37,390
Let's make it flex the top, the top div that contains everything you make it flex to it, bring everything

208
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,380
next to each other.

209
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:49,450
And we use Item Center to bring it to the center, uh, horizontally or in y axis.

210
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:59,770
Then the use justified betveen to push everything to the side, and we make a space between the.

211
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:07,310
And when we have a bigger screen, I don't want to.

212
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,860
All of them to connect to the.

213
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:16,890
Well, we just met set the Max with to be.

214
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,460
Six Excel.

215
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:23,760
All right.

216
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,540
So now we see that this one doesn't connect to the wall.

217
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,510
All right.

218
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,580
Is she is still getting the effect of Instagram?

219
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:42,570
I also that one is in the right side, both in more than six excel.

220
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,640
We are not getting to, we are not touching the ball.

221
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,420
We're going to bring them to the center in the next section.

222
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,250
When we add more things.

223
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,640
To the header, it makes more sense.

224
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:07,770
So in the next section, we're going to do this search and a search bar, we're going to make this search.

225
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:20,370
Search bar, we have to install a package called, uh, Tillmans thesis form to get a beautiful, uh,

226
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,780
beautiful form.

227
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:32,290
So let's before doing finishing this video, let's add everything to the guitar.

228
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:43,860
So just to get at and we make a new commitment with a message of.

229
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:50,060
Add insult to.

230
00:20:54,170 --> 00:21:07,370
Instagram logo to the left side of the hardware components.

231
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,160
All right.

232
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,260
And, uh, we just push it to the guitar.

233
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,650
Using Get Push.

234
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:31,650
Let's check the changes now, if you refresh the page, we should see three comments.

235
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:40,650
That is done only 18 seconds ago, and the last comment is an Instagram logo to the left side of the

236
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:46,200
header component and you can see the changes we created.

237
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,510
Heterogeneous.

238
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,640
We finished the left side.

239
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,070
And we added two images.

240
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:06,150
And also in the next that conflict that yes, we added two domains to not get any error when we're seeing

241
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:12,450
the images and inside the index that, yes, we added the header component.

242
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,210
Yeah, that was it for this.

243
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:21,380
S. In the next section, we going to start creating this search bar.

244
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,730
So see you in the next section.
