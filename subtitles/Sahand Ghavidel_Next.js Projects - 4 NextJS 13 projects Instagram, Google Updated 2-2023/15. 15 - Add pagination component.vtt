WEBVTT
1
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.820
All right.

2
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.190
In the last section, we have completed the.

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.370
Result designing for the image part.

4
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.920
In this section, we're going to work on the pagination section of our project.

5
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:30.180
We want to create a button, two buttons on the bottom next and previews, which is going to change

6
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.790
the URL and adds a parameter called a start.

7
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.000
And based on that parameter, we're going to fetch different results from Google API.

8
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.700
So first thing first, I want to just create the UI.

9
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.290
So just create the next and previous button and then we want to work on the fetching part.

10
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.530
But in order to not get the.

11
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.600
The error of two many requests, again, from the Google API.

12
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.270
I'm going to just temporary go to that web and just uh.

13
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.710
Make an API.

14
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.160
Just change the API key.

15
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.250
Or you can change the URL to get an error.

16
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:28.170
So for example, I just add Q at the end of this one, and also for the image, I'm going to add a Q

17
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.150
here so we can remember that we are getting an error for fetching.

18
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.800
So we are not going to fetch data as an exhaust our API key.

19
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:47.130
So if you know, for example, refresh the page after 10 seconds, you're going to get an error saying

20
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.510
something went wrong.

21
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.350
So now just wait for 10 seconds.

22
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.570
So as you can see, we get something went wrong, but we can fix it later when we need to show the results.

23
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.030
But for now, just work on the UI as we see in the final version we have next.

24
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.890
And when we click on next, we're going to see the another button called previous.

25
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.890
So.

26
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.520
We don't see the previous first, but when we have a number more than ten, which is 11.

27
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.440
Now we see the previews and then we can just use both of them.

28
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.650
So we need to create a component and this component is going to be client side as well, because it

29
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.430
has interactivity with the user by clicking on it.

30
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.170
There is a way to make it actually server side, but there's no point to just the two buttons.

31
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.480
It can be loaded later on when the page is loaded completely.

32
00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:02.520
So we can make this for client side and we can add add the same component to both of the image and the

33
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.740
web.

34
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.260
So we can use this same component in the image part as well, which is here.

35
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.710
So we need to just create one component.

36
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:23.940
So we go to components and we create a new component and we can call this one pagination button buttons.

37
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.530
So we just say pan generation

38
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.070
buttons.

39
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.430
The G6.

40
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.790
So we can use RFC to create a React functional component.

41
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.920
I think pagination is wrong.

42
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.970
At generation.

43
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.120
Let's see.

44
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.060
What's the problem with that spelling suggestion?

45
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.700
Okay, it has, I hear.

46
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:12.910
So I'm going to fix this ball here and here and then also rename this one to pagination.

47
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.390
Okay.

48
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.960
All right.

49
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:24.570
So now we can add this component to both of them to web and image.

50
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.150
So we need to go back to image a results component.

51
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.540
Image search results.

52
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.300
And also, we want to put it inside the Web search result tool.

53
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.120
So inside the image search results, I'm going to add a div here at the end.

54
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.240
And inside that, I'm going to add this pagination buttons.

55
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.180
I'm going to import it from the components and the things I want to do.

56
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.220
I want to add some margin.

57
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.520
Left 16 to this death to bring this one a little bit on the right side.

58
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.890
And then for the Web search results, we're going to add this one as well.

59
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:22.060
But the Web search result is already have the margin left, so we don't need to add another div.

60
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.470
So we just need to add it at the end of this.

61
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.190
File just below.

62
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.730
Just above the closing div tag.

63
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.030
So we just add the pagination.

64
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.460
Buttons.

65
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.640
Let's close this and let's check that we have inside both of them.

66
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.510
We need to wait ten second until this one to be loaded.

67
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.740
And we can temporarily remove actually that waiting to.

68
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.050
So we don't actually see the component now here.

69
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.940
So let's go to the all.

70
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.400
Let me remove this weighting here, which is inside the page.

71
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.940
So I'm going to temporarily remove this weight.

72
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.970
So we're going to quickly see the result.

73
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.570
And then when we are creating the loading effect, I'm going to add it again.

74
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:56.470
So now even inside the web, we don't see the component.

75
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.930
Let's fix this API for the web.

76
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.250
I want to see if with results we can see this one or not.

77
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.050
So I'm going to refresh the page again.

78
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.220
So let's go to Image.

79
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.300
Oh, I fix it.

80
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.050
Sorry.

81
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.280
This is for image and for the web.

82
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:35.530
We need to fix it too.

83
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:42.880
So here we see the pagination buttons and inside the web.

84
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:51.880
Also we see the pagination buttons, so we cannot actually get the error.

85
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:58.630
Let me change the API key so we can test this on.

86
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.740
So without the API, we get the same error and we don't see the pagination.

87
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.290
Okay.

88
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.960
So we cannot do this way.

89
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.330
Okay.

90
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:09.990
So.

91
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.000
So let's add this just the.

92
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.960
Ten second wait, and then we try to do it.

93
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.250
I try to.

94
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.560
If the too many requests happened, I'm going to stop the video.

95
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.260
That's fine.

96
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:28.830
Okay.

97
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.920
So let's create this.

98
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.030
Let's refresh the page.

99
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.900
Okay, let's bring this one to the left side so we can treat it, see the changes, and we just bring

100
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.100
the pagination buttons here.

101
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.110
I'm going to start working on the pagination.

102
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.540
We don't see it again.

103
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.500
Okay, so in the mobile size.

104
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.830
We need more padding at the bottom so we can see the pagination.

105
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.950
So inside the.

106
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.370
Let's hear.

107
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.270
Inside here I'm going to go to.

108
00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:29.830
We're.

109
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:33.360
No, sorry.

110
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.210
You should go to the results.

111
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.430
The results?

112
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:46.640
If you remember, we have added a margin padding bottom of 24.

113
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.960
So that is not enough for the mobile size.

114
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.480
So for the mobile size, let's try a bigger numbers.

115
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.300
For example, 30.

116
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.030
Let's see what number they have.

117
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.900
32.

118
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.280
K still not enough.

119
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:09.510
36.

120
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.710
Q Let's refresh the page.

121
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.550
Okay, now we see the pagination buttons here.

122
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.840
Still not enough.

123
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.850
Let's increase this 36 to, for example.

124
00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.380
40.

125
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:03.330
Okay, now we have enough space, but in the small size and above, we want to change the padding bottom

126
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.010
to the 24 again.

127
00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.810
But that was enough.

128
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.860
Great.

129
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:18.550
And then let's let's just search for something that is not existed so we can just get.

130
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.260
And resolve not find.

131
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:26.720
And then we see that if we can easily see the pagination part.

132
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:33.500
So we don't see the pagination if we actually don't have the results.

133
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.140
Make it.

134
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:42.640
So that's a difficult part in my in my previous projects Google Clone.

135
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.670
With next year's 12, I have made a mark.

136
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.480
But here I decided to.

137
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.650
Don't do it.

138
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.180
But it was a mistake.

139
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:51.390
You.

140
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.580
You can create a mark.

141
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.150
And instead of the real results, you can create it.

142
00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.910
If you want to know how to make a data mark.

143
00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:06.720
You can check the previous version of the Google clone, which is available to you.

144
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:07.980
But it's okay.

145
00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:13.710
Just let's now move on to the pagination and create it here.

146
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:24.760
So for the pagination, as I mentioned before, we need to create this one client client side.

147
00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:28.070
So I'm going to make it use client.

148
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:41.030
We need to get some things from the URL, including the this path name search web.

149
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:50.330
And also we need to get the parameters to because we want to search based on the previous search.

150
00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:55.550
And then when we click on the next, we just change the start one.

151
00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:01.430
So we're going to get we're going to import.

152
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.520
I have two here.

153
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.940
We're going to import two things.

154
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.420
Use path name.

155
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:28.720
Which is coming from next navigation and also use search preps Use path name for getting the path name

156
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.540
and use search params for getting the parameters.

157
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:41.950
So two things we import here and then here we need to initialize the path name by just calling it path

158
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:42.610
name.

159
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.990
Equals to use pathway.

160
00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:52.010
And also you want to initialize search path name.

161
00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.380
And then we want to get.

162
00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:03.300
Two things from the search path name, which is the first is the search term.

163
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.760
You get the search term.

164
00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:18.860
Which is equal to search path named dot get search path search term and the other things you want to

165
00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.230
get is the start index.

166
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:28.460
So you want to create a new parameters called a start index, or we can call it a start.

167
00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:35.420
And if it's not existed, we want to make it equal to one, not zero.

168
00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.520
We want to make it equal to one.

169
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.730
And then we want to call this one a start.

170
00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:49.040
And the other things I want to do is to convert this one to number because we want to get it as a string,

171
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.220
but we want to use it in a mathematical equation.

172
00:14:52.340 --> 00:15:02.600
So we need to change this one to number so it can be one 1121 and etc. or if it not existed, we want

173
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.010
to get it one.

174
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:04.640
All right.

175
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.880
So this is the things we want to do.

176
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:15.140
And also we want to get two icons, arrow left and Arrow right.

177
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.800
So as you can see from the final version.

178
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:22.250
So we want to get it from the React Icons package.

179
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:30.240
So we're going to search for an icon called Chevron Left and Chevron Right.

180
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.330
So we just say Chevron.

181
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:37.010
I don't know, I pronounce it correctly.

182
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.700
So this is a Chevron left and Chevron right.

183
00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.170
This one I want to use.

184
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.740
So the left one, I copy it.

185
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.680
I'm going to import it at a top.

186
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:59.600
Which is going to be Chevron left.

187
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:05.240
And we can also import Chevron right from React icons for slash P's.

188
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:10.010
So we have two icons we can use inside our website.

189
00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:16.640
Let's close this React icons and we bring our website again to the right side.

190
00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:28.440
So let's add the icons and everything else inside this div and also we want to create.

191
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.670
The other things I want to do is to create a link tag.

192
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:38.230
So when we click on the icon, we're going to go there.

193
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.000
So let's see the errors first.

194
00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:50.430
Very.

195
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.880
That's the problem.

196
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.860
Because I have deleted already.

197
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:00.560
Okay.

198
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.540
Let's refresh the page.

199
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.460
It's empty.

200
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:27.040
Div Now, now inside this empty div, we want to have two places, one for the left and one for the

201
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.210
right side.

202
00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.280
But do you want to make a conditional?

203
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.400
We don't want to see the previous button.

204
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:38.440
When we just come to the page, we want to go to the next one.

205
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:47.110
And if the number of start in the URL is more than 11, we want to see the previous one so we can come

206
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.710
back.

207
00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.080
So we're going to create a condition.

208
00:17:50.470 --> 00:18:01.630
If the START index is more than ten and we want to create.

209
00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:07.300
So let's close this one first.

210
00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:16.330
So now in this condition, we want to add a link tag, which is coming from the next link.

211
00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:27.980
Now, let's close this and inside the link tag, we're going to have the icons and etc..

212
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.540
For example, let me stop the server so we don't get an error.

213
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.400
While we are creating that.

214
00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:45.800
So now inside this we want to have a dev which is going to include the icon, which is the bees chapter

215
00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.650
and left.

216
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:52.890
And also we want to have a paragraph or a span saying previous.

217
00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.110
So we don't need to.

218
00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.630
We just create a paragraph saying.

219
00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.720
Previews.

220
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.600
So let's.

221
00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.890
So that is enough for this file folder.

222
00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:22.250
The link we want to have the edge ref, which is going to be dynamic first.

223
00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.830
Because we want to have the past name first.

224
00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:32.060
By adding a dollar sign, we get the path name.

225
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:42.140
Path name is can be forward slash web slash, sorry forward slash search post slash web or forward slash

226
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:42.740
web.

227
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.830
A full sized, searchable slash image.

228
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.780
So it can be dynamic.

229
00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:52.700
So based on that, we're going to go next or previous.

230
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.500
And then after that, we have the search term.

231
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:18.000
Which is going to be dynamic too, which is equal to that search term that we get from the F here,

232
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.900
from the search params that get search term.

233
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:25.020
So we've got this search term here as well.

234
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:35.790
After that, we're going to have another parameter which is going to be called a start and this is equal

235
00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.550
to that.

236
00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.280
Is start index that we get from the URL.

237
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:55.060
And because we are clicking on the previous pattern, we need to minus this one to from ten.

238
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:57.070
So we go back to the previous file.

239
00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:03.510
For example, when we are in 11, when we click on the previous one, we go to what?

240
00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.070
But if we are 21, we go to 11.

241
00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:10.670
So this works like that.

242
00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.210
And then we need to add some styling here.

243
00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:20.430
So for example, the button, the icon, I want to make the height to be five.

244
00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:27.870
And here we want to bring them next to each other, sorry, on top of each other using flags.

245
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:32.850
We use Flex column to bring them on top of each other.

246
00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:41.550
We can use cursor to be pointer, so we see a pointing hand when we hover over these icons and we use

247
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:47.550
items center to bring them next to each other.

248
00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:47.910
We're.

249
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:55.120
And sorry horizontally exactly nested and align with each other.

250
00:21:55.170 --> 00:22:01.140
And also when we hover over it, we want to see underline to.

251
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:09.230
Okay, so.

252
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:22.260
And then we have some styling here at the top, which is going to be we change the text color to be

253
00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.070
blue.

254
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.200
700.

255
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:30.330
This is going to be applied for the both previous and the next buttons.

256
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:35.370
We want to change the display, to flex, to bring them next to each other.

257
00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:47.280
We change the padding in the x axis to ten padding in the bottom of four, and we just use justified

258
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:55.530
content between to add a space between them and also in the space in the small size and above, we want

259
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.510
to have the justified a start.

260
00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:09.210
So at the bigger size we see them like the final version on the left side, but in the mobile size we

261
00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:12.270
see them exactly in the center.

262
00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:18.930
So here in my final version, I didn't fix the pattern, but they come in the center.

263
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.530
So I'm going to show you when we start the server again.

264
00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.650
So let me complete this one first.

265
00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:33.850
So now, in this small size and above, we want to have a space between them.

266
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.400
So we just added a space x 44.

267
00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:47.050
And for the small size and above we add, we remove the padding in the x axis of this, set it to be

268
00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:47.680
zero.

269
00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.220
All right, So.

270
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:55.370
We have created for the previous button.

271
00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:00.500
Let's copy this one and create the next button, which is very similar.

272
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.120
So I'm going to copy this.

273
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.180
Using all shift arrow done.

274
00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.870
And here we're going to fix this.

275
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:18.040
So this is this one should be less or equal to 90.

276
00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:22.230
So we don't want to go more than 100 results.

277
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:29.810
And then this one instead of minus should be plus.

278
00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:37.430
And instead of using Chevrolet and left, we use Chevrolet and.

279
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:38.690
Right.

280
00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.340
And instead of saying previous, we just say next.

281
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:52.790
Okay, so now let's start the server and see the our result.

282
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.450
So I'm going to use NPM run dev to start the server.

283
00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:07.460
Let's wait for a while until then to get we need to stay 10 seconds for the results to come.

284
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.860
And now I think we can refresh the page.

285
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:16.750
Right.

286
00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:31.950
So after 10 seconds, we can see the result here.

287
00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.410
And we have the next button.

288
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:44.390
And then if we click on next, we're going to see

289
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:50.780
some changes here to just wait a few second.

290
00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:53.040
Okay.

291
00:25:53.060 --> 00:26:00.440
Now we see that a start is 11 and also we see the previous button in the mobile size.

292
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:07.280
There are exactly they are in the just we have a space between them.

293
00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.270
The previous is on the left and the next is on the right.

294
00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:22.100
But when we are over the small size, we see them just on the left side, which is for the justified

295
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.440
content, a start.

296
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:33.020
So we are changing this one and let's see it in action inside the image two.

297
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:35.060
So we go to image.

298
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.370
So.

299
00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:43.400
Just wait for 10 seconds to be loaded because we have added it.

300
00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.890
Again, I mentioned we have added some waiting.

301
00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.270
So let's click on next.

302
00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:53.830
Now we should see the start 11th here to.

303
00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:02.830
Okay, now we see the previous pattern.

304
00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.830
Let's go to the right side.

305
00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:07.750
Okay.

306
00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:08.950
Okay.

307
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:13.000
In the image, we still need to add some padding.

308
00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:16.060
So I'm going to go to image results.

309
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:27.840
Uh, should go to image search results, and we need to add some padding at a bottom like the one we

310
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.500
did here.

311
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:35.820
So for them, this one should be for the small size and above, but for the normal.

312
00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.610
Uh, for the mobile size, we want to have some padding bottom.

313
00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:46.510
I think it was for t we have added for the web.

314
00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:53.320
So let's save this one and see the results in action.

315
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.240
Very.

316
00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:11.340
So, okay, now we see that we have proper space in the mobile size here.

317
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.920
Okay, It's working.

318
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.110
Fine.

319
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:23.720
So now the things we want to do is to really get the results for the next results.

320
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:32.210
Now we are just changing the URL, nothing else, but we want to change the result for the Google search.

321
00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:41.150
So we need to go to when we do the API request, we also need to

322
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:45.920
change the URL for the fetch.

323
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:47.600
So we go to.

324
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.740
So let's close everything.

325
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:55.940
We need to go to.

326
00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:00.540
For example, MH page.

327
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:04.590
And also we want to get the start from the URL.

328
00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:13.560
So inside the server side, we can get it using these search preamps.

329
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:14.640
All right.

330
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:20.250
So we don't need to just import use search params and then initialize it.

331
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:23.750
But in the server side is different in client size.

332
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:32.370
We did that one, but here we just can just tap to the search params and get this start index.

333
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:43.680
So here at a border at the top we just create a constant and we call it a start index which is going

334
00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:53.730
to be equal to search params dot a start or it can be a one not zero.

335
00:29:55.050 --> 00:30:01.650
And then here at the end we're going to add that a start.

336
00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.930
Which is equal to a start index.

337
00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:11.320
And we need to do the same things for the web as well.

338
00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:12.740
So I'm going to copy this.

339
00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:19.330
Go to Web dot G6 inside the page that is inside the Web.

340
00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:23.240
And here at the top, I'm going to add that on here to.

341
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:26.720
And then we can add that one at the.

342
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.600
As start equals a start index.

343
00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:33.150
All right.

344
00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:44.400
So now let's see that we can get the result for the next, for example, in the MH first.

345
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:48.390
Are we already getting the next result, actually?

346
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:51.780
And then just pay attention for the first image.

347
00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:55.610
Which is, uh, this one.

348
00:30:56.030 --> 00:31:06.260
And if we click on next after ten second, which is waiting time for the fetch request after changing

349
00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.580
this URL.

350
00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:12.860
And the reason is very slow because we are in the development mode in the production mode.

351
00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:15.950
This changing URL would be faster.

352
00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:21.050
As you can see, the image is different, so we are getting a different result.

353
00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:25.130
Let's test this one for the web as well.

354
00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:36.500
So when we click on all, we go to the web result after 10 seconds, and then we're going to test the

355
00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.250
next button.

356
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:40.640
So the first one is Taylor and Cars.com.

357
00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:50.290
So when we click on next, we should get a different result at the top after ten second from.

358
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:59.760
So as you can see, we got the result for another website.

359
00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:00.930
So it's working.

360
00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.300
The pagination is working.

361
00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:09.540
So okay, so let's stop this server and add everything to GitHub.

362
00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:21.620
So I'm going to open the source controller using Contour Shift G and we add everything using this button,

363
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:28.850
and then we can create a message saying add pagination.

364
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.200
Component.

365
00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:43.430
And we can just click on this icon and commit and push it to get up.

366
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:51.680
So now we can just go to our GitHub repository, We refresh the page and we can see the new commit.

367
00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:59.200
And we have now 16 commits and the last one is add pagination component.

368
00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:02.180
Let's review what we have done here.

369
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:09.920
So inside the image folder page is X, we have created a constant called a start index, which is going

370
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:16.400
to get the parameter search parameters start from the URL.

371
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:22.630
If it is not existed, we're going to make this constant to be one.

372
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.220
So we're going to fetch the first page.

373
00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:36.560
And also we have modified the URL inside the API, which is a start equal to a start index, so it can

374
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:48.050
be one 1121 and etc. Inside the web folder page that we did the similar things, we got the 13 start

375
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:51.080
from the URL and also we modified this.

376
00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.720
You are all based on that.

377
00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:58.200
And finally, we have created.

378
00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:07.440
So I have just add some padding at the bottom to fix the responsiveness of our website and see the pagination

379
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:14.040
in the mobile size by just adding a padding bottom of 40 instead of 24.

380
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:20.460
And we have created a pagination buttons components.

381
00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.610
And this is a client side.

382
00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:29.550
It can be a server side, but it doesn't matter because it's it's going to be loaded after the page

383
00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:31.470
is completely loaded.

384
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:36.270
And you know how to make it a server side.

385
00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:45.010
You just instead of using these folks from next navigations, you can just get all sorry you cannot

386
00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:52.960
make it actually the server side and now I remember because this is a component you cannot get the use

387
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.570
the search params in next 30.

388
00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:58.900
So this one that's why I made it.

389
00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:07.090
Clients that are totally forget why I why I have decided to keep it client side so we cannot get the

390
00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:08.860
search params from the.

391
00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:11.790
Server side in the components.

392
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:16.100
We can just make get them in the pages, not in the components.

393
00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:16.740
I don't know.

394
00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:26.370
It's it's a feature which it's a rule of next 13 or it's a block because I couldn't figure figure out

395
00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:30.330
how to get these parameters inside this component.

396
00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:31.380
But it's fine.

397
00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:38.760
We just make it client side and we get the use path name and use search, perhaps using next navigation.

398
00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:48.530
But because we are using these folks, we cannot make them make this component server side.

399
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.510
We need to change it to clients.

400
00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:59.580
Then we have initialized path name and search path and params and we got two parameters from the URL

401
00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:07.880
search term and start index, which is coming from these parameters is start and search term.

402
00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:15.600
We have converted this start one to number by adding a plus here, and if it's not existence, we're

403
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.000
going to set it to be one.

404
00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:30.070
And we have created two parts here for the left and right or previous or next, which is going to be

405
00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:33.610
a dynamic routing to the.

406
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:43.010
A start index minus one or start index plus minus ten or plus ten.

407
00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:53.570
So this one is actually can be dynamic based on the image or web as well, because we are getting the

408
00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:55.820
path name here as well.

409
00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:57.170
All right.

410
00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:05.090
And also in the Web search results, we have added the padding bottom of 40 to create a responsive.

411
00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:12.400
Design and we have added the pagination buttons component here.

412
00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:18.400
So that was it for creating the pagination for our project in the next section.

413
00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:21.580
We're going to work on the loading effect.

414
00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:29.830
We are going to use a new name of folder convention of next year 13, which is.

415
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:39.780
And loading the DJs, which can be exclusive for the image and the VIPs.

416
00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:46.630
For example, if we click on Web, we see a different, different loading effect in the image.

417
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:48.910
We see a different design.

418
00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:53.770
I'm going to show you how to create these loading effects using Tailwind CSS as well.

419
00:37:54.250 --> 00:38:03.270
And so it can be very beautiful and the user's experience is seamless change inside our website.

420
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.950
So when we click on Image, we don't wait for a while and then we don't see any change.

421
00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:09.700
All right.

422
00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:14.440
So see you in the next section for the loading part of our project.
