1
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:07,660
All right.

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:16,000
In the last section, we have created the header section for the web and image pages.

3
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,370
But they haven't completed this search box.

4
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:24,050
And in this section, we're going to create this search box.

5
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:34,760
If you look at the final version, you can see that the search box include an input here, a cross icon

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,410
for deleting the word that is existed.

7
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:48,620
For example, if you click on this file, because to make this input empty, then we have two more icons,

8
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,720
the microphone icon and also this magnifier icon.

9
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:02,060
So also between these two sections, we have a border here, so we need to style it like that.

10
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:03,480
And.

11
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:14,380
So let's go back to Visual Studio Code and we go to inside the search box.

12
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,760
So the things we want to do here is to create a form.

13
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,500
So we just delete this.

14
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,020
Dave and I create a form here.

15
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,560
Inside this form we're going to have.

16
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,830
Uh, the input.

17
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,700
And also the three icons.

18
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,370
So first I want to add an input.

19
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,140
After the input we have to three icons.

20
00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:01,200
We're going to search for the icons inside the React Icons package.

21
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,000
The first icon I want to find is the cross icon.

22
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,460
So I'm going to search cross.

23
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:14,260
And they want I want to use these are x cross to.

24
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,610
So, Ryan, it's just our cross to that.

25
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,360
Copy that and go back to here and paste pasted.

26
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,160
And the let's import that one as well.

27
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,820
So we're going to import.

28
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,240
Oryx cross two from React icons First flash r X.

29
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:55,590
The next icon we want to have is a microphone icon.

30
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:03,300
So we're just going to search Mike and the one I want to use is B, is Phil, Mike, Phil the first

31
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,900
one.

32
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,320
So let's add it here.

33
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:22,510
So we can just import that on as well, which is coming from React icons for slash bees and just you

34
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,070
need to match the end with the beginning of the icon.

35
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:40,660
The last icon is going to be the magnifier, which is we just need to search the word search.

36
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:50,380
And the name of that is I line search the second one.

37
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:59,410
But just copy this one and we go back to Visual Studio Code and we paste it here.

38
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,840
So we need to just import it at the top.

39
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:10,940
So we get the suggestion from GitHub Copilot, which is helping us to quickly style our project.

40
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,610
So let's check what we have here.

41
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,350
Let's refresh the page.

42
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,750
Now we have three icons here.

43
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,330
Let me zoom it a little bit.

44
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,350
So we have the three icons.

45
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,210
And the input is here at the top, so we need to style it.

46
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,800
So let me bring this one to the right side.

47
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,970
And now we bring this one to the left side.

48
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,830
Let's close.

49
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,120
Okay, it looks good.

50
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,840
So now with the things we want to do is to let me.

51
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,780
The.

52
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,580
First, we style these

53
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,150
icons.

54
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,260
So the first icon to cross icon.

55
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:21,890
I want to make it bigger by changing its text to two x large.

56
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:29,250
And then let's make the color of it to be gray.

57
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:38,620
500, and let's set the cursor to be pointers.

58
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,860
So when we hover over it, we see a pointing head.

59
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,710
This?

60
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,470
Yeah.

61
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,820
Now we can see a pointing hand when we hover over it, and the color is gray.

62
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:03,450
And also, we want to add some margin on the right side when we are in the bigger size.

63
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,240
After the mobile size, we have margin right of two.

64
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,510
Okay, let's keep continue and we go to the microphone.

65
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,010
Here.

66
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,930
For the microphone.

67
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:35,440
I wanted to be hidden when in the small size, I don't want to see the microphone.

68
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,440
So as you can see, it's hidden now.

69
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,720
But after the mobile size, I want it to to be visible.

70
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,830
So I just change the inline flex.

71
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,780
So in the bigger size, we should see the macro fork.

72
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,140
So essence and line flex.

73
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,410
Think you need to save this one.

74
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,860
Okay.

75
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:29,820
You can see the microphone here in the bigger size, like a medium, but in the small size, we don't

76
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,050
see the microphone.

77
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,650
Let's keep it this size so we can see the changes.

78
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,280
Cook.

79
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,390
So let's keep continuous styling the microphone.

80
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,690
Let's make it bigger.

81
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:52,800
We just say takes for Excel.

82
00:07:53,700 --> 00:08:00,120
I want the color of this microphone to be blue 500.

83
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,660
And let's add some padding in the left size four for.

84
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,540
And also we want to have some border on the left side.

85
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,040
With the size to.

86
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:24,570
And we can just change the color of the border to be gray.

87
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,880
300.

88
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,150
I can't see the border.

89
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,630
But if we bring them next to each other, you can see it better.

90
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:47,590
So I'm going to bring them next to each other by changing this form display of the form to be flexed.

91
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,590
Okay.

92
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,290
Now you can see them next to each other.

93
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,260
Let's keep continuous silence.

94
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,920
We come back again and complete the form.

95
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:08,220
So for the microphone, we have created this border color.

96
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,700
We can add some margin on the right axis of three as well.

97
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,360
So we have some space between the microphone and the magnifier.

98
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,660
And finally, we style the magnifier.

99
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:28,820
I want to change the text to be two x large.

100
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,190
So we make it bigger.

101
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:43,030
And also we want to make this fun hidden in the mobile size, But in the mobile size and above, I want

102
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,960
to see them.

103
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,620
So I'm going to change the inline flex here.

104
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:54,170
We changed the color of this one to be Tex blue.

105
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,690
500.

106
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,420
And also we set the cursor to be pointer.

107
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,350
So when we hover over it, we see a pointing hand.

108
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,560
Practice.

109
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,670
So now we have completed the

110
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,150
icon, so let's style this input.

111
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,390
For the input.

112
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,000
Let's add a class name.

113
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,180
Let me fix this one, actually.

114
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:46,180
So let's close the left side and we can have some more space here.

115
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,720
Okay, Now let's add some class name to the input.

116
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,830
And the input.

117
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,560
We wanted the width to be full.

118
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,970
And when we focus on it.

119
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,710
I want the art line to be null.

120
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,430
So we don't see a border.

121
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:28,670
So now the the input is here, but when we click on it, we don't see anything else.

122
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:32,680
So now it's time to create and solve the form.

123
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,320
So we see the changes in the form.

124
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:40,690
So the things we want to do in the form is to add a border for the form.

125
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:54,040
And let's make the border color to be gray 200, and let's make it rounded

126
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,240
like a rounded full.

127
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,790
And let's add some shadow.

128
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,230
Compete the large size.

129
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:17,080
And in the we just added padding in the x axis of.

130
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,660
Six.

131
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,270
And padding in the y axis of three.

132
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,790
We add some margin in the left size.

133
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,020
Of ten.

134
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,400
So we have some space between the icon and the.

135
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,750
Inputs.

136
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,120
Also, we want to have some marching in the right side.

137
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,410
So the right side of five.

138
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:08,090
And also we changed the flex to grow so we can occupy all the places from the icon to the right side

139
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:16,790
because we are using the display to justify content between for the this part.

140
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:27,290
So we just use the Flex scroll and also we can set the maximum width to be three Excel.

141
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:36,500
And we can use item center to bring everything to the center vertically.

142
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,450
I think now you can see the input here.

143
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:50,580
So everything is centered vertically and also this is flex grow because it starts from beginning.

144
00:13:50,580 --> 00:14:02,010
It's not in the center and the input looks okay in the small size, we don't see the icons.

145
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,600
We can type like this.

146
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,530
We can customize it more and make it smaller for the mobile size, but I think it's fine.

147
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,970
It looks okay.

148
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:24,460
So now that we have completed the styling of the input, we want to add functionality to that.

149
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:34,420
The first things first, we want to when we come to this website, we want to actually track the input

150
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,290
firstly.

151
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:43,720
And then we want to have the initial value of this input to be this a word that we have inside the URL.

152
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:55,330
But as we are adding interaction inside the input, we cannot use it as server side because we are going

153
00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:01,600
to use an click and submit for some piece of state or hog.

154
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,470
So we cannot use it server side because the user is interacting with that section.

155
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,290
We need to create it client side.

156
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:17,140
So first thing first, I want to change this one to client side so we don't get an error.

157
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:21,460
So we just say use client at the top.

158
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,360
So we make it client side.

159
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:35,320
Then we can use something called use search params to get the parameters of the URL.

160
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,590
So I'm going to import that one.

161
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,460
So let's import the news.

162
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:53,300
Search params from next forward slash navigation.

163
00:15:53,630 --> 00:16:03,050
The next navigation is completely new for next year and its includes exclusive for only next year 13.

164
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,560
So when we have the used search prams, we can initialize it here.

165
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,350
We just call it search prams.

166
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,630
This is going to be equal to use search prompt.

167
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,820
So we're going to initialize this one.

168
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,340
And this is actually a hook.

169
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:37,270
So by the rules of next year 13, in the when we are using hook, we need to.

170
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,590
Keep the component client side.

171
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,350
So this is another reason we use client side here.

172
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,020
So after that we got this search params.

173
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,900
Now.

174
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:59,570
This search prompt is going to give us, for example, that search term at a top here.

175
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,330
So let's refresh the page.

176
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,780
We're getting an error.

177
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:14,650
Kate, we need to get this search a search term so we can just create a constant.

178
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:21,190
And this is going to be search, for example, term.

179
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:31,260
Which is going to be equal to search programs that get and turn.

180
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,850
So if it's not existed, we are going to make it empty string.

181
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:52,800
We don't need it, actually, because later we are going to use a user state book to set the initial

182
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,810
value of the term to be empty.

183
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,210
So that is enough.

184
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,240
So now we get the search term, which is this word at a top.

185
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,570
Now we can show it inside the input.

186
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,260
So inside the input we can set the.

187
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,830
Initial value of the input by just.

188
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,020
A sitting.

189
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:24,980
Its value to a variable called, for example.

190
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,570
TER.

191
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:35,450
And then we need to create this term here at a top, we just create a piece of state called term.

192
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:41,060
And this is going to be equal to use the state.

193
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,860
As you can see here.

194
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,790
So I'm going to import you this state from React.

195
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,490
So now.

196
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,090
The initial value of this one.

197
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:13,860
Is going to be a search term that we are getting or if the search term is not existed, we can just

198
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,320
set it to be an empty string.

199
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,460
That is true.

200
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,510
Now, if you refresh the page.

201
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,220
But let's see.

202
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,080
So we got the term we have imported use the state.

203
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,250
We got this search term here.

204
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,630
Search firms that get we get a sorry.

205
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:53,280
This is not shouldn't be termed the students should be searcher because we are getting the search term

206
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,240
from here.

207
00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:03,540
So now probably when we refresh the page, we should see the search term here inside the input.

208
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:12,030
So if you come back, for example, to the home page and we search for something else, for example,

209
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:18,660
hello, and we press enter, this is going to show us the search term.

210
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,080
Hello.

211
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,390
And also the input is hello as well.

212
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:21,900
So.

213
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:33,420
So always we get the turn inside here and show it here so the user can use this word or modify it,

214
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,180
or you can they can delete it by using this icon.

215
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:42,930
So the next thing we need to do is to use this icon to delete this term.

216
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:52,380
So we need to add an event listener to this icon.

217
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:58,240
So when we click on it, we're going to set this one, set this term empty.

218
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:06,160
So let's go back to Visual Studio Code, and we go to that cross icon.

219
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,840
And here we're going to add an and click event listener.

220
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:24,920
This is going to trigger a function which is going to set the term

221
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,630
to an empty string.

222
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,020
Okay, now.

223
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,930
Let's refresh the page.

224
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,740
Now, when we click here, we should make this one empty.

225
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,690
All right.

226
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:55,570
But when we refresh the page, we get the search term again from this one.

227
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:00,430
So we can click this one, empty it, we can write down something.

228
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:07,960
But now we cannot write anything because we haven't had any unchanged events listener to the impulse.

229
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,270
So we need to go back to input.

230
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,560
Here, and then we add an unchanged event listener.

231
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,570
This all change event listener.

232
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:35,750
Is going to trigger a function to this function is going to get the event first, and this is going

233
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,770
to set the term that we have.

234
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:47,940
The piece of state to e dot target dot value.

235
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:55,800
So anything the the value of the input is going to be set for the term, the piece of state term that

236
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,030
we have at the top.

237
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:04,770
So I also we want to change the value of the input to otherwise we don't see any, we cannot change

238
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:05,670
the value.

239
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:13,380
So we need to change the value of the input to be equal to the term that we have.

240
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,230
So let's see.

241
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,920
Okay, So I think that is fine.

242
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,430
So let's check now.

243
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,410
We can change the value here.

244
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:35,620
For example, if I write down nice, I press enter.

245
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:45,610
This is going to refresh the page is submit the form, but it's changing the value of this piece of

246
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,330
state.

247
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:52,480
But we haven't able to submit the form and change this URL.

248
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,040
So.

249
00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:02,170
The things we do is to add an on submit event listener to the form.

250
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:10,390
So we just gonna add an unsub meet event listener which is going to trigger a function.

251
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,410
And we call the function handled.

252
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,460
For example, submit.

253
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,950
And we need to create this function here at the top.

254
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,770
Otherwise, we get an error.

255
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,550
So we create a function called handle submit.

256
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,870
So as we are getting the suggestion.

257
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,760
So.

258
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,780
The next.

259
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,360
The second one is not okay.

260
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,760
We just need the first one.

261
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,930
So we get the event.

262
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:56,330
We prevent the default behavior of the submission, which is refreshing the page and the things we want

263
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:05,360
to do is to push the person to that particular page.

264
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:14,020
First thing first, I want to check if the term is not existed.

265
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,730
We're going to return.

266
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:21,850
And also if there is if the person just write down a space.

267
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:26,380
So we use a trim function to remove the space.

268
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:31,180
So we remove the space and then we check if there is a term we're going to return.

269
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,590
So if this one is empty and we press enter.

270
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,440
But it's.

271
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,220
If you press enter, nothing happens.

272
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:52,590
But if we write down something, this is going to submit the form and submit the form.

273
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,750
And also we're going to.

274
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,970
Redirect the person to the page that we are desired.

275
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:06,020
So we're going to use another hook called use router from.

276
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,180
And the next navigation.

277
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,850
So we have the next navigation here.

278
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:17,130
So we're going to use use router as well.

279
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,630
And first thing first, we need to initialize it here.

280
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:25,800
So we're going to let's create this one on top.

281
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:32,850
So after this initialization, I'm going to initialize the router, which is going to be equal to router

282
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,990
use router.

283
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:42,570
And then we're going to push the person to that particular alt, which we're going to push the person

284
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:49,530
to forward slash search forward slash web.

285
00:26:53,550 --> 00:27:01,020
And then search term, which is which is have to be that term that is inside here.

286
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:10,680
So now if, for example, if I write down hello and I press enter, this is going to redirect me to

287
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,210
search for slash web search term.

288
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:14,940
Hello.

289
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:22,560
If I change this form, for example, to nice press enter, we get the nice at a top.

290
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:26,940
So that is that's it for submission for the form.

291
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:34,920
But I want when I click on this magnifier I want to submit the form to that is very simple as well.

292
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:44,310
We need to just go to that icon, this search icon, and we're going to add an event listener which

293
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:54,990
is going to be an on click event listener, which is going to just call that handle submit function.

294
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,870
So now.

295
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,620
Let's test this one again so we have the noise.

296
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:05,890
Let's delete the noise here and we just write down.

297
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:06,520
Hello.

298
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,970
We don't press enter, but we click on this icon.

299
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:19,870
This is going to submit the form and also change to redirect the person to search term.

300
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,490
Hello.

301
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,370
All right.

302
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:30,130
That was it for completing the search box.

303
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,660
Let's add this one to GitHub and review what we have done here.

304
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:43,510
So I'm going to use Contour shift G to open this source control so we can just press on this plus icon

305
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:47,140
to add everything using Git at all.

306
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:53,200
And also we can add a message here saying complete.

307
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,560
This search.

308
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:05,200
Box component.

309
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,870
So I'm going to click here and click on Commit and Push to push everything to GitHub.

310
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,470
So let's go back to GitHub and we.

311
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,590
Just click here to refresh the page.

312
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:30,440
Now we have nine commands in our GitHub repository, which is the last one is complete the search box

313
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,490
component.

314
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:42,290
So the only things we have done is to update this search box that JSS X, as I mentioned before, B.

315
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,200
S, we are using some hoax and some events listener.

316
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,720
And this is going to be interactive.

317
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,850
Be it the users.

318
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,240
So we have to use the use client at the top.

319
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,150
So we make this component client side.

320
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:10,040
And next year 13 is a smart enough to detect that everything else here at the top is server side.

321
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,800
They're going to be prepared.

322
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,830
Server side.

323
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,060
And also only this part is going to be client side.

324
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:22,900
So this is going to make our website faster to be loaded.

325
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:35,200
And it's better for the search engine optimization because these HTML files are is already prepared

326
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,660
and pass to the browser.

327
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:45,370
So the search engines is going to check this HTML part as well, which is completely opposite of the

328
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,210
react.

329
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,280
React doesn't do that.

330
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,160
Also, everything in the React is client side.

331
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,240
So now let's continue.

332
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:01,060
We have imported use search params to get the parameter of the URLs.

333
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:10,340
We have used the use router to redirect the person using router dot push.

334
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:19,910
Do we have imported three icons from React icons to add to our input and the form?

335
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,810
And also we have imported user state to create a piece of state called term.

336
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:32,070
So we have initialized the use search params and the use router here.

337
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:37,590
We got the search term by using the JIT method of the search params.

338
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,410
And we just get the search term from the URL.

339
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,700
Then we have created a piece of state called term.

340
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,770
And we have added a function to change this term.

341
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:55,800
And the initial value of this one is going to be this search term or an empty string.

342
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:04,350
We have created a function called Handle Submit, which is going to firstly prevent the default behavior

343
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,500
of the submission, which is refreshing the page.

344
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,430
Then we have added a condition.

345
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:18,220
If there is no term in the input or there is only the space in the input, we're going to return.

346
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,090
We're not going to redirect the person.

347
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:26,080
Otherwise, we're going to redirect the person to the this URL.

348
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,040
Search for slash web search term.

349
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:36,870
The term that we get from the piece of state that we have, then we have created a form.

350
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:45,120
We have added an on submit event listener which is going to trigger a function called handle submit,

351
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:50,130
and we have added an input with the type of text.

352
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:56,880
And we just set the value to be the term estate.

353
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:00,750
And then we have added an unchanged event listener.

354
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:06,120
I think I have added two value here.

355
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,330
So I'm going to delete the one of them.

356
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:20,240
So we have added the change event listener, which is going to get the event and set the term the piece

357
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,060
of state term to E to target that value.

358
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:28,400
Anything is here is going to be inside that piece of state.

359
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:35,720
And we also we have added the cross icon which is going to set the term to be an empty string.

360
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:44,870
When we click on it, then we have the microphone icon and finally we have the search icon, the magnifier

361
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:51,710
icon, which is going to submit the that function as well.

362
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,150
So let's delete this value here.

363
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,910
I'm going to.

364
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,920
Delete this some extra value here.

365
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,140
That's why we were getting an error.

366
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:15,290
And then we're going to I'm going to just add this one to GitHub and just send us a fix.

367
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:17,710
Double.

368
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,360
Value and input.

369
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,830
I'm going to commit and push it.

370
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:31,730
Okay.

371
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,690
So that was it for creating this search box.

372
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:42,150
In the next section, we're going to work on this tab icon tab section.

373
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,990
So when we click on all, we see the web result.

374
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:50,330
And when we click on the images, we see the image results.

375
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,190
Are we going to work on it?

376
00:34:53,190 --> 00:35:00,750
And also, we, as you can see, when we are on the image and here we see the image, this place is

377
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,300
selected with the blue color.

378
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,420
So we're going to work on that and how to do it.

379
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:11,640
So see in the next section for creating this search options.
