1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:07,770
Alright.

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,560
In the last section we have completed the WHO to follow sections.

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,100
And we completed the major section.

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:16,790
Now.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,420
Now it's time to start with the authentication part.

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:29,210
In order to do the authentication bill, we need to install a package called NICS off.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,300
And let's go to.

8
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,430
Let's open a new tab and research for next off.

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,750
As you can see, Nick's authority is authentication for next year and the website is next.

10
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,190
Off list.

11
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,010
Dash off, don't start or G.

12
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,250
We click on this website.

13
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,540
And, uh, we click on Get Started.

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,110
First for installation.

15
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:13,350
If you want to install the last version, you need to go here on the left side.

16
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,200
On the upgrade guide version for.

17
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,400
And if you can see here now, we need to just.

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,630
Use an install next off.

19
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:34,340
So we copy this and we go back to Visual Studio code and inside a terminal we paste the code.

20
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,310
The next step.

21
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:46,670
If we come back to the documentation and we go to getting a start, that part on the left side.

22
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:57,500
We need to create a file inside pages api off next 30th.

23
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:04,310
This is the file we need to create and we need to create this folder as well and we need to copy this

24
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,800
code inside that fire.

25
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:16,100
So we copy this and we go back to Visual Studio code and inside Pages API.

26
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:24,060
We need to create a folder and the folder is off and inside the folder.

27
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,630
We create a file and we call it Dot, dot, dot.

28
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,210
Next off.

29
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,500
Dargis.

30
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,690
Sorry that.

31
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,910
J.S. And we paste the code that we have copied from the website here.

32
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,660
So let me explain this a little bit.

33
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:57,140
So we importing index off from next off and we're getting the GitHub provider from this link.

34
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,350
Actually, we don't need the GitHub.

35
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,490
We are going to use the Google provider.

36
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:12,350
So here we can change all the GitHub to Google by using contra d to choose all of them and we change

37
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,700
it by Google.

38
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,000
This Google should be lowercase.

39
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,950
And here.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,500
We are exporting the providers here and the global provider just we need to get the client idea and

41
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,640
client secure.

42
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:38,900
So here we are using environmental variable to pass the data from there.

43
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,290
For this idea instead of Google idea, let's use Google client.

44
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,150
All right.

45
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,510
And make this Google.

46
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,640
Capital or uppercase.

47
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,380
Uh, this one, too.

48
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:02,990
And this one should be Google client secrets.

49
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:05,780
Okay.

50
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:12,830
Now we need to get this Google client idea and client client secrets.

51
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,170
So we just need to go to Firebase.

52
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:24,350
I use this for Fox because I need to be signing in my Gmail.

53
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:31,640
You two, you need to sign in with your valid Gmail account to create the firebase.

54
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:36,500
So here we search for fire base.

55
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,630
And uh, we click on Firebase start google dot com.

56
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,650
Make sure you're signing with your Gmail and see your image here and then go to console.

57
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,950
I already created, uh, I created a Twitter version to it and three for my practice.

58
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,630
Let's create another one.

59
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,120
And I call it for myself.

60
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,390
Uh.

61
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,890
Sorry.

62
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,450
Uh, Twitter version for.

63
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,020
They press continue.

64
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,660
Uh, Firebase is asking me, do you need Google Analytics?

65
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,280
We just disable it.

66
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,290
And for now, we don't need it for now.

67
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,620
We create we click on Create Project.

68
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:42,730
It's it's going to take a few minutes to be created and it's going to initialize and create our application

69
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,120
inside Google Firebase Console.

70
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,770
It's almost there.

71
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,300
It's finished.

72
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,020
So we just press continue.

73
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,280
Now.

74
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,560
We need to go.

75
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,760
We need to.

76
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,870
We are inside to, uh, to television for we go to authentication.

77
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,560
And we click on Get Started.

78
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,080
So first we need to actually initialize our app.

79
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,510
So let me go to setting, progess setting.

80
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,910
And here, as you can see, there is no app in the project.

81
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,210
There are no apps in your project.

82
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,330
You need to click here because this is for Web.

83
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,490
This is for iOS and Android.

84
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,130
Click here to create the app.

85
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,380
We named it app.

86
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,790
I name it's Twitter.

87
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,360
Version four.

88
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,310
And we click register app.

89
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,560
Now.

90
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:22,950
And Firebase is providing us with the API keys and etc. and asking us to install Firebase.

91
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:29,790
So we need to copy this code and we go back to Visual Studio code and inside terminal.

92
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,510
We installed the firebase.

93
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,960
And we need to create a file outside in this level.

94
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,530
And we call it Fire Bass.

95
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,330
That's.

96
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:54,540
And what we do here, we just go back to Firebase and we copy this code.

97
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,750
And we go we come back and paste it here.

98
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,740
Okay.

99
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,420
The things we need to do is to initialize Firebase.

100
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:17,020
This is actually a basic code and we need to add some other things because we need to add a storage.

101
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,460
As well and the storage and fire a store to our application.

102
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,840
So we need to initialize them as well.

103
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:34,770
So here at the time we were going to do an import to more things from Firebase app.

104
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,360
The first one is get app.

105
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,620
And the second one is get apps.

106
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,310
Then also we need to import.

107
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,070
Get fires or.

108
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,420
This is going to be from fire.

109
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,340
A store fire based fire forest slash fire store.

110
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,930
And let's copy this.

111
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:26,480
And here, instead of gift fire this store, we just write a storage.

112
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:32,140
And the storage is from fire bass forest storage.

113
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:35,560
Okay.

114
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:44,910
After this initialization of five x config.

115
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,530
So this is just basic.

116
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,970
But this fun each time initialize the firebase.

117
00:09:51,970 --> 00:10:00,340
But we want to limit this and say if the app is already initialized, just use that one and don't do

118
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:00,850
it again.

119
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,230
So we make it conditional so we just seconds.

120
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,970
App is equal.

121
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,180
To get apps.

122
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,950
They're at length.

123
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,320
So if the.

124
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,250
There's no application.

125
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,290
So means that there's no nothing in the in there.

126
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,270
Just create this.

127
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,860
Uh, if this one happens.

128
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,820
So initialize this country.

129
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,790
Otherwise.

130
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,070
Just get the app that is already existed like this.

131
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,220
And then for initialization of the our.

132
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:04,610
Database we just said DB equals to five get virus or.

133
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,470
Photo storage.

134
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:17,100
We just say get a storage and finally we need to export.

135
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,090
All of the.

136
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,590
App DP and a storage.

137
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,630
That's it.

138
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,790
This is for initialization.

139
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:40,760
And in order to, uh, you know, to prevent your API keys to be in public, we can use environmental

140
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,980
variable as well.

141
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:52,340
So we we can just here create a file called that in that locale.

142
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:01,120
And we bring this instead of just saying, for example, API key.

143
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,640
We can just say.

144
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:15,820
Process that EMV that firebase API key and we bring this fun inside the.

145
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,910
Uh, environmental here.

146
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,210
We just need to say.

147
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,240
Next.

148
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,070
Public.

149
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,580
Underline fire.

150
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,130
A.

151
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,910
API.

152
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:49,580
Key.

153
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,670
And this is going to be equal to the API key that we just copied.

154
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,880
Now nobody can have access to it.

155
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,820
When we push our get up to.

156
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,670
Uh.

157
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:07,990
Get, huh?

158
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:14,560
And because, uh, this file never goes inside.

159
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,040
Get GitHub.

160
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,900
So now you can do it for all of them.

161
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,430
Just for simplicity.

162
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,790
I just did it for first.

163
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:29,410
While that is the most important one, then we need to bring the Google API.

164
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:34,210
And who will Christ ID that we the we have here too.

165
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:42,010
So inside the our application we just get all of them inside were firebase.

166
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,340
Let's go to council again and now we go to authentication.

167
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,090
We go to sign signing method and we choose Google here.

168
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,760
We enable Google.

169
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,580
We choose our email here.

170
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,960
We press safe?

171
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:08,460
Okay.

172
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:15,310
Now, if we can have to our API key the x axis, it's here.

173
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,890
So we just need to click here on edit.

174
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,110
And just inside the.

175
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,250
Web SDK configuration.

176
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,420
We have the web client idea and web client secrets.

177
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,830
We just need to copy this.

178
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,130
And we go to.

179
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:44,900
Visual Studio code, an environmental variable file, and here we're going to create a Google.

180
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,030
Client I.D. First they pasted.

181
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,820
And then we copy this with client I.D..

182
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,260
Here we create Google client secret.

183
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,040
And this is going to be equal to this one.

184
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:10,840
Now.

185
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:18,060
We have successfully installed firebase and nex next off.

186
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,920
I think that's enough for this section.

187
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,970
In the next section we're going to create the sign in page.

188
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:33,050
We're going to create a custom signing page and when the person wants to sign in, goes to that page.

189
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:39,740
And if the signing is successful, they will be redirected to the website.

190
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,100
So let's add it.

191
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,390
Let's add this together as usual.

192
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:52,010
We just say you create a comment with a message of.

193
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,580
In store next off.

194
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,670
And Firebase.

195
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,740
And initialize.

196
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,710
If fire breaks.

197
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:28,810
Okay.

198
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,220
We push it to get top.

199
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,250
I want to show you now that.

200
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,610
We didn't.

201
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:45,770
So if you refresh the page here now, we should see a new comment install next off on Firebase and initialize

202
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,670
the firebase.

203
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:56,660
As you can see, the person who is checking our website in GitHub cannot see the API key.

204
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:06,760
They just see posts that envy Firebase API key because GitHub never we never push the environmental

205
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,730
variable fire.

206
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:13,190
And also when we deploy our website to for example, we also.

207
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:21,760
Those websites have a section for environmental kids and they're going to protect our keys as well.

208
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:29,430
So we created the five stages when we initialized the fire.

209
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:33,420
So fire storage and the database we installed.

210
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:43,290
We have installed firebase and Nex off and also we have we have created this file inside the pages API

211
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,030
off and we provided the Google.

212
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:55,960
And we've got the Google and client identical client secrets from the Firebase website.

213
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,970
So in the next section, we're going to create this signing page.

214
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,250
So see in the next section.
