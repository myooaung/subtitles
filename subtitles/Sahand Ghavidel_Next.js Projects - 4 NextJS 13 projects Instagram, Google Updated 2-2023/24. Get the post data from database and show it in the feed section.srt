1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,720
All right, in the last section we have completed with the uploading path and we uploaded the information

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:26,220
to the database, we got the we uploaded the image began to download You are and we updated the post

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,990
in the database.

4
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,590
Let's go to the database now.

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:40,910
This is the cloud forest or here, and the this tab is the storage.

6
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,960
Let's delete them all because I want to make some.

7
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:46,730
A

8
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:58,450
beautiful post, and then we try to look through this post and show them inside the feed section, so

9
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,200
I delete this.

10
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:00,830
Fine.

11
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:10,610
And delayed all this collections, so sick the collection, they asked you for confirmation and read

12
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,240
them all.

13
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,880
So we don't have anything now.

14
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:20,120
Let's upload some nice posts like the.

15
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,530
We have three images, so just a.

16
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,200
Sunset.

17
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,260
Then we have the next image.

18
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,100
Which is the bird, that's a nice.

19
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,180
Bird.

20
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:01,170
And let's do another one, and let's do the other one with the other accounts.

21
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,670
So I signing with my order in Gmail account.

22
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,770
First, let's do it with this one.

23
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,760
Because I want to show you that how they are shown.

24
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,400
And the fifth section.

25
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:27,690
So the last one, we just choose the other image and we just say, nice pic.

26
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,330
All right.

27
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,880
So now if you refresh.

28
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,970
Let's let this one finish.

29
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,700
If we refresh the storage.

30
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,830
We should see a folder post inside it.

31
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,050
We should have three images.

32
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:56,770
And then in the Cloths file store also we need we should have three posts now.

33
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,310
You can see the nice bears.

34
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:08,120
And then sunset and finally, nice pic and then you see that they have a different time stamp.

35
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:18,850
He thinks we want to do is show this post in the feed section, but we want to sort them by this time

36
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:25,150
to stop so that the newest one comes first in the feed section.

37
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,820
So let's do this part.

38
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:37,170
So we go to our visual studio code and we open the localhost three thousand on the right side.

39
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:46,090
If you remember we we were getting the information from the database using something called a snapshot.

40
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,940
So we're doing to we're going to do the same things here as well.

41
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,110
So in the post, let's close everything.

42
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,230
First.

43
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,690
In the posts that James.

44
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:10,150
If you remember, we created some dummy data to date, as we can see here.

45
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,170
All right.

46
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,030
We don't need them anymore, so we delete them all.

47
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,630
I didn't hear.

48
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,960
So we shouldn't see them now in the food section, the fifth section should be an empty.

49
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,040
That's page refresh to page.

50
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:46,640
Yeah, because we don't have this post, so we create this one, we create a state called posts and

51
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,830
we say sit post and we call this one to use the state.

52
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,120
And we make it an empty bracket.

53
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,050
For the beginning.

54
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:10,560
And now we can see that we are getting an error saying, use this state is not to fire, so we import

55
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,580
you as a state using control space here and we get the auto suggestion.

56
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,330
Here, so now we imported the act.

57
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,020
Actually, we don't need the reactor itself, so we delete that one.

58
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:32,650
So now our fifth section is completely empty because this is empty at the beginning.

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,840
So no, let's create a use effect.

60
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:44,830
So when the page is loaded, you're going to get the data using this use effect.

61
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,220
So this is going to be a function.

62
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,790
Out of function, and we're going to use it.

63
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:05,700
Utility called on this snapshot, so this is a built-in utility or function from fire base.

64
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,980
That gives us the information from the database.

65
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,740
And this is going to give us something called on subscribe.

66
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,770
This is the inside that function, that is the return from this function.

67
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,150
So we create a constant here.

68
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,510
Call it on sobs cry.

69
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:39,170
And we're going to use that on stuff on a snapshot.

70
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,900
So we need to just import our snapshot.

71
00:06:48,100 --> 00:07:00,060
It's not suggesting us, so we manually import on snapshot from its.

72
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,880
This is from Firebase Forest Fire Store.

73
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:10,210
So we just tried Firebase Forest Flash Player Store.

74
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:24,580
So just ignore this error because we haven't completed this one yet.

75
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:34,780
So inside this on snapshot, we agree we are getting the collection and this collection is a utility

76
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:45,730
from five Vista and a collection is coming from deep that we created in fire and fire fireplace that's

77
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,150
exported from here or imported to.

78
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,650
So we import this file from Firebase that yes.

79
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,630
And the name of the collection is posts.

80
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,640
OK.

81
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,880
This is going to get all these posts.

82
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:19,100
And then what happens next is we get this snapshot, we get this data.

83
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,370
And now we can sit the posts.

84
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:33,940
To that, a snapshot, and the snapshot actually has something called ducks.

85
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,180
So did all the documents are inside deception.

86
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,380
Now you can see it here.

87
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,260
You can see something because we have three.

88
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:49,020
Post, but the information are empty, so we need to get the information.

89
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,780
So here, instead of saying post that user name.

90
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,390
All right.

91
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:58,860
Uh.

92
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:06,290
Instead of saying post that username, we should say post that data.

93
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,160
That he is in now, we are getting the username.

94
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,270
And the next one would be the same.

95
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,920
It's better.

96
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:36,090
And then that phone wasn't a user image, and inside Firebase, we define it as a powerful image.

97
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,370
I show you here.

98
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,950
So that was profile IMG.

99
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,020
Profile by chief.

100
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,280
So you're seeing the profile.

101
00:09:55,530 --> 00:10:00,420
And for the image was post the data.

102
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,450
And it was an image, it was image.

103
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,970
You can see here image.

104
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,430
OK, we've got the image, we got the username.

105
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,830
Let's get the caption as well.

106
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,560
So we say that to.

107
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:33,780
So we got the caption, too, but this is not based on the new one, if you remember, the last post

108
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,390
was this one from my son.

109
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,210
I mean you username.

110
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,570
So in order to.

111
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:52,150
Sorties post by descending mode, we need to use a built-in utility called.

112
00:10:54,330 --> 00:11:00,250
It's called order by and Kurri Kurri actually covers everything.

113
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:00,960
So here.

114
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:09,560
We cover so we make and apprentices here, and then we just say.

115
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,240
Query.

116
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:21,670
And the import quality from Firebase for research, Forester, you can see it here and here we add a

117
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:32,410
comma and then we just say order pie and we need to import order via spell the import order pie from

118
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,580
fire bass forward slash forester here.

119
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,640
And how we order it.

120
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,490
We just ordered it by descending, so we had a.

121
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,030
Apprentices here.

122
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:58,040
And to this, this is this is should be based on the time stamp that we have.

123
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,170
And the.

124
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:07,110
The order would be descending, so we just write down D e f c.

125
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,930
So what's the error here?

126
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:28,660
So let's check in with phone, so we have the post order by.

127
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,380
And we have the time stamp that is correct.

128
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:42,390
The sending, yeah, the parent parenthesis, we missed a parenthesis here.

129
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,330
So we need another parenthesis.

130
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,280
Uh.

131
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,480
In other parenthesis here or the order by.

132
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,040
After just another practice, this.

133
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,540
Let's check again, so the country has a parenthesis until here.

134
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,250
That is correct.

135
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,460
And then the order by.

136
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:22,940
Should have apprentices, not that that's OK, fine.

137
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,420
That was just the yeah, apprentices problem.

138
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:34,710
So now we've got this post at the beginning and this is the last one.

139
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,760
And if we add now another post.

140
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:46,110
It should come first to our I and other emerge.

141
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,920
This.

142
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,240
Justice for.

143
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,700
And just say.

144
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:55,950
Hmm.

145
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,510
The best.

146
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,060
City.

147
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:20,850
So, yeah, it should take a few minutes to a few seconds to upload the image mostly and then get the.

148
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:27,700
Data depends on the images size.

149
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,370
So let's check that database.

150
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,710
Yeah, we still have three.

151
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,540
So let's try to find one.

152
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,260
It came the image of the problem.

153
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,400
Because I think it was very big.

154
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,430
So let's try a different one.

155
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,680
Let's try this.

156
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,620
Some say next.

157
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,580
Yes.

158
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,970
Of course.

159
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,410
Let's check this.

160
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,270
Uh, let me check the.

161
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:39,040
The data base, what happened to this storage?

162
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,960
Sure, the rules.

163
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,780
The thing looks fine.

164
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:15,740
Yeah, I took it myself, the problem is we didn't return this unsubscribe, so we returned this one

165
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,330
at the end.

166
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,670
So this because this one is going to be a loop.

167
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:26,450
And it made a problem, so we returned it on scribe here.

168
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,100
Unsubscribe here, so we try again.

169
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,050
We choose an image.

170
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,000
For example, this one next chance cause.

171
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:47,970
Applauded.

172
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,540
Yeah, came at the beginning, no.

173
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:04,880
So then we fixed this part so we could get we are getting all the posts when we are uploading it and

174
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,630
uh.

175
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:18,160
In the next section, we're going to hide this whole section or these buttons when we are not the sign,

176
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,260
you know, when the sign out.

177
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:29,960
We can still put their comments or other things, so we fix this part, and then after that, you start

178
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,780
creating this comment section.

179
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:38,030
So let's bring everything and push everything to get up.

180
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,330
So just take it at the use of gift.

181
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,090
And the message is.

182
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,350
Creates.

183
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,140
Creative post.

184
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,630
And and it's.

185
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,550
To the fire.

186
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,380
Mr.

187
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,570
Actually, we did this on the last part.

188
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:48,130
This is just get the pulse data from the database and show it in the feed six.

189
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,040
So let's, uh, push everything to get off.

190
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,860
And we check the final version.

191
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,590
I mean, we checked the repository.

192
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:11,120
So we have now for comments, and the last one is get the data from the database and show it in defeat

193
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,650
section.

194
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,650
Let's review what we have done.

195
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:25,630
So we imported some utilities collection on snapshot ordered by a query from Fire Space five store.

196
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,630
We got the database from Firebase Duchess.

197
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,380
We created a state.

198
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:45,250
Card posts and use use effect to get information from the database using on snapshot encourages collection

199
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,100
by the sending mode.

200
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:55,320
Using ordered by utility and also we got a collection of posts.

201
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:05,190
Finally, we got all the information as a snapshot and is set to post by snapshot that ducks.

202
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,550
And inside the post the component.

203
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:22,850
We passed the data using post that data practices, and we just added data apprentices to get that data.

204
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:30,740
Yeah, that is that was it for this part in the next section, we're going to hide this.

205
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,420
Thanks.

206
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,000
OK, a comment section are buttons when we are not signing.

207
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,010
So still in the next section.
