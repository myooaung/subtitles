1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:08,350
All right.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,060
In the last section, we have completed the sidebar section of our project.

3
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:21,300
In this section, we're going to create the feed component of our project.

4
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:32,300
If you look at the final version of the project, we can see that for responsiveness if you have a smaller

5
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:32,930
screen.

6
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:40,780
See these feet section is just this much away from the wall.

7
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,460
But in the bigger screen it's just in the center.

8
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:55,210
And when we go to the smaller screen in the mobile size, it covers all the screen.

9
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:04,010
In this section, we're going to create only the header part of the feeder and also we're going to create

10
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,590
this at borders as well.

11
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,320
So with that we have a diff here.

12
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,440
Which we can make a component for it.

13
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,360
And also we have.

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:19,810
Here.

15
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,980
The header at the top.

16
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,310
The header itself has two parts.

17
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,650
Just this home.

18
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:36,030
And also, we have an an icon which we can get from the hero icons as well.

19
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:44,760
The icon has a hover effect similar to the one we created for the items so we can use the same hover

20
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,860
effect for this icon.

21
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,610
So let's go to Visual Studio Call.

22
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:01,120
Let's increase the size and we go to index searches.

23
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,520
We don't need the sidebar anymore.

24
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,730
So we close it.

25
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,920
And here, just after the sidebar.

26
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,050
We create another component.

27
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,260
So we open the.

28
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,920
Explore section and inside the components folder we create another.

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,150
Component.

30
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,590
Andrew Collet, Ft.

31
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,080
Duchess.

32
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,590
We can use RF C to create a react functional component as we did before.

33
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:47,510
We do not need this import from React because we are using next year and let's import this component

34
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:58,070
inside index such as we just write feed and be it get this auto suggestion and be by clicking on this

35
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:04,820
auto suggestion we're going to automatically import feed from components folder.

36
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,670
Let's close this tag.

37
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,370
Now if you'll check the browser.

38
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,750
We can see their feet here.

39
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,500
The reason why it's just under.

40
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:25,820
The sidebar because this sidebar position is fixed.

41
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,470
If you remember.

42
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,560
Inside Politics.

43
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,350
We made the top layer dev here.

44
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,140
We made the position fixed.

45
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,230
So when you do fixed position.

46
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,360
This stiff goes.

47
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,440
Outside the original deer.

48
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,270
Which is the this death here, the main death.

49
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,290
And just goes on top of everything.

50
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:09,280
So in order to fix this, we can just for the feed, we add some.

51
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,100
Marching left.

52
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,070
So we push this.

53
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,310
This section, the feed section to to the right side.

54
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,590
So let's do this first.

55
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:34,230
So in the top div here we add a class name for adding the tables and spaces classes.

56
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,500
And for the.

57
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,580
It's large, which is the big size is.

58
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,030
We add a margin left of.

59
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,310
370 pixels.

60
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,810
Let's save this and see it in the browser.

61
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,350
Now, this part came here.

62
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,460
Let's add the border too, so we can see it much better because we only have a text here.

63
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,700
It's very hard to understand what we are doing.

64
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:17,030
So let's add a border to the left and right.

65
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,530
So we just say border.

66
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,580
Left.

67
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,850
And border, right?

68
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,420
And we sit there.

69
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:39,750
Men with to a certain position because we don't have any content.

70
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,520
So it's going to be shrink so and so in order to prevent this.

71
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,390
So we added in the x large.

72
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,370
We set the mean width to be.

73
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,810
For example, 576 pixels.

74
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:06,750
Actually, these numbers I find by trying an error.

75
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,210
So you can do it for yourself too.

76
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,690
So now we have a border in the left and the right.

77
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:19,950
So you can see this is a minimum 576 pixels.

78
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,140
And the.

79
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,260
But the problem is when you have a smaller screen.

80
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,500
You see that again?

81
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,860
It connects to the world so we can.

82
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,100
Another one, another.

83
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,680
Thanks.

84
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:43,740
Martin let me just say above the smallest green.

85
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:51,790
In Mobile, it's going we don't have we don't want any margin left, but after that, we want a margin

86
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,800
left of.

87
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,710
73 pixels.

88
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,620
Now if you check.

89
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,250
This is the field.

90
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,920
This is the right border.

91
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,040
This is the left border.

92
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,810
So this is correct.

93
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:15,080
But we still see that it's very small because we don't have anything there.

94
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,900
So we need to have a.

95
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,200
Some something.

96
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,710
But we can fix this one instead of doing mine with.

97
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,040
We can add the flex grow instead.

98
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,020
So we just say.

99
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,720
Flex grow.

100
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,080
Flex grow is going to push this fun to the end.

101
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,260
But because we don't have anything on the right side.

102
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,500
So this is covering everything.

103
00:07:54,350 --> 00:08:07,910
Now we can add a max with it said the maximum with I want it to be x large which is equal to 576 pixels.

104
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:13,760
When we added the min, if you remember, we added the min with 507 six.

105
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:20,960
Now we added the max with us and this is the different way you can use both of them.

106
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:29,930
So we see that now we have this size in the big, big, big screen.

107
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,520
We have the same size as well.

108
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:37,820
And when we have a smaller than mobile size, it covers all of the.

109
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,140
All right.

110
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,460
That's it for the.

111
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,940
Positioning it.

112
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,070
Let's start with the header part.

113
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,070
So instead of feed, we're going to have a death.

114
00:08:53,450 --> 00:09:01,920
And inside this, therefore, you're going to have extra time, which is saying, oh, let's bring this

115
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,320
form on the right side so we can see the sun on the left side.

116
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,040
Let's close this.

117
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,700
Okay.

118
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:31,090
So now after this H2 type B, we get another DIV and inside this step we're going to add that icon to

119
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,180
a sparkly icon so we can just write this spot.

120
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,880
Yes.

121
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,400
I can.

122
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,690
It's it only has one s actually.

123
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:59,460
So this is the suggestion we are going to import it from hero icons for slash react for slash afterlife.

124
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:10,620
So impressed that the death rate delayed this on and we should see it now it's huge because we are getting

125
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,500
the full size.

126
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,070
So let's set the height to be for example.

127
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,270
Five.

128
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,340
Now we can see it here.

129
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:30,580
So now here we can add a flex to bring them next to each other.

130
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,400
And also we can.

131
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,380
Luckily we at the.

132
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,950
Flag padding in the Y axis of two.

133
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:51,810
So I push them this way and you have a padding of three in the x axis.

134
00:10:53,050 --> 00:11:03,160
And also we can, uh, we want to make it a sticky position is sticky helps us to keep this fun always

135
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,710
at the top because we don't have any contact.

136
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,000
We cannot show it here.

137
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,570
But in the final version, they can see it.

138
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,960
Just pay attention to the top section.

139
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:18,070
When I'm scrolling down, this section is always at a top.

140
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,360
So we need to make it position it as sticky.

141
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,200
So we.

142
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,210
Added this sticky position here.

143
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,860
Then we can add, uh.

144
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,120
We wanted to keep it at the top so we can't just change the top to zero.

145
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:51,180
And also, I want it to always be added at above others.

146
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,210
So we changed the Z index to 50.

147
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:00,480
And also we changed the background color to whites because as a default.

148
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,890
It's transparent.

149
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,690
The deaf and empty there is always transparent.

150
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,660
And also, we want to have a border at the bottom.

151
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:21,400
So you can see the bottom border and the border color should be gray.

152
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,100
And just 200.

153
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,510
Yeah.

154
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,200
That was it for this part.

155
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,820
Let's start this home.

156
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:44,620
So the home has a takes off large when we have a mobile screen.

157
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,520
And for the bigger sizes.

158
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:57,060
Let's make that text to be large and sorry, extra large.

159
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:04,390
Because we we already have large nets set the font to be pulled.

160
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,450
And uh, let's think, set the cursor to be pointer.

161
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,050
So when we hover over it, we see it pointing here.

162
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,920
So when we have a bigger screen, we should see it.

163
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,730
Bigger.

164
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,720
Because we set the text to be ex large after small.

165
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,730
And for this, a spotless icon.

166
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:46,610
I want it to be on the right side and has that hover effect that we had we created before.

167
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,080
So we added the hover effect now.

168
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:57,250
So now we should see a background color of gray, but this icon is still not in the center.

169
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,170
We can use Flexbox to bring it in the center.

170
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:07,600
So we just say flex and item center and.

171
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,020
As you know, that justified center.

172
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,370
So bring it exactly in the center.

173
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,710
And also I wanted to make it smaller.

174
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,860
The circle around Earth.

175
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,180
So we added we remove the padding ex.

176
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,840
They make it zero.

177
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,540
And the.

178
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,720
Let's set the marching left to alter, to bring it to the right side.

179
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,590
At this.

180
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,930
Set the width to be nine and height to be nine to.

181
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,210
So now it's a smaller.

182
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:03,130
And on the right side, there is an I added this padding zero.

183
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,510
If you don't have it.

184
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,150
In the larger screen, you see that that icon.

185
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,440
Gets very smart like this.

186
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,670
This is for the default margin.

187
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,630
So when you have this margin.

188
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,620
Sorry, pending default padding.

189
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,320
If you have a padding of zero, we always see it the same size.

190
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:49,680
The only thing we forgot is to put the border colour for the main feed as well.

191
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:54,270
So we just say border grey to hundred.

192
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,380
It's a little bit different, but you want to keep it consistent.

193
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,760
So the same color for here and here and the down section.

194
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,870
Yeah, that was it for this design.

195
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,830
Uh, in the next section, we're going to create the.

196
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,780
Inputs section of the feed component.

197
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,420
So let's first the.

198
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,800
And stop the server and add everything to get half.

199
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:34,190
So get add or adding it, get commit for a message.

200
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,140
And the message would be.

201
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,410
Create.

202
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:42,940
Ft.

203
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,490
Component.

204
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,860
And it's.

205
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,150
Heather.

206
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:58,950
All right.

207
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,490
We push it to get, huh?

208
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,820
Let's check it here.

209
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,790
He refresh the page?

210
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,000
Now we should hear another comment.

211
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:16,550
So we have four comments and the last one is create feed component and it's header.

212
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,600
So the only things we did is to create it.

213
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,020
If fit don't just component.

214
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:37,520
And we just created a div that is covering the header section that that has an edge to tag and also

215
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:38,660
an icon.

216
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,450
And also we added this component to the index purchase.

217
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,850
So in the next section where you're going to create this input fixture.

218
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,530
So see on the next section.
