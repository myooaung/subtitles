1
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,210
All right, in the last section, we have completed the Heather part.

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:20,650
We added the logo, the input and also the user component in this section, we're going to make this

3
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,850
options, which is all an image.

4
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:34,420
If I see him a little bit more, you can see when we hover over each of them, we see and at the color

5
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:41,110
of the text and the logo is changed to blue and also we have a border at the bottom.

6
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:53,820
So and also, if you click on each of them, the other one gets black and no border.

7
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,700
But the other one, it stays blue.

8
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:05,820
So we can achieve this one using the selected attributes of the components.

9
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,510
So here.

10
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:17,750
So let's go to our visual studio code, and we start.

11
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,380
Creating these options.

12
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,880
We want to create them inside a component called

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,990
circular options.

14
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,430
So we open the.

15
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:36,440
Explorer section, we create a new component and we call it search.

16
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,430
Heather?

17
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,180
Options 30th.

18
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,960
We create a reactor functional component using RF C.

19
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,580
And we are going to add this fund to this search.

20
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,380
Heather itself, let's close this index that she is.

21
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:11,390
So here at the bottom after this, did we added this search?

22
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,480
Heather Options be imported from Dart Forest, Leicestershire, fitted options.

23
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,090
At a top.

24
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,600
We should see it here.

25
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:30,950
No.

26
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,140
Let's refresh the page.

27
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,590
We can see that we have the search and search the options at the bottom.

28
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,370
So let's continue to create and to create the both of the options.

29
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:58,380
Now, before doing that, we're going to add something in country, no, we have the quarry, which

30
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,130
is term.

31
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:06,660
But if you look at the final version of the project, we have another quarry called search type, which

32
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,210
is empty when we're searching for where.

33
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,180
But if you click on the images, we should see the search type image.

34
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:24,420
This one actually is going to tilt the API of the Google that we are searching for the.

35
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,040
Image and they're going to give us the images result.

36
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:43,740
If you remember two places we added this term here in this input, when we submit this input and also

37
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,390
when we submit the input here.

38
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:51,350
So two places we need to modify our quote.

39
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,140
What is in the home page, which is index such as.

40
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:05,710
And the index in that year when we been we are calling the router into this function.

41
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:17,270
We added the query term, but we didn't add the query search time, so we can add it here, just simply

42
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,120
adding an answer.

43
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,060
So.

44
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:28,150
Because first one is the question mark, but after that, you should add and sign, of course, and

45
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,980
a quarry name is search.

46
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,920
Type camel case, and we just say equal.

47
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,730
Because we want to search the Web, we don't need to add any tanks.

48
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:52,130
You know, I will show you later in the year when I show you and how to use the Google API, Google

49
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,800
Search API in Google Search API.

50
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,880
The rule is if this one is empty.

51
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,390
The Google is going to search the Web.

52
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,360
But if this one is image is going to search the images.

53
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:15,360
So because in the home page, if you want to search the bit first, you just make it empty.

54
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,020
No, if he says something like hello.

55
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,600
Not here in our our.

56
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,440
Website.

57
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:33,980
So if we go to homepage, if search something like hello, we should see the term hello and also the

58
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:40,880
search type, which is empty and nothing is going to change because everything is the same, but we

59
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,670
only have the another query here.

60
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:51,710
Let's do the same things for the header and in the search page as well.

61
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,560
So in the search header?

62
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,680
Inside this function, which we're calling this search.

63
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:13,740
We can add the curious law, so co-researcher, because so, no, if is there something here, for example,

64
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,010
research nice, the term is nice and then the first type is empty.

65
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,750
So we got this one.

66
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:30,530
No, when we we want to create this search, other options we can base on this, the information here,

67
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:41,510
based on the value of the search type, we can select any of the, uh, any of the options, for example,

68
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,830
in the final version.

69
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,470
Now the all the option, all is selected.

70
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:57,590
If I add image here at it at the end and press enter the tap images is selected.

71
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:05,960
So based on the information here we can choose which option is selected.

72
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:14,520
So here how in order to get this information, we already know that we need, we can use the router,

73
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,440
rather that query.

74
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:24,960
So we got the information off the channel bit router that query dot term for getting the search.

75
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:32,820
That was just a router that search time dot sorry router that query that search type.

76
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:34,800
Let's do this.

77
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,930
So inside here, let's create our options.

78
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,460
So we're going to return at deer, which has two things.

79
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:54,240
Two options, but let's create another component for each of them.

80
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,770
So we just create a component called search.

81
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,470
Option.

82
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:04,770
A search.

83
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:14,140
Search, Heather option, but this option is different, it's not options, it's option.

84
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,510
Without this, it's singular.

85
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,940
So this is a.

86
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:26,770
Here we create a search header options that yes, this is search header option that is.

87
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:39,770
We create this file using our FC, and here we're going to use these components, so we a search filter

88
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,300
option.

89
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,070
We need to create two of them, so we create two.

90
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,440
First, we import this.

91
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,030
OK.

92
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,360
Let's make this on a smaller.

93
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,390
Bring it here.

94
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:05,820
All right.

95
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,460
So now we have two options.

96
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,970
Let's look at some props for it.

97
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,770
So each of them, they have a tie to us, so we just set the first one.

98
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,180
The title is all.

99
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,330
All right.

100
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,450
And the second one, the title is images.

101
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,570
All right.

102
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:37,360
So we're going to get this props inside that search, Heather options, for example, here we can have

103
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:37,810
the.

104
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:49,930
All the props and we can get the title here, and we can just simply show it inside a paragraph saying

105
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,650
same to.

106
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,430
Now, we should say all images, we've got it.

107
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:05,110
The other things we want to pass is icon that this search icon and the images icon.

108
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,400
So we're going to get them from the hero icons first.

109
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,170
So we just import.

110
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,980
Search icon.

111
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:24,600
And also, we're going to import another icon called Photograph.

112
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,320
Photo.

113
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,260
Graph icon.

114
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,290
And this is coming from.

115
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,880
Here are icons for Sasha React forward slash.

116
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,600
Bottom line, this is not solid, this is utterly.

117
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,020
All right.

118
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:58,660
So we're going to pass this option as well, so the icon which we should pass it like a camel case because

119
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:03,490
this is all himself a component.

120
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,530
So the first one is the icon, a search icon.

121
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,510
And the second one, the icon is.

122
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,700
Photograph icon.

123
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,540
Let's get this information and show them.

124
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:36,430
So inside the search, Heather, option singular above the paragraph, the import, the iconic smell.

125
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:49,610
But first, we need to get the idea as a prop so we can get it here.

126
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,450
So much done.

127
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,750
If we got an error, but the.

128
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,020
Everything is fine, except we.

129
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,070
Here we search icon.

130
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,290
It didn't make it to capitalize.

131
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,800
Here, a small.

132
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,000
So now we've got these two icons.

133
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,820
Let's let's make them a little bit smaller.

134
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:30,450
Just adding a class name, the height of four.

135
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,940
So now we have everything.

136
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,240
Let's add more.

137
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:51,930
Props here, you've got the title, we've got the icon, but it didn't specify the selected mode yet,

138
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,600
as I mentioned before, we need to specify the selected based on the search type.

139
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,010
So in order to get the search, we need to use Raptor.

140
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,160
So first we import right after we return.

141
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:12,330
It is react, so we delete it, so we import a user after.

142
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:15,540
From.

143
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,340
And from next.

144
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,390
Forward slash, I think, or to.

145
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,230
Yeah, that's correct.

146
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:40,940
And then we will create a constant here and we call it route, which is equal to use USERADD, then

147
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,970
we just say, select this one.

148
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:48,020
Just make it selected if.

149
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,400
If the router that query.

150
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,540
That search time.

151
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:09,030
Is equal to an empty string.

152
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,860
Or we don't have any right.

153
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:30,350
We don't have any thing like that, anything, if you don't have around to that query, Dusters just

154
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,000
do to make this more selective.

155
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:43,590
So if someone, for example, comes and there will be no search type query, we still want to select

156
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,880
the all one.

157
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:46,680
All right.

158
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:53,430
So the next one is for the image, for the image we just selected.

159
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,360
Selected.

160
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:10,890
You get this auto suggestion selected, if this rather that query does such time is equal to image.

161
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,230
All right.

162
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,390
Simple as that.

163
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,420
And then we're going to style this one based on this selected.

164
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,460
So let's go to search.

165
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:30,600
Uh, let's start this fun first here at the top, so we bring them next to each other.

166
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,400
So here we add a class name.

167
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,590
We make this one flex.

168
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:46,370
So they come to next to each other, let's add some space between them using a space X of eight.

169
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,030
All right.

170
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,030
And let's.

171
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,050
I don't want this, someone can select this one because this is going to be annoying when someone is

172
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,580
clicking on this buttons.

173
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:09,900
So especially in the mobile screen, so we just change you select to none.

174
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,270
I mean, nobody can know nobody can get this.

175
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,430
Information.

176
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,690
Copy it.

177
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:28,260
So this is going to help some women in the especially in the mobile, when someone click doesn't selected

178
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,160
the text.

179
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,010
So are we going to make the width to be full?

180
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:44,190
And we can bring them the center using Amex Auto.

181
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,980
Or we just can say justify center, that's easier to justify.

182
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,630
Centre.

183
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,380
But let's change that.

184
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:17,230
Takes to be a small and we change the color to be gray as well, so just a text.

185
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:20,960
Gray.

186
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,870
And if he specified the.

187
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,960
Color to be seven hundred.

188
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,020
And the next thing that we can do is just.

189
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,430
In the larger screen.

190
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,480
Now in the largest scandal in the center, that is not beautiful, we want it to be here.

191
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:46,470
All right.

192
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,500
So.

193
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,760
We can change this for Manchester in the largest screen.

194
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,380
And change the.

195
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,920
Having left of 50 to.

196
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:12,280
But in order to see that, we knew we need to remove the Justify center.

197
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:19,380
Picking simply do that using large justify.

198
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,750
Justify start.

199
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:30,910
All right now in the larger screen, these pixels are here.

200
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,500
But when we have a smaller scheme like this.

201
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,860
It's smaller than large, we go to this center.

202
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,060
Let's add some border and a bottom, so we can.

203
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,110
Easily say border bottom.

204
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,760
Which is going to add one pixel at the bottom, you can see here.

205
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:16,940
Next, we need to install the the item itself, so we go to search his options here.

206
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:28,080
We bring them next to each other by changing the flags to be displayed to be flags.

207
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:36,680
Like this, and then we bring them to the center using items center.

208
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:49,330
No, they're next to each other and the space between the ticks and the icon using Space X.

209
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,770
I think one pixel would be fine.

210
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,840
It's just a space x one.

211
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:03,310
Then we add a border button.

212
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,150
For.

213
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,310
You can see here.

214
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,190
But we don't want to show the border now when we hover over them.

215
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:23,190
We want to see that, but the border, so we make it transparent as a default, so we just see a border.

216
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:29,400
Transparent, so we don't see the border, but stare.

217
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,580
But when someone hover over this elements.

218
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:42,290
And we want to first, we want to change to change the color of the text to be blue.

219
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,210
Five hundred.

220
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,030
Mark, this.

221
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,300
And we want the cursor to be pointer, so we just see cursor pointer.

222
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,830
So we can see a point.

223
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,930
And when we hover over the element.

224
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:09,950
Then we went to hover, we want a border that is transparent now to be blue.

225
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,470
Five hundred similar to the text.

226
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,830
So now we see the border.

227
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,210
All right.

228
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:32,100
The only things left is it's very close to the border at the bottom, so we can just add a padding bottom

229
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,410
of three, so add some space here.

230
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,520
And this is all right and here as well.

231
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,220
OK.

232
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:54,830
No, we just achieved this one when we hover over it, but you want to add this effect, it stays when

233
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,140
the when the option is selected.

234
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,270
For example, if the.

235
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,660
Search Typekit image if you want to select this one, then the search type is empty, you're going to

236
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,440
have this one.

237
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,400
He already has specified the selected rules here.

238
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,860
We just selected rules here.

239
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,780
But we can.

240
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:27,330
We can at the InStyle inside, but in order to make it like a variable, we need to change this.

241
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,690
To the back take.

242
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,380
So we changed this tactic.

243
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,480
The ad, the curly braces here.

244
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,980
And we add that.

245
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,950
Ternary operator here just said if it is selected.

246
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,490
Then.

247
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:04,260
It's not defined because we haven't imported yet as a prop service at the selected here to test this

248
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,010
selective.

249
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,230
Let me check here.

250
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,620
So have you got the selected and if the selected.

251
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,130
Is existed.

252
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,430
Yeah, we missed the E!

253
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,720
Selected.

254
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:24,420
All right.

255
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:36,930
If it's selected, we want to Pat's, we want the change to the color, to the blue.

256
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,840
The text color to be blue.

257
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,240
Five hundred.

258
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,960
And also, we want the border to be blue as far as just safe border blue.

259
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,990
Uh, five hundred.

260
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:58,910
No, he's selected to this one.

261
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,870
And if he.

262
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,040
Let me search something.

263
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,850
For example, hello.

264
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,150
Now we have the search of empty.

265
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,750
But if we aren't the image here.

266
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,590
And enter.

267
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:26,930
This option is selected, but this is just the from the default value.

268
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,470
But we want them to click on this one.

269
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:37,130
We wanted this one to be selected to so this ability, we can add it by just adding on click.

270
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,220
Here.

271
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,620
We just added, I click on this one and this there.

272
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:57,410
But this is going to call a function, we call this function select tab.

273
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,800
And this is going to pass.

274
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:08,470
The title, as far is just you want to know that what is the title here because we want to change the

275
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,320
route based on the title.

276
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:18,500
So let's create a function here, so we just function and rename the Functions Select tab.

277
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,460
And this is going to get the title as well.

278
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,810
And based under title is going to change thereafter.

279
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,810
But in order to change the writer, we need to import the use water.

280
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,470
So the import.

281
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:43,590
Use out her from.

282
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,800
Knicks forward slash router.

283
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:58,740
And we create the router here, so it's just a cast router is equal to use router.

284
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:09,000
And here we just see if we can, we just get the title here.

285
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,930
So we just see router that push.

286
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,720
And we create.

287
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,130
Push, not put.

288
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:21,880
Push.

289
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:29,770
And inside it back to we can make this well to go to this search page.

290
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,020
With the term.

291
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,450
With the term, which is equal to.

292
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,860
We can get the team as well, we can say rather.

293
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,530
That query.

294
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:50,760
Dr.

295
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:56,030
So we get the term here and also we can add the search type here.

296
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,750
Just say Alperstein.

297
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,060
Search.

298
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,060
Time and this is going to be equal to.

299
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:14,740
That we just say if to try to.

300
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,480
Is equal to images.

301
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,300
Because we are passing the.

302
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,310
Passing the title here.

303
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:37,510
We have to talk to us if the title is images we want to route to the.

304
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,790
We want to out to image.

305
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,550
And maybe you ask why the what's the difference?

306
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,500
Images or image?

307
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:56,810
But the Google API only understand image if you put images is going to gives us an error.

308
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,760
So images is not correct for calling the API later.

309
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,670
So because we need to call the API using the information that you are.

310
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:11,030
So now we just say images, otherwise an empty string.

311
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,380
All right.

312
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,320
So now.

313
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,040
Let's save this one.

314
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,510
We tested.

315
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,790
So it's this.

316
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:32,310
The reason we got the error is we calling this function all the time, even without clicking.

317
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:38,370
We need to create a function and return this select tap as a function.

318
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,500
So now if the.

319
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,120
Go to home page.

320
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,860
Administrative service getting very slow.

321
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:52,900
Yeah.

322
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,180
I go to the homepage.

323
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,000
Refresh the page.

324
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,520
Now we will go to the homepage and then the search for something like, hello.

325
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:22,090
This is going to change our URL to a term halo search time equal to just the empty strength, which

326
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,520
is choosing the all as a default.

327
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:33,010
But when we click on image, the search type changes to image and also this one is selected as well.

328
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,690
So, yeah, that is working perfectly.

329
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:50,590
The only thing left is just getting the results from the Google API, let's add everything to get her

330
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,660
for this options.

331
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,330
So we're just to get at.

332
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:02,340
They create her comments with the message.

333
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:04,740
Of.

334
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,890
The message is to create.

335
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,340
Search further.

336
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,340
Options.

337
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,300
Components.

338
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,970
And we push everything to get.

339
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,100
Let's check what we have done.

340
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,550
And let's refresh the page.

341
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,550
Now we have nine comments.

342
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:48,940
And the last one is create such better options components.

343
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:55,940
So we did we've done quite a lot in this section.

344
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,810
So we in this search for the Duchess.

345
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,710
We change this to we change this routine.

346
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:10,240
And we added this search type as well, which is empty for whip search.

347
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:20,200
And we did this one in the index that as far as we did to add to changes in index that year and also

348
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,650
to.

349
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,170
Search dogs, two inputs.

350
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:33,140
And we have this we create we created the search for the option of search options.

351
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:41,420
This search for options past the data to this search had an option like title.

352
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,050
And the icon and also the.

353
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:56,150
The ternary operator was selected, so the selected we just say if the search time is empty, just select

354
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:00,470
the first option, but if its image.

355
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:08,880
Choose the second one, which is the images option and the image in the images options.

356
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:16,250
We got that data as a prop inside the tide here, the time you've got the title icon and selected.

357
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,320
And based on this information.

358
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,360
We we created a.

359
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:30,230
It did, which includes an icon and a paragraph.

360
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:35,690
And we just say just a style it like this.

361
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:40,400
But if they select it, change the text, the blue and the border to blue.

362
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:48,590
Then we added an oncolytic function and click, which triggers a function called Select Tab.

363
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,850
And based on the title, we're going to change the route.

364
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:03,020
So the router that push is going to change the router to to the turn and also the search time, which

365
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:03,260
is.

366
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,730
It can be image or empty now.

367
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,580
That was it for this part in the next section.

368
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:18,490
We we're going to get the information from the API of Google.

369
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:27,370
So based on this URL that we have, which is which can be any terms or search type you're going to request

370
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:30,010
to the Google API.

371
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:36,880
And we just say based on this term and the search type gives us different information, as you can see

372
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:45,250
here, if you search for the search for the word hello and the choose the search type two image, we've

373
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,630
got the images data.

374
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:53,560
And if you click on all, we get the different types of data.

375
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:58,130
So it also also we're going to get these kind of data.

376
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:03,220
So how many search results and in how many seconds we got the information?

377
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,440
So in the next section, we're going to achieve this.

378
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,320
So see you in the next section.
