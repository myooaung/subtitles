1
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:07.520
All right.

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.440
In the last section, we have completed the Post page.

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.970
We got everything like sidebar and also the widgets.

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.150
And also we we we fix the problems with the like.

5
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.780
Deleting and putting comments in this section.

6
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:37.870
We're going to get all the comments related to this post and show and create another component to show

7
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.030
it just under the post.

8
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.820
We already have the post I.D..

9
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.370
We can.

10
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.710
We already got it from the IRL using a router.

11
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:59.810
Based on this idea, we can request to the database, to the fire store using use effect and get all

12
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.910
the comments related to that post.

13
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.670
If you remember, we created a new.

14
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.040
I thought you meant.

15
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.580
Inside our fire store.

16
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.050
We have the collection posts and.

17
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.180
Each of them has an idea and they have a field.

18
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:32.030
And also we have more collections and we call the new collection concepts comments and the comments

19
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.540
has.

20
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:42.220
It's own idea and also the information like the comment itself, name timestamps and etc..

21
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.230
So we want to get.

22
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.610
All these comments related to this post.

23
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.740
For example, this post has a comment, so it has, I think, around ten comments so far.

24
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.260
The other one.

25
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.530
Has, for example.

26
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.400
One comment.

27
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:14.820
Okay, so first we get the car and we get the I.D., the post I.D..

28
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.370
This one from Earl, and we check if it has the comments collection or not.

29
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.790
If it has, we just.

30
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:36.220
Get all of them and then look through all of them and show them one by one by using map method.

31
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.060
Okay, let's go back to Visual Studio code.

32
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.290
And inside I.D. that's.

33
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.400
We just create a use effect under the other one.

34
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.280
We got the post data from using this use effect.

35
00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.280
For this one.

36
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.850
We're getting the kids comments.

37
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.280
After the post.

38
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.320
This film was get.

39
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.100
The Post's data.

40
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.550
Okay, so.

41
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.770
We can just use the use effects.

42
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.700
Use of vac is going to take two things here.

43
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.990
See effects and also dependency.

44
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:42.340
Their effects is going to be by function and the dependency is just.

45
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.490
Now.

46
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.420
We can pass the database and also the I.D..

47
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.110
If the I.D. changes, we want to have this user effects triggered and also in the database.

48
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.990
Anything changed inside the database?

49
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.400
Okay.

50
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.080
Uh.

51
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.020
So now.

52
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.350
We need to air on the snapshot to get the information.

53
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.270
So on a snapshot, we want to get to query.

54
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.310
We want to have we want to sort the documents by the time stamp.

55
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.820
So we need to put everything inside a query.

56
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.540
And after that we want to the collection of reference.

57
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:46.250
So inside a collection, the refrain is reference is deep down we go to the posts.

58
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:54.440
Then we go to the post I.D. and finally we go to the comments collection.

59
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.430
And inside the Collins collection.

60
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.290
We want to order this by.

61
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.330
Timestamp.

62
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.630
It can't.

63
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.170
It should be descending.

64
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.750
It means the news comes first.

65
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.670
Okay.

66
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.640
So let's import all of them.

67
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.080
I think we already have huge effect at the top.

68
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.690
Yeah, we already use it before on snapshot.

69
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.520
We should have Korea.

70
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.240
We don't have.

71
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.470
So we import it from fire store collection.

72
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.150
We import it as well.

73
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.710
And also ordered by.

74
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.190
I think we have.

75
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.580
They're ordered by already imported.

76
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.750
So we have collection Dacus on a stop shop ordered by a quarry from Firestone arc.

77
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.620
Now this should get their comments.

78
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.890
So we get the comment.

79
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.540
Now we need to get this snapshot and sit it inside a state.

80
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.500
And first, so we need to create this state.

81
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.060
So I copy this and just call this one comment.

82
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:31.330
And this is the function to change the value of the comments or set comment.

83
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:40.990
And initial value is an empty array because it's an array of comments then.

84
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.030
Here after a snapshot.

85
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:47.660
Uh.

86
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.180
After the query, we can just get this snapshot.

87
00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:04.670
And we sit we get this snapshot sit a comment to the snapshot that ducks.

88
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:09.750
Okay.

89
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.090
Now we have the comments here.

90
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.240
We can just.

91
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.530
Show them sombre page.

92
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.320
So after the this post.

93
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:29.800
We can create a component called comment and we look through this comment and show them inside that.

94
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.610
So let's create a component and we call it.

95
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:42.540
Comment that, yes, we can use r, f c to create a react functional component.

96
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.840
So we just leave it.

97
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.090
Now we need to make it count capital.

98
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.190
That's because it's a convention for components.

99
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.140
And let's make this fun.

100
00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.540
Capital two.

101
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:08.280
So we just say comment and let's get rid of this import and insight idea that, gee, yes, we can under

102
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.210
this post.

103
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.760
Look through there all the comments.

104
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.310
Uh, they call it comment.

105
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.310
I think it should be comments to get more than one.

106
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.780
Um, this one said comments to.

107
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.600
So now on the Post, we just looked through all the comments.

108
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:30.960
I would just say comments.

109
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:34.360
That map.

110
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.270
We get each comment.

111
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:39.090
Here.

112
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.520
And we're going to just.

113
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.280
Import the comment.

114
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.070
That's.

115
00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.920
Imported.

116
00:08:59.230 --> 00:08:59.790
Okay.

117
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.300
Let's check the browser.

118
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.320
It's refresh to page.

119
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.350
Now we are not seeing it yet.

120
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.660
Let's add a key here.

121
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.570
You just can't.

122
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.100
Dot.

123
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.220
All right.

124
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.890
Then we add the IED itself.

125
00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.610
Which is common that idea ideas far.

126
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.910
Then we passed a comment as well.

127
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.030
Just a comment is equal to.

128
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.310
Comment.

129
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:43.920
DOT data.

130
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.840
And also we want to have a condition.

131
00:09:51.890 --> 00:10:02.480
You just see if the comments that land is greater than zero, then we want to.

132
00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.170
Do this.

133
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:18.280
No.

134
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.060
This is should be ampersand.

135
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:20.860
Sorry about that.

136
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:22.960
I say.

137
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:36.870
Something goes on.

138
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.480
Work.

139
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.350
So.

140
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.840
Yeah, actually, uh.

141
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.140
Let's bring this.

142
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.620
Inside a diff.

143
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.010
This year.

144
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.220
And, uh.

145
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.140
Let's check the browser now.

146
00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.570
And now we don't need.

147
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.440
I think, uh.

148
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:19.290
You need to return this or we just make a practice.

149
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.110
This should be done to return.

150
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:24.390
So now we check.

151
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.100
So getting an error.

152
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.980
So.

153
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:36.290
This parenthesis is for this year.

154
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.440
I think it's fine now.

155
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:42.570
It's just check.

156
00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.130
Okay.

157
00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.860
Now we are getting the comments.

158
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:55.060
But all of them are similar because we have a component and just writing down something randomly here,

159
00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:04.540
but we can get the information here as the props and with the structure it we just get the comment.

160
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.180
We can get the idea.

161
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.920
And here instead of that, it's just a comment.

162
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.150
Uh, for example, the comment.

163
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.270
That comment is the message, I think.

164
00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.950
It's a fresh approach.

165
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.210
Still getting some things?

166
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:31.780
No.

167
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:34.660
This.

168
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.890
Let's start with server.

169
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.670
So we passed the.

170
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:52.310
Comment that data as a comment and inside the server each comment has a comment.

171
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.460
We should get each current.

172
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:00.860
Yeah, that was correct.

173
00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:04.990
I think it was just a cash getting the previous information.

174
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.380
So these are the comments.

175
00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:08.270
Uh.

176
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.560
Now we can add a new comment.

177
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:18.310
For example, we just say hello warned and should comes first in the results.

178
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:19.600
Yeah.

179
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.420
We got it like this.

180
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:23.740
Okay.

181
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.490
In the next section, we're going to create the comments.

182
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.220
Com components.

183
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.560
Complete it and make it at.

184
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:34.710
More beautiful.

185
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:41.610
And also we want to add the delete and like functionality for that as well.

186
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.960
So let's add this one to the guitar.

187
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:54.870
We just take it and all we make a comment with the message of.

188
00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:03.700
Get the comments from fire store.

189
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.210
And create.

190
00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:11.360
The comment.

191
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:14.730
Components.

192
00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.280
And we push it to get higher.

193
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.960
Let's review what we have done so far.

194
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.970
Let's refresh the page here.

195
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:33.660
The last comment is get the comments from Firestorm and create a comment component.

196
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:43.780
As you can see, we have created a component called Comment Duchess as we just returned each comment.

197
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:51.840
And inside I did a tease there, which is our post page.

198
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:58.330
First we got the collection down on a snapshot audit by a quarry from Firestone.

199
00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:04.570
Then we created a piece of estate called comments.

200
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:07.480
Then we use use of fact.

201
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:12.680
To get the snapshot and be curried.

202
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.400
That's fine.

203
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:18.980
Based on the reference by the it's time stamps.

204
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:27.710
Then we got the snapshot data and put it inside the comments state.

205
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:38.210
Then we just say if the comments are more than one, more than zero, we just want to look through all

206
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:46.490
of them and show them inside the comments component and we pass the key idea and comment as a prop.

207
00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:49.550
Okay.

208
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.370
Yeah.

209
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:55.620
That was it for this part in the next section where you're going to complete this comment that.

210
00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:56.350
Yes.

211
00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:01.210
Which is similar to our actually the post.

212
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:10.640
We can just get the data from the post status and we just use them and just remove the image and other

213
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.700
things and we create our comment that yes.

214
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.950
And also we want to add the like and the leading functionalities.

215
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:25.850
So see the next section for creating the comment and completing the comment component.
