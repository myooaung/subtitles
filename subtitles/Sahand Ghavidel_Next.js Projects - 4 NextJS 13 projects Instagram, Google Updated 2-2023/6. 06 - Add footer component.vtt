1
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.770
All right.

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.480
In the last section, we have completed the body section of the home page.

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.520
In this section, we're going to create the footer part of the project.

4
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:27.240
If you look at the final version and we go to home page, we see that we have a footer here.

5
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.970
Which is divided with three parts.

6
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.240
Here at the top, we see the.

7
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.990
If you zoom it, we see we have a country detection here.

8
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.110
We are going to use an API to get the IP of the.

9
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.250
User and show the country that they live in.

10
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.510
Then we have to a menu at the bottom.

11
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.450
So the one menu at the left.

12
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.840
On the left and 1 million menu on the right side.

13
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.640
And also in the mobile screen, they are on top of each other.

14
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.240
But in the larger screen, they are next to each other.

15
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.610
So let's create this one.

16
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:22.200
And the other things I want to mention again is this footer is common in other pages as well.

17
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.260
For example, if you go to the search page.

18
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.030
We should see the future here.

19
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.100
Always at the bottom button of the page.

20
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:41.110
So we're going to use absolute position in absolute for the footer to keep it always at the.

21
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.240
But, uh.

22
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.350
Bottom of the page.

23
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.000
So let's create this.

24
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.080
Footer.

25
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.740
Let's go back to Visual City Code.

26
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.280
So we're going to create a component.

27
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.240
And also we want to add it to the layouts because we want to keep this footer in both sides.

28
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.020
So we want to have this footer inside this page such A6.

29
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.160
And also if we in the future, if we make any other pages, we want to have the footer there as well.

30
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:29.160
So we want to create that one inside the layout, A6 layout that A6 is just the React functional component,

31
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:37.380
which gets the children, which is this page that JSX or any other pages that we create in the future

32
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.490
under this.

33
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.340
It has just an HTML tag.

34
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:50.770
This head tag is not necessary actually, because we have the hit tag here in the next year 13 so we

35
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.000
can delete that hit.

36
00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:00.520
And we have the body section, which includes the children, which is this page such as X.

37
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:09.850
So what we want to do here is inside this body section, after these children, we want to add our footer

38
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.330
here.

39
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.760
So I'm going to say footer.

40
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:21.580
And here at the bottom we want to create the footer component, add the footer component here.

41
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.680
So this one should be in an uppercase because it's a component, not a tag.

42
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.690
And let's create this one inside the components file.

43
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:54.150
So we're going to create another component called Footer Dot.

44
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.320
G6.

45
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.280
And this is going to be a reac functional component.

46
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.340
So let's add this one to the layouts.

47
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.890
We can just use control space here to order imported.

48
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.720
And we just add the alias components for slash footer.

49
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.700
Now, if you look at our website, we should see the footer here.

50
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.370
So let's start creating the future.

51
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:39.350
And the other things I want to mention is this country IP lookup as it is using use the set and use

52
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.820
effect from React and there are hawks.

53
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.200
React hawks.

54
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.570
We cannot use this component.

55
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.850
Uh, server side.

56
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.100
We need to use it client side.

57
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.960
But I don't want all the footer to be client side.

58
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.270
I just want the this part to be client side.

59
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:12.200
That's so I'm going to create a separate component for this part for the country and the rest of them

60
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.470
can stay server side.

61
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.560
So we're going to create that one separately.

62
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:29.060
So we're going to create that footer and we're going to return for let's delete this one.

63
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.970
And here instead of the A diff, I'm going to create a footer tag for SEO purposes.

64
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.800
And here inside this, we're going to have a diff.

65
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.300
And inside this tier, we're going to have that country lookup.

66
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.000
So we're going to create a country.

67
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.370
Look up file here a components.

68
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.180
I'm going to create it now inside the components folder.

69
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.410
That's G6.

70
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.050
And this is going to be a big functional component to.

71
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.810
So let's import it here using contra space.

72
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.990
So we have the country look up for now, but later we're going to create it.

73
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.010
For now we just create the other parts, the menus.

74
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:43.600
So we're going to have another diff at the bottom of this diff.

75
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.610
And this, Deb, is going to include.

76
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:56.720
A ul a unordered list which is going to include.

77
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.350
Some list which is going to be for example, about.

78
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.610
The next one.

79
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:19.080
As you can see, we are getting a suggestion from the now actually the GitHub copilot detected that

80
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.970
we are creating a Google clone based on the previous information.

81
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:30.120
So this is going to help us to fill up even the form correctly as Google Chrome.

82
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.930
So we have finished with the left side.

83
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.150
And let's create the right side.

84
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.130
I'm going to put another UL and here we have.

85
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.700
Privacy terms.

86
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.480
And finally, we have city, as you can see, if you use.

87
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:58.390
Yeah, GitHub copilot is going to help you a lot, so I'm going to see all we have.

88
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.230
All these.

89
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.550
Country, the low carb and everything here.

90
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:15.030
So this they have this similar asylum.

91
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.040
So I'm going to create a custom.

92
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.370
Tilman says.

93
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:29.160
So inside the Global SAT, CSIS, I'm going to create another custom one, which is going to be a link.

94
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:37.240
So I'm just say link and this is going to be apply.

95
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.830
I had two things.

96
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:49.360
First thing first, I want to change the.

97
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:55.620
Underline, make it underlined when we use it.

98
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:59.730
And then also we will when we hover over it.

99
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.890
I want to see the and underline.

100
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.520
The other things I want to see is when we.

101
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.320
Hover over it.

102
00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.990
I want to see the cursor to be pointed.

103
00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.440
So now we can add this link here.

104
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:28.570
So let's go back to Footer six and I'm going to add all all of them using a dual cursor.

105
00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:30.730
But let's do it again.

106
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:43.570
And for all of them, I just use the alt and click to have a dual cursor.

107
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:49.750
Now we have class name and we can just add that link that we have created.

108
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:55.480
So now when we hover over them, we should see an underline.

109
00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:02.990
And we see a cursor is pointer when we hover over the elements.

110
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.480
So let's continue styling this.

111
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:15.050
The other styling is one I want to use for these two unordered lists.

112
00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.430
I want to change the display to be flex.

113
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.590
Be to bring them next to each other.

114
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:34.920
And also I want to use items center to bring them to the aligned with each other vertically.

115
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:41.430
And also we want to use space x six to have some space between them.

116
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.000
So now.

117
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.430
They are next to each other, each menu.

118
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.710
And also they have a.

119
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.960
Proper spacing between them.

120
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:57.690
The next thing we want to do is to in the top div.

121
00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:03.730
We also want to change the flag display to flex for the.

122
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.540
Mobile size.

123
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:13.670
We want to have them on top of each other, so we change the display to column.

124
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:20.780
But in the after the mobile size, I want them to be next to each other.

125
00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:29.960
So we change the flex to two row in the same size and above, and then we can use justify content between

126
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:35.600
to add a space between there and we can use item center to bring them.

127
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.860
Uh, in the center.

128
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.720
Vertically.

129
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:43.440
Vertically in the.

130
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:45.850
A small size.

131
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.190
Sorry, in the large size.

132
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.960
Horizontally in the small size.

133
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:57.750
So our time sentence works, but in different in the flex call or flex row.

134
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:08.280
The other is a small things we want to do is to add a padding in the x axis of eight and padding in

135
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.110
the y axis of three.

136
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:14.610
We can have a space between them in the y axis.

137
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:20.660
Of seven.

138
00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:27.590
But in the small size and above, I don't want any space in the y axis.

139
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.960
So let's see what we have done.

140
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.510
So they are actually.

141
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:43.470
The we use the justify between so we have a space between them and also they are aligned with each.

142
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:44.470
Each.

143
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.450
Each other.

144
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.530
And.

145
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:55.340
So everything looks good, but we have to style this one as well at the top.

146
00:12:55.340 --> 00:13:02.330
And also we want to have a background color and also we want to keep this footer at the bottom of the

147
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:03.020
page.

148
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:14.000
So next things we want to do is to add some classes to this first thing first in the country, low carb.

149
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:21.230
I want to have a border at the bottom so we have some border here.

150
00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.300
You can see the border.

151
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.620
And also after the border.

152
00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:40.700
We want to have some padding in the x axis of eight and padding in the Y axis of three.

153
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.690
So this is going to look like that.

154
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.760
And now it's time to actually bring them to the bottom.

155
00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:59.570
So in the top footer, we're going to change the position to be absolute.

156
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.740
And we want to bring them to the bottom.

157
00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.050
So we just say bottom zero.

158
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.050
This is going to push them at the bottom.

159
00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:25.070
I want the text to be as small, the color of the text to be gray, but the 500.

160
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.060
Let's change the background color.

161
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.080
Again, I want to use the.

162
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:40.770
If you go to Google.com, for example, you search something, check the footer.

163
00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:48.250
We can just use that color picker to to get this color here.

164
00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.340
But let me try again.

165
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:57.860
Okay, When we click here, we get this color.

166
00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:06.570
I'm going to copy this color and come back here in our website and just put it inside a bracket.

167
00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:13.530
So this is the exactly the same color of Google.com.

168
00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:18.930
And we want the width of this width of it to be full.

169
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:24.040
Which is the with 100%.

170
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:25.780
So let's try with.

171
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:30.940
See now we have this with this color and also at the bottom.

172
00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:38.260
So the other things you need to do in all pages, you need to add a padding at a bottom.

173
00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.570
So never anything goes under it.

174
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.170
So as you can see now, for example, in the.

175
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.260
Too much zoom.

176
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:52.110
The button went under the this so in order to prevent it.

177
00:15:52.830 --> 00:16:00.270
In this pages that you have a lot of content, you can add some putting padding at the bottom so you

178
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:05.160
can just prevent the items to go under the.

179
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.010
A footer.

180
00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:14.670
So this is the trick that always keeps your footer at the bottom of the page in any circumstances.

181
00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:16.040
All right.

182
00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:26.160
So now that we have finished with the footer, we want to create this font correctly.

183
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.900
We want to really get the

184
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:33.390
country of the person.

185
00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:39.450
So I'm going to use a website called Extreme.

186
00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.800
So let me search for it here.

187
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:43.980
Extreme.

188
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.550
So let's search here.

189
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:50.940
You can see it better.

190
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:54.950
So we just say X train.

191
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:04.480
So he had at the beginning extreme IP.

192
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:06.670
Look up.

193
00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.480
There is a website called Extreme IP lookup.

194
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.540
They're going to give you this.

195
00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:21.660
Information about your country and also the places you are living.

196
00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:29.670
You can see the IP address, what kind of IP you have, and other useful stuff.

197
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.080
The other things you can do is to.

198
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.100
Use their API.

199
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.610
So if you hear, you can use a free package.

200
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:52.720
So up to one website and also you can have 10,000 website requests per month for free and also 20 per

201
00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.790
minute backend requests.

202
00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.440
So here you can just simply choose the free package.

203
00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.910
Put your name.

204
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.540
Address and email.

205
00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.180
And you just sign up.

206
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.840
There is no need for.

207
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.830
Uh, credit card or anything.

208
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.080
So I'm going to just quickly put my name.

209
00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:21.370
Email called with sand dot com at gmail.com.

210
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:37.270
We just say the hand you're you need to put your an any address.

211
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:45.880
Which is to say something.

212
00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:52.930
Country.

213
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:54.550
I just choose Australia.

214
00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.380
When you press on, sign up.

215
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.770
You should get an API key.

216
00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.680
So let's.

217
00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.150
So we need to wait until they create your account.

218
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:26.080
And finally, they're going to redirect you to the.

219
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:35.640
To your place and you can just use their API key to get the country of the person.

220
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.480
I'm going to pause the video when they finish.

221
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.010
I'm going to come back.

222
00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:42.950
All right, So.

223
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.590
Uh, the sign up is completed.

224
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.720
Now, I have my API key here.

225
00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:57.510
And also there are other examples how to use the API key, for example, to get the.

226
00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.990
Different information.

227
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.200
I'm going to show you how to get the country easily.

228
00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:18.420
So we're going to just copy the API key and we bring it and put it inside our environmental variable.

229
00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.550
So we have it created an environmental variable.

230
00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:31.450
Environmental variable is a file that is going to protect our API keys from people to see it, for example,

231
00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.380
inside the GitHub repository.

232
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.570
So you need to go to the root of your project, which is outside.

233
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:45.790
You need to close all the folders and here you just right click and create a new file and we just call

234
00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:50.950
the file dot E and V dot local.

235
00:20:53.480 --> 00:21:09.740
And here you can just add your API key, which in this case is, for example, IP underlying a PI underlying

236
00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:10.250
key.

237
00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:16.730
And this is going to be equal to the API key that we have copied.

238
00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:23.930
And now we just easily we can add it to our website.

239
00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:28.370
So we go to the country, look up here.

240
00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:35.210
And the other things I want to mention is the reason we are using client side for the country lookup.

241
00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.850
One was the use of fact and uses state.

242
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.360
But without using these two.

243
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:51.940
Also we can also create this in the server side part because we want to get the country of the user,

244
00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.490
not the server.

245
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.520
We need to keep create this one client side.

246
00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:03.610
Otherwise the person is always seeing the the server country.

247
00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:09.400
So we need to create this function country client size for this reason as well.

248
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:15.160
So we need to to add that to use client at a top.

249
00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.700
To make this one client side.

250
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.650
And here we need to.

251
00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:25.630
Create.

252
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:31.180
I want to create a constant a piece of state called country.

253
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:35.320
And we use uses state to create it.

254
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.790
The I want to make the initial value.

255
00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.500
United States.

256
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:50.730
So if the person for any reason the IPA, the API doesn't work, they can see United States.

257
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:55.680
And then when the API works, they see their own country.

258
00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:01.470
So now here inside this diff.

259
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:03.630
So instead of.

260
00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.750
Just, uh.

261
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:07.980
We just say country.

262
00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.330
Country.

263
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:19.830
So now if we check our website, we should see.

264
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:21.200
United States.

265
00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.890
Let me refresh the page.

266
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.640
So use a state is not defined.

267
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.410
So we need to import user state.

268
00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:35.730
You can just use counter space to import user set.

269
00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.560
Let's see again.

270
00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:38.340
Okay.

271
00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.770
Now we see the United States here.

272
00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:44.690
Now we need to fetch and use that API.

273
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:52.710
So here at a top I'm going to use the user use effect to fetch the data.

274
00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:57.760
So this is going to fetch data.

275
00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:06.990
From that from this website.

276
00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:08.910
So I'm going to show you how to do it.

277
00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.960
HTTP s.

278
00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:28.000
And we can just say extreme IP lookup dot com forward slash JSON and now we need to add our API key

279
00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:28.480
here.

280
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:36.280
We just say key and this is going to be equal to because this is a variable we are getting from the

281
00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.020
environmental variable.

282
00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:43.090
We need to change this one to code, double code to back take.

283
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:47.930
Not the single code.

284
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:48.890
It's a back deck.

285
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.830
It's located above the tap key.

286
00:24:51.980 --> 00:25:01.160
And then we create a dollar sign for adding the variable, which is which will be processed.

287
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:04.070
That envy.

288
00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:17.140
Dot the name that we have added inside this and have here so we can copy this IP API key here and add

289
00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:17.770
it here.

290
00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:27.550
So now we can fetch the data we need to convert this one to a proper format, which is JSON.

291
00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:28.480
So we're going to.

292
00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:35.850
We're going to come get this.

293
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.150
Response.

294
00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:45.400
We converted to JSON and then we want to set this country.

295
00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.230
We get the data.

296
00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:53.530
This.

297
00:25:53.530 --> 00:26:00.340
This is going to be data and then we're just going to set the country to be data, that country.

298
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:10.960
So as you can see, we are getting more and more better suggestion from get out, get copilot and let's

299
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.590
delete this.

300
00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:13.660
Okay.

301
00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:21.370
So let's see what we I think there is some problem here.

302
00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.940
This return should be.

303
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:36.360
So we didn't close this use of packed properly and we're going to add some dependency.

304
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:43.860
So each time we we refresh the page or go to another page, we're going to call this fetching and set

305
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.030
the country again.

306
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:51.270
So now let's check our website.

307
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.870
So first is the United States and then it's nothing.

308
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:02.220
So let's check what we mistakes we have done.

309
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:10.380
So the API key is coming from IP API underlying key process.

310
00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.030
That is correct.

311
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:22.800
And then you're going to fetch the data from this key and then we have converted this one to a JSON

312
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.050
and then we got the data.

313
00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:30.830
And if we set the country, which is here to data that country.

314
00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:36.170
--.

315
00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.670
And let's see what.

316
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:41.900
Error we get.

317
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.510
We need to catch the error here.

318
00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:47.440
So let me.

319
00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:50.650
Console.log data first.

320
00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.990
So instead of set country.

321
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:56.850
On to console.log data.

322
00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:58.050
So let's see.

323
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:04.940
What do we get?

324
00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.650
So now.

325
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:14.330
Honestly this.

326
00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:25.040
So let's open the console using F 12

327
00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.950
and actually we get an object.

328
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:37.860
The message is API key not recognize.

329
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:40.270
So probably we didn't.

330
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.440
Oh, I forgot to restart the server.

331
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:49.920
Whenever you add something inside it that EMV that local or any environmental variable, you need to

332
00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.120
restart the server.

333
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.550
Otherwise you cannot get the results.

334
00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:56.400
So now I'm going to restart the server.

335
00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.920
So now we should see different results.

336
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:04.190
Let's open the console here.

337
00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:08.480
And now we refresh the page.

338
00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.300
Okay.

339
00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:15.950
Okay.

340
00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.490
Now this time looks better.

341
00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:20.780
So let's.

342
00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.580
Yeah, it looks like the API key not recognized.

343
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.670
So I'm going to check the.

344
00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:36.620
API.

345
00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.110
So that is correct.

346
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:41.150
We put the API key here.

347
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.550
Process that EMV that.

348
00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:51.790
IP API key that was correct to.

349
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:02.440
So.

350
00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:12.370
So another reason that we don't get because this is a client side, we need to change the environmental

351
00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:13.320
variable.

352
00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:20.470
We need to add something at the beginning, which is next public.

353
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:28.760
And then we add underline and then we just say IP underline API key.

354
00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:34.550
So we need to change this font here too.

355
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.260
So we just say public.

356
00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:44.420
Next public because this is a client size.

357
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:49.460
It's a different role for the environmental variables.

358
00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:56.480
Now let's see the console using F 12.

359
00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:00.290
So inside the object.

360
00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.840
So let's refresh the page now.

361
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:08.480
So actually, after changing the environmental variable, we need to resolve the server again.

362
00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:17.020
So, okay, now it looks like we are getting the correct things.

363
00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.750
So as you can see here.

364
00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:33.390
Inside the console where we are getting the correct now answer because the API key was correct now.

365
00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:41.460
So we are getting the city, the continent, country and residential, all the things we need like a

366
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.690
address and etc..

367
00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:56.790
Okay, so now we instead of just console logging, we can just here we can just set the.

368
00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.190
Country.

369
00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:08.490
To be that data, that country, because here we get the country here.

370
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.190
So let's close this.

371
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:15.950
So now.

372
00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.940
Let's refresh the page.

373
00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:23.260
We should see instead of United States, we should see Vietnam.

374
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:24.040
Okay.

375
00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:29.410
Now, as you can see all the pages here, it's server side.

376
00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:35.350
But this part is going to render with a delay and shows the country.

377
00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:41.050
So actually, now we can use this footer for other pages as well.

378
00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:51.340
We just need to import this footer component anywhere we like or as we are putting it inside the layouts.

379
00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:57.820
This is going to be common in all pages inside the app directory.

380
00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.560
So that was it for creating the footer part.

381
00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:07.760
Let's add this one to GitHub using contour shift G.

382
00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.070
So we're going to.

383
00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:16.590
As you can see, the environmental variable is not here, so this is not going to be uploaded to GitHub.

384
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:25.990
So our API key is protected from people seeing our GitHub repository and then we can just press plus

385
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:33.070
here and we add the message, which is add footer component.

386
00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.990
We can commit and push it.

387
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:45.900
And let's go to GitHub and we refresh the page here we should see now.

388
00:33:47.140 --> 00:34:01.570
So let's we need we now we see we have six commits here and the last one is at footer components.

389
00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:04.270
Let's review what we have done.

390
00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:12.280
We have added a custom tail and CSS class called link that we have used inside our menu.

391
00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:15.640
Inside the layout gsx.

392
00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:19.750
We have added the footer component here.

393
00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:27.190
And inside we have created a component specifically for country lookup.

394
00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:35.710
So this is a client side component because we want to show the IP of the person in the client side.

395
00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:43.660
We have imported user state and use effect to create some piece of seed and also a lifecycle.

396
00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.460
So we have created a piece of state called country.

397
00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.080
And the initial value is the United States.

398
00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:58.330
And then we have used the use effect to fetch the data from this API.

399
00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:04.060
With this, as you can see, we just see the environmental variable here.

400
00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:14.080
And we have converted this file to JSON and we set the country to be data that country here.

401
00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:16.510
And we just returned the country.

402
00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:25.660
And we have created another component called Footer, which includes the menu.

403
00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.560
And also we have imported that country.

404
00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:34.330
Look up here as a component, a separate component.

405
00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:45.850
So this footer is actually server side, but the country lookup that is inside this is going to be client

406
00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:46.180
side.

407
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:55.270
So we can just have a separate as client size and server side and they're going to work together seamlessly.

408
00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:02.260
So that was it for creating the footer section of our project.

409
00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:08.710
In the next section we're going to create the two pages that we have, which is this.

410
00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:18.640
If you look at the final version, we have this image page, which is in the search force slash web

411
00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.460
sort of web page.

412
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:25.400
And also we have the image page, which is search for slash image.

413
00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:35.320
So this is going to be a very short section and we're going to learn how to create different pages inside

414
00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:35.770
next.

415
00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:40.720
JS So see you in the next section for creating these two pages.
