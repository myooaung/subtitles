1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,080
All right.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,210
In the last section, we have completed the header section of our project.

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,500
In this section, we're going to work on the dark mode button.

4
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,630
So inside the.

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,450
We have to put this dark mode switch inside the header section.

6
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:34,720
So we go to we go back to Visual Studio Code, and here we go to.

7
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:47,170
This file, this header, that G6 and just next to this icon that we have created here, we're going

8
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,270
to add that switch.

9
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,570
But we're going to create another component for this switch.

10
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,020
So I'm going to call this component dark.

11
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,630
Mode switch.

12
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,050
I'm going to close this.

13
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,550
And we simply need to create this file.

14
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:18,750
So we go back to Explorer section using Contour Shift E and inside the components, I'm going to create

15
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,870
another component with the same name dark mode switch.

16
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,580
Dutch G6.

17
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,310
So I just use RFC to create a React functional component for now.

18
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,370
And I'm going to import this one in here.

19
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:46,460
So I can just click on the at the end of the name of the component use contra space and auto import

20
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:46,940
it.

21
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,500
Here.

22
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,390
So now let's start the server and see.

23
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,960
The dark mode switch here.

24
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,810
So let's go back to our website in localhost 3000.

25
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,290
Now let's refresh the page to see the changes.

26
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,960
So you can see the dark mode switch at the top.

27
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:27,230
We can just bring it next to that by working on this diff that is covering both of the dark mode switch

28
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,160
and the link.

29
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,790
So here we change the display to flex.

30
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,420
We changed.

31
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,730
Let's see.

32
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,210
Let's.

33
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,450
Let me show you in real time.

34
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,740
So I'll bring this one to the right side.

35
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,300
So I changed the flags.

36
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:52,260
So this is going to bring them next to each other like this, and then we can align them.

37
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,750
Using items.

38
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,150
Center.

39
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,780
And also we can edit space between them using a space x five.

40
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,610
Which is equal to.

41
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,530
Uh.

42
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:26,170
This CSS code, which is going to calculate the distance between them and just add the space between

43
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,590
them, not before or after.

44
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,780
So this is the good things about using the tailbacks.

45
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,300
As you can see, a lot of codes here.

46
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,830
Just you can use this space X instead.

47
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,620
So we just bring them next to each other.

48
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,690
Now perfectly.

49
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,410
So let's go work on this dark mode switch.

50
00:03:53,710 --> 00:04:02,440
And before doing that, we need to install a package called next thing to be able to use the and change

51
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,240
the dark and light mode in our websites.

52
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:15,460
But actually, you can do that by just adding some variable inside your local storage and save your

53
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,660
current mode.

54
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:25,780
But the next thing package is going to do all these parts for us and we don't need to create these functions

55
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,950
or anything else.

56
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,180
And it uses the use context.

57
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:36,370
So it is going to create a global variable for us.

58
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,690
So anywhere inside our website, if you click on this.

59
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,380
Button, we can change the light mode of the website.

60
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,290
So I'm going to search on Google.

61
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,040
For.

62
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,770
Next.

63
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,860
Themes.

64
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,300
And there is a package.

65
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,740
AMPM just inside this website.

66
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,060
Let me zoom this so you can see it better.

67
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:16,230
So the website is just an MPLM package and the package name is next thing.

68
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,510
So we're going to click the in here.

69
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,060
For installation.

70
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,290
It's very simple.

71
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:31,060
We just need to have NPM install next team.

72
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:38,570
And for the usage, we need to cover all our website.

73
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,770
And with the team provider.

74
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,860
So we get a team provider and cover everything.

75
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:55,600
But the problem is because this team provider uses contacts, so we are not allowed to use contacts

76
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,230
in.

77
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,780
A server side component in next.

78
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,360
Yes, we need to use it in client side.

79
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:10,160
So if we just put this one inside the layout that JSX, so all the layout of JSX would be.

80
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,950
A client side instead of server side.

81
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:20,060
So what we do, we recreate an extra provider and put this one inside that provider.

82
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,730
I'm going to show you now how we do it.

83
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,900
So let's first install this.

84
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:33,510
So we just copy this code and we come back here, we stop the server, I'm going to paste it here to

85
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,860
install this one.

86
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,470
And what we do.

87
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:43,110
We go to layout the G6 and here we add our providers.

88
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,600
So we just create a provider.

89
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,140
And we just put the provider inside the body section.

90
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,330
So I'm going to create a provider.

91
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,400
Providers.

92
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:08,620
And I'm going to put everything inside the provider, so I'm going to cut.

93
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:15,130
All the things, including the children, and put it inside these providers.

94
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,160
And I'm going to create this provider.

95
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,510
We need to put this provider inside the app folder.

96
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,430
So I'm going to create this file providers that G6.

97
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,940
And we create a React functional component for now.

98
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,950
And we go back to layout the JSX.

99
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:47,110
And we import by using just count control space and click on the auto suggestion.

100
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,630
So now we have the providers.

101
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,360
And inside the providers.

102
00:07:54,950 --> 00:08:02,450
We can create this provider client side without changing the layout or anything inside it.

103
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,720
So the next yes is so smart.

104
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:14,900
The next is 13 that even this provider is client side the header and the children would be still server

105
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,350
side.

106
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,340
So that's a good things about using next year's 30.

107
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,420
So we need to create this provider here.

108
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:32,180
So this is going to return that theme provider that I mentioned.

109
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,550
So we need to.

110
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,180
As you can see, we need to use this team provider from next teams.

111
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,970
And let me close this.

112
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,080
Let this one.

113
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:53,250
So this is going to cover everything inside our website, which is in layout.

114
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,530
We are covering header and children.

115
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,270
So in providers, the theme provider is going to cover all of them.

116
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:08,630
And this theme provider because is using the context, we cannot use it as a server side.

117
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:17,400
So if I start the server now and P and run there, we should get an error.

118
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,740
So let's see.

119
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,090
So now if I refresh the page.

120
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:34,370
We should get an error saying that we cannot use team provider inside a server side.

121
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,760
Component.

122
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:39,860
Let's see.

123
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,880
K.

124
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:54,020
Any time you start the server, you need to wait until the initial sell until the website loaded.

125
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,320
So.

126
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,940
Okay.

127
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,620
Let's see.

128
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:11,310
So until this one comes, let's add some other things inside the theme provider.

129
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,700
So I'm going to show you here inside the next steps.

130
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:23,690
So this team provider, it's going to cover everything inside our website.

131
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,560
And it has some a.

132
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,910
Default.

133
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:35,730
And default kind of coloring if you want to use.

134
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:42,760
And there is something else called use team from next teams that is going to change the theme of the

135
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,870
website.

136
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:50,530
So it actually this hook is going to give us the theme and the.

137
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,260
We can change it using this function setting.

138
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,550
So, for example, we have two buttons.

139
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,990
One is light and one is.

140
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,940
At dark.

141
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,170
So when we click on the light button, we're going to set the theme to light.

142
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,280
And when we click on Dark Mode, we set the theme to dark.

143
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,900
And the current theme is the one that we are getting here.

144
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:20,490
All right.

145
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,370
So let's see what happened to our website.

146
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,100
So probably some problem happened.

147
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:33,270
The other things we need to do for the providers and put it their theme is we need to pass the children

148
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:33,690
as well.

149
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:42,480
So we need to have the children here because we want to pass everything inside from the layout, digest

150
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,070
and put it inside the.

151
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,010
Team provider.

152
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:50,630
So inside the team provider, we're going to pass this children.

153
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,720
So let's save this one.

154
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:05,990
So now if you check the our our website, we can see that we get an error.

155
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,310
That is a type error.

156
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:19,680
Saying create context only works in client components at the use client directive at the top of the

157
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,990
file to use it.

158
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:29,760
So as I mentioned before, because they are using contacts, we cannot use them in, in the server side

159
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,570
component, it should be in client component.

160
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,900
So we need to add use client at the top.

161
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:41,550
So I'm going to copy this or I'm going to go here at the top.

162
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,290
We need to add this.

163
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,720
Use client.

164
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,130
So we just right here use client.

165
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,040
And this is going to solve the problem for us.

166
00:12:54,190 --> 00:13:00,310
And if you go back now, you refresh the page, we shouldn't get this error.

167
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,140
Kit.

168
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,630
So now we don't get an error.

169
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,880
So everything is the same because we didn't do anything.

170
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:21,100
Actually, we actually covered all the website with providers and inside the providers covered everything

171
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,630
with the theme provider.

172
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,990
So they think actually we need to do is start from now.

173
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,790
So we go here.

174
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:36,530
The first thing we need to add as an attribute inside the team provider we need to enable.

175
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,610
The system.

176
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:44,600
We just say use the system and theme.

177
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,100
And we said it to be true.

178
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,870
So this is going to use the system's dark mode.

179
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:59,100
For example, if you're using light mode or dark mode inside your browser setting, this screen provider

180
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,540
can use that for.

181
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,810
And the other things we need to add is attribute.

182
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,760
Class.

183
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:16,550
So what is what that means is when we are using Tailwind CSS, we want to add to a class called Dark.

184
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,320
To add our dark mode for the dark.

185
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,300
So we need to add this attribute class here and we go, We can.

186
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:30,040
We need to go to the 12 in that conflict that is.

187
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,570
This file.

188
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:44,640
And here inside the sorry, after this team or anywhere outside of this one, we need to add the dark

189
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,300
mode.

190
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,610
Equal to class.

191
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,590
So in this way, if we add something.

192
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,300
Inside our website.

193
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,330
And added dark at the beginning.

194
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:05,310
We can just say use this class only for the dark mode.

195
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,950
So I'm going to show you now.

196
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,790
So first we add the necessary things.

197
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:19,170
So we need to add these two attributes, as I mentioned, enabled system and attributes.

198
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,650
Now.

199
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,940
We we can just add our.

200
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,400
Button to change the light and dark mode.

201
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,850
So we go to this, uh.

202
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,020
So let's see what this error.

203
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:50,420
Ah, we are getting an error because we have added something to the tailwind config, but we haven't

204
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,570
actually restart the server.

205
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:58,340
Anything you add inside the config file, you need to restart the server.

206
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,690
So I'm going to restart the server now.

207
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,260
Probably the errors should go away for now.

208
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,640
Let's refresh the page and see.

209
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,240
No, it's okay now.

210
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,540
We don't get any more any error.

211
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,060
So let's go to.

212
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:40,130
Our start mode switch and add our switch and other things so we can work on the the changing the thing.

213
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:46,050
So we need to actually button.

214
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:53,310
So if you go to react icons, I'm going to use two icons for our website.

215
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,410
One is the light.

216
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,450
We search for light.

217
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,790
And this the search for light mode.

218
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,310
So I want to use AMD light mode.

219
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,300
So I'm going to copy this one and bring it to this.

220
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,670
So let's add it at a top.

221
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,470
So I'm going to import it.

222
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,560
Import empty lite mode.

223
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,690
And this is going to come from react icons forward slash empty.

224
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,010
The next icon I want to add is this.

225
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,020
It's called.

226
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:33,640
Moon.

227
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,180
And we just search for moon.

228
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,120
And the name of that is BS.

229
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,900
Phil.

230
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,610
Let me find this.

231
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,340
Be is field, Moon Field.

232
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:51,910
This one.

233
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,630
So I'm going to copy this one, too.

234
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,750
I'm going to add it here.

235
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:09,130
And this is coming from React Icons for Bees.

236
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,460
So now we have two icons here.

237
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,370
Let's add them here.

238
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:20,200
So instead of dark mode, let's remove this diff.

239
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,310
And here.

240
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,280
We just add the icons.

241
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,400
For now, I want to show you the icons.

242
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,090
So the first icon is empty.

243
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,590
Light mode.

244
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:43,260
And the second one is peace.

245
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,600
Phil Mon.

246
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,150
Phil.

247
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,040
So if you now check our website, we should see two icons.

248
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,540
Here.

249
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,480
Let's refresh the page.

250
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,480
So we can see the two icons here, the light.

251
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,100
Let me zoom this.

252
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,120
You can see it better.

253
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,440
So it's light and the dark mode.

254
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:10,910
A button.

255
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,390
And the things we do, we get.

256
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,000
The theme.

257
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:27,680
The other things here I want to show you, because we want to use the use and estate and use effect

258
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,550
and also the use theme from next teams.

259
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,670
We cannot have this component as a server side.

260
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,000
We need to change this one to the client side as well.

261
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:48,350
For example, if I use any user state or let's actually bring that here, for example, import.

262
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,120
Use team.

263
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,440
If we import used steam from next steam.

264
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,100
And we just.

265
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,010
For example, get the use team.

266
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:18,300
We create a constant, we get the theme set theme from the US theme, and also we want to get the system

267
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,440
theme as well.

268
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:23,930
Okay.

269
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,440
So we should get an error here.

270
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,740
I want to show you the error so we get an error.

271
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,250
Lester.

272
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:46,720
As you can see, we get an error again saying contacts create contacts only works in client components,

273
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,000
so you cannot use any hooks inside the server side component.

274
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:56,290
So here we need to add the use client at the top.

275
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:00,670
So we convert this component to the.

276
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,790
And client side.

277
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,200
So now we change this one to the use client.

278
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,490
And we should get rid of this error for now.

279
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,840
As you can see, we don't get an error now.

280
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:24,600
So now we want to check the system thing first.

281
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,290
So we create a variable here.

282
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,170
We just say if the current thing.

283
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,240
So let me show you here how to do it.

284
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,760
Let me delete this one.

285
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,870
So we get the system team here.

286
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,840
And we want to create a constant.

287
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:51,080
We want to create a constant, and we call it current theme.

288
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:54,790
All right.

289
00:21:54,790 --> 00:22:01,180
So this one is going to be as we get suggestion from the co-pilot.

290
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,500
This one, if the theme is equal to system.

291
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,710
We want to use the system theme.

292
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:17,280
Otherwise you want to use the theme that we are sitting by clicking on these icons.

293
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:22,890
So first we get the theme using the US team.

294
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,820
This is going to give us dark light or system.

295
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:33,890
If it system, it is going to use the system, the system which can be dark or light.

296
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:38,570
Otherwise, we use the theme that is set by us.

297
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,640
So now here we just say current theme.

298
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,180
If the current thing is equal to dark.

299
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,810
We want to just close this.

300
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,610
So this is going to be conditional.

301
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:04,920
If this is one is dark, we want to see this icon.

302
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,090
If it's light, we want to see the other icon.

303
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,910
Okay, so let's see.

304
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,150
We should see only one icon now.

305
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,920
So let's refresh the page.

306
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,380
We are getting an error.

307
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,380
Okay.

308
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,450
I probably put too many.

309
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,170
I have to remove this equal sign here.

310
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,370
So let's refresh the page.

311
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:45,130
We see that we get we should see the light actually the moon icon now, because the my.

312
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,180
System team is the light mode.

313
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,720
I usually use a light mode and.

314
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,610
So now we are just seeing this icon.

315
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:56,720
All right.

316
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,430
But we want to change the the theme now.

317
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:09,220
So if we click on this light mode icon.

318
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,740
We want to change the theme to light.

319
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:17,300
If we click on the other one, we want to change it to dark.

320
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:29,270
So we added on Click here and this and click is going to call and set that theme.

321
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,370
This team is coming from here.

322
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:41,260
They use team and we want to set the theme to light.

323
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:49,440
We want to use the same things for the moon icon we added on click.

324
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,800
And we want to set the theme.

325
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,270
To dock.

326
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:08,490
Great.

327
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,780
Now, if we.

328
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:15,170
Go here now.

329
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,480
It's a moon icon if you click on it.

330
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,950
It's going to be.

331
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,940
The other icon.

332
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,690
And also the theme of our website is Change to Dark.

333
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:31,220
If you click again, comes back to the light mode

334
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:41,840
and the other things we need to do, I want to install this icons first, so I'm going to add a style,

335
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,870
but I want to add this style for both of them the same style.

336
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:53,630
So I'm going to add the cursors to both of them using alt and click and just add some class name.

337
00:25:54,290 --> 00:26:01,520
First thing first, I want to increase the size of the text to be x large the size of the icon.

338
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:08,570
I want to change the cursor to be pointer so we see a pointing hand when we hover over them and also

339
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,310
when we hover over them.

340
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:17,060
I want to change the color of the text to be amber 500.

341
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:26,060
So now the icons are bigger and when we hover over it, we see some.

342
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,500
Color change.

343
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:38,390
And the other things we need to do is the very important for when you are using dark or light mode.

344
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,880
Sometimes when you refresh the page, if the page is not mounted or didn't start, this font doesn't

345
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,510
work.

346
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,960
So for example, you change the page and then you click something quicker.

347
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,100
Sometimes it doesn't work and makes an error.

348
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:04,040
So the mounting means we want to complete this page to be rendered.

349
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:10,570
For example, if I this the dark mode when we refresh.

350
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,700
We see an error here.

351
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:22,900
You see that the UI does not match what was rendered on the server.

352
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,350
We get an hydration error.

353
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:33,720
This error is because the system is light mode and this is the dark mode.

354
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,630
When we refresh, it gets some conflict.

355
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:45,600
We say we want to use the system mode, but you already saved it like a dark.

356
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:53,710
But when we wait until the page completely loaded and then we change the light mode and dark mode,

357
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:58,030
we don't get an error because we already know.

358
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:04,570
The the mode of the website, especially when we are using next.

359
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,450
Yes, we have server side and client side.

360
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,890
In the client side we have, for example, light mode.

361
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:16,360
In the server side, we have dark mode and this is going to mismatch.

362
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:23,770
In order to prevent that, we need to first be sure that the page is mounted, It's loaded completely

363
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:28,450
and we we decide to be in the dark mode or light mode.

364
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:33,940
So I'm going to fix this one by just adding a user effect.

365
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,890
So here.

366
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,910
We can add a user fact.

367
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,500
Use.

368
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:49,990
The fact is going is come is coming from react and they use effect.

369
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,500
Is going to.

370
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,960
So sit.

371
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,920
The mounted.

372
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:12,580
To true when this one, you know, they use effect when the page load is weights completely page renders

373
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,150
one time and then set the mounted to true.

374
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,590
In this case we prevent using this.

375
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,850
Mode and other things.

376
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,960
So now we need to create this hook.

377
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,970
This piece of estate called mounted.

378
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,020
And first it's false.

379
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,700
And when the page is loaded, I think I added an extra.

380
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,930
So this one is for this one.

381
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,860
I think that's okay.

382
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:58,400
So when the page is completed rendered, we set the mounted to true, but first is false, and then

383
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,790
we're going to prevent using these things.

384
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:15,500
So I'm going to say, if the pages is mounted and it's true, then check the content team or other things.

385
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,940
So I'm going to put this one in a parenthesis.

386
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:29,460
Okay, Now this is going to check if the mountain is true, then then they're going to check the current

387
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,410
thing and put the light mode or dark mode.

388
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,360
So let's check it now.

389
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,990
So if we go here and we refresh the page.

390
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,430
So the error is used, state is not defined.

391
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,340
So we need to import user state from React.

392
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,010
So let's try again.

393
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:01,970
Okay.

394
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:05,540
Now it said seat mounted is not a function.

395
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,740
So let's.

396
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,470
Let's check what's what's the mistake?

397
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,440
So set, mounted.

398
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,700
Set.

399
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:20,680
Mounted.

400
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,170
You're getting this one here.

401
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,030
Now, it should be fine.

402
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,740
So let's refresh the page.

403
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,620
This maybe that's a previous error.

404
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:42,730
Said Martin is not a function that's a.

405
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:53,250
So we got the use of fact use state here.

406
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,430
We created this function set mounted.

407
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,550
We have mounted, set mounted.

408
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:07,190
And then we have used this set mounted here inside the use effect.

409
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:20,070
The problem is we have used the we should use the bracket here because we are creating a piece of state.

410
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:23,160
So let's bring this one.

411
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,120
When you're using user set, you need to use a bracket.

412
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:34,920
But when you are using, for example, we are getting the use theme, something we need to use a.

413
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,410
The curly braces.

414
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,060
All right, so now we shouldn't get an error here.

415
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,030
And as you can see, there is a delay.

416
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,160
Then we see the icon.

417
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:55,780
So when you refresh the page, we don't see the icon first and then the icons comes this time.

418
00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:03,580
It's safe to use it because it's already this page is mounted, so now we can use it safely.

419
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:08,170
So even in the dark mode, when we refresh the page, we don't get an error.

420
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,730
Because there is no mismatch.

421
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:16,040
And we are they are the page is rendered and we can get the data.

422
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:17,660
All right.

423
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,910
So now we have created this button.

424
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:26,180
Let's add some styles to our main div.

425
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,560
What I want to do.

426
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,200
I want to just have a style like a.

427
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,740
Dark or I want to change the background color.

428
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,530
I don't want it to be completely dark.

429
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,360
I want to use a gray color.

430
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:50,790
And also I want to have some dark and mode using tail and CSS.

431
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,920
So inside the.

432
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,780
Providers.

433
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:02,860
Let's close the unnecessary things so we can see what we have done.

434
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:15,790
So inside the providers that GSA, we have added this team provider, but we just directly put it inside,

435
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,060
put the children inside this.

436
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,960
I'm going to add a diff here.

437
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:27,570
And this div is going to cover these children.

438
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,600
And I'm going to add the Estelle to this.

439
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:34,410
So I'm going to add a class name to here.

440
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,550
I just want to say if there is a dark mode.

441
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,410
I want the background color to be gray.

442
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,750
700.

443
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:53,910
If there is a dark mode, I want the text to be gray.

444
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:56,500
200.

445
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,200
And also in the light mode.

446
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,070
I want the text to be gray 700.

447
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,260
I.

448
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:17,310
And also I want to have a transition when a light mode and dark mode happens.

449
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:28,470
So I want to have a transition on colors with the duration of the 300 milliseconds.

450
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:37,620
And and also I want the mean height of the screen to be.

451
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:49,980
When you use mean etch a screen, it means the minimum size of the screen to be 100% of the viewport

452
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,580
height.

453
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:58,650
So now if we check our website, we see all the screen is kind of gray.

454
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:04,320
And in the light mode is light in this mode is gray.

455
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,120
And also we have some transition.

456
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,000
It doesn't come suddenly change.

457
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:15,050
And also I don't want people be able to select this text.

458
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:18,860
This is very annoying, especially in the mobile size.

459
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:25,130
If you want to click on some button, this is going to be very annoying.

460
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:28,610
So I want to use a select.

461
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,580
None.

462
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,840
So nobody can select the text.

463
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,440
So now you can select it.

464
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,760
But now after the save, you can select the text.

465
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,800
So this is the things we have added here.

466
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:53,360
So that was it for the adding the dark mode in our website.

467
00:36:53,360 --> 00:37:01,250
So let's add this one to GitHub, but I didn't need to actually stop the server.

468
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:11,570
But you can use control shift G to open the source control and we click on this plus icon to add everything

469
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:16,280
to GitHub and we create a message for that one, which is.

470
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:26,400
At dark mode so we can click and commit and push and push it to get up.

471
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:32,830
So now if you go to GitHub and we come back.

472
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,740
And refresh the page.

473
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:38,920
We should see a new commit.

474
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,920
Ad dark mode.

475
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,410
So let's review what we have done.

476
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:47,010
It was a lot of work, So but it's very simple actually.

477
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:55,050
We have just a actually install a package called next teams, which is going to provide us with some

478
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,020
hooks and some theme providers.

479
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,160
And we have created a provider.

480
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,100
File, which is in client side.

481
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:12,970
Firstly, because we are using team provider which is using contacts like a hook.

482
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,420
And we have covered all our websites with team provider.

483
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,170
See.

484
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:30,000
So we put the children here and also we have added a div with adding the dark mode colors for all our

485
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,840
website.

486
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,330
And also we have added some transition.

487
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,890
So and also we have enabled systems.

488
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:43,920
So when the system is, for example, dark mode, the website is automatically be dark.

489
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:49,280
And we have added this one for the Taleban and CSS.

490
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:59,650
Inside the layer that gsx we have imported that provider, which is going to cover all our website,

491
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,110
including the header and the children.

492
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:13,770
And we have created a component called Dark Mode Switch, which is also in the client side because it's

493
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,410
using some hooks.

494
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:21,060
Like use steam and use state and also use effect.

495
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:29,760
So we have imported two icons from React, icons for the light mode and the dark mode, and we have

496
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,560
imported use team from next teams, which gives us system team.

497
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:44,250
And we can change the theme using set themes and get the system theme or our theme.

498
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:53,380
It depends on the hour choice, because if the theme is equal to system, we get the system theme.

499
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:57,080
Otherwise we get the theme that we have set.

500
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:03,200
And also we have used use of effect react hook.

501
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:04,990
To.

502
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:11,610
Apply and change the amount to true after the page is rendered.

503
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:19,300
To be sure that we don't have mismatch between the server side and the client side and we have added

504
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,290
a condition.

505
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:23,050
We just say if the mountain is true.

506
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:28,220
So when the page is rendered, then check the current theme.

507
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:36,110
If it's dark, show the light mode button, Otherwise show the moon icon.

508
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:44,630
So and then we have added an on click, which is going to change the theme by clicking on these icons.

509
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:54,370
We have also imported this dark switch mode component inside the header and we have added it.

510
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,360
Uh, next to the logo.

511
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:05,580
And inside the 12 Inconspicuous, we have added the dark mode, and we set it to be class.

512
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:06,860
All right.

513
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,680
So that was it for the dark mode section.

514
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,390
In the next section, we're going to create the about page for now.

515
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:19,310
When we click on the About, we get an error four or four error.

516
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,170
So let's refresh the page.

517
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,140
So I've stopped the server.

518
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:33,400
But I've shown you before, when we click on the about page, we get an error saying the page is not

519
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,300
existed.

520
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,210
So we're going to create this about page.

521
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:45,550
I'm going to show you how to put it under the app directory and how to create pages inside next.

522
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,020
JZ 30.

523
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:52,060
So see you in the next section for creating of the about page.
