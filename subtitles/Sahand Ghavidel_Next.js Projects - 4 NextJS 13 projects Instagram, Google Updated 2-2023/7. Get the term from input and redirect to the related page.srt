1
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,760
All right, in the last election, we have completed the.

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:18,770
For section of our project, in this section, we're going to get the information from the input and

3
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,920
movement to redirect the page to the related page.

4
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:33,840
So in order to do that, we need to use something called use router from Nick's router.

5
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,670
So inside the index that you use here?

6
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:52,110
The place that we have the former, the input at a top we at that used around her for the import use

7
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,930
throughout her.

8
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:56,850
From.

9
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,160
This is going to be from next forward slash route.

10
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:13,850
All right, so and then we can get the router here, so here, we just can't create a constant and we

11
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:19,490
just see a router and we call it to use router.

12
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,620
Simple as that.

13
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:31,190
But now, if you want to redirect a page to somewhere, we can just use a rather dark push and we will

14
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,420
be very direct to anywhere we like.

15
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:42,750
So because we want to redirect person to somewhere, we need to get that information here.

16
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,610
If you look at the final version here, it says hello and in there you are ill.

17
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,300
We have forest.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,110
Search, which is the which is the file we're going to create later.

19
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,590
This is a page inside the search.

20
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:09,470
We have another query called term and we call that term to hello.

21
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,870
But how we get this?

22
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,580
Uh, how do we get this?

23
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,150
Hello.

24
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:23,800
We can use something called use riff from React to get the information from the input.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,050
So inside the index that yes, we have the input here, we add something.

26
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,920
Called ref.

27
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,150
And we equal this referred to.

28
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,430
And then they just put the name for it.

29
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:54,270
The name would be in, for example, search inputs, riff and we're going to create this riff at the

30
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,720
top.

31
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:01,830
So here, just under this import, we're going to import use we have.

32
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,720
From.

33
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:10,830
React.

34
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,420
So this is just a built-in utility from React.

35
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,530
And then here we can just create that.

36
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,160
If you remember, we just called it the search.

37
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:34,510
Import tariffs, so we create this constant here, and this is going to be equal to use with.

38
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,560
And the default value would be no.

39
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,710
So if nobody write down anything in the input, their value is no.

40
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,340
But whatever you write down here, you can't get later.

41
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,850
And we want this when we write down here and press enter.

42
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:05,670
We want to submit this information and get it or when we click on this button, it doesn't matter in

43
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,150
the form.

44
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,900
If you add on, click to the button.

45
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,150
We can get the information off the input even by entering.

46
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,920
Yeah, press enter.

47
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:24,030
So inside the forum first button is a Google search, we added on Click here.

48
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:34,990
And this enclave is going to trigger a function and we called a function search.

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,980
And now we are getting an error saying search is not defined.

50
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,290
So we need to define this search by creating a function.

51
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,430
Just under this search input, ref, we create a function.

52
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:07,520
And we call it search as we be triggered under this, and this certainly is going to gives us something

53
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,940
called event.

54
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,010
For example, we want to.

55
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,960
Get the values or we want to prevent the refreshing of the page, we can use this event.

56
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,020
So first thing we need to do is just say.

57
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:29,540
And now before doing that, if we know clicked that Google search, they see that the page is refreshing

58
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,930
at the top, you can see the pages refresh.

59
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,560
In order to prevent this, we can use events.

60
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,180
Don't prevent default.

61
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:51,440
As simple as that, it can't prevent the fishing if it's not the sea that we don't see any refresh,

62
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,880
but actually the function is working, so we don't want to refresh the page.

63
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,580
We just want to change the URL.

64
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:10,390
So we can't get the term here in the input, just saying we can just turn is equal to death riff.

65
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,760
The search input ref dot current.

66
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,630
Don't value.

67
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:23,350
So this is everything inside input we can get and put it inside the term.

68
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:34,580
After defining the term, we can say if the term is not existed, just return.

69
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,270
So just if the term is not existed.

70
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,280
All right.

71
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,300
We just the.

72
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:49,950
Return in the function is great, is not going to work, so it's going to go outside that function.

73
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:57,210
Otherwise we're going to push to the that place, but this is actually now.

74
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,250
This one is not working, but if someone at a space.

75
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,890
This is going to this is not going to work.

76
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,390
All right.

77
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:19,370
So in order to prevent adding a space at the beginning, we can just add a method called terror trim

78
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:25,160
that is a building method from far from JavaScript.

79
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:32,360
So this is going to remove all this space before the thinks, even the person and a lot of space and

80
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,440
then write something.

81
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,770
This is going to remove all of the space.

82
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,880
All right, so.

83
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:48,180
And then if the term exists, if someone writes something, this is going to change the writer and mean

84
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,710
they redirect the page.

85
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:56,900
To solve it, so we just say rather that push and we're going to add.

86
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:07,410
Back to work to have a manual, so we just redirect a page to the the page search.

87
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,040
And just add the curry.

88
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:23,460
So we need to add a question mark, the quarry name is term and term is equal to.

89
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,470
This term that we're getting from the input here, so just a term.

90
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,400
So you know this.

91
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,870
This one's going to be yeah.

92
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,270
Dollar sign, yeah, so now we're getting to a variable term.

93
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,190
And also we want to trim it as well.

94
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,830
So you want to remove the S-based at the beginning of it?

95
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:47,440
No.

96
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,640
If you write down something, we click search.

97
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:59,020
We're going to redirect to the page, which is search term, is this one?

98
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,170
But this is because this the page search is not existed.

99
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,060
You're getting an error saying the page could could not be found.

100
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,630
That is, don't pay attention to this error.

101
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,800
We're going to create that this search page in the next section.

102
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,660
So now we just got successful to get the term.

103
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,430
And if we add only space, see only adding space.

104
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:32,290
This is not going to work, but even we add a space.

105
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,900
And then you write down something like, Hello.

106
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,700
The page would be only hello, we remove this base at the beginning.

107
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,090
So this is the functionality of the trip.

108
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,860
But that was it for the redirect thing.

109
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,540
Yeah.

110
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,240
Using rather.

111
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:06,030
Let's add everything to get home and review what we did, we just get at and we commence a new message

112
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:06,980
which is saying.

113
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,950
Because say.

114
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,330
Kids.

115
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,620
The town.

116
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,840
From input.

117
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,280
And I.

118
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,570
Directly related page.

119
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,020
It's related.

120
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,080
So we pushed to get off.

121
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,440
Let's see what we have done in refresh the page.

122
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,840
We have no new comments.

123
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:06,280
So that we just in the index that, yes, we added the user after and use where we create a function

124
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:18,850
to which is getting the information from the inputs, serving it first in a constant and we have a condition

125
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:28,270
if the term is not existed, we return and otherwise be pushed to the we push or we direct to the search

126
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,220
and we get the terms here.

127
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:41,250
And we got the information from the inputs using search input with using use actually and rename the

128
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,880
file search input the.

129
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:54,940
Yeah, that's it for the redirection and getting the turn in the next section, we're going to create

130
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,840
this header.

131
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,180
This header is different from the home page.

132
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,000
This is the home page header, but the page.

133
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:11,260
This search result, Heather, is different, so we have here.

134
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,950
An icon, a search bar again.

135
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:22,560
With the icons and the ability to delete this term.

136
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:30,870
And also, we we have this this signing, a sign off ability here as well.

137
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,320
And also we have some options, all or images.

138
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:41,870
All right, so in the next session, we're going to start with the header part of the results section.

139
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,240
So see you in the next section.
