WEBVTT
1
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.010
All right.

2
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:15.290
In the last six years, we have completed the life functionality, as you can see here in this section,

3
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.550
we're going to deploy our website to Verso.

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.960
And we're going to get a custom domain.

5
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.530
And at our website with that domain in there, solar as well.

6
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.800
So as you can see from the terminal, we're getting an error saying there's no secret.

7
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.780
This one was not.

8
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.310
But no problem.

9
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:47.260
Before when we were in the deployment, sorry in the deployment mode.

10
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.100
But.

11
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:56.560
For the production, we need to add the secret, and this is going to be very simple, we just need

12
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.580
to go to.

13
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:07.550
This file inside the AP API Pages API, off NICS, off that genius.

14
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.290
And just, uh.

15
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.680
And he for two pages, we add a secret.

16
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.450
We just write secret.

17
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.810
And this is going to be equal to a process that in the.

18
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.540
Because we want to add this fun to our environmental variable, so nobody can have access to our secret

19
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:43.430
and we just right sick bed, but in capital mode here I made a mistake to secrets.

20
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.450
All right.

21
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.950
And we had a.

22
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.250
Come out there.

23
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.030
So this is for this path.

24
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.720
But you go to our environmental variable.

25
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.630
And just at the end, you had a secret.

26
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.450
So we just tried secret, and this is going to be anything.

27
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.930
So can be a no can be a letter.

28
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.190
But the bigger is better.

29
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.910
So just try something random.

30
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.240
And we restore our server because we changed the environment or variable.

31
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.140
So the our website should work similarly with no problem.

32
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.790
So let's refresh the page.

33
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.310
So.

34
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.410
So that's fine.

35
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.200
It's working, it's signing of all the.

36
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.180
Yeah, everything's working normally.

37
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.120
We just need to go to.

38
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.490
They're salt and deploy our website.

39
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.070
So here.

40
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.410
We search for so.

41
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.150
And in the results section.

42
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.310
We're going to have to go to a website called Birdsell dot com.

43
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.080
Let's look in.

44
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.520
And we can't really recommend to log in with your guitar because we are going to be used guitar to get

45
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.220
the information and pass it to herself to easily deploy our website.

46
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.830
So we'll be signing with guitar.

47
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.040
Let me write down my name.

48
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.340
So.

49
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.980
This is going to authenticate you inside birther and here inside the vessel.

50
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.970
You just click on new project.

51
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:45.730
And you don't need to do anything you just here is showing it is showing you your recent repository.

52
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.320
And this is the Insta version for that.

53
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.760
You know, we did.

54
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.960
And.

55
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:07.850
So let's add, I get push again because we added the secret, but it didn't add it to our repository,

56
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.300
so we just create another command.

57
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.440
So at the secret.

58
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.980
And push it to get her.

59
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.130
So this should be fine.

60
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.640
Let's check that everything's OK.

61
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.830
So now we have twenty nine permits.

62
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.650
And the last one is at the secret.

63
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.880
So everything's fine.

64
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.250
You just go back to so and import this institution for.

65
00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.310
So we have instability and for.

66
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.930
So we import this.

67
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.460
So the name would be instead version four.

68
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.690
It's already detected, that is the next year.

69
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.160
The truth would be the same.

70
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:22.560
You don't change the setting in built and output, we just add the environmental variables, so we go

71
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.660
to environmental variables here.

72
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.750
And one by one, we should add these things.

73
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:34.830
So the name is Google Client I.D. You copy this pasted here.

74
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.590
At this.

75
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.190
Next one is the crew client secrets.

76
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.810
That's and pretty quickly.

77
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.510
So after this, you can.

78
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:18.470
Automatically create and reverse, automatically going to create your.

79
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:22.900
Application.

80
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.410
Let's do this one as well.

81
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.920
And this is from the one.

82
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:41.040
OK.

83
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.980
And this is the last line, which is the secret.

84
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.080
OK, so we added everything.

85
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.430
So one, uh, fine.

86
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.170
So let's try to deploy.

87
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.220
The deployment usually takes about one minute.

88
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.600
So at the same time, let's go to get our domain.

89
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:25.420
I put my domain in, I bought my domain in Google, so I searched for Google domain.

90
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.970
And I go to domains that Google dot com.

91
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.350
So I go to my own.

92
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:44.470
Not this account, this crunch.

93
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:47.790
OK.

94
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.350
As you can see, I have a domain name.

95
00:08:50.680 --> 00:09:01.450
Hundred year Project Scott and I go to DNS, so I'm going to add another website for it.

96
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.110
So here this phone, manage the records.

97
00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.050
So I'm going to add a new record and I call this one.

98
00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:16.390
Version four and the type would be a.

99
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.540
And this is the my first call.

100
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.890
I didn't call it the data.

101
00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.700
So or IPv4 address?

102
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:33.770
So this is going to be the same for me always, so I added this one.

103
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:35.840
All right.

104
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.920
So I saved this.

105
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.560
And I'm going to add this one too personal to.

106
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.990
So we are getting an error inside the phone, a deployment.

107
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:59.440
Missing a key in suggestions that she is.

108
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:07.710
Suggestion that, yes, so we've got two suggestions that, yes, you're in the map, we are missing

109
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:08.310
a key.

110
00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:09.950
So that's fine.

111
00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:10.850
We're going to add a.

112
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.270
So.

113
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.780
Here.

114
00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.180
So the key would be.

115
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.580
Inside this there and just the at the key.

116
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.720
And just a suggestion.

117
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:48.060
Dot I.D., because we are getting the idea here.

118
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.970
So this is going to be unique.

119
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:59.280
All right, so let's push this one to get up and try again,

120
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.440
get commit, and the message would be.

121
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.320
And the key.

122
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.190
Or suggestion?

123
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.510
Suggestions that yes.

124
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:27.870
And we push it to get up.

125
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.720
Let's check.

126
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:35.090
All right, so.

127
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.560
We try to do it again.

128
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.240
So we come back.

129
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:57.150
And if you go to the homepage, we can see that it's already added the ad to key for suggestions that

130
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.490
yes, to our application.

131
00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.170
Let's go to the application.

132
00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.850
So they said no deployment.

133
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.680
So let's.

134
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:19.310
Quote the deployments.

135
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.540
Both of them, they got an error.

136
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.450
See, what's the next area?

137
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.700
So we will redeploy it.

138
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.230
See what happens this stuff?

139
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:47.570
Should be fine.

140
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:58.810
So anytime you get a problem, you can see the functions and the logs, everything inside, if you have

141
00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:02.260
any problem in your deployment.

142
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.660
So we're getting another error.

143
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:21.310
So let's check the errors, so we go to a building and you can see that he failed to compile and the

144
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.080
error is missing key.

145
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:29.290
So another place in our codes, we didn't put the key, probably.

146
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:36.520
I feel like it should be inside the post that, yes, when we added the comment.

147
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.650
So in the comments section.

148
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:47.810
He created a map, but we didn't put the key, so anarchy here.

149
00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.800
So the key would be coming out.

150
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:54.990
That R&amp;D.

151
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.770
So, I mean, just the common.

152
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.680
But I do both because this is coming from a database.

153
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.610
We need to add data as well.

154
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:10.600
That's right.

155
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:16.140
So let's.

156
00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.010
Push this on to.

157
00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:27.300
So at key for hostages.

158
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:36.090
It pushed his one to get half.

159
00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.070
We go to homepage.

160
00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.200
So you refresh the so.

161
00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.550
If the new one came, let's go and check.

162
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.970
Or the.

163
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:05.060
There we go to deployment, it's still deploying, so we wait until it gets error or not.

164
00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:18.220
So you can see that these these ones after 20.

165
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:25.750
Something they got here, but this fund is still building, so this is going to be fine, probably.

166
00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.010
And uh, let's go inside this.

167
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.480
It shaped what's happening.

168
00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:34.650
Yeah.

169
00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.280
No error, fine, but we are getting some warning.

170
00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:46.350
For example, one warning is saying do not use IMG use image from next host flash image.

171
00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:54.480
This is not mandatory, but if you use like this, for example, in our posts that you use, your image

172
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.540
is going to be optimized.

173
00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:03.570
So it was successful and already deployed to our two.

174
00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:11.190
To this institution, Fort Worth, so death.

175
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:15.250
So we checked and.

176
00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:22.710
We are going to get an error because we haven't done the Google part yet.

177
00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:28.240
Because the let's let's signing and we see the error.

178
00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:34.310
As you can see, now, we're getting our authorization error.

179
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.100
They said this.

180
00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:43.740
Domain is not defined for callbacks, so we copy this one.

181
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:50.940
If you remember we were inside the Castle Dot Cloud Dot, Google dot com.

182
00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:58.500
We added the credentials and here if you sign in with your Gmail.

183
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:07.020
If you go to API services and credentials, you comes to this page.

184
00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:13.840
For the off 2.0 client ID, you need to edit this part.

185
00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:26.220
We added the local localhost three thousand, uh, here.

186
00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:33.460
For the redirect, but we didn't add our own website to the first one.

187
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:42.490
So, uh, for the redirect, we paste the link that we got on that.

188
00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:47.800
Well, you copy it and here this is going to be.

189
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.780
From our application sites.

190
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:56.560
We went here, we come back.

191
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.670
You go to this is one of the URLs.

192
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.570
We have too many Earth, actually.

193
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.620
Not one.

194
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.630
So we have.

195
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:11.670
Let's check.

196
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.210
Let's go.

197
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:17.430
Yeah, this is.

198
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:18.530
Yeah.

199
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:22.710
Two more you are we just at one of them, two of them?

200
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:32.720
So this is going to be OK with this part and the other one.

201
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:46.530
The origin is we should add the extra tubes at the beginning to sew the callback for this one, we can

202
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:47.370
fix it too.

203
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:52.020
So we go to this web site, this sign in.

204
00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:53.980
It Google.

205
00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:06.700
So you can in another areas, so we copy this code this year as well, we go back to this class and

206
00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.200
we add this one here as well.

207
00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:12.220
So we shouldn't get error from this web site now.

208
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:19.790
Yeah.

209
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:32.120
It's a space it's before that, so that's fine, we say this and we tested again, we go to our website,

210
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:33.350
we sign in.

211
00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:36.550
It Google.

212
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:39.880
Yeah, it brings us to the website.

213
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:42.830
Let's sign in with this account.

214
00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:44.820
Every sign in.

215
00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:52.470
That's everything's working nice and perfect, so let's add our custom domain.

216
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:53.640
So here.

217
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.430
We can add another.

218
00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:00.190
Domain two, so let me.

219
00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:07.810
Assigning domains here at the border, so we have no.

220
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:20.390
Some domains let's at go to the manage domains and be at our domain that we created this one Insta version

221
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:24.440
for a copy of this and we go to.

222
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.190
Here we added here.

223
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:44.000
Let you should wait a little bit to create the SSL certificate as well, but it should work now.

224
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:52.640
Usually it's very fast, so instead version four hundred projects that account this is the custom URL,

225
00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:58.220
but we should get an error for this one too, because we haven't had the credentials.

226
00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:01.860
So we copy this code.

227
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.110
This less your hour, you go to Google.

228
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.800
And we added here.

229
00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.600
What a callback is this one and this is going to be.

230
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:20.480
Yeah, you are a.

231
00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:22.010
All right.

232
00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:24.830
We save this and we shouldn't get any error now.

233
00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:28.590
And.

234
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.870
Was it here is?

235
00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.370
No doubt this one?

236
00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:43.260
I totally lost its closest people again to our websites we sign in.

237
00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:46.860
Signing with Google.

238
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:51.470
Now we can sign in with our.

239
00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:54.260
Jeff?

240
00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:55.660
All right.

241
00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.010
So it's working now.

242
00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.920
So this is the step for deployment.

243
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:07.900
And any change, any change you do in your website, in your code, you need.

244
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:14.530
You just need to commit it and push it to get as soon as you do that.

245
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.950
If you go to get half.

246
00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:28.480
As soon as you push, push it, reversal, automatically detect it and deploy it.

247
00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:34.930
You can see this deployment or not successful, but the last one was successful.

248
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:45.630
And you get a check here, green check, and also you get a comment here as well under the court's reversal.

249
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:55.230
But comments on your comments and just saying that successfully deployed in these web sites.

250
00:22:58.580 --> 00:22:58.940
All right.

251
00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.870
Yeah, that was it for our project, I hope you enjoyed.

252
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:11.880
I'm going to add more functionality to this website, like the ability to follow or unfollow someone

253
00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.400
or create it, create a.

254
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:22.440
I'm going to create some pages for each user name, and we're going to show all the posts related to

255
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.970
that person in that page.

256
00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:33.390
So this is going to be very soon, just spare in your mind and check the course again and wait for the

257
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:34.020
updates.

258
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.940
So see you again in another project.
