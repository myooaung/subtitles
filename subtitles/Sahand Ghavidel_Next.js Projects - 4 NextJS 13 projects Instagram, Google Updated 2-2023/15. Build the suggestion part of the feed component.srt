1
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:14,530
All right, in the last section, we have created the mini profile section of the FT that J.S..

2
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,500
In this section, we're going to create this suggestion area.

3
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:27,930
If you look at the final version of the project, it can see that the suggestion area has a few parts

4
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,700
resume a little bit.

5
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,490
And we can see that.

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:43,880
We have a part at a time that's just a suggestion for you, and there is a bottom and the riots saying

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,220
seal, then we have.

8
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,530
And in other parts.

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,930
Which has.

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,250
Few sections first is just a profile.

11
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,510
Image, then we have the username.

12
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:13,640
Yeah, we're going to create using minifigure package and also we're going to create these job titles

13
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,380
using minifigure as well.

14
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,060
And finally, we have.

15
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,400
A follow button at the right side.

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,430
OK, let's go back to our visual studio code.

17
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,940
And first, we create the component.

18
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,370
With the name of suggestion.

19
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,920
So this is our website.

20
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,340
So we close the mini for fall of that year and the head of the chief.

21
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,070
Inside the feed that yes, we need to at the suggestion.

22
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,440
Suggestion part.

23
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:08,140
So we go to the components and we create a new component called a suggestion or suggestions.

24
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,800
But yes.

25
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,480
And then we create a.

26
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,410
React functional component using RF C.

27
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,810
We can delete this import, react from react and inside a return part.

28
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:40,590
It create another div that covers the suggestion for you part.

29
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:49,850
Before continuing on this suggestion that, yes, we need to import suggestions that as to this year,

30
00:02:50,510 --> 00:03:01,850
so we create an attack here suggestion and the use counter space to auto import this component.

31
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,200
All right.

32
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:13,610
So we go back to suggestions that, yes, and here you create the Etch three with a hardcoded same suggestion

33
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,130
for you.

34
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,670
We can see here after that, we have a button.

35
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,790
Saying.

36
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,850
See are.

37
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,930
Well, just this.

38
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,220
Yeah.

39
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,280
So let's say a little bit, establish fun.

40
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,530
So let's make it flex, so we bring everything next to each other.

41
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,660
And we used just the fight between to have a space between the two elements.

42
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,180
We push them to.

43
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:10,060
Each side of the place and then at some margin button.

44
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,580
In Button of the five.

45
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,570
So we can add that.

46
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,490
The next part.

47
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,120
And also, we make the text the size of the tanks.

48
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,320
To be a small.

49
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:37,080
So the next one is just the let's establish its three part.

50
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,550
We make it.

51
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:55,140
Bowled by using font balls, the next thing is just to change the color of the text to gray.

52
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,790
Four hundred.

53
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,500
And for the bottom, we just need to.

54
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,740
Have we changed the text color to?

55
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,750
I think this color gray would be fine.

56
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,070
The gray 600 and we changed the boldness of the font.

57
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:32,000
To symbols, so we just say found a semi bolt.

58
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,280
All right.

59
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:43,530
We need a little more space at the left, so at the top level here because we want everything to have

60
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,940
the same amount of space around there.

61
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,950
So we just imagine top of four.

62
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,540
So they push it a little bit down, and we use the margin lift of 10.

63
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:05,640
Now, everything is aligned nicely, so we need to go to the next part, which is here.

64
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,500
Creating our suggestion section.

65
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:21,110
So in order to have these things, we need to first install the many fake hair, but we have already

66
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,940
installed for this story's part.

67
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,470
If you remember false stories, we used many fake as well.

68
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,680
We just need to import minifigure here.

69
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,820
All right.

70
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,460
We just write down in port.

71
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,830
M.F.A..

72
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,380
From Faker.

73
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,530
So here.

74
00:06:50,040 --> 00:07:00,750
Just before they return, we create a state and we call it suggestions and we just say sit suggestion.

75
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,300
And we call it to use the state.

76
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,080
We import use the states using the space.

77
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,350
Before getting the auto suggestion, we can see it here at the top.

78
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:27,470
And the initial value of this stage would be an empty array and after that we use.

79
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:42,220
Use effect to fetch data from the, uh, from the minifigure.

80
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:50,820
As soon as the page is loaded, so first we put to use effect as well, and we.

81
00:07:52,330 --> 00:08:02,920
Creative callback function and in scientist function, we create the constant color suggestions and

82
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,240
the equal suggestion to minifigure.

83
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:14,740
I think you are already familiar with these things because we have done this one before for this story's

84
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,160
part.

85
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,210
So in order, we want to create five.

86
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:28,850
A profile, so we need to just use array and amount of area is fine.

87
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,190
And after that, we get the number of index.

88
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,350
So here we can see it now.

89
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:46,120
We used minifigures era to create five array and we get the index of AI for each of them.

90
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,400
Then we return.

91
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,270
And object here.

92
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:02,150
The object includes username, which is equal to a mini faker.

93
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:11,130
Dot username, the username is a function internal function of fake package.

94
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:23,530
And, uh, as I mentioned before, we need to specify to the language that we want the user name to

95
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:28,840
be, we use the locale of English.

96
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:39,290
And also, we want to use a name to be lowercase, so we just say to lower.

97
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:48,380
Case, and we need to open a set of parenthesis because the function the next one is.

98
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,490
Job title.

99
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,000
And the job title will be equal to.

100
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,340
You can't see that I'm getting the suggestions from Tap Nine.

101
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,380
But the job site doesn't have any local.

102
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,570
Look.

103
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,850
And uh, yeah, that's it.

104
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:22,110
We're using a job title function of the minifigure to get the job title.

105
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:29,730
And also we want the idea which is equal to AI, which is this AI is coming from here.

106
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:40,970
And finally, after these things, we set this suggestion to it, this suggestion constant.

107
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,030
So we feel this state.

108
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,360
OK.

109
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,070
Let's console.log.

110
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,440
So just see the result.

111
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,000
It's a fresh page.

112
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:16,650
We're getting an error of saying fail to process, A. L., A. Unreachable, McCaw.

113
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,450
An object letter is invalid.

114
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:37,960
We made a mistake here, and we need to put a clone here to fix this fire and refresh.

115
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,600
Beginning another era, they're saying that

116
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,680
failed.

117
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:48,990
Yeah, that's fine.

118
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,490
So let's open the.

119
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,070
Dev tools and console using F12.

120
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:10,140
Now we're getting an array of five here that has the user name, job title and I.D. Yeah, everything

121
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,950
looks fine.

122
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:18,740
So we just need to look through this array to to show them here.

123
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,910
So in after this.

124
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:31,360
There, which is for this part, we create.

125
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,940
We look through the suggestion.

126
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,990
And we just the suggestion that map and we get each suggestion.

127
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,440
And we return it.

128
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:03,660
We create a tiff here, and in cientista, we just need to get an image.

129
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:16,720
Image tag and S4C would be, uh, if you remember we were using before the PR avatar in the story that

130
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,350
as here for the image.

131
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,450
So are you going to use the same thing?

132
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,950
So I copy this.

133
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,420
Code.

134
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,970
And bring it here, but I explain you for your.

135
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,770
For your review, you just saying.

136
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,220
So the.

137
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,900
So, yeah.

138
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,790
This phone book.

139
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:55,950
Yeah, we have the basic URL, which is here.

140
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:04,350
PR Avatar does CC and Dennis four in front of the IMT, we put.

141
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:12,750
A random number between one and 70, because this website only offers 70 images.

142
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:22,160
So we are getting randomly five images from these 70 images, so now we're getting these images here,

143
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,120
but there are huge.

144
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:31,130
So we are going to install it soon, so after this image.

145
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:38,720
But first, let's make it a smaller so we can see the next parts better.

146
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:47,130
So we have a class name here and the size of the image, the height would be 10.

147
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,620
We make it circle by using round full.

148
00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:00,140
We add a border and we add a padding of.

149
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,790
Two pixels between the border and the picture.

150
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,670
And this is similar to this image, but besides is a smaller.

151
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:24,810
After this image, we have another div that covers both the user name and the job title.

152
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,460
So for the username, we use it to tag.

153
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:36,340
And we put the suggestion.

154
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,870
Dot.

155
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,040
User name.

156
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:55,620
So if you remember, we created this username here inside this suggestions, but we are getting each

157
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,140
of the suggestion here using math.

158
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:03,810
So now you're getting the user names as well after the user name.

159
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:08,910
We use each three tag to get the job title.

160
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:15,420
So it's a suggestion dot job title.

161
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:17,960
OK.

162
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:26,400
Let's solve this one as well, so we bring them next to each other using Flex.

163
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,260
No, actually, we don't want them to be next to each other.

164
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,770
We want these two to be next to each other, so we use the Flex at the top.

165
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:53,990
All right, and then let's bring them to this center using eye test center.

166
00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:01,380
This is for horizontal and vertical level, then we use.

167
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:08,450
Justify between to push everything to the other side.

168
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,030
And we have a margin of three.

169
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,260
But we want this to be next to the image.

170
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:32,010
That's why we use Flex one here to occupy the place from here.

171
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,180
And after that, the ad a marching left off for.

172
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,490
For H2, we at.

173
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,660
The class name.

174
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,230
Uh.

175
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,820
We just want it to be semi semi bold.

176
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,740
And also the caller.

177
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:08,990
The color is OK, we just, uh, yeah, make it the Texas small.

178
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:12,570
OK.

179
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,180
For the job title.

180
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,150
I'm getting a lot of suggestions from top nine, but some of them, OK, yeah, we keep the text, Greg.

181
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,000
Four hundred make it great, but I don't want to be.

182
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,580
I don't want it to be bold.

183
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,070
We just make the text as small as four.

184
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,110
And in case someone

185
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,190
has a big job title, we truncated.

186
00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:06,650
And we we maximum width of this part, I want it to be 230 pixels, so it would be around here.

187
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,490
So after this day, we have.

188
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,220
The bottom that's saying follow.

189
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,360
So here we just say follow.

190
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,520
And let's establish and make it blue.

191
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:40,830
So the font is semi bold and the text color is blue.

192
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:43,860
Four hundred.

193
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,120
And make the Texas moral as well, so.

194
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,530
OK, that's one looks fine.

195
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:06,110
No, each time you refresh the page, you're getting a new username, new job title and new image.

196
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:07,930
And here.

197
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,720
So in the quote, we just don't need the.

198
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,850
Console.log anymore.

199
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:36,920
And let's push it to get her using get at and get command for putting a message, and the message would

200
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,740
be build.

201
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,940
This suggestion, part of the.

202
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,350
After each component.

203
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,870
And we push it to.

204
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:04,870
Get her.

205
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:11,910
Now let's review the code, and but we have done here, we refresh the page.

206
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,780
And this this is going to be the last commit, which is build this suggestion.

207
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,250
Part of the faith component.

208
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,640
So in feta cheese, we added this suggestion here, and we import it there.

209
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,470
And in suggesting that the imported.

210
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:43,010
We have imported the minifigure, the minifigure, local use, the state and use effect, and we made

211
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,560
a state here called suggestion and used.

212
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,480
Use the fact to.

213
00:21:54,260 --> 00:22:02,080
To call the M.F.A. package and create five profile.

214
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,480
User name and job title.

215
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:17,670
And finally, we set to this this suggestion is stay with the constant suggestion and then we return.

216
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,040
And we map through this suggestion array.

217
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:31,110
And we got the image from the P PR amateur website, we create a random number for each image.

218
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:38,940
And finally, we we put the user name and the job title inside the issue and industry.

219
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,820
Yet that was it for this part.

220
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:51,650
In the next section, we're going to start with the authentication, and I'm going to introduce you

221
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:57,080
to and next off, so see on the next section.
