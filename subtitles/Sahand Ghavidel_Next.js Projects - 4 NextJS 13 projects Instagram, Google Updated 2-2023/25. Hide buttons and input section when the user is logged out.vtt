1
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.550
All right, in the last section, we have completed the food section.

2
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.710
We've got the data from the database.

3
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.520
We showed it here in the main page.

4
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.730
In this section, we're going to hide these buttons.

5
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.440
Let me show you here.

6
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.480
So are you going to hide this part?

7
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.150
And also the input section.

8
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.660
The other things I want to do is to add a rather.

9
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:51.340
So when we click on this icon and also the home icon here, which you can see you're not, you cannot

10
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.860
see in the mobile size.

11
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.460
And when you click on them, you want to go to the homepage.

12
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.370
So if you're using something called use router from next rather to do so.

13
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.850
So, uh, the other thing.

14
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:16.390
So I would like to say I added a dependency here for I forgot the last video to add the dependency for

15
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:26.250
the use fee, and it was requesting every second to the post and I didn't know that.

16
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.510
So if you check here.

17
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.370
The usage.

18
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:43.060
You can see that every hour we were requesting like a 20 K.

19
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:53.540
So it was if you don't do the dependency, so every fuse, every second or even less than the second

20
00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:04.940
you get requested database and and Firebase database is free until 50000 over 50000 a day.

21
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:12.710
You have to pay, so bear in debt, bear in your mind that you don't forget the dependency and quickly

22
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.380
added before you finish your three.

23
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.540
And read line here.

24
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.080
OK, so let's.

25
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.900
Let's continue with our.

26
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.120
VIDEO and the hide this from in order to hide these sections.

27
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:47.800
We need to get this session, so we need to know if the person is logged and or not, if the person

28
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.940
is log out.

29
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.620
We need to hide this section so we go to.

30
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.190
Feet.

31
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:04.870
Uh, we need to go to the feed section and actually we need to go to the post 30th because everything

32
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.760
here is inside post touches and inside the post touches.

33
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:18.730
We have few pots, we have post buttons, which is here and post comments and also post inbox.

34
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.380
So we're going to hide to pass this part and this part.

35
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.180
So first, let's bring the use session.

36
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.890
So we import.

37
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.750
Use session.

38
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.760
And this is going to be from next.

39
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.020
Off.

40
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.940
Forward slash reacts.

41
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.080
Also, where are you going to get this session here at the top?

42
00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:04.270
So we create a constant and we will get the data from the U.S. and we call the data session and we equally

43
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.100
this to use session.

44
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.740
All right.

45
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:21.460
Now we can use this session and we create a ternary operator to hide that, but then section, for example,

46
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.610
first, so first we open.

47
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.870
It could set up curly braces at JavaScript here.

48
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.330
So we say if this session exists there.

49
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.350
You show this spot and we just bring everything inside the parenthesis.

50
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.890
You can do the same things.

51
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.990
That's the depression check.

52
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.270
So now we can we can see the buttons, but then we find out.

53
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.960
The important section is hidden, so let's hide this comment section as well.

54
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.250
The important part?

55
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.580
So here we at session.

56
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:27.480
Use the ternary operator and and sign, so the book should exist if the first one is false and the compiler

57
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.230
are not going to check the second part.

58
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.360
This is the and.

59
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.860
Logic, so we go up and we bring this one, too.

60
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.070
So now we only see the comment section.

61
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:59.170
Also, we want to add the writer for the home button and also this icon and also this Instagram icon.

62
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:07.150
So we go to header that takes the place that these things are existed.

63
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.410
So if you go to that and we import.

64
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.500
And a top import.

65
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:20.330
Use.

66
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.470
Rather.

67
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.730
From next.

68
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.660
Forward slash route.

69
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:46.160
And then here it create a constant and we call it the root or, as English people say, the router.

70
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.550
So.

71
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:58.000
The American accent is rather so Konst rather is equal to use user after.

72
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.900
And we just need to use this one and add and click on the image.

73
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.680
And the other thing so we have two images at the beginning.

74
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:18.650
So here we added unclear, and the enclave is going to be a function that.

75
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:27.220
Called the router, and it's going to bring us to the homepage.

76
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.130
So let's add the same things for.

77
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.560
The other image.

78
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.750
Because we have two images, one here and one in here.

79
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.220
And also, let's add this the same things for the.

80
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.410
Home button here, home icon.

81
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.910
So we paste this one here as well.

82
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.130
So let's test this.

83
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.850
So we go to another page like signing page.

84
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.710
And we click on the home page.

85
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.910
Said the rather is not a function.

86
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.040
Yeah, that's true.

87
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:18.490
I forgot to add the router, and we're using a method called push, actually.

88
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.590
So it's a rather dark push.

89
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:26.850
So we fix this one here and here.

90
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.230
So now it should work.

91
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.330
So now we went to the home page by clicking here.

92
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.910
Let's go back to the signing page and we test this icon as well.

93
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:49.970
Yeah, it's working and we don't see the buttons and the input box that's signing and check if we can

94
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:55.490
see the icons again, that's signing with this email.

95
00:08:59.440 --> 00:08:59.780
Yeah.

96
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.010
Now you can see the portents and also the.

97
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:12.800
The comment section in the next section, we're going to add the functionality that when we write down

98
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:21.710
in the comments section something it goes to the database so we can save these comments and show them

99
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:22.250
at a top.

100
00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:35.340
So let's first the and everything to get her, so we'll just take it, and I will comment that.

101
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.810
And the message would be.

102
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:47.240
Hi button's and come inputs.

103
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:51.720
Sections.

104
00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:54.310
When?

105
00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.650
The user is locked.

106
00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:03.160
Oh.

107
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.210
And we push it to get high.

108
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:17.710
And let's review the code that we have written.

109
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.790
It's here and refresh the page first to see all the comments.

110
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:27.050
Now we have 24 comments and we click on the Yes Sir.

111
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.800
Yet comments by showing Mr.

112
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.150
So let's check.

113
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.130
Let's try it again.

114
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:49.540
I think.

115
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.680
Some problem here.

116
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.780
So the problem is.

117
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.080
Oh, I forgot to add the.

118
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:12.450
And here.

119
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:18.210
So the message, the comment, the message would be this.

120
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.600
No, we can't do.

121
00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:25.120
OK.

122
00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.910
Let's refresh the page.

123
00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:39.670
Yes, 30 seconds ago, we got and you commit, as you can see, we just added the router.

124
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:42.350
Use it out there.

125
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:51.130
For the home page and to icons, and we hide two parts.

126
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.430
From the post that yes.

127
00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:04.820
We used to use Session to get this session, and then we used ternary operator to hide the.

128
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.050
Buttons and also the input part.

129
00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:19.550
So in the next section, we're going to add this functionality, which gives us the ability to send

130
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:26.360
the comments sections data from this input to the database, so see in the next section.
