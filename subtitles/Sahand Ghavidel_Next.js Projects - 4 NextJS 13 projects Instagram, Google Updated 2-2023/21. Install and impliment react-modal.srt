1
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,430
All right.

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:19,580
In the last six year, we have implemented recoil and we created a component called upload model.

3
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:31,640
And here we could achieve the let me increase the size you could achieve to the state, a global state

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,480
by clicking on the plus circle icon.

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:41,180
You can see that the model is open in this section we're going to create.

6
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:51,870
The model completely using a package called React model, if you look at the final version of the project.

7
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,000
Here.

8
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,610
You can see when we click on the.

9
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:12,780
As Circle Icon, the plus circle icon, we can see that the model is open and we have a blurry background.

10
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:22,730
And also when we click on the other side, except it the model, the model will be close.

11
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:31,970
So we're going to call this state by clicking here and the other side, except for the model itself.

12
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:41,600
First, let us search for a React model.

13
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,940
If you search, just react the model.

14
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:55,140
We can't seem to resolve section, we have an Olympian package called the React model.

15
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,880
So if you click here.

16
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:11,210
We can see that the installation process is like this, we just need to install, save, react more

17
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:20,970
or if you're using your, you can use your Act React model, and the examples are very easy.

18
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:27,140
You just need to have this model component in portrait.

19
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:33,440
And inside this model, you're going to have all your codes or everything inside the model.

20
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:45,030
For opening, he used this attribute is model and for closing the use on request close.

21
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,740
So let's do this one, let's install it first, we copy this command.

22
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,550
Here they come in.

23
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,430
We copy it.

24
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:05,580
We go back to Visual Studio Code, the stop the server using Contra See and we place the command.

25
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:14,480
It's a very light price package is going to install very fast.

26
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,280
And no, we can't add the model.

27
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,610
The React model at the top of our.

28
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:34,080
Upload model, duchess component, we just here say import.

29
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,280
React moral.

30
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,590
No, sorry.

31
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,020
Uh.

32
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:52,300
You just say import model from React.

33
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,030
Moral.

34
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,200
And this is all lower case, but this is upper case.

35
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,880
And instead of having just this one upload model or.

36
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,830
Here we delete this section.

37
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,950
We don't need this.

38
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,400
But when it is open, we want to have the model.

39
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:26,060
So you make a parenthesis and inside the parentheses, we add the model component, which is coming

40
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,080
from React model.

41
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,960
So because attack, we.

42
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,910
And inside this, you're going to have the things we need.

43
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:51,020
So here, let's first add just the H1 Singh model, and as I mentioned before, we have some, uh,

44
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,280
props sorry attributes here.

45
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,400
The first one is is open.

46
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,770
So it's going to stay open it.

47
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,350
But how do we know that is open?

48
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,670
We're going to use this stayed open here.

49
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,700
So this is open, is equal to open.

50
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,590
So when the open is true, the model is going to open.

51
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,150
I think we can see it now.

52
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,320
MP and run there and we check our application.

53
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,050
I hope you can see it.

54
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,700
That's refresh the page.

55
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,210
All right.

56
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,500
I think.

57
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,520
Yes, still.

58
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,310
Refreshing, yeah, that is fine now.

59
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,540
So let's click on here now we can see the model in the middle.

60
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,300
But if you click on the outside, you still model is open.

61
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:16,980
So let's add that under on request clause and the request clause is going to.

62
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:24,570
Trigger a function which changed to sit open.

63
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,950
To floss.

64
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,440
So now when we click outside the model, we should close this.

65
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:37,930
Well, as you can see now, we opened a model, we closed it by clicking outside.

66
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,630
You can see it better here.

67
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:49,660
This size, we're going to fix it by using Tillmans, yes, but the functionality spoke.

68
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,400
So let's.

69
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,500
Change this model, a style.

70
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:10,710
To make it a little bit small when we have a just we just see Max with to be large.

71
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,850
So in the big size, we want it to be like that.

72
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:25,200
And also if the mobile size, let's make the width to be 90 percent of the width.

73
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:34,650
And let's at a height of 300 pixels or now because we don't have any content.

74
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,160
OK.

75
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,140
Still cannot see it properly.

76
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,860
Yeah, we can see it here, but let's position it exactly in the center.

77
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,210
So.

78
00:07:53,170 --> 00:08:04,690
Uh, we can use the position in absolute and we just say top fifty six and left.

79
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:13,970
And left just say 50 percent, but actually 50 percent.

80
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,280
It's bringing the edge to the.

81
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,340
Centre.

82
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,300
We want it to be exactly in the centre, so we're going to use trance.

83
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,040
Translate X.

84
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,850
Of minus 50 percent.

85
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,380
If you're familiar with the thesis.

86
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:47,990
So when we position left 50 percent, if this is a box at the edge of the box, we'll be in the center

87
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:53,840
and then we use Translate X to bring the exact centre of the box.

88
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,670
So that's should be fine.

89
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,960
Let's change the background to be white so we can see it nicely.

90
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,750
No, you can't see it, but it doesn't have a border yet.

91
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,240
So let's add some borders so we can see it even better.

92
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,660
So we add a border to.

93
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,720
All right, Ceci, nicely.

94
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,990
And let's make it rounded.

95
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:40,520
Just the I think medium would be fine, run the media, and let's add some shadow so we can see it better

96
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,140
as well.

97
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,410
We just wish media to.

98
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,900
Okay, so we have the model here now.

99
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:56,780
When we click our sites close, when we have a bigger size, it's this much.

100
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,720
Because we set the max with to be large.

101
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,400
And it's almost in the center.

102
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,070
All right.

103
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:18,130
So that's fine for this part, and we had this model as well.

104
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:27,850
Uh, let's cover this model with the deer so we can bring this model to the center.

105
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:40,930
So we we just change the display to Flex and makes the Flex column and for bringing it to the center,

106
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,470
we can justify center.

107
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,210
And this is for.

108
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,420
And then we just say items sent to.

109
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:03,750
So these to bring them to the center both vertically and horizontally.

110
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,500
But because we don't, we didn't make the heights within a set.

111
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:13,740
The high so did not come to the center this way vertically.

112
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,840
So we just say hi to 100 percent.

113
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,420
So.

114
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,920
This is going to bring everything to the center.

115
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,480
So now we just have a basic model.

116
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,090
For our website.

117
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:40,740
And it was very easy to implement if you want to really make with make it with JavaScript, it's going

118
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,610
to be very hard.

119
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:47,790
But with the React model package implemented, everything easy.

120
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,540
So let's push everything to get up.

121
00:11:55,010 --> 00:12:06,170
We just take it and get command of it, the message of change, so.

122
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:09,750
And.

123
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,290
Plan.

124
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,400
Implement reacts.

125
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,530
More.

126
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:34,560
OK, so we push it to get up using Kit Push, let's check to what we have done.

127
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,180
We review our code.

128
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:42,960
We just refresh the page and go to the last comment by clicking on this.

129
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,810
14 seconds ago.

130
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,460
As you can see, we just installed the React model first.

131
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:59,040
And then we import it and the covered everything with the more moral component.

132
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,230
And the U.S.

133
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,630
Is open and honest.

134
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,810
Quest closed for opening and closing their model.

135
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:15,560
And we just center it using this as well, so.

136
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:27,020
In the next section, we're going to complete the model part by adding this icon, the input and the

137
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,280
this button.

138
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,260
So see in the next section for this part.
