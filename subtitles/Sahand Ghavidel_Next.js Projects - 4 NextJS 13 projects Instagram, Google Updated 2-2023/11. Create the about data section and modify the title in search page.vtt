1
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.530
All right, in the last section, we have completed the ability to get the information from the Google

2
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.190
API.

3
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:28.450
We got the information based on the URL to our website and we got to the data in our council and the

4
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:36.790
market impacted to it to not consume the the API requests.

5
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.590
As you can see, now, we have the data in our console in this section we are going to create.

6
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.650
About 60, and as you can see here in the final build.

7
00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:01.450
So are we going to get two informations, one is the the number of results and also the the the amount

8
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.420
of time that takes to get there is off.

9
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.430
So if you look at the hour, the council.

10
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:24.600
In the if you open to this object inside, we have something called search information and enter in

11
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.830
the search information, we have 46.

12
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.310
We have this search time, total total results.

13
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.490
And also we have formatted search time and formatted total results.

14
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.410
The difference between them is this one, it's the total, the time.

15
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:54.880
But this is the rounded to two digits and the two digits here and the formatted result.

16
00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.790
Instead of just writing the numbers, it has some comma to make it more readable.

17
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.900
So we're going to get we're going to use these two informations.

18
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.740
To to show it in our website.

19
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.070
So let's go back to visual studio code and inside the search that yes.

20
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.040
So we completed the search in the search results.

21
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.820
We're going to create another component and recall this search

22
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.570
results.

23
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:45.120
And let's create this component inside this components folder, so search.

24
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:56.380
And insults Dutch, yes, and we create react functional components using RC.

25
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.970
And let's import it inside the.

26
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.060
That's close to unnecessary files and inside the search, the duchess, we import the file.

27
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.490
Using conference space.

28
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.030
OK, now we should see the search results here.

29
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.710
Now here.

30
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.870
Insert inside this, dear.

31
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:34.010
We're going to create a paragraph and we just, uh, say about.

32
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.460
You can see that about.

33
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.800
And then if you want to get the results, the result is coming from the.

34
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:55.350
The props, but we didn't pass it the f, so inside the search such that, yes, we got the results

35
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.770
here.

36
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:05.160
So we're going to pass it as a props to this component, so here we just see a result.

37
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.710
Results is equal to results.

38
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.410
Now we can get it inside the search results as a prop to.

39
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.030
So I would just say about and be open a parenthesis.

40
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.690
So we open a set of curly braces to write some JavaScript here.

41
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.330
Let's refresh the page, you see the result.

42
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.300
So here we just say results.

43
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.670
Dot.

44
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.540
Search information.

45
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.520
Dot formatted.

46
00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.250
Total results, total results.

47
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.110
So this is coming from here.

48
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.120
The you open the object in a search information.

49
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.650
We've got this formatted total resorts.

50
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:24.990
So now we can see it here, about five thousand eight hundred forty.

51
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:32.580
Then this is after this we have results are quoted results.

52
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.170
And inside the fantasies, we want to show the.

53
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.240
Then the second.

54
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:51.820
So here I will show you a trick how to be get this instead of writing all of them, we can just if you

55
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.980
want this fun, we can right click on it.

56
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.280
And we just copy property past.

57
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.430
I think this fight is going to paste everything we don't need to Typekit.

58
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.460
We just at the results at the beginning.

59
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.650
So now we got to this forty four and then the.

60
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.410
We just say seconds.

61
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.420
OK, that is fine.

62
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.890
No.

63
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.320
And let's style it a little bit.

64
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.170
So for styling, we just need to.

65
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:41.900
For the paragraph we had, for example, we changed the color just to text gray instead of black.

66
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.290
We want it to be gray, but OK, this color six hundred.

67
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.990
And then we want it to be a smaller so we just takes a small.

68
00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.210
Then we had a marching pattern of five.

69
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.050
So we the result will be a little bit down here.

70
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:13.860
We have a space and marching top of three and then we don't want it to just connect to the wall.

71
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:22.440
So we're going to create it like the one we have in the final version and the final version.

72
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.610
Just pay attention to this one.

73
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.020
So when we see that here.

74
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:44.870
We have, uh, different types of formatting here, isn't it like this much space and then we have more

75
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.940
space and finally in the largest screen vehicle here?

76
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:59.110
So let's fix this one based on that.

77
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.720
So in the day, he had a class name.

78
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.510
First, we bring them in the center.

79
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:15.820
But just same with food and then or auto.

80
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:26.710
We use this one, but in order to apply, we need to add some other things, like the padding in the

81
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.420
x axis of three.

82
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.820
Now we have this much space.

83
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:34.620
All right.

84
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:44.620
But in the bigger than the mobile sites like a small, we want the padding left.

85
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.490
To be, for example, five percent.

86
00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:01.550
So now, if we had a little bit more than mobile science, we should see more space.

87
00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:02.450
Yeah.

88
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:16.240
Can we have the in the medium sized and above we have a padding left of 14 percent instead.

89
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.600
So let's see, after the media, we see this much space.

90
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:36.300
And finally, in the large screen, we have padding left of 50 to.

91
00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.070
So this is similar to the one here.

92
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.380
So it's going to.

93
00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.480
Connect to this place and.

94
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:51.740
Similar to here.

95
00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:57.140
So in the larger screen, we have like this.

96
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:07.540
And this is going to get us the result, because the result is going to be inside this diff.

97
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:14.790
So after this paragraph, so actually we designed our results section as well.

98
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:23.430
So let's add in other things I wanted to you wanted this title to be dynamic, first of all.

99
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.890
So here.

100
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:32.630
Instead of just saying search page, I want to get the term I should at a time.

101
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.340
So now we have just search page, so we don't want this.

102
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.670
Let's bring the router so we can get the term.

103
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:52.040
Inside a client side, so we just say use water from next forest slash router.

104
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.530
And this is should be import.

105
00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:13.780
And then we create the constant throughout the year, which is equal to use rather than here we can,

106
00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:20.530
instead of just saying that the search page as a heart quote, if we can change it to.

107
00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:25.420
We just sit around her.

108
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.740
That query, Dr.

109
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.480
No.

110
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.350
Whatever research you should see at the top now is say hello.

111
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:49.300
And it's just nice they seem nice at the top.

112
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:55.260
Now also, we can add something to the justice search.

113
00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.000
Page.

114
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.420
The nice search page.

115
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:08.630
Oh, hello.

116
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.020
So space.

117
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:11.800
All right.

118
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.160
So let's add this one to the guitar.

119
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:22.780
So we have we and everything using it at DOT.

120
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:30.650
We use get commands to add the message and the message would be, uh.

121
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.820
Kerry aides did about.

122
00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:58.280
Occurred about fiction, about data section, and also we modify the title and modify.

123
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:03.580
The site.

124
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.940
Title in search.

125
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:19.940
Page, well, just so we push it to get hops using get push.

126
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:29.940
Let's check it and inside this Google version three, we should see a new.

127
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.320
Commit now.

128
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:44.900
Let me maximize this, so we have 11 commits to the last one is created data about data section and

129
00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.620
modify the title and search page in the first page.

130
00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:54.950
We just in this search that, yes, we modify the title.

131
00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:08.210
Based on the turn of the page, and then we added a property component and we passed this resource to

132
00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:08.450
it.

133
00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:13.010
We create this search results that GST component.

134
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:25.540
And this is just a day with a paragraph inside it, which is saying about and we got the results formatted

135
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:26.620
total results.

136
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.860
And also the format is search time.

137
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:40.920
Yeah, that was it for the about section here in the next section, we're going to complete the results

138
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.400
section as we see in the final version.

139
00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:58.790
So are you going to get like a URL when we get this snippets and we're going to design it based on the

140
00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.820
pelvis versus styling like this?

141
00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.670
So see in the next section for the results section.
