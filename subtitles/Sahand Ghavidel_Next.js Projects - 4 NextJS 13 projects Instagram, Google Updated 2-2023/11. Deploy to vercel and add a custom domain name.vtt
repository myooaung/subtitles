00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.360
All right, in the last section, we have finished our card that year and made our website responsive

2
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.460
by adding the greats like.

3
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.750
And we just change to create columns.

4
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:31.060
No, after the small large x large and two x large in this section, we're going to deploy our website

5
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.280
to herself and finally apply it to a custom.

6
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.150
You are our.

7
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.520
So here we open in New Tab and we go to air.

8
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.240
Searching the Google herself.

9
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.840
In the search results, we click on Verso dot com.

10
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:04.080
Once you are inside the vessel, that's calm, you need to sign up or log in.

11
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.580
If you already sign up, it's free, completely free and it's just near your name or your email, and

12
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.200
then you just need to log in.

13
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.780
I'm going to use my guitar to log in, so it's just because my GitHub is already open and another tab.

14
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.730
So when once I click on the guitar, I'm going to directly go inside?

15
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.930
All right.

16
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.590
Once I came inside, I can see my previous deployment.

17
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.220
And.

18
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.860
Here I can click on new projects.

19
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.370
And in the left side, you can't see all my get repositories.

20
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.640
So, no, we have created our.

21
00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.800
This is the last one movie app, version eight for me, and it was 17 minutes ago.

22
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:10.400
Here you can see the 17 or 60 minutes ago I committed the last one, so it automatically came here,

23
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.830
but you have to sign in with your kids, get half true.

24
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.120
They were so to see this picture.

25
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.880
Otherwise you just click on, log in with your getup.

26
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:33.730
Once you see this section, you just import the application you would like to deploy to where so I click

27
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.470
here on import.

28
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.810
And it's suggests me project name.

29
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.420
That's fine movie version eight.

30
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:51.090
It's already detected that it's next year, and also we need to add our environmental variables so we

31
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.420
go back to visual studio code and inside it that envy that local.

32
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.760
We just get our API key.

33
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.030
And paste it here.

34
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.220
And also, we get the tea itself and paste it here and click on at.

35
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.870
And now we can deploy the website if you just click on Deploy.

36
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:24.070
He usually takes about I feel it's 45 second to one minute.

37
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.600
So in the meantime, let's go to I want to go to my two Google.

38
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.260
Domain.

39
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:47.350
So inside Google search Google domains because I have my domain on Google domain, but you can go to

40
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.010
your own, uh, domain.

41
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.900
Website and get all the information and change it, so are you.

42
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.390
I personally use Google domains because it's very secure.

43
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.020
It's similar to your Gmail.

44
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.610
This same security and once you.

45
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.790
Select your VIPs, I want to use this 100th day as projects dot com my website once.

46
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:24.070
If you don't have you, just you can buy a new website so you just go to all domains and purchase a

47
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.820
new domain.

48
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:34.850
And once you are inside the 100 genius projects dot com or your your website, you go to DNS.

49
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.300
And here.

50
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:46.790
Uh, you see my previous, uh, deployments here, you click on Manage Customer Records and here.

51
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:55.720
I want to add a new record, so here, click I click on, create new records and I just call this sub

52
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.460
domain movie app.

53
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.810
Version eight.

54
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:14.630
So the tie up is a and in order to get this IPV four addressee, you just need to go to work so.

55
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.860
Here.

56
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.850
You can see that already our website is deployed to reverse all and the.

57
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.080
If you click on the website.

58
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:36.770
You see that the domain domain name is movie eight and some thing else.

59
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.020
Dot app versus that app.

60
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.710
All right.

61
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.570
But I want to change this one to my custom domain, which is 100 just.

62
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.500
Uh, projects project.

63
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:57.940
So I go to the view domains and here you see that this is our domain now movie app version eight that

64
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.110
were so that you can open it, they can see our website.

65
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.760
All right.

66
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.440
But I don't want this domain, which is a death reversal.

67
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.810
Let's go to.

68
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.490
And it's my own domain, which is Moby.

69
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.200
App version eight.

70
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.620
Dot hundreds.

71
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.330
Yes.

72
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.240
Projects dot com?

73
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.850
Yeah, I added.

74
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:38.900
Once you add it, it's automatically add to the SSL, the configuration and everything, you just need

75
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.250
to click on edit.

76
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.640
And go to DNS records.

77
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.560
And here you can get the.

78
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:49.610
This value.

79
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.070
Seventy six, this is my.

80
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:54.600
IPV.

81
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.720
All right.

82
00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.570
Just copy this and you go back to Google domains and paste that here.

83
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.700
You see, this is all always the same.

84
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.060
All right.

85
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.490
Once I save it.

86
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.190
Now, if I copy this URL and paste it here.

87
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:25.110
You can see that our website is completely live in our custom domain.

88
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:32.100
You can actually directly put it in hundred-year, yes, that's come as well, but because I already

89
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.210
have something else in my domain, I added, It's up to me.

90
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.350
If you want to add it directly, you just need to.

91
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.200
And let me show you.

92
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:50.780
Instead of writing off movie half versions, six or something like that, you just add.

93
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.660
At Star.

94
00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:02.470
Or make it empty, so it means that this is just a hundred chicks that come.

95
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.230
All right.

96
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:12.340
But otherwise, if you want to sub domain, you just write down whatever you like to have before your

97
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:13.690
actual domain.

98
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:15.360
All right.

99
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.760
This is our best scientists.

100
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.040
It's completely responsive and it's very fast.

101
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.030
It's faster than local hosts, actually when you deploy it.

102
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:30.300
So when we click on top rated, you see that quickly loads all the images.

103
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.610
And trending as well.

104
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:43.560
Later later, I'm going to add more functionality to this website, so please wait for the updates of

105
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.560
this project.

106
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.830
I'm going to add more functionality.

107
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:57.810
And but you can use the other projects and wait for other projects as well, so see you in the next

108
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.860
project.
