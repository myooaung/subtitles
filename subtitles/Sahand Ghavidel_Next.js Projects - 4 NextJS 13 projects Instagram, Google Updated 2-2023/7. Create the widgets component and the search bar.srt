1
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:07,820
All right.

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,390
In the last section, we have completed the post section of our project.

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,970
In this section, we're going to start creating the widgets of the project.

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:25,710
If you look at the final version of the project, you can see we have a search bar at the top and when

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,580
we scroll down, the search bar is always added to.

6
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,290
So it's, uh.

7
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,740
Let me show you here.

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,960
By trying.

9
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,220
So we have a div here at the top.

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:53,890
Actually we have a diff that is called, uh, that is for the wages component and then we have a diff

11
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,430
here at the top that is, is sticky to the top.

12
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:10,230
Then we have another div that is covering both of the input and also the magnifier icon.

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,420
Well search icon.

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:25,180
So we're going to make the position of the input absolute in relative to this dev their red dev and

15
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,630
add a margin left to it.

16
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:37,210
So we bring it a little bit right and we set this as search icon in the left side.

17
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,360
So let's go back to Visual Studio code and we create our widgets component.

18
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:51,220
So here in the components folder, we create a new file and we call it widgets.

19
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:52,810
Don't just.

20
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:59,610
We can use our MFC to create a reactive functional component.

21
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,660
We don't need this import.

22
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,390
React from react as we're using.

23
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,820
Next year.

24
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:15,580
Then inside index that is just after the feed component.

25
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,440
We add the widgets.

26
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:26,720
And we we can import it using contrast base and click on the first auto suggestion.

27
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,360
Let's close the tank.

28
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,650
And let's test it here.

29
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:41,120
Now, if you refresh the page in the localhost 3000, we see that on the top.

30
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,120
We have widgets which is coming from.

31
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,260
This takes.

32
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,170
So.

33
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:50,870
Here.

34
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:58,430
As I mentioned before, we have a div that is covering all the fittings and we have a div that we're

35
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,680
going to use for making the.

36
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:10,550
Search bar is sticky and another div that is having both of the magnifier icon and also the input.

37
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,640
So let's bring the magnify icon or in hero icons.

38
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,690
It's called search icon.

39
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,620
So here you can get this suggestion.

40
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,960
Search icon from here, icons for slash react post slash outline.

41
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,000
We cannot see it.

42
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,450
I think the size is, uh, very big.

43
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,770
Let me.

44
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,810
Bring this phone here so you can see everything in real time.

45
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:56,610
So we change the size to be five, so now we can see it at top.

46
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:02,410
Let's add the input here as well, which just said input.

47
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,750
And, uh.

48
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,250
The tie is text.

49
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,060
That's fine.

50
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,820
And we have a place holder.

51
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,700
Of search.

52
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,160
Twitter.

53
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,170
You can see now.

54
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:30,440
So as I, we use a plugin before for this input, this plugin is applied to this one as well.

55
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:37,780
If you remember, we installed a plugin called Tailwind Success Forms.

56
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,170
So it has the basic styling now.

57
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:49,330
Let's continue a style and more where we can and let's.

58
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:50,980
Yeah.

59
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:58,450
Mick, let's bring these two next to each other first by just using flags.

60
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,580
Display flags here.

61
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:11,020
And we can just use our time center to bring them center and very clear.

62
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,570
Like this.

63
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,220
Then.

64
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,440
Let's add some padding of three.

65
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,950
So push them a little bit inside and let's make it rounded.

66
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,620
Full.

67
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,810
So you cannot see it yet.

68
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:38,010
But if you add a background color of, for example, red.

69
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,060
300.

70
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,410
You can see the.

71
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,460
Their color.

72
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,990
And the.

73
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:59,400
Now I want this input to be exactly the same size of this, Dave, but.

74
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:12,650
We can just only do this if we do their make this input and make the position of this input absolute

75
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,580
in relative to this death.

76
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,450
So we the added relative.

77
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,460
To the dev and here.

78
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:30,360
For this import, we add a position of absolute.

79
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,810
Now you can see that it exactly went there.

80
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,040
But.

81
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,520
I still have left zero or rather zero.

82
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,750
We can remove that one using instead zero instead.

83
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,550
Zero means if you look at here, it means top zero, right?

84
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,090
Zero.

85
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,000
Bottom zero.

86
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,160
I left everything.

87
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:05,140
So as you can see now, we cannot see even the sea, the death, because it's exactly like that there.

88
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,920
But it's a square that there is round it.

89
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,410
So we add the round it for this one as well.

90
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,820
Surrounded.

91
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,060
Well.

92
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:26,240
And let's, uh, add some width and height or other things so we can see.

93
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,780
Make it bigger.

94
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,590
So here inside the input we add.

95
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,010
We can add with.

96
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,740
And height, or we can add that width and height.

97
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,800
To the above death.

98
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,100
Death.

99
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,670
This death.

100
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,330
So we can add.

101
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,510
For example.

102
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,300
A with.

103
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,390
For example, we say the weight would be 90%.

104
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:14,120
But we can add the upper tier, we add the with.

105
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:25,820
For the x large and above we add the width to be because in actually mobile size, uh, we don't want

106
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,950
to see the widgets.

107
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:37,130
So as you can see now we have 600 pixels here and I want it to be hidden.

108
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:46,630
When we have a mobile screen and in the largest size and above, I want it to be in line.

109
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,250
If it tests it.

110
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,840
Now, we can see that when we decrease the size.

111
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:01,730
The reason we are seeing this one is small because we don't have any content here yet that this is going

112
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,540
to be okay.

113
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:08,450
Don't worry about that, because in the final version we have what's happening on Hulu to follow.

114
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,860
So this size will be exactly like that.

115
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:13,610
Then.

116
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,810
When we have this size and that in the mobile size, we don't see it.

117
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,270
Okay.

118
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,530
Let's continue styling this one.

119
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:37,580
So we want to wait to be 90%, but in the x large, I want the dead to be 75%.

120
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,870
Their with to be.

121
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,920
75%.

122
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:54,930
So you see, it's a smaller now than, as I mentioned before, I want this section to be sticky at a

123
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:55,410
top.

124
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,560
And she was just at Sticky and Top Zero.

125
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:10,430
And, uh, I want the background to be white because, uh, the default is transparent.

126
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:17,840
So if you don't make it white when we are scrolling down, we just see the other content inside the

127
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,560
search bar.

128
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,000
Then we have a padding y of one and a half.

129
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:33,200
They push it a little bit down and let's make the Z index 52 because I want it to be always at a top.

130
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,410
But as you can see, we cannot see the magnifier icon or a search icon anymore.

131
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,700
So let's make the Z index for this 152.

132
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,350
So now we can see it.

133
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,120
And let's change the color of the map.

134
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:54,610
This, uh, magnifier to be Tex Gray.

135
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,500
500.

136
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:06,110
And as I mentioned before, I want this placeholder, too, to be pushed a little bit to the right side.

137
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,320
So here in the.

138
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,340
Not here.

139
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,390
In the inputs.

140
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,200
We just add a margin left.

141
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,650
Or padding left.

142
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,320
Of 11.

143
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,360
And this is going to be okay now.

144
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,720
And, uh.

145
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,780
Let's change the border color.

146
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,330
Yes.

147
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,510
Say border.

148
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,790
Gray 500.

149
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,590
And then we have texts.

150
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,410
Gray.

151
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,600
700.

152
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,780
This text, the one that we are writing.

153
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,030
So.

154
00:11:59,070 --> 00:11:59,730
That's.

155
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,800
And then we have.

156
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,990
Uh, when we focus on it, and then we click to it.

157
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,190
I want to add a shadow of large.

158
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,690
Like this.

159
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,790
See the shadow at the bottom.

160
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:27,480
Then when we focus, I want the background color to be white.

161
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,690
It's white already.

162
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:41,550
But let's make the background color as a default gray 100.

163
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,060
So now it's gray.

164
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,980
When we click on it, it becomes white.

165
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,250
Let's push a little bit, this one to the right side.

166
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,840
So in the top there.

167
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,520
Here, we just add a margin left of eight.

168
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,010
It can't see it like that.

169
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:14,960
The other thing is when we add the other things like what's happening and who to follow.

170
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,360
I wanted all the items.

171
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:24,940
To have a space in the Y axis of five.

172
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,080
You cannot see the result now, but later you can see it.

173
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,110
So that was it for the search bar.

174
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,470
Uh, let's add it to the get ha.

175
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,160
Real quick by just saying it at all.

176
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:44,100
Let's add a message using can't commit.

177
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,810
And the message would be.

178
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,650
Create the widgets.

179
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,210
Component.

180
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,970
And this search bar.

181
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,000
Okay.

182
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,650
Let's push it to get.

183
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,660
And we check our code.

184
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:32,170
So here, if you refresh the page by clicking on this Twitter, we can see now we have seven commits

185
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,430
in our repository.

186
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:41,470
And if you click on this, we can check our last repository, which is create the widgets component

187
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,550
and the search bar.

188
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:53,220
As you can see, we created a widget, that genius component, and we added a div that is covering all

189
00:14:53,220 --> 00:15:00,540
the bridges, one for it being sticky and one to cover this icon and the input.

190
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,110
And we added this, which is that you asked to index that.

191
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,620
Yes.

192
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:06,670
Here.

193
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,920
Yeah, that was it for the search bar section.

194
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,810
In the next section, we're going to create this What's Happening section?

195
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,230
And we're going to use an open API.

196
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:28,020
Which doesn't need any API keys for getting these news.

197
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,710
This news is actually.

198
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:37,370
It's coming from an API and it's always getting a new.

199
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:43,190
Every day new news comes and if you click on show more, we can see more news.

200
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:51,800
And each time we are going to fetch 50 headlines from this API and show it here.

201
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,460
So we can just go on till 50.

202
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:56,780
Okay.

203
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,090
See you in the next section.
