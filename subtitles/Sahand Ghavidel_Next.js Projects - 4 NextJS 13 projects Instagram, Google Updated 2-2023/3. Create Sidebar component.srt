1
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:07,960
All right.

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:16,340
In the last section we have installed next year and Tilman says and we got the first template of our

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,680
project, we got the Hello World in the browser.

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,550
In this section we are going to create the sidebar component of our project.

5
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,800
If you look at the final version of the project here.

6
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,900
We can see that we have a logo here, the Twitter logo.

7
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:48,470
Some menu icons, a button button and also a mini profile, including the name of the person and also

8
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,920
their user name.

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,580
And if he decreased the size.

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:04,470
We can see the responsiveness of the sidebar after hitting the.

11
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,640
A large break point.

12
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:18,170
We see that the menu changes only to icons and also the menu profile is included.

13
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,780
Just the image of the person.

14
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,270
And also the button is disappeared as far.

15
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:36,550
And after another break point, which is the mobile size, a small size, we don't see the menu anymore.

16
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:39,990
All right.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,770
So let's start by just creating this sidebar component inside Visual Studio code.

18
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,140
So we go back to Visual Studio code.

19
00:01:51,100 --> 00:02:03,130
Here we go to index searches and we just delete the hello world and we break down our project first.

20
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,330
If we look at the final version, we can see.

21
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,530
We have three main parts, including.

22
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,670
This sidebar here.

23
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,290
We have the feed section.

24
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,460
And also we have the.

25
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,230
Widgets on the right side.

26
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,000
The other one.

27
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,060
The other things we have is the model.

28
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,700
If we want to reply to a post.

29
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,460
If you click on this icon, we can see the model pops up.

30
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,290
Here as well.

31
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,870
So we have four main, main sections in the project.

32
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,420
So let's go back to Visual Studio code and here we break down the project.

33
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,510
So first section is sidebar.

34
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,100
Then we have the feed section.

35
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,850
We have widgets.

36
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,530
And finally, we have the model.

37
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,260
Let's create this sidebar components first.

38
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:29,290
So inside here, in the main section, in the section like package, that JSON label we created, we

39
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,390
create a folder called Components.

40
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:42,200
And inside this folder we create a file called sidebar that Jesus.

41
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,980
We can use rf c.

42
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,780
To create a react functional component.

43
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:59,200
I'm getting this suggestion because I have installed a extension called the new.

44
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,740
Let me show you here.

45
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,010
If you go to view extensions.

46
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:12,490
We have an extension called iOS seven React Redux, React Native snippets.

47
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:20,310
If you install this one, you get these kind of suggestions like React.

48
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,500
Functional component and etc..

49
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,510
I highly recommend this.

50
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,310
Uh, extension.

51
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:29,900
Alright.

52
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,180
So now we have.

53
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:40,090
The React functional component actually in next year, we don't need this import reactor from reactor

54
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,080
so we can delete it.

55
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,960
So let's import this component inside index that's here.

56
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:59,890
So here we just say sidebar and we get an author's suggestion that that vehicle is going to auto import

57
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,950
sidebar components.

58
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,280
So we click on this.

59
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,210
You can see that the sidebar component is imported from.

60
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,040
A components folder.

61
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,390
We closed this.

62
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:22,930
And if you look at our browser now, we can see that their hello world is changed to sidebar, which

63
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,570
we are getting from here.

64
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:33,260
So the next thinks actually we should put everything inside a.

65
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,020
Another tag, a main tag.

66
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:43,950
So I'm at a main tank here and we bring everything inside this main tech.

67
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:57,170
So now we have we should get the same result because we just added an empty div called Main.

68
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:09,930
But it's better for the search engines to find our content inside this kind of text, not only just

69
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,430
the death.

70
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:22,390
We call this kind of tax, semantic tax because they have a meaning.

71
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,970
If you use only div, it means that you are using non semantic tags.

72
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,200
All right.

73
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,410
By the way, let's continue for the sidebar section of our project.

74
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,060
Let's break down this sidebar.

75
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,880
Well, one more time we go to the final version.

76
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,980
So here we have it.

77
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,330
Sidebar component here, which includes.

78
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,600
A logo here.

79
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,840
Then we have the menu.

80
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,930
They have the buttons and also we have the mini profile.

81
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,660
Let's break down it inside the Visual Studio.

82
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:17,460
So this dev, first we have the Twitter logo, then we have.

83
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,510
The menu.

84
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:31,460
Then we have the button and finally we have the mini profile.

85
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:42,550
All right, so let's first create the logo of our sidebar.

86
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,580
So here we add a.

87
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:46,700
Dev.

88
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:58,820
And inside scientist there, we added a next year image component to use this image component.

89
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:04,880
This is the built in component of React and we need to import it as well.

90
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:13,490
So just click at the end of this image and we can use contrast space to get the auto suggestions.

91
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:21,530
This second auto suggestion is going to import image from next forward slash image.

92
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,880
You can see here.

93
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:25,760
Yeah.

94
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,230
Let's close this.

95
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:27,610
Uh.

96
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,260
The left side.

97
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,150
And also we bring this one.

98
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:40,000
Here too, and we open our localhost 3000 on the right side.

99
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,550
As you can see, we get in an error.

100
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:49,570
The error is saying that the image component is missing required SRT property.

101
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,550
So SRT property is mandatory in an image component.

102
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,400
So here we added SRT.

103
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,230
And as SASE would be, we just search for the tutor.

104
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,140
Inside Google and we go to Images tab.

105
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:17,290
So I'm going to use this low, uh, this one here.

106
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:24,070
So here we right click and we click on copy image address and we can paste it here.

107
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,950
Now we should get another error.

108
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:43,270
Then the next error is that we need to have a width and height or we need to have layout equals to feel

109
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,730
though this is mandatory as well.

110
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,260
And for image tag.

111
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,280
So here we add the width.

112
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:58,210
Let's sit there with 250 and also the height to 50 as far.

113
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,270
Okay.

114
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:14,900
So the next error is and they said that helped the Twitter dot com which we have used here is not configured

115
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,520
under images in your next account fictitious file.

116
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:29,870
So we need to configure whatever website we use for image task that is mandatory as well.

117
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,640
So we just need to copy this help that twitter dot com.

118
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:40,470
And we open the Explorer section.

119
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,320
We go to view an explorer.

120
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,260
And we go to next that conflict that is here.

121
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,110
And we should add that domain here.

122
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,560
So.

123
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,110
We just need to add images.

124
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,690
Equal an object.

125
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,130
And the domain.

126
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,640
Domains is equal to and an array and the first.

127
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,250
Uh element is help the Twitter dot com.

128
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:22,450
When we change something inside the conflict that next that conflict that, yes, we need to restart

129
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:26,920
the server because we need to see the effect in this way.

130
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,010
So we stop the server using contra see.

131
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:37,520
And uh, we can use NPR and Ron there to start the server again.

132
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,500
So he is restarting the server now.

133
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,210
There.

134
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:48,200
The error, uh, should be removed by now.

135
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,580
We refresh the page.

136
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,330
Now we are getting the logo.

137
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,050
So everything worked fine.

138
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,760
Now let's continue.

139
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,470
So we have added the logo.

140
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,490
So in the menu section.

141
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,150
We will start creating the menu item items.

142
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,500
I would like to create a component.

143
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:27,840
Separate components for each item and then import them inside the sidebar component.

144
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:39,090
So here we open the Explorer section and we create a new component and we call this component sidebar

145
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:39,960
menu item.

146
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:46,440
So we just say sidebar menu item that just.

147
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,190
So we can use our AFC.

148
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:05,600
RBC for React Functional Component, we can delete the import react from React and we can inside the

149
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:10,100
sidebar that is the import that.

150
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:21,440
But first we create a diff and inside is there we import that here this sidebar menu item we can use

151
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,190
contra space to get the auto suggestion.

152
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,530
Let's make it self-closing.

153
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,860
And we can import it by using country space again.

154
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:42,740
So now we have imported side bar menu item from the same folder, which is components.

155
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,090
And let's check the browser now.

156
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,730
Now we are getting sidebar menu item.

157
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,930
That we have here for the icons.

158
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,490
Yeah, the home icon and etc..

159
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,660
We're going to use a website called Hero Icons.

160
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:12,890
Hero Icons has the same owner of the Tillman CSF, so it's completely compatible with Tillman CSF.

161
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,710
So let's search for.

162
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,370
Here are our comments here.

163
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,750
So in the search results we click on hero icons dot com.

164
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:37,900
First we need to install this package, so we need to go to a documentation.

165
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:44,750
And we just scroll a little bit and for using reaction.

166
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,160
Yes, in our case we can use NPM, install hero icons for a slash react.

167
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,800
So we copied this line of code.

168
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,990
We go to Visual Studio code is stop the server and we paste the code.

169
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,830
And for using the icons.

170
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:12,180
For example, here there is an example we can use the breaker icon, for example, we just need imported

171
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:12,720
from here.

172
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:21,840
Icons for slash react for slash solid or artillery solid is like a thicker and outline is.

173
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,980
So the installation process has been completed.

174
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,560
So we just need to run the server again.

175
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,540
We don't need this.

176
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,390
Here are cons menu.

177
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,830
Uh, tap anymore.

178
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,520
We close it.

179
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:43,910
So here before the first one, we add a prop.

180
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:53,360
And the first one is the name and we just a text because I want to add the home.

181
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,260
I care.

182
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,590
I want to stay home.

183
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,970
And the icon.

184
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:05,970
So let me just add a text and a text would be home for the first one.

185
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,040
And the icon.

186
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,920
It's going to be home.

187
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,490
Arcon.

188
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,470
Like this.

189
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,890
And we need to import it from here.

190
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,540
Are we just import?

191
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,870
Home icon.

192
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:35,710
From.

193
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,390
He comes first for us to react.

194
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:46,680
And also because we want to use the home, the thick one.

195
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,730
We use solid.

196
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:54,840
So we just added forward slash and we just say, solve it.

197
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,850
Let's refresh the page.

198
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,640
We should see the result now.

199
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:05,720
Yeah.

200
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:10,490
We already passed the prop, but we didn't use it inside the sidebar menu.

201
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,960
Let's go to sidebar menu item, duchess.

202
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:25,040
And here we we can get the props here like this or we can this structure it and we just get the texts.

203
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:28,280
And also we want to get the icon.

204
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:32,800
So.

205
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,470
So here inside a diff now.

206
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,560
The ad icon here.

207
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,640
You can see the icon here, but it's huge.

208
00:17:50,640 --> 00:18:00,900
So let's decrease the size by just adding it to this class, which is just set the height to be seven.

209
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:10,660
Now we can see it is smaller here and after the icon we added span and inside the span we just add the

210
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,260
text.

211
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:13,740
That we're getting here.

212
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,110
Yeah.

213
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:15,890
That is home.

214
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:24,680
So we go to we go back to Sidebar Digest and we copied this one few more times.

215
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:32,350
In the final version, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight items.

216
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:40,330
So we need to copy this seven more times using alt shift A.I..

217
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,120
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

218
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,900
So now we need to change that.

219
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,320
Just two ticks and we add a new icon.

220
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,970
So the next takes would be explore.

221
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:02,540
And the icon is hashtag icon, just like the hashtag icon.

222
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:08,960
So we getting this suggestion or to suggestion, but we don't want it from solid.

223
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,650
We want it from outline.

224
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,690
So we just manually we can get it.

225
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,100
So we just go up.

226
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,310
And we import.

227
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,610
Hashtag.

228
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:28,480
Icon.

229
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,430
From.

230
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,370
Hero icons of life.

231
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,760
Let's refresh the page.

232
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,790
Yeah, you can see the hashtag and explore.

233
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,760
The third one is notification.

234
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:02,630
Conventions and the icon is built.

235
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,110
Which is from outline as well.

236
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,040
So we're getting the suggestion Bill I can't outline as solid so we choose outline here.

237
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,740
We can see now here.

238
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,610
The next one is messages.

239
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,000
And the icon is inbox icon.

240
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,730
I think I imported.

241
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,350
Oh, my God.

242
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:47,980
Hashtag.

243
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:48,570
Sorry.

244
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,300
That's fine.

245
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,130
So let's go.

246
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,330
Let's continue.

247
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,460
The next one is bookmark.

248
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:05,960
Yes.

249
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,770
I puke, Mark.

250
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,210
And the icon is bookmark icon.

251
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,360
PwC.

252
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,670
And this is going to be from offline as well.

253
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,690
So we can see it here.

254
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,080
Let me increase the size here.

255
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,100
You can see a better.

256
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,960
The next one is lists and the icon is clipboard.

257
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,730
Clipboard.

258
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,070
KLEPPER.

259
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,540
I come from Oslo.

260
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,850
And then we have profile.

261
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,340
Which is use user icon.

262
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,820
And finally, we have more.

263
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,200
Which is the dot horizon.

264
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,050
That circle who an aka?

265
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,400
This one.

266
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:35,760
All right.

267
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:40,050
So we have created the menu you have completed next.

268
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,540
Let's go to the next part, which is the button.

269
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,060
We just create a button.

270
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,420
And, uh, we just saw a tweet.

271
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,480
We can see here later, we're going to style it.

272
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,270
But just for now, we'll leave it here.

273
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,190
And then we we have the menu profile, which has the dev.

274
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,100
And inside the div we have it.

275
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:21,070
We have an image we have then like another div that is covering a user name.

276
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:26,200
And so the user first name, a family name and also the user name.

277
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:32,560
And also we have another icon which is that dot that that horizon icon.

278
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,800
So let's go back to Visual Studio code and the and the image.

279
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,870
First we use images tag.

280
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,860
Let's just bring an image.

281
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,420
I just choose my image from online.

282
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,400
So you can you can put your own name.

283
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,050
Your own image.

284
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:05,180
So I just get this image copy, image address and we go back and put it inside.

285
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:05,970
So see.

286
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,520
We can see it here.

287
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,870
The old would be user image.

288
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,010
And then after the image we have.

289
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:25,040
As I mentioned, we have another diff that is covering two things.

290
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,260
The name and the username.

291
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:36,050
So for the name we just added edge for tag and I just write my name.

292
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,320
Then we have a paragraph.

293
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:52,570
We added, uh, my twitter username, which is code with sahand.

294
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,260
Yeah, we can see it here.

295
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,190
And also at the end we have that that horizon.

296
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:03,800
Uh.

297
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:09,260
Which is dot or rise in.

298
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,120
And it's going to be from out line as well.

299
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,990
Know, we can see that this is very huge.

300
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,600
Let's decrease the size.

301
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,970
Just adding height of five, for example.

302
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:35,720
All right.

303
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:41,980
So we have completed the sidebar components and the items.

304
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,520
Now let's just start styling it.

305
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,680
If we look at the final version.

306
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:54,280
We can see that the icon and the menus, they have a hovering effects.

307
00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:01,180
So when we hover over them, we can see a different color in the background.

308
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:10,000
So but the background color of the menu is gray, but the icon is blue and here is gray, too.

309
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:17,650
So if we do a styling for each of them individually, it's going to be a lot of work.

310
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,080
But we can use it.

311
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:30,550
We can use the a costume, a style of tailoring cases, and create one class that is covering all of

312
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,440
them so we can use for all of them.

313
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:46,410
So we can if we can do that and simply add one class to each item and we get the same result for everyone.

314
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,610
So let's do this and see it inside the real example.

315
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,180
So.

316
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,480
For creating a custom class we need to go to.

317
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,450
Inside the Telvin.

318
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,420
Our goal was a global ceasefire.

319
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:20,600
So first let let's add this constant missile here and see the effects in real time when we are doing

320
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,340
the crisis.

321
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:22,970
So.

322
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,730
We have the logo.

323
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,990
So this div that is covering the logo.

324
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,840
We had a class called Hover Effects.

325
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,250
I would just make it this.

326
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:51,210
And we can use this one for the other places as well.

327
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,890
For example.

328
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,370
For the mini profile.

329
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,230
We add this one too.

330
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:04,870
And also we we want to add it to a sidebar menu item as well.

331
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:11,910
So in this of that is covering everything, we add this hover effect class as well.

332
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:18,120
Now if we we create this hover effect class, we can see the results in all of the.

333
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,380
So for creating them.

334
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:24,900
We need to go to Global.

335
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:26,980
That's CSIS.

336
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:39,610
So we opened the Explorer section using Country B and we go to a styles folder here and we go to globals.

337
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,830
That's the SS.

338
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:46,400
Here we can add our custom at.

339
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,120
Custom styling component.

340
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,060
We just need to add a layer here.

341
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,950
And just two components.

342
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:04,270
And inside is it's going to be that class that we want to define.

343
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,200
And the name of that class was Hover Effect.

344
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:17,010
So if we open up a set of curly braces and we apply our classes using.

345
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,420
Apply here.

346
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,650
Let's refresh your page and see the fix.

347
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,930
So now we're just going to just add our first class.

348
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,960
I want the cursor to be pointer.

349
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:38,010
When we hover over the element.

350
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:45,750
If you now if you hover over the elements, we can see occurs a point in hand.

351
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:52,010
So next one is change the background color of when we hover over it.

352
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:57,030
So we change the background color to Gray 200.

353
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,000
You can see the gray color.

354
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,260
Then let's make it rounded.

355
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,390
So the the added rounded corner.

356
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,430
You can see the rounded corner here.

357
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:23,800
Then.

358
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,300
Let's change the width and height.

359
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:34,370
So wait, it would be 52 pixels.

360
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:47,350
And also this is when we have a mobile site.

361
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:57,930
So this is a small but when we have a larger screen in the in the larger breakpoint like Excel, the

362
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,890
breakpoint prefix.

363
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,520
We want the width to be also.

364
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:14,710
So now if you, uh, increase the size of the browser to larger screen, you can see that the.

365
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,660
Uh, with is auto.

366
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,200
It's the size of the screen.

367
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:26,650
But when we have a smaller screen, we have a smaller rounded one.

368
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:36,150
Maybe now looks a little bit weird, but if first wait we keep continue and complete their styling and

369
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,290
you can see the result.

370
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,430
Very nice.

371
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,700
So now we want to add the height.

372
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:49,230
So for the mobile size, I want the hide or less an x large size.

373
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,620
We want the height to be 52 pixels.

374
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,130
And.

375
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,120
For the.

376
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,090
Excel.

377
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,460
Break point prefix.

378
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,780
We want the height to be auto as far.

379
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,280
And when we have a larger.

380
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:15,890
Size over x large.

381
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,590
We want the rear and a padding of three.

382
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,990
So in this size, we have some padding.

383
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,080
All right.

384
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:38,870
So let's keep this one bigger and life sized and let's bring the base code on the right side so we can

385
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:39,950
see this section.

386
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,970
Better so we can install it in the.

387
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,190
Big sighs first.

388
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,160
So we finished with the hover effects.

389
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,250
Uh.

390
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,260
Sale We closed this global assets.

391
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:55,560
Yes.

392
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:55,860
Yes.

393
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,700
And let's continue to sell our sidebar more.

394
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,200
For example, we bring this home next to the icon and also this one as well.

395
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:14,880
So we go to sidebar menu item, which is for the individual items.

396
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:23,610
Let's bring them next to each other here by changing the display to flex.

397
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:30,720
You can see now they came next to each other, but they are not aligned with each other.

398
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:39,900
So we can change two items, a line item center, or you can say item center for Talbots.

399
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,170
Yes.

400
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:40,520
Yes.

401
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,740
So we bring them next to each other.

402
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,110
I mean, horizontally.

403
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,980
Then we changed the text to be gray.

404
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,370
700.

405
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,970
A little bit brighter.

406
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,630
And, uh, we changed it.

407
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:06,280
Just, uh, justified content to be center as well.

408
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:09,960
Now.

409
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,930
It went to the center of the screen, actually, but.

410
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:20,060
Actually, we want I want them to in the larger screen to be at the beginning.

411
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:32,180
So in the x large and breakpoint prefix, we changed the justify from center to a start.

412
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,310
So it comes to beginning.

413
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:44,330
Then let's change this to the size of the text to be large.

414
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:54,650
And also let's add some space between the icon and the text using a space x three.

415
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,830
We can see this space now.

416
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:04,830
I want this home to be bought, but I don't want the others to be both.

417
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:18,410
So for cyber ninjas, for the home section, the cyber menu item home, I add an active attribute and

418
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,560
be imported from sidebar menu item.

419
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,170
Here.

420
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:30,000
And here in the Texas, a span.

421
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:36,640
I had a class name, but make this fun for using variables.

422
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,870
So I use it back.

423
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:38,320
Take.

424
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,770
And I just say if.

425
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,430
It is active.

426
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,550
The active is true then.

427
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,770
Make the font bold.

428
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,580
So you can see the only home is both now.

429
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:14,620
And the next thing I want to do is make this text hidden when this is and when the borders screen is

430
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,950
smaller or less than x large.

431
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:23,290
So first we make it hidden so we don't see it now.

432
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:31,200
But for the x large and above, I want it to be in line so we can see it.

433
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:38,200
Now, if we have a smaller screen than this, we don't see the pics.

434
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,230
Let's keep continuing install this button, the tweet button.

435
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:54,770
So we go back to sidebar notes and in the button section we add some styles to the button.

436
00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:00,430
So we had a class name and the first class.

437
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:06,110
We just want the background to be blue.

438
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,960
400.

439
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,760
Which is similar to the real Twitter.

440
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,730
Then let's change the text colour to be white.

441
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,390
And we make it rounded using a rounded full.

442
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,140
And we need just to add some.

443
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:32,850
At.

444
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:39,720
Like a weight and height to make it similar to the tweeters one.

445
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:46,020
So the width would be 56 and height to be 12.

446
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:52,150
We make the font to be bold.

447
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:59,890
And we can add a shadow effect as well using terms.

448
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:06,980
Yes, easily by adjusting shadow and B, make it small and medium shadow like this.

449
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,710
And for A hovering, I want it to be a little bit darker when we hover over it.

450
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:18,210
So you just say hover.

451
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,510
And they change the brightness to be 95%.

452
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:28,130
So 5% less when we hover over it can see now.

453
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,030
And also, let's make the tweet.

454
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,080
Text to be a little bit larger.

455
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,560
But just seeing ticks large.

456
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,680
Similar to one we did it is text.

457
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:49,300
I want this button to be hidden when we have a smaller screen.

458
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,650
So I make it hidden.

459
00:38:51,710 --> 00:39:02,360
When we have a mobile size and an x large and breakpoint prefix and above, I want it to be in line.

460
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,250
So now when we have a smaller screen, we don't see the button.

461
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:12,220
Okay.

462
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:12,850
Let's go.

463
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:16,930
Let's continue for a minute for a full section.

464
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,450
So inside sidebar, the chess.

465
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:28,220
We go to a menu for a fall section and after this.

466
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:36,800
However, in fact, let's first change the text color to be gray 700.

467
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:40,230
Then let's change the display to flex.

468
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,810
To bring them next to each other.

469
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:53,860
And similar to what we did before, we bring them horizontally next to each other using items center.

470
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,080
And, uh.

471
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,400
We can use Justified Center to bring it to the center.

472
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,330
Horizontally that the items with the, uh, thing vertically.

473
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,310
This is horizontally.

474
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:10,470
Yeah.

475
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,060
Justify.

476
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:14,240
Center.

477
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,390
It's fancy across the middle.

478
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,010
But the.

479
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,310
We can.

480
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,940
Fix that.

481
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:34,180
Uh, just say, uh, we can say more than a large.

482
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,540
Me just to justify a start.

483
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:41,690
All right.

484
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,700
Let's add some margin top off auto.

485
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:57,310
This is going to help us when we have a smaller zoom level.

486
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:06,130
This one comes to the end, but now it's not happening because we need to set the height of the screen

487
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:11,320
to be at least at the size of this screen, like a mini height screen.

488
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,460
So inside index that yes, we go to menu.

489
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,500
And we had a class there.

490
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:25,740
First we changed the display to flex because I want all of them to be next to each other.

491
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:30,450
Then we changed the min height to be a screen.

492
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,610
So.

493
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,190
Now and then.

494
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:44,740
We set the max with to be seven Excel.

495
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:48,660
What does it mean?

496
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:53,070
First, let me change the mix to auto.

497
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:56,190
It means a major margin exporter.

498
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,990
So it comes to this center.

499
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:06,000
You can see let's add a just background color of red hundred.

500
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,790
You can see it's what's happening here.

501
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:13,440
So we change the max with to be seven excel.

502
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:20,340
So for 200% a zoom level we have some space here and here equally.

503
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:24,950
The reason we have equal space because we use mimics auto.

504
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:25,530
Yeah.

505
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:34,000
And we have this read to the end.

506
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:38,980
So because we have the minimum height screen.

507
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:46,400
So let's remove this background red color, which as I just added for explaining that.

508
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,100
So that is fine now.

509
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,090
For a sidebar.

510
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:57,810
For the top level there was because every half here.

511
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,350
That is covering everything.

512
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:06,170
We had a class name and we want to.

513
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:16,340
We changed the display to flex, but I wanted to first to be hidden because in the mobile screen I don't

514
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:26,300
want to have a menu, but in the mobile screen and above, let's change the display to flex so we can

515
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:26,810
see them.

516
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:33,470
But Flex bring them next to each other like this so we can change the flex direction to column.

517
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,230
Legs direction to column.

518
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,970
So they come back on top of each other.

519
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,150
Now the mini profile is at the end.

520
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:50,650
So as I mentioned, I want this always to be at the end.

521
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,250
So that's why we added the margin top or to.

522
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,470
For as many powerful.

523
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:02,970
So let's do the increase the zoom level to 100%.

524
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:11,110
Then you can see them because the width is very high, because this is very long.

525
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,780
But we can fix it here.

526
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,480
We just say, what is there?

527
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,470
First, we add a padding of two.

528
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:26,360
So they a little bit they pushed to the center.

529
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:28,960
And let's.

530
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:31,860
Uh.

531
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,440
For X large and above.

532
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,850
We changed the items to star instead of items center.

533
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,660
And I want it to be fixed because.

534
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:57,360
When we if you look at the final version, when we're scrolling down, I want this side menu, sidebar

535
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:57,660
menu.

536
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:58,890
It's always be.

537
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:00,580
There.

538
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,610
I don't want it to scroll down.

539
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,670
So I change it to be fixed here.

540
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,080
To do that.

541
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:11,370
Okay.

542
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,420
It's fixed now and then.

543
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:18,280
Let's set the height to be for the reason I'm doing that.

544
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:27,970
Because now because we change the f f position to be fixed so we don't have this margin top effect anymore.

545
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:33,490
So that's why we need to change the height to be full.

546
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:34,690
Yeah.

547
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,340
You can see now the effects you.

548
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,100
Let's keep continuing for the user profile section.

549
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:46,210
So we go back to mini profile.

550
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:50,240
This increase the size of this again.

551
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,050
So now.

552
00:45:54,680 --> 00:46:00,590
Uh, let's make this a, uh, name.

553
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:05,690
I have to make it bold using font.

554
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:06,230
Bold.

555
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:09,850
You can see here.

556
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:12,610
Now let's decrease the size of the image.

557
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:23,800
So the image should have a class name and we set the height and width to be ten.

558
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:30,820
So just say height ten with ten and we make it rounded.

559
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:34,020
My picture was rounded actually by default.

560
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:40,840
But if you're using your image, probably if you don't have a rounded image, make this fun.

561
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,770
Rounded for.

562
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:46,090
For this user name.

563
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,230
Let's.

564
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,750
Change the color to gray.

565
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,120
Uh, just say ticks.

566
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:57,360
Gray 500.

567
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:08,480
And let's add some space between the image and these things using for the x large and above.

568
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:18,380
I want wanted margin right off to to add here and for the dot dot horizon, I want the margin left.

569
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:26,310
So for the x large and above, we add a margin left of eight.

570
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:29,960
They can't see.

571
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:31,550
Looks like this.

572
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,170
And I think that is fine.

573
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,500
But I want this.

574
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:46,230
And to be a little bit next to each other so we can add a leading five.

575
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:49,560
So add a space of five here between the.

576
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:54,490
So did the same things we did for here.

577
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,440
We do for this minute for.

578
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:06,120
So I want this text user name and depth horizon to be hidden when we have a smaller screen.

579
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:13,130
So we're for this one and it's this fun together.

580
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:18,330
So I add a dual cursor here using Alt.

581
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:27,510
And first I wanted to be hit in, but in the x large and above, I want it to be in line.

582
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,740
So now in this smaller screen, we don't see the.

583
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:41,370
So.

584
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:48,150
And then also for the logo, I want the background to be blue instead of the this color is just gray.

585
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:53,790
So let's go style this logo first.

586
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:57,030
Let's remove this padding around it.

587
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,560
It's just coming from the image problem we have.

588
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:05,720
So we we removed the padding using padding zero.

589
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:14,400
And also let's change the background color when we hover over it from gray to blue.

590
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:20,140
And just a hundred is enough.

591
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:22,480
Like this.

592
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:32,590
Alyssa It looks like Knots Circle so we can add some padding in the x level x axis.

593
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:39,190
We just say if it's bigger than x large, let's add a padding itself.

594
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:40,150
One.

595
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:42,840
So now it looks better.

596
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,610
And also so let's add some space between this menu and this button.

597
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:59,880
So for the for this state that is covering all of the items, first we add a margin top of four.

598
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:06,270
So added space between them and the logo and the added margin bottom of.

599
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,340
2.5.

600
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:13,640
2.5 is equal to ten pixels.

601
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:14,900
Now we have this space.

602
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,740
Then also in the.

603
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:19,250
And.

604
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:21,810
Ex large and above.

605
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,630
I want the items to be at the beginning.

606
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:27,930
So this item starts now.

607
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:32,970
You cannot see the effect, but when we are adding to all the other parts like Feed and other section,

608
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:33,960
we can see the effect.

609
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:36,240
But just for now.

610
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:38,540
We have everything.

611
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:40,270
Okay.

612
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,280
That was it for the sidebar menu.

613
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,160
Let's add it to the get up now.

614
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:56,770
They stop the server using controversy and we add everything to get everything get at dot and with the

615
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:00,820
message off, which is just get commands.

616
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:06,730
Dash am and the message is create.

617
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:11,750
Sidebar component.

618
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,890
And we push it to the top using get push.

619
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:29,060
Now if we go to guitar and we refresh the page by clicking on this tweeter, we should see three comments.

620
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:32,240
And the last one is create a sidebar component.

621
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:39,080
So as you can see, we created this sidebar, case file and side components folder.

622
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:49,020
We created sidebar menu item for each menu and for the next that conflict that yes, we added our add

623
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:51,200
the Twitter link.

624
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:59,210
We installed hero icons and finally indexed the GSV.

625
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:12,500
We added this sidebar component and for the global stats, yes, we added a custom utility custom a

626
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,930
style for the details.

627
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:15,500
Yes.

628
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,810
And the name was Hover Effect.

629
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:22,550
Yet that was it for our sidebar section of our project.

630
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:25,370
In the next section we start with the feed section.

631
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,200
So see in the next section.
