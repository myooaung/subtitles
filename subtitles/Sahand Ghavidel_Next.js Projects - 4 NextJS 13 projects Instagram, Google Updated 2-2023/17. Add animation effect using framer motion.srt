1
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:07,820
All right.

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,430
In the last section, we have completed the delete functionality.

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,510
In this section I want to add some transition effect.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:25,140
When we delete or add a new post where we don't see it suddenly pop up or remove, I want to add some

5
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,810
transition effects.

6
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:39,370
I want to add a package called Framer Motion that gives us all this transition and opacity animation

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,790
easily so we can search for frame or motion.

8
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,680
And this is the website for Framer Dotcom Motion.

9
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,190
But we can have the NPN package.

10
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,950
Here if you go to NPN just dotcom and frame in motion.

11
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,350
We can't get the instruction how to install it.

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,550
So as you can see, it's a very popular package.

13
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,000
It has more than 1 million downloads or installation weekly.

14
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,090
First, we need to install it.

15
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,430
So we go to get support and for a quick start.

16
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:33,990
We just grabbed this line of code and we got back to Visual Studio code.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,790
We stopped the server using Control C and we pressed Y and.

18
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,390
We just, uh.

19
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,350
Paste the code that you have copied.

20
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,840
In order to use it, we just need to.

21
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,470
Wrap the things we want to have, for example.

22
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:10,820
In 50 years we have a mapping and to the posts.

23
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,830
We just need to wrap this one with something called animate.

24
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,630
Presents.

25
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,580
See if you're getting the suggestion and it's coming from frame in motion.

26
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,870
We need to wrap this map.

27
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:32,820
Here.

28
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,440
Okay.

29
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,380
Then we need to wrap this.

30
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,210
Host inside motion that this it's just a motion.

31
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,600
Uh.

32
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:53,540
But if you close it and.

33
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,930
I mean.

34
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,040
We need to import it too.

35
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,160
So we import it.

36
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,940
Animate presents from frame in motion.

37
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,500
We just need to add motion to make.

38
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,340
Simple as that.

39
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,590
Now we need to add to what type of animation we'd like to have.

40
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:24,420
First thing first, we need to add a key here, because all the map, everything inside the map should

41
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,530
have a key.

42
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,850
And then we can add a initial value.

43
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:41,090
So initial value for this one and should be inside the object and the opacity amount to be zero.

44
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:51,800
The initial value when we this animation starts then I want to animate and has animation.

45
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,620
Until the capacity you get one.

46
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,710
And then when the animation finish, I want to exit it.

47
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,820
Bit capacity zero to.

48
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:10,650
Okay.

49
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,700
So first you start with zero, then one and then zero again.

50
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,250
So let's see it inside our application.

51
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,050
Let's add something.

52
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,880
For example, I just say let's start the server first.

53
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,750
Let's refresh the page to be signed and.

54
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,670
To be able to add a post.

55
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,100
Okay.

56
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,120
No adipose.

57
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:47,720
You just.

58
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,320
Check.

59
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,720
When they added, we see that a pause comes with a transition.

60
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,670
You see that's flashing.

61
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:04,620
We can actually increase the duration of the animation by just adding here transition.

62
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,010
And we changed it.

63
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:14,790
Time of different transmission duration to, for example, 1/2.

64
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,830
So now see, it's different.

65
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,870
For example, let's add something else.

66
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,120
Hello.

67
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,200
What?

68
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,920
See when we deleted also it.

69
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,030
It will be deleted by transition.

70
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,840
That is more nice because suddenly remove it.

71
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,480
It's not going to be nice.

72
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,030
Now let's add the same transition to this.

73
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,700
What's happening in section two?

74
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:47,970
When?

75
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,200
Now we add it.

76
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,400
Click on show more.

77
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,180
We see as suddenly new news comes.

78
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,290
We can add the same sort of animation to this one.

79
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,370
It's same things we did.

80
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,410
Uh.

81
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,190
So we need to go to widgets.

82
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:10,410
And inside the which is let's see where we wrapped our news.

83
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,410
Uh, yeah.

84
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,830
This is the new section.

85
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:22,930
So we should have the animate presence wrapping.

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,470
All the map section.

87
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,470
And we have the motion Dave rapping inside.

88
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,600
So just a motion.

89
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,500
That's their.

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,960
Wrapping this.

91
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,590
And we need to import them as well.

92
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,790
So we import animate from frame in motion and also.

93
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,960
Motion.

94
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,730
So Grandma emotion too, I think we are the important or not was just added manually.

95
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,660
Okay.

96
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:10,160
So as we did before, we need to add a key and the key would be the same article, the title we can

97
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,580
use.

98
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:18,530
Then we add the initial value, which would be a opacity.

99
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,060
Uh, zero.

100
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,270
And we have the animals.

101
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,060
Opacity one.

102
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,540
And finally, we have the exits.

103
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,260
All right.

104
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,470
That's why.

105
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,160
Initial opacity.

106
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,390
Yeah, we missed the.

107
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,290
Curly braces here.

108
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:58,740
Okay.

109
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,950
And finally, we have the exit.

110
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,440
Each has the capacity of zero.

111
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:08,720
Okay.

112
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,700
And also we can add the transition to.

113
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,440
So a transition.

114
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,590
With the duration of 1/2.

115
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,990
Let's take it inside the browser.

116
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,630
Let's reload the page.

117
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,020
Now you can see already the transition.

118
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,630
We can click on more.

119
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,290
It it.

120
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,970
Beautiful faith trance animation.

121
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:47,410
Okay, let's do the same things for the world to follow.

122
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:47,980
Six year.

123
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:58,070
So who to follow we can copy these things so we don't need to get is so hard to follow section it starts

124
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,460
from.

125
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,970
Uh, this deer.

126
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,990
This is the map.

127
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,510
So we covered this map with the.

128
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,400
Animate presents.

129
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:16,950
Until here and then we copy this motion that there and the.

130
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,260
They sit here and be close it.

131
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,410
At the end.

132
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,050
Uh.

133
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,400
It's here.

134
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:30,090
Okay.

135
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,370
Let's check.

136
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:35,660
Here.

137
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:42,500
We added a key article, the title, but the key should be the same as the key here.

138
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,590
So if we replace this one with this.

139
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,830
Let's see it now.

140
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,230
Now we click on here.

141
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,530
Now see, it comes with the transition.

142
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,160
Okay.

143
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:02,440
The other transition I want to add is for this menu because it's as you can see, the hover effects

144
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,730
quickly change from one to another.

145
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,490
You can simply add a transition here as well.

146
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:14,840
So we need to come back to Visual Studio code and we go to we close everything and we go to a styles

147
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,780
global set CFS.

148
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,980
This is that hover effect.

149
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,020
At the end, we can add a transition.

150
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,090
This is just telling us this class.

151
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,190
It's not related to frame in motion or something.

152
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,930
It's just to say transition and a duration.

153
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:43,780
We're just say 500 and we we want the effects to be is out.

154
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,620
Okay.

155
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:51,580
Now, you see, it's a bit different and also affects the other one as well here.

156
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:57,250
These icons now, they have a phase transition effect.

157
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,260
Okay.

158
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,180
And see.

159
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,020
Yes.

160
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:07,950
Okay.

161
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:15,600
And also, let's add the transition for having effect on these restrictions, like how to follow.

162
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,180
You see the gray, however.

163
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,050
Let's do it for them too.

164
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,390
So we go to.

165
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,430
Widgets.

166
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,600
Uh.

167
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,920
For the news.

168
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,960
We should go to news that Jesus.

169
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,530
And.

170
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,880
Let's see where we have we have a our effect here.

171
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,030
Actually, the duration is 200.

172
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,380
Let's make it 500 and is out.

173
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,140
Okay.

174
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,050
So let's test it again.

175
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,160
That's better.

176
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,110
For the whole to follow.

177
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,610
We need to go to visit.

178
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,910
And, uh, here, when we have a hover effect, it's at a transition.

179
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:14,030
With the duration of 500 milliseconds, which is just a half a second, and then with the ease out effects.

180
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,460
Okay.

181
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,350
Let's check.

182
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,560
Yeah, we can see the transition effect.

183
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:26,410
Okay.

184
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,730
That's it for this part.

185
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,380
Let's add it to get half.

186
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,010
We just take it and all.

187
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:38,450
And we may make a message by just saying get.

188
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:46,980
Comments with the message of ad animation.

189
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:58,700
Effects using framer motion.

190
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:00,610
Okay.

191
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,920
And the push.

192
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,900
Everything to get to.

193
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,320
Let's check what we have done so far.

194
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,300
We refresh this page by clicking on this tweeter.

195
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,970
Now we have 18 commits.

196
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:23,590
The last comment was committed, right, 11 seconds ago.

197
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,570
Which is an animation effect using frame and motion.

198
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,900
In fit that we added.

199
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,700
We brought.

200
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:45,350
Animate presents and motion from frame in motion and be covered the posts that map with animate presents

201
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:52,940
and also covered the post component with the motion that can be added the initial value animate and

202
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,510
exit.

203
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,690
And also we add a transition of 1/2 duration.

204
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,280
Okay.

205
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:07,790
In news that is, we added the same things we did with, uh, in.

206
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,280
News that.

207
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:09,940
Yes.

208
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,140
Yeah.

209
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:20,470
We just added this transition, I think this part but in which it that yes we we added the animate presence

210
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,500
and motion dev for the.

211
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,350
Well to follow section.

212
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,320
Here is the full to follow section.

213
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,120
Here is the new section.

214
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,750
This one was the new section.

215
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,010
The first one is the.

216
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,160
Uh.

217
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,230
Yes.

218
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:41,670
Why?

219
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,900
We had a two times.

220
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,730
News that.

221
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,020
Yes, I read it that.

222
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,470
Yes.

223
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:50,930
Touché.

224
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,730
Yes.

225
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:55,580
Now.

226
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,800
He did it out of here just two times.

227
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,150
Okay.

228
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:07,690
And finally, we in global success, we added transition duration 500 and is out of favor and we have

229
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:14,470
installed frame and motion to our package dot JSA.

230
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,190
Okay.

231
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:22,270
So, uh, I see you in the next section for more functionality.
