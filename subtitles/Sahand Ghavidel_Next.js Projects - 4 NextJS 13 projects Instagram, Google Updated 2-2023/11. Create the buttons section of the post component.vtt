00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.310
All right.

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:16.500
The last section we have finished with the header and image sections of the posts, in this section,

3
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.470
we're going to create the button section.

4
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.960
If you look at the final version of the project, here we have three buttons and all of them, they

5
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.820
have hovering effects.

6
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.010
Is all the buttons has the same hovering effects.

7
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.990
We're going to create a custom class name for the children's CSIS.

8
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.060
So let's go back to Visual Studio code.

9
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.550
And.

10
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.530
Let's bring the website right section.

11
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:07.330
And here inside the after this image, we create another section and we call it Barton's.

12
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.380
Or just say postpartum.

13
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:26.340
Here we added death and inside this to me at another death because we want the left icons to be inside

14
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.360
this there and the right icon.

15
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.510
Which is the bookmark icon to be on the right side.

16
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:42.310
So we need three new icons to import, the first one is heart icon.

17
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.690
You just say hard.

18
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.860
Icon.

19
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.050
The next one is chat icon.

20
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.000
And the last one, which goes to the right side is book.

21
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.560
Bookmark icon.

22
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.680
All right.

23
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.470
Let's use them here inside our death.

24
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.600
So first one is heart icon.

25
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.800
It's a sense that it's huge.

26
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.830
But we can use some class name to make a small, but as I mentioned, because all these icons has the

27
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.360
same features.

28
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.230
Were you going to use custom and.

29
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.390
Custom last name.

30
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.440
So we just say here, Peter, for example, but we go.

31
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.190
Two global stats, yes, yes.

32
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.710
And here we are at.

33
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.430
A layer component, so just right layer.

34
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:10.920
Component.

35
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:21.850
Components inside a set of curly braces, we just add that that button that we would like to create

36
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.790
and it's it's very easy.

37
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.890
We just need to at apply.

38
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:39.230
Here and after apply, you write down any Tilghman thesis that we like, for example, which set the

39
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.240
high fifty seven.

40
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.840
You can see now the heart got smaller.

41
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.840
And then we have hover effect of changing the scale.

42
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.250
Two hundred and twenty five percent.

43
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.200
And let's ask some transition.

44
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.640
To make us a little bit smooth transition and transform.

45
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.180
And the duration would be.

46
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.950
Hundred or 200 seconds?

47
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.510
Two hundred milliseconds, sorry.

48
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.390
And the effect is, is are.

49
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.140
And as usual, we have cursor pointer as well.

50
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.020
To make it pointing it.

51
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.150
So now we have the beautiful effect.

52
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.910
So if you add no, the other.

53
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.970
The other icons like the chat icon.

54
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:13.670
We just need to add the P10 class thing, so they have the same effect as the the other one.

55
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:25.830
So we have the other side, we have the bookmark icon as well with the same class of 18.

56
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.410
Let's bring everything next to each other by just using flags.

57
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:45.510
And we want this for this paper to be at the end, so we just use justify between.

58
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.690
It's a which means justified content space between.

59
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.010
Let's add some padding to the X.

60
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.220
Or in the horizontal just peaks.

61
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.910
And some padding to the top.

62
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:18.640
14TH pixels, so these are fine, we just need to bring these two next to each other, just be add flex

63
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.090
here.

64
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.050
And we add some space between them by using just space X.

65
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:38.450
For I think by repeating these classes, you now know many of them in your memory.

66
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:44.760
So that's it for this button section in the next section.

67
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.950
We're going to create this caption part.

68
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.380
And also, this imposed section for putting the comments.

69
00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:02.850
Before ending the violence and everything to get home, we just say get off.

70
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:10.200
And then you say get comments with the message of.

71
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.180
Creates.

72
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.740
The portents.

73
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:27.470
Sectioned off the post components.

74
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.600
And we push it to.

75
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:39.800
Get.

76
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.050
So let's check, so we refreshed the page and a guitar.

77
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.330
It should come in a second.

78
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.310
So we have.

79
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:59.730
The last comment is critic Barton's section of the post component with the only things we did was the

80
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.680
changing to post touches.

81
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:08.020
We added the post button section, which has.

82
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:17.790
A diff that covers another day and put mark icons, and the first Steve has two icons.

83
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.860
And also we added the B10 class.

84
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.730
But this one, we just use the layer components.

85
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:29.800
All right.

86
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:37.210
That was it for this section in the next section, we start with this caption and the post area.

87
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.220
So see you in the next section.
