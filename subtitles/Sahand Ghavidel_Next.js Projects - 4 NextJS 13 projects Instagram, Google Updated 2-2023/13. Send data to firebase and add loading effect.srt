1
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,560
All right.

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:14,680
In the last section, we have got the information from the session and filled this mini profile and

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,430
this picture.

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:24,040
In this section, we're going to upload and add information to the firebase and using this input.

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,940
Before starting to do that, we need to activate our firebase.

6
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:41,350
And uh, actually for the input we don't need, but for the image upload we need to activate our firebase.

7
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,510
So first, let's make the input and add it to the fire saw.

8
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:55,100
So, uh, for doing that, we need to get this information here as it states.

9
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:02,140
So we go back to Visual Studio code and inside to close this sidebar.

10
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,610
And this next off and we go to input.

11
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,350
Yes.

12
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:16,380
Insight input that just we we create a state and we call it inputs.

13
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,590
And, uh, this input.

14
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,980
We have this set input.

15
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,870
To change the value of it.

16
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,950
And this is going to be equal to use a state.

17
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,050
And the initial value would be an empty string.

18
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,130
So let's import user state as well.

19
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,950
So I'm not getting any other imports, so I import it manually here at the top.

20
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,690
We just say use a state.

21
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,700
From.

22
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,750
Reacts.

23
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:09,510
Okay.

24
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,340
Now.

25
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,380
We can change the value of the input based on this input.

26
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,060
So in the text area.

27
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,150
We can add a value.

28
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:29,850
After this place holder we just the value is equal to input

29
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,970
and the next things that we need to add.

30
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,820
Is just there aren't change, which is a.

31
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,940
And tracks the change.

32
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:53,610
And the change is going to be equal to a function which is get the value first.

33
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,620
This one is the value of this text area.

34
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,920
And then.

35
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,210
We get the value added as an input.

36
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,620
So we just set input and we pass this e.

37
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,750
We just it that target dot value.

38
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,010
Okay.

39
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,760
No, we should track our.

40
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,420
Let's refresh the page.

41
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,230
And let's track this state.

42
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,740
I open my def reactive tool.

43
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:44,680
If you haven't installed it, you can install it via the chrome marketplace and just search for React

44
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,100
diff tools or React developers tools.

45
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,240
And here you can click on components.

46
00:03:53,230 --> 00:04:00,940
Now if we click here and we write something, we should see a change here.

47
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,920
And this is this state.

48
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,090
So whatever we write here first is an empty string.

49
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,960
And then if we write, for example, hello, we see it here.

50
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,690
Now we want to.

51
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:22,510
Now when we click on this tweet, we want to send this information to fire a store.

52
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:24,840
Okay.

53
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:32,100
And firstly, I want to I want this button to be disabled when there's nothing inside the input.

54
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,870
We can simply add this charge, this one in the button.

55
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:47,040
We just say disabled is equal to when the input is not there.

56
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,310
And also, I don't want someone just at a space and can submit.

57
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,410
So we add a trim at the end.

58
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,940
So now here you see the tweet is disabled.

59
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,460
And also if we added space, we also add the tweet is disabled, too.

60
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,650
So when now we write something, we can tweet.

61
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,160
And also this is space not going to send as well.

62
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay.

63
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,500
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,910
It's going to be sin.

65
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:24,160
But when we don't have any space, we don't.

66
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,190
We cannot send anything because the button is disabled.

67
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:35,200
No, let's create the function that we want to send this information to fire the store.

68
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,040
So here in the button, we add on click as well.

69
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,480
And oncolytic is going to be.

70
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,420
Actually a fire function call sent.

71
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,560
Most.

72
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,660
We should get an error because we don't have this file.

73
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,550
We should create this function.

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,550
So we go at of top and here just delete this console.log.

75
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,330
We don't need it.

76
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,790
And here we create the function.

77
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:19,890
We just saw a concert and we named it for the a name it send post and this is going to be an asynchronous

78
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:20,670
function.

79
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,270
Because we want to wait for the data.

80
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,890
We want to wait for the data.

81
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,620
Data is going to gives us a promise.

82
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,490
So we need to edit async here.

83
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:49,780
And first thing we need to do, we need to create a reference for our document for a fire store.

84
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,110
It means we need to have a reference.

85
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:59,600
And then based on that reference, we need to update our.

86
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,030
I have fired Firestone.

87
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,800
So let's create a we just say doc ref.

88
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:11,960
Okay.

89
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,110
And then this is going to be a weight.

90
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,880
And the method we want to use is at Doc.

91
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,810
So this one should be camel case and we need to import all these things.

92
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:35,000
And Doc from Firebase and Firebase Forest or.

93
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,550
Okay.

94
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,380
And then the other things we need is just the.

95
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,810
We need to create a kind of collection.

96
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:56,050
And the collection is going to be from our database that we have created here inside this fire base

97
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:06,910
that, yes, if you remember, we created this and we export our database data so we can get this one

98
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,850
and add it here.

99
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:14,980
We just say DB and we can import it from Firebase, that is.

100
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:21,610
And the name of the collection would be posts.

101
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,340
Okay, now.

102
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,090
After this, what happens after adding the doc?

103
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,380
What we want to add to the documentation is these things.

104
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:45,450
We want to add, for example ID which is the we can get it from position that user dothe user ID.

105
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,080
So let's test this 1/1 and then.

106
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,370
We continue or we just add another field, which is.

107
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,120
The text, which is coming from inputs.

108
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:01,900
Okay.

109
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,070
Let's, uh.

110
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,690
See what error we are getting because, uh.

111
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,070
We didn't import something.

112
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:20,320
So we submit this beginning error that the attack is not defined.

113
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,200
Let's see, we can get the auto suggestion.

114
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,570
Yeah, we can auto import at dark from Firebase Fire Store.

115
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:35,760
Here we add it and we need to import collection as well.

116
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,260
So let's test it again.

117
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,580
So we didn't get any error.

118
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,270
So let's go to the firebase.

119
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,390
So let's search firebase or if you have it, I have that phone open.

120
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,150
You can go to Firebase, that Google dot com.

121
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:06,590
And be sure to sign in with the account that you have created the database.

122
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:14,600
So let's go to console and here we go to our project, which is Twitter version for.

123
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,820
Now we can go to Firebase database.

124
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,660
Now we check that the post is created or not.

125
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,300
So as you can see, I need to.

126
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,880
Initialize it.

127
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,140
So I just say it started with the test mode.

128
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,770
And, uh.

129
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,550
Create the.

130
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,900
Location.

131
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,500
It takes a while.

132
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,190
And, uh, maybe the first attempt didn't bore.

133
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,900
But we can test it again.

134
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,080
Let's see.

135
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,660
Maybe we have it.

136
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,680
I'm not sure.

137
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,550
Okay.

138
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,110
Now let's refresh the page.

139
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,590
No, we don't have any actually collection, so let's try it again.

140
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,060
So we took this on again.

141
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,010
The first two page.

142
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:33,800
Yeah.

143
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,350
We created the first one.

144
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,250
A post.

145
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,650
We created a collection called Posts.

146
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,070
Then we have a document.

147
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:54,630
This is a unique ID that is created by fire, face or fire store where we have an ID, which is the

148
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,290
user ID.

149
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,030
We are getting from the session and also we have the text.

150
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,750
So now, for example, if we do something else and treat.

151
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,750
Now we see in other fields.

152
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:19,140
But I wanted to actually make this one again empty when we when we tweet.

153
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,700
So we can simply do that after this function is triggered.

154
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,710
We can set inputs.

155
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,560
To an empty string again.

156
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,030
So let's try it again.

157
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,490
So we just say hello.

158
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,460
Retweet it now it's gone.

159
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,420
Let's check the database.

160
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,450
Yeah, we have it here.

161
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,020
Let's complete this one more.

162
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,320
We get the image.

163
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,430
We can get the.

164
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,750
Other things, the user image.

165
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:58,470
So let's go back here and complete this field.

166
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,470
We can get the user image.

167
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,540
Which is coming from cision Dutch user.

168
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,910
That image.

169
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,280
Then let's add timestamp timestamp.

170
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,800
We can get it by using a server.

171
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,820
Timestamp, which is the building function from the firebase.

172
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,810
We need to import it.

173
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,630
Server timestamp.

174
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:34,360
Let's.

175
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,650
We already imported here in our store.

176
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,070
Here.

177
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:39,710
Okay.

178
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:52,260
Uh, the other one the other things I want to add is the name, which is a session dot user name.

179
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,020
And finally, let's add the user name as well.

180
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,240
So let me just say user name.

181
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,000
We need these things actually later to get it.

182
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,210
When we are getting the information, we fill the post section.

183
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,910
Okay, we got everything.

184
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,880
Let's check it tested again.

185
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,660
Just say.

186
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:15,800
Uh.

187
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,600
Just a nice a treat it.

188
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,250
Okay, let's check.

189
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,140
I think this is and this is the one we get.

190
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,600
Now we have the I.D. name.

191
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,570
Text timestamp.

192
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,120
User image.

193
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,760
So we can get it, for example, test.

194
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:48,330
You can see the user image, the address, and also we have the user name.

195
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,440
So in the next step.

196
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,310
I want to be able.

197
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,380
To upload an image as well with their input.

198
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,890
So in order to do that, we need to add a reference.

199
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:13,340
We added input to this image, but we cannot add it inside the image tag.

200
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:19,970
We can make it an input by the hidden input and then we add a reference to it.

201
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:28,190
So when we click on this image, we trigger that input and that input is going to open a window that

202
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,050
we pick our image.

203
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:34,610
Then we create a link of that image.

204
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,980
And firstly we upload it to the Firebase as storage.

205
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:47,910
Then we add it to our database to link the link that we get from the storage.

206
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,460
To here.

207
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,590
Let's do it step by step that you can understand it.

208
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,540
So now.

209
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,760
We just go to.

210
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,070
To week we go to.

211
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,020
Input that.

212
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:04,600
Yes.

213
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,950
And we go to that photograph icon.

214
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:18,940
Uh, let's add a Dave here because I want to add the input inside that Dave.

215
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,910
So here after the photograph icon, we add inputs.

216
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:34,960
And a type of the input, as I mentioned, is it's going to be filed because we want to upload the file

217
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,450
and I think we can see it now here.

218
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:42,010
But as I mentioned, I want to hide this file.

219
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,730
This is working, but I want to hide this from.

220
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:49,990
And when we click on this icon, I want to upload the image.

221
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:55,210
Let's go back to the input touches and Visual Studio code.

222
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:02,140
And we change this input to Hidden.

223
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,910
So we we don't see it by default, but we add a reference for it.

224
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,180
So we want to connect this one to this one.

225
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,410
So the reference.

226
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,270
We want to choose.

227
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,480
We want to chair and a name for it.

228
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,160
Just a full file.

229
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,700
Picture ref.

230
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:35,260
And this reference we need to create it using use the ref a hook of the react.

231
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,830
So let's create it at a top.

232
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,430
Uh, here.

233
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:55,510
We create a constant and we call it fall, pick a ref and this is going to be equal to use ref and the

234
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,000
initial value should be null.

235
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,370
And uh, let's import this user F as well.

236
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,260
Oh.

237
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,050
We're just here at Youth Reform.

238
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,240
Now, inside this input that we have added here.

239
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:25,730
We added on click that is going to trigger a function.

240
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,530
We recall this function at.

241
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,860
Image ref.

242
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,530
Okay.

243
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,210
Or we just call it an image.

244
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,130
To post.

245
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:55,820
And now when we click on this photograph or we click on this div, I want to trigger this input.

246
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,850
So here inside this there we add unclear.

247
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,770
And this oncolytic is going to trigger a function.

248
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,840
Which refers to that file.

249
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:25,060
Pick a ref, and we just have to, uh, we need to add current.

250
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,000
And we click on it.

251
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,180
We just see click.

252
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,890
We use click method.

253
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:30,940
Okay.

254
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:32,550
Now.

255
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,780
Let's test it.

256
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,970
You just saying to add image to post is not defined.

257
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,950
We need to create the function that we called here.

258
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:49,180
So let's create it real quick to get rid of the error.

259
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,930
So here at the.

260
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,990
Here at the bottom, we create a constant.

261
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,850
We call this fun and image to post.

262
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,740
It's created just living like this.

263
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,320
And, uh, we need to add the error as well.

264
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:17,100
Okay, so let's test it here.

265
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,180
Now, we should.

266
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:27,400
So don't, uh, we just click if you click on the image now, we should trigger the inputs, as you

267
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:27,880
can see.

268
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,500
Now, we did.

269
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,480
Okay, that's working.

270
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,620
Now we need to get to your L for this one.

271
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,340
You created your alpha.

272
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:45,670
Or if you, for example, choose this image, we need to create a URL, a temporary URL, then we use

273
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:49,120
that URL to upload to fire storage.

274
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,640
So let's create the URL first.

275
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:59,110
So inside this F function that we have created, we create a reader.

276
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,890
And we just saying new.

277
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,860
File reader.

278
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:10,150
This is a built in function from giant JavaScript.

279
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,490
And when we create the reader.

280
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:25,670
And we also want to get their input off that phone, too, or the input that has a file.

281
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:31,010
This is the this one this it has the information of the file that we're uploading.

282
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:39,830
And we say if the that file that e that input has a file.

283
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:48,560
So we just e that target that files because we want to see all the files, but we want to just get the

284
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:54,380
first one because we want to upload only one image and if there is a file.

285
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:55,950
So.

286
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,980
Just put the read.

287
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,430
As Data, Earl.

288
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,330
Add it to this reader and this is going to be this e.

289
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,360
The target that file this one.

290
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,680
Okay.

291
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:23,950
Now that we did this one, we need to add on load.

292
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:36,820
Through this reader and this is going to get the the reader event.

293
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,470
And this one is going to give us the earth.

294
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:50,390
So like this we can now console.log reader.

295
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:52,900
Event.

296
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,200
Dot target dot results.

297
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:07,620
Just now we go back to our website and we just upload an image.

298
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,320
Just choose one.

299
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,860
We can open the console log.

300
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,390
You can see the URL here.

301
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,510
You can not see the image with this one, but this is just the data.

302
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,570
But we can use this one to upload to.

303
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,330
Uh.

304
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,550
Let me test this.

305
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,120
I don't.

306
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,560
Think we can see any image here, actually.

307
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:47,170
Yeah, actually, we can see the image, but you can just see a little bit of the image.

308
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:51,740
But, uh, this is just saved in the browser.

309
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,150
But we need to upload this one to the database.

310
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,630
So let's close this.

311
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:03,310
So now we understand that we got the URL for the image.

312
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:12,220
Now we can use this URL to add it to the a storage section of the firebase.

313
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,920
So we need to.

314
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,710
Let me just delete the console log.

315
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:21,700
And instead of this, save this one in there in a state.

316
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,080
So we create a state here and we call it.

317
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,410
And selected file or just say sit.

318
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,750
Selected.

319
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,860
Uh.

320
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:39,460
Sorry.

321
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,540
Just say.

322
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,470
Selected.

323
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:52,510
File.

324
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,480
And we can set it to set selected file.

325
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,000
Okay.

326
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,010
And this is going to be equal to user state.

327
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:09,820
And the initial value should be.

328
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,340
Should be null.

329
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,870
And now after we got the URL.

330
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,880
We said it.

331
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,580
We say it inside this hook.

332
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:30,320
So we're just a set selected file is equal to this.

333
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,700
Let's test it.

334
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,730
We open the reactive tool.

335
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,070
Right click on this.

336
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,940
And, uh.

337
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:43,980
Now, when we're writing something, we're still getting to this state.

338
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,520
Let's upload the image.

339
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,690
We should see a change here.

340
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:57,760
Still?

341
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,240
No.

342
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:01,700
Yeah.

343
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,170
I mean it, I think to click on this tweet party.

344
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:06,920
Yeah.

345
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,770
No, we got the euro.

346
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,740
Uh, let's try it again.

347
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
Refresh the page.

348
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,310
To be sure.

349
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,940
So we go to the inputs.

350
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,360
Select the input to see the hooks.

351
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,910
So we write something you see here.

352
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,670
We select the image.

353
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:38,600
When we click on tweet, we should see a URL.

354
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:43,440
Uh.

355
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:43,950
We don't.

356
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,200
Let's try it again.

357
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,140
No.

358
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,610
Is it?

359
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,410
I don't know what's happened.

360
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,240
It has a delay, so it's fine.

361
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,080
Uh.

362
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,680
Let's first initialize the storage.

363
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,360
So inside the firebase, we go to a storage section.

364
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:16,570
We just need to change the rules here because now nobody is allowed to read or write inside this storage.

365
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:23,240
And so let's just remove this part and we publish it again.

366
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,870
Now let's go back to Visual Studio code and just after.

367
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,660
Uh.

368
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,980
The place that we want to and the center post.

369
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,350
Just here.

370
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,160
After this, first we create a reference for the.

371
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,630
Storage is just a.

372
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,590
Image ref.

373
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:57,190
And this is going to be equal to a riff raff is a building method office storage.

374
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:04,690
And we just say we get this storage that we have created in Firebase.

375
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,400
This is storage data.

376
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:12,370
And then we say we want to save it in this address.

377
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,540
And the address is dynamic as well.

378
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,430
We just say save it in a folder called posts.

379
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,850
Then forward slash.

380
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:33,220
We at that reference we created here doc ref because each document has a reference as well and we want

381
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:33,920
to get the it.

382
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:35,360
Sorry.

383
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:35,770
We want to.

384
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:36,150
Yeah.

385
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:42,160
We want to get it to I.D. So each person is going to upload to its own

386
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:54,720
I.D. It's going to be like a very tidy and it's very easy to read later.

387
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,870
So we just say just the path will be like this.

388
00:28:59,350 --> 00:28:59,680
So.

389
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,510
And after that.

390
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,050
We just put it inside another folder called Image.

391
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:08,540
Okay.

392
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,720
Now we have the image reference.

393
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,930
Now we can upload it.

394
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:26,480
So first we say if there is any file, if there is a selected file, is if there is a link that we we

395
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:31,250
created here, if there is something in the hook, then.

396
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:42,330
We need to wait for this method just to upload a string because we want to upload a string now.

397
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,850
Uh, it's a URL which looks like a string, so.

398
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:54,730
And then we just say image ref because we want to put it inside this.

399
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,900
Address.

400
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,420
And what we want to add is that selected file.

401
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,560
Okay.

402
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,080
And finally.

403
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:10,110
Which method we want to use is data URLs.

404
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,580
So we just say data or save it as a data.

405
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:15,830
You are.

406
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,500
After this one happened.

407
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,740
When this one uploaded completely, then.

408
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,570
We make another function, we just say a sink.

409
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:34,190
And this is going to be.

410
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:45,390
At first we can get the don't download the URL, so we just download.

411
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,580
You are our.

412
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,540
And this is equal to weight.

413
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:06,230
And we can use a function called get download URL, which is this one is coming from the storage to

414
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,310
it.

415
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,880
So we need to import that later.

416
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,910
So we just say image ref.

417
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,320
Okay, then.

418
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,710
No, I think.

419
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,030
So let's try it now.

420
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,130
We add the image?

421
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,100
We write something and treat it.

422
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:36,740
So now we are getting error because we haven't import this thing.

423
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,750
So the ref is going to be found.

424
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:45,590
Firebase is storage then it's storage is coming from Firebase, that is.

425
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,820
And now we have the dark rear.

426
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,460
We we need to import upload string from the storage get.

427
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,830
You are from a storage.

428
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,090
Uh.

429
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:01,910
I think it's fine.

430
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,190
You just try it again.

431
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,820
So we write something, we add the image.

432
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,310
I retweeted.

433
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,480
So we didn't get any error.

434
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,620
So now we are getting error actually file storage.

435
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,380
Server response.

436
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:21,770
Okay.

437
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,410
This a fresh page.

438
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,670
Try it again.

439
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,210
I cannot read the property of.

440
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,050
No.

441
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,540
Upload streaming.

442
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,670
Let's check it again.

443
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,590
So here.

444
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,360
We have an image ref we are getting from here.

445
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,760
So far pick.

446
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,380
This is correct.

447
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,390
That is fine.

448
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,380
And.

449
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,660
Know, we don't need this selective fall here.

450
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:36,070
We just need to get the download you are from the image risk.

451
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,090
Now we tested.

452
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:45,510
We just write something, choose an image and retweet.

453
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,720
So we didn't get any errors.

454
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,780
So we go to a database and we go to files.

455
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:59,820
Now we created this post folder and inside this we have the.

456
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,670
User ID if sorry post ID.

457
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:13,210
This is the post I.D. if you go to if you check now in VR queue, if you go to file store database.

458
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,520
We have it and we are Q Here.

459
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,360
So we got this one and then.

460
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,340
Now.

461
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:29,460
Inside this, we have a folder called Image.

462
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,610
We have a file called Image and then you can see the image here.

463
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:38,460
And also this is the URL.

464
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,910
So we click here, we see the URL here.

465
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:42,810
Okay.

466
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:51,690
Now we want to add this URL to this virus store here as a new.

467
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,770
Uh, document here.

468
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,700
New field.

469
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:05,610
So inside this new week in our Q, for example, we add another field called image.

470
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,550
Okay, so here we are.

471
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:14,100
We finished this one, and now we need to update our documents.

472
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,550
So.

473
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:24,390
Instead of deleting it when we create it, instead of making a new document, we update our previous

474
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,540
document and we add a new field.

475
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:31,050
So we need to create and wait here.

476
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:38,010
And then we just say, Update doc, which is a building method from the fire store.

477
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,450
We need to import it.

478
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:50,900
So let's say I think we can import that now from foreign store and this is going to get some information

479
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,950
from document.

480
00:35:52,190 --> 00:36:01,460
First is the database and then we have the collection name, which is posts.

481
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,620
After that we add we just said in the post.

482
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,910
Just check the document reference.

483
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,720
With this idea.

484
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,990
Which is here.

485
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,410
And we are getting from the document that we have created.

486
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:27,630
So go to this one and then add this field here, which is image download.

487
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,340
You are out.

488
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,260
Which we are getting from here.

489
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:36,890
Okay.

490
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,990
Let's test it again.

491
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:43,430
And before testing, let's, uh, delete all the everything.

492
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:43,880
So.

493
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,440
We can.

494
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:50,740
Uh, see the difference, because we have created too many posts.

495
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,220
So let's delete this.

496
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,990
Let's do this search as well.

497
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:03,970
Okay.

498
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,240
Now let's test it.

499
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,590
We go to here.

500
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,470
We just write, for example.

501
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,990
Hello.

502
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,630
We had an image.

503
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:15,830
And we tweet it.

504
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,250
Let's go to.

505
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:20,830
Here.

506
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,690
We refresh the page in a storage.

507
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,590
Yeah.

508
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,860
We have the post.

509
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:29,660
Uh, we.

510
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,430
This is the post I.D. and we have the image here.

511
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,190
Right.

512
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,090
This is the image.

513
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:42,810
And the Earl should be inside the fire starter.

514
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,520
So we go to fire store.

515
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,940
This is the same ID.

516
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,420
And, uh.

517
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:53,930
Now we don't see it.

518
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,120
It didn't add the image.

519
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:00,390
Let's see what Sphere Mystic we have done.

520
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,100
Oh, I think.

521
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,120
Yeah.

522
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:12,170
We didn't import the dock and up to our building for the dock, so we need it imported from Firestone.

523
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,050
So let's test it again.

524
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,150
So just say.

525
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,270
Nice.

526
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,770
And the image.

527
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,070
He tweeted.

528
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,090
Let's go to now.

529
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:36,880
We have a different post, the new post this year and this post has the image field as well.

530
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,720
If you check the image field.

531
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,300
It pasted here.

532
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,730
It should be the image of the.

533
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,940
Picture that we have uploaded.

534
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:48,470
Okay.

535
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:59,110
The other things I want to do when, uh, no, the tweet button is, uh.

536
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,010
Disabled.

537
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:05,330
As you can see, I want to make it disabled.

538
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:09,840
When we when we have we don't have an image to.

539
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,540
Or.

540
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:22,090
Um, maybe that's not a good idea, because in Twitter, you can just tweet without any image.

541
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,430
That's, uh, yeah, that's not a good idea.

542
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,390
So, uh, let's move on to the next step.

543
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,930
The next step I want when my upload the, when I'm uploading, I want to see the preview, the image

544
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,280
of the image as well.

545
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:42,160
So we have the URL in the set.

546
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,740
We are saving it here in the selected file.

547
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,650
We want to use that one and show a preview of the image here.

548
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,090
So let's do this one.

549
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:59,060
So you go back to Visual Studio code.

550
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,000
Just after the.

551
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,010
Input it takes area.

552
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,330
So the text area is inside.

553
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:12,970
Uh.

554
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:15,840
They're after this.

555
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:21,330
Dare we just say if there is a selected file?

556
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,870
If someone selected a file, then.

557
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,110
Just share add a div.

558
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,680
We added their fear.

559
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:37,420
So we cannot do it like this.

560
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,650
Let me add a parenthesis here.

561
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:50,710
We additive here and in scientist there.

562
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:55,190
We're going to have our image.

563
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:03,190
So we just see the ad image and the source would be that selected file.

564
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:09,840
Let's test.

565
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:10,970
Test it.

566
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,400
It's a fresh two page.

567
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,920
Let's write something and choose an image.

568
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,180
Choose the same image and retweet it.

569
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,500
Uh.

570
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,760
Let's see.

571
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,260
The problem is, no, I understand the problem.

572
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:53,030
The problem is when we choose the image, it takes time to be fitted as a.

573
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:54,420
Sit?

574
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:55,010
No.

575
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,320
You're here instead of sitting sits.

576
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:04,280
If sit selected fault exist we should stay selected for.

577
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,630
That's a problem.

578
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,900
We are getting some error sometimes.

579
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:15,790
So now we go back to our code.

580
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,680
We choose an image.

581
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,540
Now we see the image.

582
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,210
Actually, let's refresh the page and be tried again.

583
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,390
So we write down something.

584
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,630
We choose image.

585
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,940
The image should come now.

586
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:36,950
So, uh.

587
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,930
Taking too long.

588
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,340
Let's see.

589
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,440
Let's delete this phone.

590
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,190
I mean, be sure that you're uploading something.

591
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:02,640
So you're right on.

592
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,270
Uh.

593
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,060
But there is some problem here.

594
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:27,150
After this completing the center pose.

595
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:31,860
We should actually set the.

596
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,190
Set the selected fall to null again.

597
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,770
Let's do this 1/1.

598
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,250
Let's refresh the page.

599
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,270
No database is empty.

600
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:01,060
Let's try it again.

601
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:03,820
We choose an image.

602
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,340
We write something.

603
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,540
So I don't have any upload, but when I'm uploading I want to choose.

604
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,960
Again, we see the image here, so it should be a problem in our code.

605
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:29,290
So let's test check it again.

606
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:32,710
Let me pause the video and check it and come back.

607
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:34,510
All right.

608
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:41,090
I find the problem inside the input that's inside next to the.

609
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:47,070
Photograph instead of unclear, we should say unchanged.

610
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:50,860
That was a problem.

611
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:55,060
So now we tested again.

612
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,930
Now if you choose the image.

613
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:04,520
Just quickly after that, we see the image as a preview here.

614
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:10,750
The other things I want to do, I want to add a cross icon.

615
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,860
So when I click on it, I remove the image.

616
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:23,080
So when someone is change his mind, they want to add another image, he can just remove it.

617
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:29,390
So let's go back to Visual Studio code and just, uh.

618
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,240
Here that we're showing the image.

619
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,380
Let me see.

620
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,320
What was it?

621
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,380
You're just here.

622
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,540
Just above this one, we add.

623
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:53,950
Icon, we can use the icon from hero icons.

624
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,090
So we just need to import it.

625
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:02,800
So just the x icon and the auto imported.

626
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,320
Let's see it now.

627
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:08,080
It's huge.

628
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:10,300
Let's just style this.

629
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,060
He had a class name.

630
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:23,090
We set the heights to be five and we changed the color to be white.

631
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,260
So let's see.

632
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,390
We don't see it because it went.

633
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:32,210
Uh.

634
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:38,320
I think, uh, color lists change the color of black.

635
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:44,900
And they tried.

636
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:50,590
Yeah, we see it here, but I want this to be on the image here.

637
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,740
So we changed the.

638
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:02,640
Position to be absolute and we change the position of this diff to be relative.

639
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,290
So this is absolute based on that.

640
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:09,930
So now if you test, it's came on the top of this.

641
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:13,010
Uh, let's make it a little bit bigger.

642
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,990
So just say maybe seven.

643
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:19,560
And that's fine.

644
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,420
And then let's just style it more.

645
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:27,360
For example, we change the cursor to B pointer.

646
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,070
Then when I click on it.

647
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,230
So we add it on, click on it.

648
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:39,660
So when I click, I want to close, remove the image.

649
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:47,040
So we just say on click and this is going to trigger a function.

650
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:54,900
We're going to set this selected file to NULL again.

651
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,080
Okay, let's try it.

652
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:02,860
So when we click on this, you should remove the image.

653
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:06,100
Now we can choose a different image.

654
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:08,900
Maybe this one.

655
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:10,070
Okay.

656
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,850
So we can remove this.

657
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:12,580
Oh, yeah.

658
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:16,580
We can also added some shadow effect too.

659
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:20,900
So they can say text shadow.

660
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,620
Or because it's just a shadow, I think.

661
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,090
Shadow minion.

662
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,260
And the shadow of cholera.

663
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:40,750
One of be white.

664
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:51,000
So at least in the dark places, the problem is we see that around the earth.

665
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:57,600
So we can make it a circle using the for.

666
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:00,740
Like this.

667
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:03,980
So we can see the see it better.

668
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:08,120
And, uh.

669
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:12,330
Let's close this and add another image.

670
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:15,010
Um.

671
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:19,710
Doesn't look that much nice, but, uh.

672
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,000
No, that's fine.

673
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:27,060
You can you can check it later or I can I can add it as an update.

674
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:28,260
Let's move on.

675
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,840
And, uh.

676
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:38,480
So we we've done all the parts, so let's test it again.

677
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,170
Just say test.

678
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:44,850
A tweet.

679
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:54,570
And uh, when that, uh, it's uploaded.

680
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:02,670
Uh, we don't see the image and that the text is gone so we can see it inside the virus or.

681
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:07,570
So.

682
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,650
This is the test.

683
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:12,850
This is the image.

684
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:13,990
Everything is working.

685
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,900
And I want to add some loading effects.

686
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:24,380
So when I'm uploading so it's not going to this doesn't look like a freezing something I want.

687
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:31,630
This has some loading effect so we can add a loading stage here at the top.

688
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:45,170
Uh, just after this selected, we create a constant and we call this loading and we just say, Set

689
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:45,710
loading.

690
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:59,320
And this is going to be a user state and the first value is going to be false.

691
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:01,410
Okay.

692
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,230
Then when we.

693
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:07,960
Want to send a post.

694
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:10,240
Just.

695
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:10,850
That's fine.

696
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:16,810
Before sending first, we check if the loading is happening.

697
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,270
So if the loading is true.

698
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:21,790
Then.

699
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,130
We.

700
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,320
We want to return.

701
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:36,110
We don't want to continue this and fire this loading, so we want to return.

702
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,090
If the loading is false, we want to set it to be true.

703
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:45,980
So here is just this set loading to be true.

704
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,930
Okay, now and then, after everything happened, everything.

705
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,850
The image is uploaded.

706
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:56,510
Everything is done for the database.

707
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,980
We want to set the loading again to false.

708
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:02,300
Okay.

709
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,710
Let's see it inside the.

710
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,030
Reactive tool.

711
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,930
So we click on here and we see we've got two components.

712
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:21,910
Let's add something like Hello and add the image.

713
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:28,970
Now we see the image url and this false is loading probably because.

714
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,900
And then when we tweet, the loading will be true.

715
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:41,520
And when the loading or when it's uploaded, it should come back to false like this.

716
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:42,270
Okay.

717
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:48,360
Now we can use this as state to add some loading effects.

718
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,430
The loading effect, I want to add.

719
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:53,340
I just want this image.

720
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,310
That's, uh, we choose.

721
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:57,770
Oh.

722
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,440
Refresh the fish.

723
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:09,910
I want this image to be and to have animation when it's uploaded.

724
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,480
So.

725
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,170
Let's go to the Amish.

726
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:18,820
I think it was after the Texas area here.

727
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:27,440
And we will delete this and we just add a class name and this class name is going to be dynamic.

728
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:30,470
You just say if it's loading.

729
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,870
Now is a valuable.

730
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:41,120
So let's see what's happening here.

731
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:48,000
Oh, here should be a dollar sign.

732
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:52,770
So we say if the loading is true, then.

733
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:59,520
Let's add it animates of uh.

734
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,090
Just a.

735
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:07,370
We have a different we have a pulse animate.

736
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,380
So let's test this one.

737
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:19,480
It's closed this and we add image.

738
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:27,190
We write something and we tweet.

739
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:33,280
When it's loading, we see that we have a pulse effect on the image.

740
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:34,950
Okay.

741
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,070
Now the loading finish, the image is gone.

742
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:44,820
Uh, the other thing I want to do is when I'm loading.

743
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:51,510
I don't want to be the person able to tweet.

744
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,800
So I want to remove this part as well.

745
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:59,540
So, uh, here in this div.

746
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:03,510
That we had at the bottom.

747
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,520
We can just say if.

748
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,390
It's loading.

749
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:15,140
Uh, even if it's not.

750
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:17,420
Loading that show.

751
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:18,590
It's like this.

752
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:23,920
So we bring everything.

753
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:26,220
Inside.

754
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:30,660
Uh.

755
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,650
I think until.

756
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,200
At least this year.

757
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:43,500
And this is what we need to add.

758
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,900
A fragment, empty fragment.

759
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:55,320
And we just until here we bring it and it's not here until the bottom.

760
00:55:58,210 --> 00:55:58,570
Okay.

761
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:00,820
Now we tested again.

762
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:04,450
We shouldn't see these buttons when we are uploading.

763
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:07,630
So we try.

764
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:08,710
Now it's gone.

765
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,200
It's working now.

766
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:13,890
Okay.

767
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,360
It's working nicely.

768
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:20,120
Uh, so that was it for the input section.

769
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:23,170
I think we have already completed this far.

770
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:30,400
In the next section, we are going to get the post that we have uploaded and show it here dynamically.

771
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,730
These are just a static that we have created before.

772
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:41,440
So before finishing the video, let's add everything to get by using it at all.

773
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:45,130
And we made the we make a message.

774
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:49,190
They're using get commands.

775
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,110
And the message would be.

776
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:54,380
We just.

777
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:57,900
Send.

778
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:02,290
Data to fire.

779
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,420
Base.

780
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:10,330
And ad loading.

781
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:13,660
Effects.

782
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:21,190
So we push everything to get half and we check what we have done so far.

783
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:24,540
So we go to get Hoppy.

784
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,610
Refresh the page here.

785
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:32,460
Now we have three comments and the last committee sent it out.

786
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:33,630
I made a mistake here.

787
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:35,820
But that's fine.

788
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:41,580
So we we've done quite a lot, actually.

789
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,870
So three stages.

790
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:50,590
We have done the first stage, first uploading just the input section.

791
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:53,520
Then we added the ability to upload the.

792
00:57:56,490 --> 00:57:57,120
Image.

793
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:03,770
And then we completed by adding the loading effect.

794
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:07,310
So it's quite a lot.

795
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:09,740
If I want to explain it, it can't fix a lot.

796
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:16,540
But uh, so these three parts we have done so just uploading the input.

797
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:18,980
You can watch the video again this part.

798
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:23,390
So we have input, then we have the image and then the loading part.

799
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:31,430
So see in the next section for getting the information from the database and show it inside the post

800
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,210
section.
