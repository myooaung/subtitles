00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:09.330
Welcome to the project. In this project, we're going to create a Google clone using Next.js and Tailwind
1

2
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.050
CSS
2

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.030
As you can see from the final version of the project, we have three parts in the home page, including
3

4
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.690
a header.
4

5
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.120
A search form and also a footer.
5

6
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.480
Inside the header, we can authenticate the users.
6

7
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.490
If we click on this sign-in button,
7

8
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.350
we're going to be redirected to another page, which gives us the ability to sign in with Google.
8

9
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.190
Here we can choose one of our Gmail accounts.
9

10
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.990
For example, this one.
10

11
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.350
Which is going to sign us in with our Google account and we get the image here from Google.
11

12
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.820
Here we have a search form in the center.
12

13
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.340
We can search for anything we want.
13

14
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.370
For example, a search for next js.
14

15
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.760
As soon as we press enter, we get the results from Google Search API.
15

16
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.390
By using server side rendering technique, the response would be very fast and almost in real time.
16

17
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:35.440
We can get the results in two categories web and images, as you can see in these two options, 
17

18
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.010
as a default, 
18

19
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.880
We see the web result, which includes title.
19

20
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.530
Link.
20

21
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.370
And also this snippet.
21

22
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:51.340
At the end of the page, we have pagination here by clicking on the next button.
22

23
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.370
We see the next 10 results.
23

24
00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.990
Now even we can go back to the previous results by clicking on the previous button.
24

25
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.980
The other option is the image tap here.
25

26
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:14.990
If we click on this tab, we can see the image results related to the same term that we have already
26

27
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.440
searched.
27

28
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.520
That was in our case next js.
28

29
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.920
Here, we also have pagination at the end, and also our page is completely responsive.
29

30
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.070
If we zoom here, we see that the number of columns are changed depending on the Zoom level.
30

31
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.510
So we're going to achieve this using the Tailwind CSS grid system.
31

32
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.630
On the homepage, if you click on this icon.
32

33
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.970
We have a button called I'm Feeling Lucky.
33

34
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.190
This button allows us to see the search results for a random word.
34

35
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.060
This random word is created using a random word API that we are going to learn in this project.
35

36
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.140
So let's test this one by clicking on this button.
36

37
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.350
You can see that we we already searched for a random word.
37

38
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.770
And we are getting the same result, the same pattern, like we're getting the web and images like before.
38

39
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.170
Let's test this one again.
39

40
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.040
with clicking on the I'm Feeling Lucky button again.
40

41
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.710
Now we are getting another term.
41

42
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:42.080
All this Google clone website is styled using Tailwind CSS latest version, which is now version 3.0,
42

43
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:49.880
and the entire source code is available in this GitHub repository, which you can find inside the resource
43

44
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.420
section.
44

45
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.710
You can also have a preview of the project from this URL.
45

46
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.200
google-v3.100jsprojects.com
46

47
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.740
In the next section, we're going to install Next.js and Tailwind CSS, and we create the beginning
47

48
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.560
template. So, see you in the next section.
