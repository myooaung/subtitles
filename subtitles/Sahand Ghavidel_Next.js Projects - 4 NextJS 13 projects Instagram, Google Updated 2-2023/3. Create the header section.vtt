WEBVTT
1
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.220
All right, in the last section, we have installed next year and months to assess.

2
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:22.210
And we've got this helloworld in our local host three thousand in this section, we are going to create

3
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.710
the header of our website.

4
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.340
Actually, we have three parts.

5
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:39.420
We have the header, we have the body and the footer, so inside the index that, yes, we let delete

6
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.180
this hello world, so we have three parts.

7
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.850
The first part is header.

8
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.920
Then we have the body section.

9
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.250
And finally, we have the footer for the header.

10
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.060
We we can create a component and start creating the header.

11
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.610
So in order to create the components first, we create a folder called components inside that we create

12
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.350
a header, that jazz file.

13
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:22.050
So in this level, I mean, the package that Jason level outside to all the folders, we create a folder

14
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.090
and we color components.

15
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.230
And inside this folder, we create a file called Header the Trace.

16
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.820
Here we can use our sea to create a reactor functional component.

17
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.130
For next year, we don't need to import react.

18
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.360
It's optional.

19
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.200
We can leave it there, or we just we can delete it now inside the.

20
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.000
Index that, yes, we can add this component, so we just write down here.

21
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.020
And in order to import the header.

22
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.920
We can use contour space to get the auto suggestion.

23
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:21.980
And just remember that you have to keep it open, so you get the such as if this is close, you get

24
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.740
you don't get the suggestion like this.

25
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.960
So if you click on the first author suggestion, we get here the import header from components forward

26
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.770
slash header.

27
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.620
So let's continue with the header part.

28
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.560
Let's see, and we start the server again using npm run dev.

29
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:54.310
I want to put the website on the right side so you can see the changes in real time and keep the coding

30
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:55.900
on the left side.

31
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.050
So let's close this left side.

32
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.500
You don't need it for now.

33
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.870
So we have more space on the left side.

34
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.850
We go to A.j.'s and we change this diff to better because we're making it harder.

35
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.640
So this is going to help the search engines to rank our Web site.

36
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.470
So we need to use the proper syntax.

37
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.070
So inside the header, we have actually two deaths.

38
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.690
That one day or the left side wonder one at a dinner for the right side.

39
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.340
Let's look at the final version.

40
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.380
And I just draw it so you can see it better.

41
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.580
So we have a.

42
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.100
Let me change the color this one.

43
00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.650
So we have a hitter at the top.

44
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.360
Which is the header pack inside the header tank?

45
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.490
We have to this.

46
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.640
One, Dev is here.

47
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.370
Let me do it again, so we have one.

48
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:29.810
They're here inside this fund, we have one div at the left and one on the right side.

49
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.020
So each of these two is inside are the tax.

50
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.890
So two attacks here.

51
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:48.480
To this side, and also, we have another component called user on the right side.

52
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:59.480
So let's go back to Visual Studio code, so we have the header and to do so, this is the one and this

53
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.160
is another one for the right side.

54
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:11.020
So inside the first one, we have two paragraphs, the first one is saying about.

55
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.620
And the next one is.

56
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.730
Mr.

57
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.740
Let's refresh the page to see the changes.

58
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.200
Now we have about a store.

59
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.390
And onto the next one.

60
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.700
The directive on the right side, we have.

61
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.560
Gmail.

62
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.090
In the paragraph, so G.M. and the paragraph.

63
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.610
They should like.

64
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.400
You need.

65
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.750
And just I forgot how to do it, so.

66
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.820
Paragraph inside his Gmail.

67
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.490
Then we have the images.

68
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:23.880
So now we have all the paragraphs and finally, we have another component called user, so let's create

69
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.100
that component now.

70
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:34.820
So inside the components folder, we create a file, we call it user touches and we use Odyssey to create

71
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.620
a reac functional component.

72
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.400
Just leave it like this for now.

73
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:51.320
And we import it inside the hair in the second death, so we just use our here and we import it using

74
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.370
counter space.

75
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.720
And we get this other suggestion and the important issue.

76
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.660
So now we have everything else.

77
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.970
Now it's time to stall the.

78
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.020
Thanks.

79
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.410
First, we need to bring these three to the right side.

80
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:16.190
So we need to add a Flex display flex to that header at a time.

81
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:22.370
And we just use just to fight between to outer space between there.

82
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.630
So we just added class name here.

83
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.940
We changed the display to Flex, bring them next to each other.

84
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.940
We can't use justify it fee to add a space between the.

85
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.630
As you can see, it's completely connected to the wall.

86
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.130
We can add a padding of five.

87
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:55.170
To push them a little bit inside, we changed the text to be a small.

88
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:07.420
And we changed the text color to gray, but not the just gray 700, this would be fine.

89
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.370
This is similar to the Google itself.

90
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.050
All right.

91
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:21.920
So now we push them to the side.

92
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:33.110
And let's style each div here, because both of these styles are similar.

93
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:39.010
So we we can just choose the tool cursor.

94
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.080
Using old, I keep it here and here.

95
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:50.730
So both are flags we want to bring them next to each other, the added space between their.

96
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.890
And the space would be a space X.

97
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.500
For.

98
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:02.450
So you can see here.

99
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.060
The added space.

100
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.250
Next thing is.

101
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:16.140
We just bring them to the center using items sent.

102
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:25.910
OK, all right, so maybe you can see the teams, but maybe add the image here you are you.

103
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.820
You see that the pics are actually in the center of the image.

104
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:42.370
So this item center is for this, for this, for instead of doing this dual cursor, we can use something

105
00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.820
called layer components, intel and CSF.

106
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:52.360
So we add one class, but this class includes multiple classes.

107
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.940
So it's it's like a custom class.

108
00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:04.550
The only things we need to do is just go to global success, and we add that layer components.

109
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:16.870
So we click on the global stats thesis here and just here we add a layer component.

110
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:25.950
Which is a cost them utility, and we call this cost them class.

111
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:32.100
We just call it link, and this link includes several classes.

112
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:37.470
In order to apply this, we need to just right down here apply.

113
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.190
And after this base, we at the.

114
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:53.110
Our the classes that we want to use, let's first and the class link to the header.

115
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:58.190
So to all of them, we choose all of them using all.

116
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:04.250
And we add a class name and they call this class link.

117
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:06.700
All right.

118
00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.040
No, we can see the result.

119
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:18.820
So we go back to global success and after a year, we just say if someone hover over the.

120
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.980
Text just the underline.

121
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.880
Now you can see the underlying.

122
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:31.400
Yeah.

123
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:39.890
And then I want Dick Cursor to point pointer when we hover over, so we add a cursor pointer here,

124
00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.870
so it's going to apply to all of them.

125
00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:47.020
So when we now hover over these elements, we see appointing an.

126
00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:49.870
All right.

127
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:52.630
So this is the way you.

128
00:11:53.140 --> 00:12:01.870
For example, if you add many classes, you just need to know and this class link to anywhere you like

129
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.090
to apply all the classes together.

130
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:15.860
Yeah, that was it for the Heather section, because the user part needs to add authentication and several

131
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.280
things, we cannot finish it in a short video.

132
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.950
So this video is going to be very long.

133
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:29.570
So in the next section, we're going to cover this user section and we're going to get the image from

134
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:38.330
the Google authentication and we'll be going to add the ability to sign in or and sign out.

135
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.900
Let's first add this one to get her.

136
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.300
It's.

137
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.070
Uh.

138
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:50.980
Clear.

139
00:12:51.100 --> 00:13:00.220
Let's clear the terminal, and no, because this is the second time we are pushing our kids to get off

140
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.590
our repository to GitHub.

141
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:05.920
We just need to and get and all.

142
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:11.750
Kit Cometh with the message of.

143
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:16.270
Creates.

144
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:20.670
The head

145
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:29.310
section, and we just need to right, get push to push everything to get tough.

146
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.270
So if you go to GitHub now.

147
00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:42.260
We refresh the page and we go to our repository now we have three comments, and the last one is 20

148
00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.520
seconds ago that we just created, so we click here to go there.

149
00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:52.880
As you can see, the name of the comment is create the Here section.

150
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.150
The things we did is we created a that fire.

151
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:05.100
Which includes all the links and also the component user.

152
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:12.790
And also, we created the user, the GST component, which is now empty.

153
00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:20.450
Then we have the index that, yes, that we added the head component here.

154
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:29.990
And also inside the clue was that CSI, we added a layer component, which is a custom utility or a

155
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.440
class.

156
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:38.330
Yeah, that was it for this part, for the hair section in the next section, we're going to start with

157
00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:44.060
the user authentication and at this beautiful hovering effect.

158
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.910
And get the image from the Google Google itself.

159
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.070
So see in the next section.
