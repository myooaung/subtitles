1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:14,810
All right, in the last section, we have finished the local part of the header in this section, we're

2
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,840
going to start creating the search bar.

3
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,510
Let's check the final version of the project.

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,950
Let's zoom a little bit.

5
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,990
So we can see it better.

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:29,500
Yeah.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,470
We have actually here.

8
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,500
There, which have an input inside it.

9
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,900
And the input.

10
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,600
He's a little bit pushed to the right side.

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:01:04,500
Here and we have an icon which we're going to get from hero icons dot com and the icon is has the position

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,580
of absolute and it's relative to the.

13
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,330
Dave, that is covering the inputs.

14
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:13,890
All right.

15
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,580
Let's go back to our visual studio code and open the.

16
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,200
Our local hosts on the right side.

17
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,360
And also there.

18
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:40,930
In order to have this beautiful input, we are going to use a package called children's services forums

19
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,700
to have at the basic forms, a styling.

20
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,640
So we just search here on the Google.

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,950
Tailwinds, CSIS forms.

22
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,910
And we just search for a get up.

23
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,510
So it's a GitHub that can tell when labs 12+ CSIS forms.

24
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,890
We click on this link.

25
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,320
And if you scroll down a little bit, we can see that we can use Indian installed children's, use this

26
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,330
form to install the package.

27
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:26,790
And also, we need to add this package as a requirement inside the plugins of tailwinds that conflict

28
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,370
that yes.

29
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,890
So we copy this line of code.

30
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,030
And inside the terminal.

31
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,360
First, we stop the server to clear the.

32
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,380
Terminal and replace the.

33
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:45,780
Court.

34
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,560
So.

35
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,330
We need to add this requirement.

36
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:01,350
To tell us that conflict, that duchess here.

37
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,600
Now, the plug ins are empty.

38
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,660
We just need to paste this inside the array of plug ins.

39
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,580
All right.

40
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:23,370
And just in the meantime, we go to Tillman's hero icons to get the icon.

41
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:30,330
So we search you icons on Google and we go to the hero icons dot com.

42
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,630
You are actually as part of Tilden CSF Project.

43
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:45,780
And tell us, yes, this actually owns this website, and they're going to add more and more icons soon,

44
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,520
and it's very compatible to tailwinds to assist.

45
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,520
In order to install it, we can go to documentation here.

46
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:06,610
And for installing, we just need to copy this line of code and then install Hulu icons slash.

47
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,420
Uh, Ricky, react.

48
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:19,190
So we posted here in the terminal and for using that, you just need to import the icon from here.

49
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:27,480
I react if you want the solid, we need to write down a solid if you want the outline we need off-line

50
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,470
and the different if this is outlined, this is solid.

51
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,660
Just this solid is filled with the color.

52
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:49,440
OK, so here we just copy this one as a reference, and we go to Heather de Jesus and at the top, we

53
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,540
paste it and we change this font to search.

54
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,110
I.

55
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,640
Search, I.

56
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:10,750
And this is we want to use the artillery, so we changed the solid to artillery.

57
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,030
All right.

58
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,020
Yeah, let's fix here and let it be.

59
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:26,940
And we don't need the diff at the top because we use the Flexbox for the top there.

60
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:37,080
So in the header, we delete the diff here and here, and we move this lift here.

61
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,520
This is the left side.

62
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,880
The two images.

63
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,700
And then we have the middle here and.

64
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,610
This is going to be the right time.

65
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,200
So that is correct now.

66
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,860
So in the middle, we want to add.

67
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,610
Uh, Dev.

68
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:16,910
And inside that day, another day for the icon, and we add the search icon here, let's run the server

69
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,180
using A.N.

70
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,730
Diff to see the changes inside our website.

71
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,260
And.

72
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,200
They're getting an error.

73
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,770
Know icons react.

74
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,880
Imports, which are nothing.

75
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,040
Yeah, unexpected.

76
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,990
Yeah, I did actually to.

77
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,760
Double code your.

78
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,810
Yeah, that should be fine now.

79
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,120
Let's refresh the page.

80
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,030
The element type is invalid.

81
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,970
So let's see what we have done.

82
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:43,580
Iraq announced last week that it's fine if search, I can't be made a mistake.

83
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,230
And here.

84
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,910
Two emergency search.

85
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,560
Always when I'm typing, I.

86
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,590
Do this kind of a fix?

87
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,820
Sorry about that.

88
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:10,920
So we cannot see the icon yet because it doesn't have any dimensions, so we're just at a height of

89
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,610
five.

90
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,670
So now we can see the icon here.

91
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:24,360
Let's change the color of the icon to tex gray.

92
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,540
Let's do it.

93
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:32,070
Five hundred, it makes it dark gray.

94
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:40,080
And after that, let's add the input after this stuff, so we had to input.

95
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,490
With the type of.

96
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,710
Tax.

97
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,680
We don't need the name or I.D..

98
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,280
So we can see the impact here.

99
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:10,970
And let's add the position of absolute for the icon that div that covers the icon, so the position

100
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:17,990
would be absolute and it's going to be relative to the div that is covering both of the.

101
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:29,550
Icons and also the input, and you can see we have some basic styling from the Taleban CSF forms.

102
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,220
But let's add more things like a placeholder.

103
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,740
We just say place order search.

104
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:53,890
If you're wondering why I get a lot of other such yes, yeah, I installed it at a package, an extension

105
00:09:53,890 --> 00:10:01,510
called Tap Nine, and I bought the actual diff pro version of the tap, known on tap, known based on

106
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:06,160
my previous coding and also the codes online.

107
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,470
Gives me suggestion, and that helps me to quote faster.

108
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,930
I highly recommend Tableau.

109
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,740
Even the basic version is going to help you a lot.

110
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:30,000
But if you are a student, actually, you can get it free if you can use your student email address

111
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,250
to get a provision for free.

112
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,460
All right, let's continue.

113
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,840
And yeah, for the input section, let's at some styling.

114
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,180
Just add a class name.

115
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,590
Let's change the background color to Gray.

116
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,310
A light gray like 50.

117
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,190
And it would be similar to the original Instagram website.

118
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:13,110
Let's add some padding left of tin to push this search placeholder to the right so we can position the

119
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,160
this icon to the center.

120
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Later, and let's change the border color to be gray as well, but a dark gray, similar color as the

121
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,690
icon and.

122
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:39,410
Let's make it a little bit smaller using Tex as an.

123
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,400
Next, let's add some.

124
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,540
Uh.

125
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:57,980
We just want to make the border rounded and also we want to be focused on it instead of blue.

126
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,860
We have a black color for doing this.

127
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,200
We need to add to.

128
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,960
Tailwind faces classes.

129
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,050
One is focus ring black.

130
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,980
And also, we need to focus.

131
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,680
Border black.

132
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:31,170
Now we get a black border, if you don't if you miss one of these two classes, you're not going to

133
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,040
get the result.

134
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:44,850
So bear in mind to have both of them and let's round the border using rounded, empty medium brown that.

135
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,680
I see no.

136
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,500
Everything is finished with the input path.

137
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,050
Let's position this.

138
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,530
I come to the center here.

139
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:08,440
It's very easy, we just need to add here after this absolute we just say top two to bring it a little

140
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,580
bit down.

141
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,550
Uh.

142
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,380
But yeah, it's not positioned to their.

143
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,380
Let's see.

144
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,650
There isn't.

145
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,370
It's not relative to this device because we made a silly mistake here.

146
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,750
Actually, I'm celebrating just a relative.

147
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,450
Yeah, that's fine.

148
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:05,930
Uh, now we need just at the left to just left to be completely in the center.

149
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:15,640
You can do it now could top 50 percent left and then you have to position a bit transform translate.

150
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,830
Minus 50 percent.

151
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,230
That is a lot of writing.

152
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,020
This is going to be very simple.

153
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:24,610
Yeah.

154
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,040
Yeah, that's it for the.

155
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:41,670
Our search for let's bring it a little bit down using here, marching top one to be completely in the

156
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,270
center.

157
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,590
Yeah, looks.

158
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,390
Now looks very fine.

159
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:48,950
Yeah.

160
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:55,550
In the next section, we're going to start creating the the right side, which have.

161
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,920
Two icons from Hero Icons.

162
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,010
There they have a very beautiful animation.

163
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,510
And also, we're going to add around that image.

164
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,970
On the right side.

165
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,850
So see in the next section for the actually, let's add.

166
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,690
Let's do that getup before forgetting all this, I forget.

167
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:36,120
So just quickly add everything to get with the commencement message of at.

168
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:39,600
Search.

169
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:44,920
For.

170
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,180
The header com.

171
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:52,940
Component.

172
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,850
And we just shifts can't get pushed to push everything to the guitar.

173
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,010
Let's go to our GitHub and see.

174
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,660
Yeah, we added a new commit.

175
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:14,060
Ten seconds ago, which is had a search bar to the head heather component.

00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,460
Now we just in the.

178
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,540
We added something in the middle section, actually, because we removed the operative, we see the

179
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,420
change, but actually we change only this part.

180
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,580
And we just added a search icon.

181
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:41,260
It positioned it absolute in the upper tier.

182
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,990
And also, they added an input for installation.

183
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:53,290
We installed, you know, icons and children's spaces forms and in the tailwind that conflict that.

184
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,080
We added the Children's Services Forum plug in.

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,180
Yeah, that was it for the this section.

186
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:08,370
