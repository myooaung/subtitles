1
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,420
All right, in the last section, we have completed the Heather section.

2
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:21,480
And the added the menu and profile image in this section, we're going to make this header a stick to

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,000
the top of the page and also we want to add some shadow effects.

4
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:35,970
If you if you look at the final version of the project, you can see that the header is at the top all

5
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:36,600
the time.

6
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:45,360
And also, if you zoom a little bit, you can see that we have a shadow between the header and other

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,290
sections of the website.

8
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,130
So it's very simple and we can do it in a short video.

9
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:05,310
We just need to go to header chase and we wrap everything inside one diff.

10
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:11,180
So we I bring everything inside the header that yes.

11
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:23,790
Inside and empty there and here, we just add a shadow first.

12
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,910
And we just say shadow eSIM, which means a very small shadow.

13
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,360
Now we can see it.

14
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,400
It's not clear yet because they're both colors are similar.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,850
Later, we're going to change the color of the.

16
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,600
The main feed section, a little bit gray.

17
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,430
And which we can see that is different here in the final version.

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,440
All right.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,420
And the other things we need to do to be sticky.

20
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,220
Is to at.

21
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,030
Let's add just a border at the bottom.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,010
So we can see it better.

23
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,100
So you see a difference now.

24
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,350
The border be.

25
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,020
And.

26
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,900
And see the difference.

27
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,270
And also make it a sticky to the top by just adding a sticky.

28
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,020
And we need to just say top zero.

29
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:52,440
So let's add something inside our index that, yes, so we can see the sticky part.

30
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:08,840
Let's add just a paragraph with your lorem ipsum, just hundred learn if song and we copy this a few

31
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,060
times, so now we can see the effects.

32
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:22,190
It's sticky at the top, but we can see that it's transparent and the text goes inside the header.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,320
The easiest solution is just to add a background.

34
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,340
We add a background color of white.

35
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:45,540
And just to be sure that the header is always at the top, if we have more things like a model or other

36
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,140
things, we just change the Z Index to 30.

37
00:03:49,980 --> 00:04:00,150
The normal Z index is zero for everything, but when you put it higher than zero, it means you're at

38
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,230
the top level.

39
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:02,950
All right.

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,080
Looks fine now, let's delete the dummy text, we added.

41
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:27,500
So, OK, and let's add this one to the guitar, and we can move to the next section, so we just add

42
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,870
everything to the kit.

43
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,400
We make a comment.

44
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:33,960
Of.

45
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,640
Just saying implement.

46
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,450
It's sticky.

47
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:48,700
Header.

48
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,030
And we just push it to the get tough.

49
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,470
Let's check that we will refresh this page.

50
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:08,420
And now we have six comments, and the last one is implement sticky header.

51
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,120
And we just add another div at the top that is covering everything.

52
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,650
All right.

53
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:27,620
So these changes are just the first when we see some automatic changes happens, but it just is.

54
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,090
This is the change we have done in the next section.

55
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,520
We are going to start with the food section.

56
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,340
And uh, so the food section.

57
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:53,430
This is the food section, and the food section has actually four parts, so the first one is the.

58
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,500
Story, the story part, then we have the post part.

59
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,400
Many profile.

60
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:11,550
And also, we have this suggestions, so in the next section, we're going to start with the story part.

61
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:17,720
We're going to use a package called Mini Faker to produce these fakes.

62
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,350
Uh.

63
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:28,100
Profiles and we can use another website for producing profile images.

64
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:37,630
So see you in the next section for the feed section and also this story part.
