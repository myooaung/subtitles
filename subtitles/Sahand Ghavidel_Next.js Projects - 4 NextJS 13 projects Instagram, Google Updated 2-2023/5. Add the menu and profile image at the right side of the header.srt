1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:14,150
All right, in the last section, we have finished with the search bar in our project, in this section,

2
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,120
we're going to finish the right side of the head.

3
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,170
If you look at the final version of the project.

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:29,390
Let me increase the size, you can see it better, so we have actually.

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,870
And menu, including two icons from Hero Icons.

6
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:42,220
And also, we have an image rounded by Italian SS Starlee.

7
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,340
So totally, we have.

8
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,390
One big fear, which includes.

9
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,960
The menu and the.

10
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:56,760
The image.

11
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:58,840
All right.

12
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,760
Let's go back to Visual Studio code.

13
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,950
And in Heritage's.

14
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,690
In the right section, we just.

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,390
Delete the right side.

16
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,610
And we had a death here and inside this death.

17
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:29,710
We need to add the icons, so we need one icon onthe arts line, which is.

18
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:31,760
Uh.

19
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,900
Spur Plus.

20
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:53,480
Circle icon, and also we need an icon called home icon, but the icon is not so artfully.

21
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,410
It's solid.

22
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,550
So we just bring it from.

23
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,440
Hero icons react.

24
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,760
Forward slash solid.

25
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,960
So here we are at the.

26
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,430
Icons.

27
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,400
First, we add the home icon.

28
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,960
It's refresh the page.

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:40,430
We cannot see it yet, because it doesn't have any height or weight, so the height which is said to

30
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,420
be six.

31
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:49,110
You can see the icon here that's changed the cursor to be pointer.

32
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,070
So we can see a pointing hand when we hover over the icon.

33
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,650
Let's at the hover effect.

34
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:10,940
So when we hover over the element, we want to increase the size of the elements so we can do it a bit.

35
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,770
You need actually at double.

36
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:25,900
Claw and just add this skill here, and you just add 25 percent to this scale.

37
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,440
You can see here.

38
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,590
And.

39
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:41,760
We need a transition for this to be a little bit more smooth, so we add the transform fission to transform

40
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,960
property, which includes this scale function.

41
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:55,290
And let's do the duration of 100 or 200 million milli seconds.

42
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:06,230
So now we see a small things just to add is the fact.

43
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,650
So we went to remove the.

44
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,850
Mouse, we see is out for the effect.

45
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,380
All right.

46
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:28,480
Let's copy this and and the plus circular as well.

47
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,160
Plus soccer icon.

48
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:38,960
We can see they are on the top of each other, we can bring them next to each other by adding flex to

49
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,500
the top level dev.

50
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:49,850
And just after them, we can add an image tag.

51
00:04:51,010 --> 00:05:00,460
To add a hardcoded image, so we just need to search for, for example, your own name.

52
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,000
My name is Sam Gambino.

53
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,480
So.

54
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,010
I just saw an image for myself.

55
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,330
This is from.

56
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,970
Just copy the.

57
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,170
Image address you can get, you can put any image you like, including your own image.

58
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,540
It's up to you.

59
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,050
So here in the source section, I paste the.

60
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,210
Paste it.

61
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,380
So we go back to our website, we can see the image.

62
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,430
But it's a little bit huge.

63
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:48,140
First, we add the alternative name, which is we just say user image, let's add some styling.

64
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,010
We just need to change the hunt to be 10.

65
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:04,500
And they change the way you make it circle by using rounded.

66
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:09,950
Full.

67
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:19,480
We can add some space between the icons and the image using.

68
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,150
In the top level, there is just add a space X.

69
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:34,200
For two, at a space between them, and we can bring them horizontally next to each other.

70
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,300
Using items center.

71
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,040
All right.

72
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,630
That's looks fine.

73
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,420
Let's add just a cursor pointer to the image.

74
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:54,330
So we see a point in hand when we hover over the image, and let's remove this.

75
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:05,850
Home Bar, when we have a smaller screen and added when we have a bigger screen so we can do, we can

76
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:13,380
achieve that easily by just adding at the beginning of the home icon hidden class.

77
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,800
And we just say if the size is bigger than medium size.

78
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:26,240
Just change the in line.

79
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,100
To Flex.

80
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:37,020
So when we have a bigger screen, we can see the icon, but in the smaller screen, we hide it.

81
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:51,020
The next things I want to do is just to add some space between the icons and the this profile icon and

82
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:59,180
the wall of the browser, we can achieve this easily by in the top there next to the return.

83
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,690
At the end, we're just at margin X of four.

84
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:17,460
And when we were in the ICC's largest space, like its large size like this, I want them to be centered.

85
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:28,420
So we just use the we just say in the large and above, just change the mix.

86
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,150
To be auto.

87
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,800
So now we can see everything center.

88
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:49,990
And let's increase the size and slowly you see that the icon appears after medium sized and in the largest.

89
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,650
Well, we see a change in the icon.

90
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,090
And when we get bigger in this size, we have.

91
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,930
Everything centers like this.

92
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:09,970
That was it for the part of the the right part of the header.

93
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:10,970
Let's.

94
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:22,770
Push this to the guitar using get at all and get command with a message of.

95
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:37,160
Uh, and the menu and profile image at the right.

96
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:47,040
Side of the head, and we just push it to get her.

97
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,820
You can check now here.

98
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,780
We just go to install version four and we have no.

99
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,840
Five comments.

100
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:05,270
And the last one is add the menu and and profile image at the right side of the header.

101
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,530
As you can see, the imported two icons, including plus soccer icon and home icon.

102
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,460
We make the header.

103
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:26,280
A centre using this auto mix, and also we added some marching to the left and right.

104
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,200
And, uh.

105
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:36,100
We just add the menu at the right side here, we can see.

106
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,410
Just the home and the plus icon and also the image.

107
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,120
All right.

108
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:48,580
So in the next section, we're going to make this.

109
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:55,180
Header a sticky or make it sticky to the top.

110
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:03,160
So when we when we scroll down there, the menu will be always at the top.

111
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:08,830
And also, we want to add some shadow effect at the bottom.

112
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,500
So see in the next section.
