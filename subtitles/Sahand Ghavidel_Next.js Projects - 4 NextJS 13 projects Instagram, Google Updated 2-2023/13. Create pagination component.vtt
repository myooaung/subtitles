1
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.970
All right.

2
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.110
In the last section, we have completed the results section.

3
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.840
In this section, we're going to start with the pagination part.

4
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.450
If you look at the final version of the project.

5
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.780
You can see that if I assume this one.

6
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.740
You can see that we have an icon here.

7
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.620
The this icon is coming from the hero icons.

8
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.610
It's the name is.

9
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.400
This one is chipper on left icon, this is Chevron right icon.

10
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.080
So let's go to our visual studio code.

11
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:07.970
And keep the website and the right side open and the things we do here inside the search.

12
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.670
Search results, duchess.

13
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:21.350
Just here, we add another component and the colored page and nation buttons.

14
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.550
And we're going to create this here and their components folder, so we create a new component and we

15
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.440
call it page and nation.

16
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.600
But turns that J.S..

17
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.000
And we create a react functional component.

18
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:54.690
And we just got to search the research, results, touches, and we import this component using control

19
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.300
of space.

20
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.120
So we should see something at the bottom same page in nations.

21
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.210
But ends.

22
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.200
Let.

23
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.380
Putting this fund benefits after.

24
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.290
OK, here.

25
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.350
So inside the pagination buttons to import the two icons.

26
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.660
Using imports, the first icon is Chevron.

27
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.180
Left icon.

28
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.900
This one.

29
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.060
We can see from the auto suggestion.

30
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.560
And it's already important some who are calling for a slash react or slash solid.

31
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.750
And the next one is Champaran.

32
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.410
Right icon.

33
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.600
All right, now, we have two icons inside the return.

34
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.450
We need to have two parts.

35
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.870
So one for the left, one for the right.

36
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:23.680
So but in order to go to the another link inside our own website, we can use something called Link.

37
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.590
And link tag from next link.

38
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:38.390
So we're going to use this one here as well, so we're going to import Link from Nick's.

39
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.850
Forward slash link.

40
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.710
So here we have the first link.

41
00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:04.330
And inside this first link, so we can just, uh, uh, close this tank and inside this tag.

42
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:17.850
Just weekend, we are getting an error saying that the link inside the the Etch Ref is mandatory, so

43
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.680
we should have an aircraft.

44
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.720
So inside to the opening tag, we create aircraft.

45
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.300
So this is just the let's make first for the next one.

46
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.910
So it makes more sense.

47
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:46.800
So we just say the shrimp is going to be for a search and we need to get the turn and the search time.

48
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.760
And also, we're going to add another index called a start.

49
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:59.220
So first, we need to import router use router to to get the terms from the Earth.

50
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.950
So we import use.

51
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.630
Round two from next forward slash round to.

52
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.700
We create a constant called rather here.

53
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.420
And the term here.

54
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.490
Would be equal to.

55
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.260
That router, that query.

56
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:29.940
Short term.

57
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.670
Next, we will need to get the search time.

58
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.980
So we arrived here search time, and the search stop is going to be equal to.

59
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.040
Router that curry.

60
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.960
That's search time.

61
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.450
And finally, we need to get in.

62
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.650
We need to at the start.

63
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.640
So.

64
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:21.370
In the pagination, just we need to create a consent first because we want to start to get the creative

65
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.860
consent and we call it a start index.

66
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.800
This is start index.

67
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.960
Well, we need to get it from the Earth, but we don't have it yet, actually, we need to go to.

68
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:48.140
Search statistics, if you remember in the search judge that we had a server side rendering function

69
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.140
that was fetching data from Google API.

70
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:59.810
But this one has everything, for example, the API key to turn the search time.

71
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.990
But we missed the start point.

72
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:04.700
So here?

73
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:14.480
We create a constant here at the top, we create a constant and we call it a start index.

74
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.900
And this is going to be.

75
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:27.440
This is this is going to get to a start from the euro using contacts.

76
00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.170
That quoted that Assad.

77
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:37.890
But if this one is not exist, it would just say, just said it to be one.

78
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.070
And here at the end of the your hour, we add something else as well.

79
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.500
Just outside this.

80
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:51.430
We act.

81
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.990
We just say start query.

82
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.430
Is equal to.

83
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.550
That's a stock index.

84
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:13.600
So if they're inside the euro, we have the start, Corey.

85
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:19.750
We get the information and we pass it to the stock index, otherwise we just use one.

86
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.230
Now we go we go back to pagination buttons.

87
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.240
And here we do the same.

88
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.730
We just say.

89
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.650
We get the router that.

90
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.090
Curry ducked a start.

91
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:50.490
But because we want to use this number, we we because this is a strength, we need to convert this

92
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:54.980
one to a number, so we had no at the beginning.

93
00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:03.420
This is a built in function from JavaScript.

94
00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:13.600
So if it converts string to no, and then they say, if this one is not exist, it just be one.

95
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.250
All right.

96
00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:21.310
Now here in the link, they say if someone click on the link.

97
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:33.040
If someone click on the next link, just go to the search term, search time with this and also at the

98
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:33.460
end.

99
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:40.760
Let's go to a starting point of.

100
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.220
Starts.

101
00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.200
A start point and then not one is equal to.

102
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.420
A star and index.

103
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:05.710
And then whatever I start, Indigo is just at 10 to it.

104
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.040
So we're going to the next 10 quote.

105
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.840
So we cannot see it yet.

106
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:21.970
But inside the link, we need to add more things like we need to add a paragraph.

107
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:29.070
We need to add actually this Chevron right icon and also the paragraph.

108
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.650
So inside this link, we.

109
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:44.420
We had something we just added dear and scientist.

110
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.760
We have the icon.

111
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:55.710
That Chevron right icon and also we add a paragraph saying next.

112
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.140
We're getting an error here.

113
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.490
Let me check the error.

114
00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.890
It says multiple children with passed will link.

115
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.690
With Ashraf.

116
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:15.330
But only one child is supportive, so let me check what we have done.

117
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.210
I think we went.

118
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.890
Probably we are missing something here, so we start with this.

119
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:46.850
I checked it was an error we needed just to refresh a page, there was OK.

120
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.430
So there's no and there's no error.

121
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.260
So no.

122
00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:56.760
We should see a next button at a bar at the top here.

123
00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:06.160
Let's decrease the size of this icon by just saying class name height of five.

124
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:18.410
So now, if you click on the next, you should go to the.

125
00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.430
Here we should go to this start 11.

126
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:33.020
Let's see that we went to start 11 and now we're going to 12, 31.

127
00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.890
Four to one, and it said it's going up.

128
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:45.370
But as I mentioned before, we cannot go more than ninety one because.

129
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:57.720
Google API is only giving us 100 results, so we should limit this and next button to cool more than.

130
00:12:59.090 --> 00:12:59.990
Ninety one.

131
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.780
So here we can wrap this.

132
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:09.730
Uh, we can wrap this aircraft.

133
00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.200
With turn to the operator and then we just say, if this thought.

134
00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.800
If they start index is.

135
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:24.810
More than.

136
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.430
All is less than 90.

137
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:33.930
Uh.

138
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:46.920
Just show the if it's less than 90, just show the next button.

139
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.880
So 91 will be included here.

140
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.650
So when it's ninety one, we don't see this button anymore.

141
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:05.080
So, no, a start point is hundred one, we don't see the next button.

142
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:10.560
But if it's 90 or 81, which is the less than 90.

143
00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:19.220
We should see the next button if you click on this more, we go to one, we don't see the next button.

144
00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.790
So let's establish a little bit more.

145
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:24.020
So we have a.

146
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.070
Let's remove this as thought.

147
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:36.440
And let's bring this one here, and we just zoom a little bit to see it better.

148
00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.200
And we start this next by phone.

149
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.730
We just need to hear.

150
00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:53.750
This dear the inside is there, we had a class of cursor point to.

151
00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:04.050
So when we hover over this, we should steer it pointing hand.

152
00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.040
Now, let's make this one flex.

153
00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:16.320
So we bring it to this center, but we want them to be on top of each other, so we changed the Flex

154
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:25.080
two column and for bringing everything to center, we need to use items center.

155
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:34.430
We cannot see it anymore.

156
00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:35.200
It's here.

157
00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:36.340
All right.

158
00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:38.020
And then.

159
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.290
When we hover over the edge.

160
00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:52.590
We want to see it underline under it, so we just say under lie.

161
00:15:55.790 --> 00:16:03.530
And let's change the color of this next to blue, but I don't want to apply this one to both of the

162
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.300
next and the previous.

163
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:10.040
So let's do this one in the top bit here.

164
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:20.860
So this is going to be text blue.

165
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.370
700.

166
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:26.430
At this.

167
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.640
All right, so let's create the previous button as well.

168
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:42.070
This is going to be very similar, so we can copy this.

169
00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.590
One time using Alt Shift Arrow, Don.

170
00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:54.330
The only difference is this is going to be when we have more than 10.

171
00:16:54.900 --> 00:17:04.920
We should have this previous button instead of less than 90 because when we go to the next button.

172
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.700
No, if you click on next, we should see two Nexis.

173
00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.630
So the first one instead of next is previous.

174
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:25.010
Like this then instead of increasing the estate index one, we want to decrease.

175
00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.240
One from it.

176
00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.930
So we added subtract instead of plus icon sign.

177
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.310
And then everything is similar.

178
00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:43.720
This Chevron right icon should be Chevron left icon.

179
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:54.420
And now let's bring them next to each other, so we need to in the top tier.

180
00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.350
Here we change the.

181
00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.560
Displayed Flex to bring them next to each other.

182
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:08.170
And then we add some padding.

183
00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.270
In the x axis of nine.

184
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:20.250
So we bring them a little bit on the right side, and we have a penny at the bottom of for.

185
00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:34.040
Then we bring them as we centralize them using me and a space between them using just justify between.

186
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.180
So you can see the next button went the other side.

187
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:40.950
But, uh.

188
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:54.410
Well, when we have a kind of have a small size and above, we want to see that justify a start.

189
00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:04.280
So now, if we have a big screen like this there next to each other, but then we have a smaller screen,

190
00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.110
there are far from each other.

191
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:15.260
But we can remove the and when we are bigger than the smaller, we want to have a space between them,

192
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.440
a space x of forty four.

193
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:24.320
So here we have a space of 44 between them.

194
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:41.750
And then when there is more we want to you don't have to have to have any padding.

195
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:43.670
At all.

196
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:52.110
So Penny X would be zero, so I want them to really connect to the corner when you're in the bigger

197
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.470
screen.

198
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.900
It's still in this small screen is a little bit.

199
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:02.250
Not nice.

200
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:07.850
The reason we don't see the Knicks actually is not because of the styling.

201
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:16.320
I zoomed this one a little bit myself, so without Zoom, actually, they're positioned very nice.

202
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:22.980
So now we're in just the five between in the mobile screen.

203
00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:32.220
But when the sizes get bigger, they go to the justify a start, but they have a space between each

204
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.560
other for the four.

205
00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:40.600
So now.

206
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.310
We have completed this.

207
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.960
Actually, this one is working when we have in 91.

208
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:54.580
We shouldn't see the next button, only we see the previous, but and then when we are at the beginning.

209
00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.460
We should only see the next, but.

210
00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:03.700
So let's test this one by buying the real data, not the mock data.

211
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:11.060
This is actually a mock data in search strategies in the mock data.

212
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:11.660
I changed it.

213
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.030
True to false.

214
00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.500
So now.

215
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.040
This left load the page.

216
00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:29.210
And now, as you see the real data which is coming from Hello.

217
00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.440
This search something like tailwind CFS.

218
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.210
So the first website is telling CCIs dot com.

219
00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:39.790
All right.

220
00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:45.680
When we click on next, we should see a new page.

221
00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:51.710
So you see that this is a talented sitcom, but this is the docs configuration.

222
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.570
The next page?

223
00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.920
Is, uh.

224
00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:58.180
Yeah.

225
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.230
Geeks for geeks.

226
00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:00.910
Dot com.

227
00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:06.490
So no, actually we are getting the correct result from the real data.

228
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.420
The previous button is all as well.

229
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:20.670
We went back to the homepage, so in the next section, we are going to create this image tab.

230
00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:26.510
Now if you click on the image that we see the image result, actually.

231
00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.940
But we want to see the image, actually.

232
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:35.780
Uh, the uh, the image preview, not only the links.

233
00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:40.430
So we want it to be like the our final version here.

234
00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:44.810
We want to see images, for example, from next year's images.

235
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.630
And we have to pay attention here as far.

236
00:22:50.310 --> 00:23:02.490
So let's add everything to get her first using get at, and we will use comments with a message of.

237
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.270
Page and nation.

238
00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.240
Or create

239
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.030
page a nation.

240
00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.010
Component.

241
00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:23.380
Component, it push everything to get her.

242
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:29.070
And let's review what we have done in our code.

243
00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:33.300
We click on Google Virgin Tree to refresh the page.

244
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:43.040
As you can see, now, we have 13 commits and the last one is create pagination car component.

245
00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:46.890
So inside.

246
00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.010
Let's start with day at the bottom.

247
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.200
Inside the search, that is.

248
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:59.460
We added this tart query at the end of the hour API.

249
00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:00.310
URL.

250
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:09.980
So we have the ability to ask the Google to give us the new database on the page number, and we say

251
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.600
if there is a page number.

252
00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:18.260
Just get it if there's not just put the stock number of one.

253
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:28.040
Then inside the search results, GSP added the pagination button's component, and finally, we created

254
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.770
the pagination button's component here.

255
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:37.870
We got the two icons from here are icons forward slash react solid.

256
00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:44.150
And here as well, we got the start index.

257
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:55.340
We convert it to number using no method of JavaScript, and we set it to be one if there is no quarry

258
00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.600
name to start.

259
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:02.330
Then we created two buttons with the Link TAC.

260
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:10.330
The previous one and the next one, and we only see the previous one when we have the index number of

261
00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:14.760
10 or above or just above more than 10.

262
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:22.340
And if we have a number less than 90, we see the the next button.

263
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:35.620
And here we added it subtracted 10 from the start index inside the previous button, and we added 10.

264
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.290
To the next spot to.

265
00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:45.960
And when we click on the next button to the start index, but that was it for the pagination.

266
00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:56.690
Then in the next section, we going to start with the images tech, and we're going to use tailwinds

267
00:25:56.830 --> 00:26:00.160
to assist Grid to create this.

268
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:05.620
If you look at this final version, no, we have actually.

269
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:10.540
Four items, four columns, actually.

270
00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:16.930
But if you decrease the size of the page, which we see in a point three column.

271
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:23.310
Three columns, and then we will see two columns, and finally, we see one column.

272
00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:26.220
So are we going to achieve this using?

273
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.010
Yes.

274
00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:30.470
Tell us this is great.

275
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:31.950
Classes.

276
00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.930
So see you in the next section for the tab.

277
00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.700
For the types of images.
