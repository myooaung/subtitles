WEBVTT
1
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.630
All right.

2
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.370
In the last section, we got the titles of the search result.

3
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.110
In this section, we're going to handle the errors, the possible errors.

4
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.160
So we need to come back to Visual Studio Code, the different types of error we want to handle.

5
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:36.140
Now, if the response is not okay or doesn't return a 200, we want to throw an error here.

6
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.480
So we're going to say if the.

7
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.870
Response is not okay.

8
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:53.830
So we want to throw a new error and we just say something went wrong or fail to fetch data.

9
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.070
We can just any message you can create.

10
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.130
So this is the things we do.

11
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:11.110
For example, if the API key is wrong, for example, we add an extra letter here and we go here, we

12
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.370
just refresh the page.

13
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.660
We should get an error.

14
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.870
Something went wrong, you can see, but we don't want to get kind of this error.

15
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.610
We want to create a file inside the next.

16
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.960
Yes, you can create a file inside the folder.

17
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.010
For example, in the web folder you can create a file called error that JSX, and you can handle this

18
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.930
error in that way.

19
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:46.960
So you're not going to break your application as we want to use the error for both pages, as for both

20
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.720
the image and the web, so we can put the error that is inside the search.

21
00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:04.170
Inside this search, we can just create another file and we call it error dot jsx x.

22
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.020
This is exclusive for next years 13.

23
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.280
So this one should be actually a reac functional component.

24
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.290
So and it's called error.

25
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.630
We can just say capitalized.

26
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:30.220
And this one is you, you need to make it in a client side.

27
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.320
So we just say use client because it is this is related to the client.

28
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.520
So we need to do it.

29
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.580
And also we have to use user effect for catching the error.

30
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.060
So this here we get two things.

31
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.600
We get the error and also we get the reset.

32
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.670
For resetting the error.

33
00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.470
All right.

34
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.840
So now after this, we're going to use use effect.

35
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.270
Which is coming from React.

36
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.030
And this one is going to be a function.

37
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.750
Are we going to just.

38
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.850
Console.log.

39
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.200
First error.

40
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.590
Okay.

41
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.990
And then for the dependency.

42
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.330
It's close.

43
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.630
This one first for the dependency.

44
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.170
We just get the error.

45
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.240
Let's see, we.

46
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.400
I think we put an extra.

47
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.180
Okay.

48
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.210
So any time an error happens, we're going to console.log the error using use effect.

49
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.140
First things we do here, and then we're going to return.

50
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.110
We're going to return a div.

51
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:11.610
And first things first, we just create an H one tag saying something.

52
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.440
Went wrong.

53
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:25.390
So we just say something went wrong and we're going to create a button here.

54
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.890
As you can see, we are going to create a button with the UN click that which is going to reset.

55
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.050
And we need to actually call this reset.

56
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.530
So I'm going to create a function.

57
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.630
I'm going to call the reset.

58
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.070
Like this, which is the.

59
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:58.290
Which is going to reset and ask and retry to fetch data.

60
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.290
And we have a button called Try Again.

61
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:10.700
So now probably when we because we know the API key is wrong, we should get an error again, but it's

62
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.280
not going to break our application.

63
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.870
We just see something went wrong.

64
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.010
Try again.

65
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:24.440
And we can see the error now in just in the development mode, not in the production.

66
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.760
So you can see this one, but the user cannot see this.

67
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.560
And also you can see the error inside the console log.

68
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.300
But let's just stall this one.

69
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.600
We want to bring this font to the center.

70
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:51.320
So inside the parent device, I'm going to change this one to flex.

71
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.670
Change the flex direction to column to bring them on top of each other.

72
00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:06.280
Then we use Justify Content Center and Item Center to bring them to the center horizontally and vertically.

73
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.610
And also, I want to add some padding in the top of ten.

74
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.620
And for the H one tag, I want to make it bigger.

75
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.920
You just use it and text three x large.

76
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.530
And we add some more margin at the bottom of four.

77
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.420
For the button.

78
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:39.570
We just make it change the color to be blue.

79
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.380
Blue, for example, 500 k.

80
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.310
Let's test what we get.

81
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.960
Now, as you can see, we get something went wrong in a beautiful manner.

82
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.260
We click again.

83
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.110
You see, we get an error again.

84
00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:06.960
But if we fix the API key, I remove this s here that I have added this time.

85
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.620
If we click on try again, we should get the result.

86
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:17.640
So any time the something happened with the API key or the user doesn't have access to the internet

87
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.070
or whatever, we get something went wrong and we can try again and fix their problem.

88
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:28.710
Or if it's in the server, they have to come back again to the website in a later time.

89
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.550
So that was for handling the error.

90
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.180
If there is a problem with API key or other things.

91
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.050
The other things is the other error can happen.

92
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:46.770
For example, if you write down something here that doesn't have any meaning and there is no result

93
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.380
for that, we get this error.

94
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.280
Something went wrong.

95
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.360
But actually I don't want this kind of error.

96
00:07:53.370 --> 00:08:00.660
I just want to say, for example, there is no such a thing so or no results found.

97
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.990
Uh, we can do that because we are getting the items.

98
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:11.160
If there is no items, we want to show that those kind of results.

99
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.920
Let me first delete this castle log.

100
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.100
And here we can just.

101
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.420
Create a condition.

102
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:31.260
We just say if there is no result, return, no result finds that this is the simplest way, but I want

103
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.640
to return something more.

104
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.310
So let me first just see it, for example.

105
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:43.290
Try again.

106
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:47.120
We see no results find for this search term.

107
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.190
Let's make that one beautiful, too.

108
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.150
So I'm going to create a diff here.

109
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.750
Let's delete this one.

110
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.390
If after the death, I'm going to.

111
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.600
First create ah1 tag saying no result find.

112
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.190
And then I want to create a paragraph.

113
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.320
Inside the paragraph.

114
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.230
I want to say try search something else.

115
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:32.280
Or.

116
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.240
Go back to home, for example.

117
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:43.310
Go back to home Page.

118
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.520
And here.

119
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.360
Uh, we want to have some link tag from.

120
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:59.200
But just say link tag, which is coming from the next photo slash link and inside the link if you're

121
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.380
going to have a text saying all.

122
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:06.040
And here we're going to have the H ref.

123
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:12.770
The caps.

124
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.740
This one should be lowercase.

125
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.550
The rap is going to be the home page.

126
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:26.530
I'll just we need to style this one for the day.

127
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:33.790
Div at the top you're going to change the display to flex flex direction to be column.

128
00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:47.770
And we just changed the justified center and item center to bring them centered horizontally and vertically.

129
00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.640
And we add some padding at a top of ten.

130
00:10:54.100 --> 00:11:04.840
We make this text to be bigger by changing the text to be three x large and add some padding and margin

131
00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.580
at the bottom of four.

132
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:15.330
The reason I'm doing it fast because we are we already made it similar things and then we we add a class

133
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:16.350
name here.

134
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.830
Just make the text to be large.

135
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:30.680
And for the link, I just want to change the link color to be ticks blue.

136
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.620
500 and home.

137
00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.280
This home.

138
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.130
I'm going to fix this one too.

139
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.610
K Let's see what we have.

140
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.640
So let's refresh the page.

141
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.230
As you can see, we get it like this.

142
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.860
No result.

143
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:49.130
Find.

144
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.490
Try searching for something else or go back to homepage.

145
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.160
Actually, uh.

146
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.440
Let's remove this one here.

147
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.240
We need to add some space here.

148
00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.450
So just kind of create a space.

149
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:08.810
Okay.

150
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.480
Okay.

151
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:16.740
And when we click on Hall, we're going to go back to home page.

152
00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.440
We can search something else.

153
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.130
This is going to show this result.

154
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:27.030
If the result is not existed, we get no results.

155
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.690
Fine.

156
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:28.560
Okay.

157
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:35.470
I think that's that's that was it for the handling the error.

158
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.950
Let's add this one to the GitHub.

159
00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:49.610
Using Contour Shift G and we're going to press the plus sign and then we create a message saying handle.

160
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.710
Handle possible.

161
00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.070
Errors.

162
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.100
K I'm going to commit and push.

163
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:14.700
Let's review what we have done to go back to our repository homepage.

164
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:21.120
Now we have 313 commits and the last one is handled possible errors.

165
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:24.920
Okay.

166
00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:33.110
We have created a file inside the search, which is going to cover both the web and the image folder.

167
00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:40.100
This is the client side because we are using user effect and it should be client side.

168
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:48.260
It's mentioned inside the next year's 13 documentation that you have to make the error page client side.

169
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.870
Then we get the error and the reset.

170
00:13:53.900 --> 00:14:00.110
We're going to use user fact to console.log the error any time an error happens.

171
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:08.720
And also we have created ah1 tag saying something went wrong and we can click on this button to reset

172
00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.070
and try again.

173
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.930
Inside the page, that's x.

174
00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.390
We have modified the result.

175
00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:25.850
For example, we have we just said if there is, the response is not okay it's it's not returning 200.

176
00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:33.920
We're going to throw an error which is going to trigger that file instead.

177
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:41.760
And if there is no result, if data that items is not existed for, for example, for the situation

178
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.230
that the word has a spelling mistake or something like that.

179
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:58.140
We get no result, find title, and also we can click to the home icon to go back to home.

180
00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:04.150
So we have designed this one to how to prevent the errors.

181
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:08.600
So two types of errors we have pre prevented.

182
00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:13.300
First, is the error related to fetching the API.

183
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:18.670
The second one is if the vault is not existed.

184
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:26.470
So in the next section, the things we want to do is to create the search result component.

185
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:33.610
So we're going to create this search result like the one we have inside the final version.

186
00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:35.480
Inside the final version.

187
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:44.230
As you can see, we get the search results like this, which includes the time, then the number of

188
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:49.450
results, the time we get the URL.

189
00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.520
And also we can click and go to that page.

190
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.190
And also we can.

191
00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.710
We're going to have a brief description of this.

192
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:09.670
And also we want to install this one like this one, this beautiful using tailwind CSS.

193
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:10.270
Okay.

194
00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.530
So in the next section, we're going to work on this one and get all this data.

195
00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:25.510
And also we need to install some packages to, for example, show this kind of a result in a bold manner.

196
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:27.100
Okay.

197
00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:31.600
So in the next section for creating this part of the project.
