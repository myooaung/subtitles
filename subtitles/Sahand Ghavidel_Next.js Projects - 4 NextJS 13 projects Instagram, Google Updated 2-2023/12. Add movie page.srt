1
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:07,340
All right.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,090
In the last section, we have created the cart components.

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:18,110
In this section, we are going to create the page related to the each movie.

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:25,810
If you look at the final version and if you go, for example, to trending and we click on one of the

5
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:31,530
movies, we see that each movie has a URL for itself.

6
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:38,410
And based on that, we're going to get the full overview, the title, the release date and the rating.

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,790
And.

8
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,620
So and seeing that one is an instance.

9
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:51,070
So we're going to use the paging dynamic paging system of next year 13.

10
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:58,570
So we need to go to Visual Studio Code and we go to app the app directory.

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,810
We need to create another.

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,900
Folder called Movie.

13
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,150
I'm sure I'm going to show you a trick so you can create a file.

14
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:15,880
But instead of naming the file, you can just write down movie.

15
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,460
And add forward slash.

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,800
And ad ID because we want to create a page based on the ID.

17
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,720
And after that, we're going to have forward slash page.

18
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,600
Dot js x.

19
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:44,190
This is going to create two folders, the movie folder, the folder called Bracket ID, and also inside

20
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:49,650
this folder is going to create a file called page dot GSX.

21
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,280
Let's create this page using RFC, we create a React functional component.

22
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,880
And we can just call this one.

23
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,860
Page or.

24
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,900
We can just call it movie.

25
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,130
Page.

26
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:17,940
Now, if you go to our website and we click in any of these cards, we're going to be redirected to

27
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,930
that page.

28
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:28,440
So when we click, we go to that page and we see that movie page and we also get all the layouts that

29
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,410
we have created before, like before.

30
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:39,300
So now we still have the header, we have the Napa, and here we see the movie page.

31
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:48,980
So how we get to each movie based on this idea that we have passed, we can we can request again to

32
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,870
the ten DB API.

33
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,080
And based on this ID, we are going to get the.

34
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,390
The movie data.

35
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,030
So here.

36
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,400
We can just pass.

37
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,990
The premise here.

38
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,760
And based on this prams, we can get the ID.

39
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,130
So, for example, if I.

40
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,500
Uh, let's.

41
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,240
So we can get the ID and we create a constant and we call it.

42
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,030
Movie.

43
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,680
ID and this is going to be equal to this params dot ID.

44
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:40,220
So now we can use this ID to create and ask for the database and get the result.

45
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,150
So we create a constant here and we call it response.

46
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,390
And this is going to be equal to a wait fetch.

47
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,490
And we're going to.

48
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,060
Get the information that based on the suggestion from the GitHub copilot.

49
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,060
So we're going to await phage.

50
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,160
This is the URL API that.

51
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,060
The movie DB dot org.

52
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:14,400
We're going to pass the movie ID and we're going to pass the API key, which is coming from process

53
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,660
dot envy.

54
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,640
API key.

55
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,040
We don't need that next public actually.

56
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:31,960
And we can just get the we can get rid of the language because here we don't need the language and we

57
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,110
just get the result, we get the response.

58
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:41,500
We can just get the data of the movie by changing the response to a JSON file.

59
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,410
Like this.

60
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,840
And we we just get each movie.

61
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,150
As you can see, the get up copilot is not so smart.

62
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:57,420
It's getting all the information, giving me all the correct one this time.

63
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,010
So now.

64
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,730
We can just get the.

65
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,830
So we have requested now.

66
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,400
So we can do this one or we can just call this function.

67
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,430
It doesn't matter to both work the same way.

68
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:32,240
By this function should be asynchronous because we are using a weight inside it and we want to use the

69
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,820
server side rendering inside next year 30.

70
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:44,360
So this one should be asynchronous and we're going to fetch database on the print parameter ID.

71
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:57,850
So for making it a little bit cleaner, I'm going to just, uh, go at the top, create a function,

72
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,220
a synchronous function.

73
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,690
I'm going to call it get movie, for example.

74
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,310
And then.

75
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:13,390
We want to I want to bring all of them inside this function.

76
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,820
Let's close the function.

77
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,760
And we bring everything inside there.

78
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,930
So I have to get the movie ID here.

79
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:34,390
So I get the movie ID here and then I'm going to call the function that we have created.

80
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,680
So.

81
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,640
Let's check.

82
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:50,960
So now we need to get the movie by calling that function and passing this ID and actually this ID we

83
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:58,940
don't need that ID here because this prompts is get everything inside this ID so we need to remove this

84
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,270
ID.

85
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,800
So sorry about that.

86
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:09,020
So remove this ID, this params is actually is movie ID and we pass the movie ID and we call this function

87
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,150
which is asynchronous as well.

88
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:19,040
And finally, we're going to show it, show it inside this return.

89
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,130
And also we need to return here as well.

90
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:27,560
So here, instead of saying movie, I'm going to return this.

91
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,200
Await response.

92
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,370
Dodgson.

93
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,020
So this is going to return.

94
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:41,060
And we get the movie here and we put it inside this.

95
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:41,510
All right.

96
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,320
So now we can show it inside this day.

97
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,330
For example, I'm going to show.

98
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,710
The H one tag with the movie title.

99
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,170
Let's see that we can get the result.

100
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,860
So I'm going to refresh the page here.

101
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:02,810
And based on this ID, we should get the title of the movie.

102
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:09,700
Let's save it again and refresh the page here.

103
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,970
Well, let's try another movie.

104
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,010
For example, this one.

105
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,550
So we are not getting the title.

106
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,670
Let's check.

107
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,890
So this movie we get we have passed the title here.

108
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,400
So.

109
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:45,450
Can be a title or if the title is not available, we want to get the movie.

110
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,390
That name, for example.

111
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,430
So now it's just.

112
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,200
Tested.

113
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,780
Let's refresh the page.

114
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,560
It should show here.

115
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,910
Let's check what mistakes we have done.

116
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,540
Okay.

117
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,720
You hear this premise?

118
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,890
We got it directly.

119
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,770
It should be inside a curly braces.

120
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,550
Okay.

121
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,180
Okay, that's fine.

122
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,380
Now let's check it.

123
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,040
Let's go to the other pages.

124
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,090
Trending.

125
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,220
And then we click here.

126
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:52,730
All right.

127
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,850
So let's see what problem we have here.

128
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:04,490
Now, I think this prams should be prams dot ID, actually, because this is the name is ID, and the

129
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,050
programs can have different variables.

130
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,750
So this ID should be added here.

131
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,680
Now we see the title of the movie.

132
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,200
Let's try a different movie.

133
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,590
For example, this one.

134
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,580
Okay, We see the title.

135
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,310
All right.

136
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:31,280
So now we need to install this one and create a beautiful page for this one.

137
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,830
Instead of just getting the title, I'm going to create some page here.

138
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,420
So first thing first, I want to add

139
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,160
a full weight to this day.

140
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,290
So I'm going to add a class name.

141
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,270
And just set the fit width to be full.

142
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:02,410
And instead of this insert inside of this tape, we're going to have.

143
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,720
Another death.

144
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:13,700
And in this stiff is going to create a two column for us.

145
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,350
So we're going to.

146
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:24,720
So let's add some padding in the y axis padding of the four in the medium size and above.

147
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,630
I want the padding top of eight.

148
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,400
Let's change the display to flex.

149
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:42,940
So by changing the display to flex, we can change the flex direction to column and bring after the

150
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,950
medium size and above.

151
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,040
I want to change the flex to row.

152
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,860
So when we have a smaller screen, the image would be on top of the.

153
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:55,720
Ticks.

154
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,390
But after the medium size and above, we're going to have them next to each other.

155
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:08,620
So this is going to mix, makes it responsive and we can use items.

156
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:19,020
Dash center and justify Content Center or just a content center.

157
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,990
Content center is equal to align content center.

158
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:30,660
This is going to help us to bring them exactly in the center.

159
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:41,880
We set the maximum width of the size of this to be six x LX, which is equal to the header section and

160
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,950
everything would be in a line.

161
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:48,570
And we're going to add a mach margin x auto to.

162
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,030
Keep them everything in the center and in the medium size and above.

163
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,610
I want to have some space in the x axis between the two columns of six.

164
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:15,100
So we have this div now we're going to add the image and the description on the on the right side.

165
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:22,700
So first we're going to have an image here, the image tag which is coming from the next.

166
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,640
Yes, 13.

167
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,540
This is similar to the one that we have created in the cart.

168
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,600
So I'm going to copy that image.

169
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,400
I'm going to copy.

170
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:42,520
Let's close this and I'm going to copy this image tag and put it inside this.

171
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:49,740
So this is going to save some time for us because it's exactly the same.

172
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:55,440
And the weight and height.

173
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,600
The class name.

174
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,270
So the class name, we're going to change it a little bit.

175
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,340
We don't need everything here.

176
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:12,310
We just I just want to make it rounded large.

177
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,910
So delete everything and add the rounded.

178
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,010
Round that.

179
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,540
So let's see.

180
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,660
Dash.

181
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,010
LG.

182
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,800
And the style would be the same.

183
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:49,680
The height is also we can change the height to be 100% as well here, so we can get the full quality

184
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,180
of the image here.

185
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,700
And the alternative for this one.

186
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:02,010
Is going to we can say the image is not available or we can just say the movie.

187
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,530
And poster, for example.

188
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,450
Okay.

189
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:12,340
So this is going to have this banner as well.

190
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,860
So the image should be here.

191
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,940
Now, let's let's check and we try again.

192
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,180
So this is going to show us the image for us.

193
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:26,800
Now.

194
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,920
Let's see.

195
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:29,970
Okay.

196
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,550
We are getting an error.

197
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,050
Let's see the error.

198
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,850
So the image is not defined.

199
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,370
So we need to import this image tag.

200
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:45,890
So I'm going to use the contour space to auto import the next forward slash image.

201
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,030
So now we shouldn't get this error.

202
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,610
So let's refresh the page.

203
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,140
We got another error.

204
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,140
Let's see.

205
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,540
We still get the same error.

206
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,100
Image is not defined.

207
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:09,000
Let's refresh the page again.

208
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,950
I think I didn't save this one.

209
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,820
Let's save this one again.

210
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:23,640
Now, as you can see, we have imported the image tag from next forward slash image.

211
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,560
It should work.

212
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:24,920
Now.

213
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,790
Let's wait until this is reloaded.

214
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,020
So we get an error again.

215
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,710
The error is the result is not defined.

216
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,850
So probably we didn't get the result yet.

217
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,000
Let's see what result.

218
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:53,820
So this one is resolved, that puzzle that this one should be movie because we we have changed this

219
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,510
one to movie.

220
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,900
So I'm going to copy this movie instead of results.

221
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:07,620
I'm going to say movie dot pack, backdrop, underline path and movie poster, underline path.

222
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,550
So this one should solve the problem.

223
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,090
Now let's check the browser.

224
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,310
We refresh the page here.

225
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,530
Okay, now it shows the image for us.

226
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,970
So let's check it for the other movies as well.

227
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,500
So I'm going to come back to the trending page.

228
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:42,940
It's this is always happened when you're in the development mode because it's always compiling your

229
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:48,100
next year's code at this point gets a little bit slow.

230
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,800
And also I'm recording as well at the same time.

231
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,610
So this is all depend on your CPU and the RAM.

232
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,030
So let's go to the trending page.

233
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,780
Okay in the trending page.

234
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,710
Let's choose another movie.

235
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,840
For example, the first one.

236
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,790
As you can see, they're loading.

237
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,100
It's working as well.

238
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,260
So after the loading finish, we're going to see the image here.

239
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,060
All right.

240
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,800
So you can see the image now.

241
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,840
So let's move on and create the other part of this page.

242
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,160
So I want to bring this one on the right side and the code on the left side.

243
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:49,680
So after the image, we're going to add the other parts of the page.

244
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,290
I'm going to add another div here.

245
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,890
Inside this tip.

246
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:03,820
I'm going to add some other parts.

247
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,990
The first thing I want to add is an H to tag.

248
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,310
With the movie title and movie name.

249
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,310
So this is going to be.

250
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,550
Movie.

251
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:28,960
Got title or if this one is not available, this is going to be movie.

252
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,700
Dot name.

253
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,320
So we're going to style this one first.

254
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,650
So that's let's add a class name here.

255
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,250
Let's add change that takes to be large.

256
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,930
And also let us add a margin at the bottom of three.

257
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,440
Sorry, the margin bottom of tree.

258
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,630
And also we want to add a font board for this.

259
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,990
This should be like that.

260
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,240
And for the top tip, we're going to add a padding of two.

261
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,550
So we have the title now.

262
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:36,690
After the title, I'm going to add some other things like the overview and other parts.

263
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,210
So I'm going to add a paragraph.

264
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,600
The paragraph is going to have a.

265
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:49,250
Uh, expand inside it because I want to have a title for that.

266
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,730
So for the spam, I want to just say over view clone.

267
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:05,840
And after this is spam, we're going to have that movie dot over view.

268
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,830
And let's style this hair graph as well.

269
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,350
So this one should be overview.

270
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,100
Not over views.

271
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,910
And then the class name we're going to add here.

272
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,820
It's just we want to add the text to be large.

273
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,650
And we add a margin bottom of tree.

274
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,760
For this overview.

275
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:45,110
I want to make it bold or semi bold, so I'm going to add a font to be semi bold.

276
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,150
And we add some margin at the right of one.

277
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,420
So this is going to add some space here.

278
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,810
Now you can see the.

279
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,550
Explanation and other things.

280
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,570
So inside.

281
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,720
The mobile size.

282
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,480
We see it like that in the big screen.

283
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,640
They are next to each other because we have added a dynamic flex.

284
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,270
Hey.

285
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,130
And let's add the other parts.

286
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,040
So after the overview.

287
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,610
I want to add some.

288
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,820
Real estate.

289
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:33,080
So I'm going to another paragraph with the spam inside.

290
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:38,060
It is spam is going to say date.

291
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,220
Released.

292
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,590
It clone.

293
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,500
Let's add.

294
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,780
Because, uh.

295
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,150
So that is fine.

296
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:02,960
So we're going to create we're going to add a margin bottom of three for this one as well.

297
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,560
And let's.

298
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,900
Make this a span to be.

299
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,910
Semi bold the font to be semi bold.

300
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,980
And we add some margin at the right of one.

301
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:33,850
And then also after this, this ban, we're going to have the information of the movie.

302
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,560
Release date.

303
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,320
So we just say movie Dot.

304
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,420
Release underline.

305
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:58,180
Date or sorry date or if this one is not available, we're going to see the movie.

306
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:03,840
Dot first underlying.

307
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,230
Air underline dates.

308
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:09,970
Okay.

309
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,150
This one should work now.

310
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,060
So we see the release date after this one.

311
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,680
We're going to have another paragraph for the rating.

312
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,910
I'm going to copy this one.

313
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,200
So this is very similar.

314
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:32,580
So I'm going to copy this paragraph and instead of date released, this one should be rating.

315
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,890
And this one instead of this, it should be.

316
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:43,690
Vote.

317
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,770
Underline.

318
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,070
Can't.

319
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,610
You can get more information about the movie and add it here.

320
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,640
So make it more informal informative.

321
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,910
But for simplicity, I just got this for information.

322
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:15,440
I just want to show you in next year's 13 how you work with the dynamic URL's, how to get the information.

323
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,780
So let's test this one for another movie.

324
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,130
We go to top rated.

325
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,850
I just want to choose, for example, the Godfather movie.

326
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:26,330
This is going to show us the all the overview.

327
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,090
See, said another one, for example, this movie.

328
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,090
All right, So.

329
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:37,600
That was it for this section for creating the page.

330
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,680
And also we can see that this is also works on the dark mode as well.

331
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,540
So in this section we have completed this.

332
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,220
Part the creating the page.

333
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,850
Let's add this one to GitHub and we review what we have done.

334
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,190
So inside the source control using control shift G.

335
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,450
I'm going to add everything and create a message for this one.

336
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:13,490
Say add movie page and we're going to commit and push this one to GitHub.

337
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:17,600
And after that I'm going to go to my GitHub.

338
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,170
And go to the comment section.

339
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,990
As you can see, we have now a new commit.

340
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,910
Add the movie page.

341
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:38,030
So we have created a page inside the app directory with the with a new folder, movie and other folder

342
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,230
for ID.

343
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:45,940
And also we have just named the file page that asks.

344
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:53,170
We have created a function here, a synchronous function, which is going to fetch the movies with the

345
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:59,920
ID, and we get the response by fetching this URL.

346
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:10,930
And then we're going to return the movie by changing it to the JSON file and we change this file to

347
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,190
asynchronous as well.

348
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:19,000
We got the params here which is going to give us the movie ID based on the name of the folder.

349
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:25,660
And we also get the movie by bye calling that function.

350
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:34,930
So inside here we have added an image tag which is similar to the one that we have created for the card

351
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:45,520
component, which has the source of movie that drop path and has everything similar to that one.

352
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:53,470
And after that we have added the title, the overview and the release date and finally the move the

353
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,640
vote count.

354
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:55,710
All right.

355
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,260
So that was it for creating the page.

356
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:03,330
In the next section, we're going to add the search ability.

357
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:08,160
As you can see from the final version, we can we have the ability to search.

358
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,470
For example, if I search for Wolf, you're going to see the movies related to this search.

359
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:21,250
Term, this is going to be very easy because we already have created this card component.

360
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,420
And the result, that G6 component file, we just have to create an inbox.

361
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,980
Then input.

362
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:37,610
And we just redirect to this URL search, for example, for Wolf.

363
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:47,240
And based on this keyword, we're going to search the IMDB API and get all the movies related to that

364
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,240
search term and show it inside the results.

365
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:57,980
That component that we have created before, because we have created these files before, we can easily

366
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,270
finish this part.

367
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:05,900
So next in the next section, we're going to work on this search box.
