1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:17,270
Welcome back in this section, we're going to start installing next year and Tillmans CSIS and a start

2
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,430
the template of our project.

3
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,990
So first, let's go to the.

4
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,890
Next year's flipside, we just in Google search next.

5
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,400
Jill, yes.

6
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,900
And in the in the results section, we go to next year, that or.

7
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:50,970
This is the official website of Neches, which is a brand of verse, all that later we're going to use

8
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,790
to deploy to our application.

9
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,740
And here we just click on documentation.

10
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:10,590
And as you can see, you need not just 12 or later as a pre installation for this project.

11
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:20,820
So I assume that you already installed notches in your computer and also NPN.

12
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,600
I'm using NPN, but you can use your phone as well.

13
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,340
So here as you can see, in order to have the latest version of the next year, we can use this

14
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,960
command in our terminal.

15
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,300
So we copy this and we open our command terminal.

16
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,700
I use common prompt.

17
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:51,570
So let me increase the size of this so you can see better.

18
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:55,900
All right.

19
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,270
So we've paste the code and create Nick's app.

20
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:08,770
Athletes actually forgot before pasting this on, let's go to our inside.

21
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:18,190
I would like to create a project in my desktop, so I just write this stuff, see the desktop and inside

22
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,740
this stuff, I want to create the project.

23
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,870
So we have.

24
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,750
NPCs create Nick's latest.

25
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,350
And after this base, we write down the name of our project.

26
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,730
Which is, in our case, is inStar.

27
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,230
I just like that Insta version, I already practiced this application.

28
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:51,300
Yeah, I think three times, so I just tried version four, but you can name your application anything

29
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:53,730
you want.

30
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,190
So I press enter.

31
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,970
So the installation process going to start the first we asked me to.

32
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,040
Proceed.

33
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,240
So it just right.

34
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,170
Why?

35
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,360
So as you can see, react, react and next are.

36
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,470
Are being installed and the.

37
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:28,640
So while this one is installing, let's go to a children's CSIS website, and because we're going to

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,200
use till next year, as for installing our project, so we go to tell them, yes, yes.

39
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,180
We need to click on tailwinds, yes, have stuff come?

40
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,480
Pegasus is rapidly building modern websites.

41
00:03:52,350 --> 00:04:01,890
If you go to get started section now, we need to use that framework, so the framework guides here

42
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,450
and the Tab Installation tab, we have frameworks guides.

43
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,730
And here we can see next year.

44
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,650
We click on next year.

45
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:15,730
And.

46
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,020
The there are some steps to do it.

47
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:27,760
First thing is just install the next year that we are already done this part and then we need to go

48
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,050
to the folder we have created, which is the name of our project.

49
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,400
And after that, we need to install Taylor's office.

50
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,330
By this comment, and also, we need to initialize it by this one.

51
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,350
Finally.

52
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,460
We need to change the children's systems config, file it like this.

53
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,180
Which has the gist and Typekit scripts.

54
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:10,380
And we changed the color of altered CFS to this comment, and also we can run our application using

55
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,610
NPR on this.

56
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,600
So let's go back to the terminal.

57
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:23,820
We see that the application already installed, so we see the inside our application.

58
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,470
The name of my application was install version four.

59
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:34,650
So I see the into it and I can use or you can use.

60
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,240
Could.

61
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:45,490
Dot to open up the Visual Studio code, which is the default code editor of me.

62
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:56,670
This command's going to open a visual studio code with the current folder that's already installed using

63
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:56,910
an.

64
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,280
You can use any text editor.

65
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,650
And if you want to if you are comfortable with others, it's up to you.

66
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:16,290
If you go to package such as songs, you can see that we already have.

67
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,880
Knicks react, react on.

68
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:29,290
And also, we can use and pin Ron there to install to start our application.

69
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,210
In a development mode, so.

70
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:44,500
Before starting our application or you just opened the terminal and I want to show you what the application

71
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,140
looked like now so empty and run there.

72
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,900
And let's decrease the size of this.

73
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,920
We closed this terminal, we don't need it.

74
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,770
And the open.

75
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:15,280
The local host, 3000, you just keep control and click on it, and it's going to be opened here, as

76
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,970
you can see now, we have a welcome page of next year's.

77
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:26,900
And the associated links for the documentation of next year from vessel.

78
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,400
The next part, as I mentioned, we need to install.

79
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,390
So we go back to the children's CSF website and the second step.

80
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:51,620
Is this installed, Taylor says a copy this code and paste it inside the terminal, so we first we stop

81
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,700
the server using Contra See?

82
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,420
Let me decrease the size of this.

83
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,330
Yeah, and the clear their terminal.

84
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,400
Let's make it better, bigger.

85
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:12,670
All right.

86
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,140
So.

87
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,510
We paste the link and install it.

88
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,630
It's going to take a few seconds because it's not a big package, actually deal CFS.

89
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,860
And then after that, we're going to initialize it to get these Tilman Cece's config files.

90
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:39,930
We don't have it now, but after installing and initializing see if it's using this command, we're

91
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:45,360
going to have some files, including children that can't take that.

92
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,640
I hear.

93
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:59,450
So we click on tailwind that config dot, yes, and we copy this code and we replace this previous code

94
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,140
with death on.

95
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:10,820
So this is going to be we can use all the JS and G6 files inside the children's success.

96
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,680
After that, we go to source folder here.

97
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:23,590
Global studies CSIS and replace everything with these three lines of code.

98
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:26,930
All right.

99
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:37,870
But if, you know, run the server using and can run, if we're going to get some errors because we

100
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,790
deleted some of the fiercest styling.

101
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,470
That we were using in this page.

102
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:57,630
So as you can see a little bit, we can see a lot of a change inside the temple template.

103
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,340
Uh, let's delete this home.

104
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:08,560
That module that says we don't need it because we are using children's for styling and we're getting

105
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:18,380
an error because inside the pages and index that, yes, we're using this, uh, home that module that

106
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,040
consists.

107
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,030
So it this.

108
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,400
I also hear.

109
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:35,710
And yeah, we use it in many places, so we delete everything from the main to the future.

110
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:38,590
And.

111
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:47,530
Now, our application is completely empty, we just use an H1 tag.

112
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,970
Saying Hello, world.

113
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,120
So we can see here.

114
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,110
Yeah.

115
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,410
Let's change the title of our application, which you can see here.

116
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,470
Create next app to.

117
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,680
Instagram.

118
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,230
Application Instagram app you can see here.

119
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,130
All right.

120
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:30,000
So now I want to show you that in the final version of our project, which I have here.

121
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,320
We have some.

122
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:37,520
Sorry.

123
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,620
We have some sections.

124
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,940
I show you.

125
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,860
Yeah, we have.

126
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,930
A header at the top.

127
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,200
And they have.

128
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,560
Feet section at the bottom, so the feet section includes.

129
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,220
This section to this story.

130
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:18,020
And the posts and also we have a mini profile here with this suggestion as well.

131
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:28,250
So the things we are going to do to, we start with the header section and we keep continue with the

132
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:34,190
feed section at the left side and then we could finish it on the right side.

133
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,060
So uh, let's.

134
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:40,520
Yeah.

135
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,930
So let's do this the same template in our project.

136
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,860
So inside the index that yes, instead of this hello world.

137
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,070
You're going to create.

138
00:12:53,750 --> 00:13:03,140
360 also, we have another fictional forgot to mention, if you want to upload an image or a post,

139
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,930
we have a model this this one is called model.

140
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,950
So uh.

141
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,680
So we have hit our feet and modal inside index that use.

142
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,330
So we just add header.

143
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,960
Here we have.

144
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:25,230
Feed.

145
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,030
S..

146
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:34,490
Now finally, we have the model, so we're going to start.

147
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:45,530
With the Heather section in the next section, and we're going to divide the hair section to three parts

148
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:56,960
the the the logo, the search bar and also the menus with the image icon.

149
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,340
So in the next section, we're going to start.

150
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,960
Creating our Heather S. and.

151
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,330
We're going to use tailwind cases to style, and we're going to use image.

152
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,110
And.

153
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:26,620
The image, a component of the next year to to get this Instagram logo and also this image here.

154
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,030
So see in the next section for the header component.
