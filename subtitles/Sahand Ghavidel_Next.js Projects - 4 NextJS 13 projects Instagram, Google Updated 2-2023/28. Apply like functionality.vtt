00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.570
All right.

2
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.240
In the last section, we have completed the comment section and we got all the data from the database

3
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.470
and show it here just above the input section.

4
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.690
In this section, we are going to achieve the like functionality.

5
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.270
If you look at the final version of the project here.

6
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.270
You can see that the first.

7
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.660
Posed with the bird has two likes.

8
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.810
Let's check the database.

9
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:48.220
And the database is install version one, because that is the final version.

10
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.770
So we checked the.

11
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.110
This is a sunset, this one is the nice bird.

12
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.090
So as you can see.

13
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.920
And we have another collection called Likes.

14
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.450
So we had the comments and we have another one, which is likes.

15
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.840
And this one has two people already at.

16
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.050
Already life, this is not a random idea that you can see here.

17
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.010
This is just a random idea that the virus creates.

18
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:35.300
But this is actually the user name I.D. that is coming from the Gmail.

19
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.060
And if you remember, we added this font to our session.

20
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.160
We modified the session and we got the user ID as well.

21
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:53.430
So we are going to use that information to instead of just adding a random number or a random I.D.,

22
00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:03.060
you're going to add a user name I.D. And if you click this one, we see that you get the username as

23
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.300
well.

24
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.820
So username is this one.

25
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.990
The other one is this one.

26
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:16.200
The reason we are doing that one because we want to have a unique link and we're going to check if the

27
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.450
person is liked or not.

28
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:27.750
So we can based on that bitcoin we can control and also we can show the button red or empty.

29
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:39.110
So let's go to our post that is in the Visual Studio code, and we open our local host three thousand

30
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.230
on the right side.

31
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.160
So let's create another estate called has liked.

32
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.260
So we want to know you want to be sure that there is a like or not.

33
00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:04.350
So at a time after the comments, we're going to add in other states, this state is it you can call

34
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.640
it has like.

35
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.500
Or has liked.

36
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.150
And we're just at the SIT has like.

37
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.740
And this is going to be equal to use a state, and this is going to be false as a default.

38
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:30.860
The initial value would be false because if there's nobody clicked, yeah, it should be empty and there

39
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.020
is no like so has like, it's false.

40
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:40.820
Now, instead of having one hot button here, you're going to have to.

41
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.160
One is filth, one is empty and one should be read.

42
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.730
One should be just feet off color.

43
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.820
So we have here a heart icon.

44
00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:03.470
So let's make it two, and let's make the first one at the back of picks.

45
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.910
Color.

46
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.050
Color of, uh, red.

47
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.290
And the number would be four hundred, but this is just an empty heart.

48
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.460
We want the field one.

49
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:25.620
So there is another icon called heart icon filled.

50
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.920
And we should important as well.

51
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.680
At a top.

52
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.230
So just after this week at.

53
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.160
Heart icon, filth.

54
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.130
Let's refresh the page.

55
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.210
So they said in.

56
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.870
Components.

57
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.160
I think this uh.

58
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.870
You know, this is not called heart icon, actually, we need to.

59
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.680
Bring this fun from something, sound from the solid, actually.

60
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.150
And let's copy this.

61
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.270
And we changed our client to solid.

62
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:41.200
This is actually called a hot heart icon, but.

63
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.860
Because we have two heart icons, this is going to be confusing and repetitive.

64
00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:00.860
So we're going to change this one as heart icon felt.

65
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.440
So now let's refresh the page.

66
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:16.580
Know we have a solid icon, the heart icon with the red color and one empty.

67
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.290
We want to show this one.

68
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:26.780
If this this state here we created it has like it's true and if it's false, we want to show this one.

69
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.400
So here we create a ternary operator at a time.

70
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.060
Here we just say if the haves like.

71
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.330
It's true.

72
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.310
Then showed.

73
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.100
This so he copied and pasted here.

74
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.520
Otherwise.

75
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.890
Sure, this one.

76
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.820
So we put it aside this.

77
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.810
No.

78
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.260
Let's refresh the page.

79
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.120
Now we see only the.

80
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.490
Empty one because they filled the the field one.

81
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:18.400
Has the condition of the House like to be true, which is false now because we haven't liked yet?

82
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.520
So in order to have this one, we need to add on to the icon.

83
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.580
So and you're going to call it function.

84
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:37.580
So here in the heart, I feel and heart icon, you're going to add Uncle, so I buy all.

85
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.260
I choose both of them.

86
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.420
So we just say and click.

87
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:54.310
And the old cliff is going to call a function called let's call it like post.

88
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:56.350
All right.

89
00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.860
But we should define this.

90
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.160
So let's go off and create the function.

91
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.410
So just above the.

92
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:14.170
This function will create a scent for scent comment, we create another asynchronous function.

93
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.580
And we call this one sent.

94
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.280
So like most.

95
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:25.910
So.

96
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:35.250
So this is going to be a weight as well, and this is going to sit at documents.

97
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.280
And the document would be.

98
00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:49.530
From Doc, this is a building function from fire store and from we get the DPI data.

99
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:57.900
And this is going to be inside the posts and I.D. because this is a unique post.

100
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.850
For example, if you like here, it's different from liking the next sponsor.

101
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:07.950
We need to have the I.D. and then record this collection likes.

102
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.720
And after that, we're going to get this session.

103
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.090
That's user that user I.D..

104
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.860
So this is going to be unique each like.

105
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:23.780
I don't know, we have.

106
00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.050
Imported decision or not?

107
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.580
Yeah, we have a decision here.

108
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.430
But, uh, we need.

109
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:38.660
Let's see that we get an error by clicking here, if we get error, we know.

110
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:43.820
Yes, Sitak is not the find the reason we at.

111
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:49.320
We use set-top instead of at dark because we want to change this.

112
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.030
Sitak.

113
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.500
We.

114
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.250
We are not.

115
00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:02.350
Adding something via modify, sometimes like sometimes to remove the rock.

116
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.700
So we use the sitar can be imported.

117
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.550
So let's try again by looking.

118
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:16.400
So the duck duck is not the fire, so we talk as well.

119
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:22.550
So this is a good way to check if something is imported or not.

120
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.620
So let's try again.

121
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.140
To find further.

122
00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.110
Functions that are called with invalid data.

123
00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:45.520
The reason for this fight is we haven't finished it yet, because after this, we're going to actually.

124
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.740
Set to use an app, so here.

125
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:59.850
After this one, we need to create the object, and we're going to submit this object so that it things

126
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.560
we want to say is username.

127
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.740
Equals the session that user not use it.

128
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.830
OK, now we try again.

129
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:17.850
So we didn't get any error.

130
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:25.770
That's the good news, so we got the database and we selected the database we are working on, which

131
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:27.480
is insert a version for.

132
00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:29.560
No.

133
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:42.010
Let's check the there one that yeah, this one the next year, of course, which is the we like, let's

134
00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:51.040
check that we created the light collection and this is this one has the user name I.D., which is coming

135
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.090
from Google and the user name is created.

136
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.720
So that was successful the next step.

137
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:06.450
Is to actually remove the like.

138
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:21.610
So here, when we called the function, set it dark here, we need to add a ternary operator or just

139
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:21.930
the.

140
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:32.090
Normal if condition, and we check that if the horse has a like or not, if it has a life, we remove

141
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:36.500
the like and if it doesn't have to like.

142
00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:43.660
So we sit there like before doing this one, we need to get the lax data.

143
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:49.670
So we should know that if there is a leak inside the database or not.

144
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.290
So we we don't know yet.

145
00:12:51.560 --> 00:13:00.590
So we should create another parameter or another state call and let's create another state and we call

146
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:01.360
it likes.

147
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:05.870
So you want to get the LAX, so we have to set LAX.

148
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:16.030
And we just used to use a state and we set it to be empty bracket, which means there is no like yet

149
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.440
initial value.

150
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:26.440
And in order to understand if there is a like or not, we need to use use effective fish fetch data

151
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.520
from the database.

152
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.280
So we use the use effect.

153
00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.200
We create a function.

154
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:41.440
And here we add added dependency, which is.

155
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.920
Likes, so we're going to add a.

156
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:49.870
So.

157
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:56.040
If you just sit, sit there has like like this.

158
00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:03.180
So we loop through to the likes and we check the index.

159
00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.210
Let me explain this one in a way with the.

160
00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:14.960
Drawing.

161
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:17.580
So.

162
00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.400
Imagine here.

163
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:28.020
So let me yeah, just we have an array of likes here.

164
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.250
So this is the user one.

165
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.300
And then we have user to.

166
00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:38.980
I use a three.

167
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.360
Is a tree and use it for.

168
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:45.970
All right.

169
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.710
And each of them has an index that the first index is zero.

170
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:55.390
Then we have this one, two and three.

171
00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:02.350
So what we do here is we go to the likes array.

172
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:04.520
All right.

173
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.340
We checked the index.

174
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.740
So if there is a one

175
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.770
one user, the index is zero, if there is a two.

176
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.810
So we have zero and one.

177
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.210
All right.

178
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:24.140
And the number that is not existed in this area is minus one.

179
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:30.180
So we don't have minus one or minus two, so we check everything.

180
00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:36.510
And if there is no minus one means that we have a like.

181
00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:39.320
All right.

182
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:46.170
If this this one is not equal, so we have a minus one, so.

183
00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.020
Let's create this one.

184
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.890
So we just said likes.

185
00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:54.660
And we find the index.

186
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:05.990
We get each of the like each person that's life and.

187
00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.280
We check that it's like that I.D..

188
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.490
Is equal to session.

189
00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:16.860
That user.

190
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.680
Doth user I.D..

191
00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:23.550
Yeah.

192
00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.050
So this is going to give us.

193
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.220
So we're going to look through the indexes.

194
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:45.020
We want to look to the likes and we check if each life has an I.D. equal to the user I.D., as we can

195
00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.170
see inside the here.

196
00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:48.980
So now we have one.

197
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:55.160
If another person like you have two, so you're checking that this.

198
00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:57.030
No.

199
00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:06.460
This number is equal to the number that person is locked in, which is a session that uses that user

200
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:06.760
ID.

201
00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:15.810
So if this one happened, so we get an index, for example, at the second user in the array, I, I

202
00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:17.770
wrote, I draw.

203
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:29.790
If the second, yeah, second one in the array is the user, this is going to gives us an index of one.

204
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:31.580
All right.

205
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:33.200
So.

206
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.960
And then we said if this is not equal.

207
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.500
This one is not.

208
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.060
Let me clear this for another minute.

209
00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:59.890
If this is not equal to minus one, if this if it's not equal to minus one, it means that nobody liked

210
00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:00.370
it yet.

211
00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:06.460
But if the index we get, it's anything like a zero one, two three and et cetera.

212
00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:16.750
We have like and we have like because there is an I.D. which is equal to decision that user that user

213
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:17.050
I.D..

214
00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:23.410
So we sit there has like now, let's save this one and test it.

215
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.050
You said a light post is not defined.

216
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:40.500
Yeah.

217
00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.440
Not because it's not as if we created the function here.

218
00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.130
Cause like post.

219
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:55.170
So do.

220
00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.650
We just have to see something went.

221
00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.210
Yeah, we.

222
00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.450
We didn't close.

223
00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.720
Yeah, this added a comma here.

224
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:17.780
So now it should be fine.

225
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.600
So the first one.

226
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.310
Let's like it and to check.

227
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.690
So this is OK.

228
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:54.680
It should actually show us the red button instead of the this one.

229
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:55.850
Let's check it again.

230
00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.060
Sit has like likes that.

231
00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:07.780
Fine index, like is equal to like that idea.

232
00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.880
This one is.

233
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.910
Equal, not equal to minus one.

234
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.190
And this one looks fine.

235
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.510
And we have has life.

236
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.430
Yeah, we haven't set the locks yet, actually.

237
00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.530
So we should get the facts first.

238
00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:46.310
So here at the top of this.

239
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:54.780
This use effect, we need to get the LAX because we don't have the LAX yet.

240
00:20:54.900 --> 00:21:05.880
So you just say use the fact similar way and the and the dependency and the dependency is just at the

241
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.450
tip.

242
00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.050
So we want to get the information.

243
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:20.740
That's why we need to use the snapshot, so we just create a constant unsubscribe you use on snapshot.

244
00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.890
And here we are going to.

245
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:37.120
Beginning the collection and the collection as we get here, is deep post idea instead of comments,

246
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.380
it should be lax.

247
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.350
And here.

248
00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.390
So let me save this.

249
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.600
And here we are getting after this.

250
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.830
A snapshot.

251
00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:56.260
Let's check it.

252
00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:59.950
Yeah, just after this, we're getting this snapshot.

253
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:08.170
And this snapshot is going to fit the likes.

254
00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:13.670
To a snapshot.

255
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:17.200
Ducks.

256
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.780
So this is we have done.

257
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.710
This one is in.

258
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:31.330
Forty seven.

259
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:38.310
Because we need to protect the session.

260
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:41.300
So if would just add something here?

261
00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:42.980
This is very OK.

262
00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:44.780
So we refresh the page.

263
00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:51.380
Now we can see that the first one has their red icon.

264
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.670
All right.

265
00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:55.830
And the second one to me.

266
00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.110
But when we click.

267
00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:00.940
Actually, nothing happened.

268
00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.520
We need to remove their like.

269
00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:05.310
So we haven't at this functionality yet.

270
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:17.370
So the places we added like here, this function like post, so we set the light, but we want to delete

271
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.490
the like if there is a like.

272
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.920
So we just create a.

273
00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:29.810
You create a function in life if condition.

274
00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.200
And we say if there is a like has black.

275
00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:36.480
Then.

276
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:45.810
So let's.

277
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:54.870
If there is a like we want to await and deleted like so we use the Delete Doc Delete.

278
00:23:57.190 --> 00:24:06.850
Delete doc utility of the Firebase, then we just similar to what we have done here.

279
00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:08.800
We can copy this one, actually.

280
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:16.340
Yes, copy this, they said here.

281
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.700
And we need another parenthesis.

282
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.250
OK.

283
00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.160
So we deleted like.

284
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:37.070
From which phone, which documented the deep post ideologues and decision to user so both otherwise

285
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:38.820
we had else here.

286
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.330
Otherwise, we want to set the back.

287
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.310
So now.

288
00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.020
Let's refresh the page.

289
00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.570
So we have to lie.

290
00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:52.720
But if we click, no, we should remove the light.

291
00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.420
And inside the database.

292
00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:02.890
And let's decrease the size of the database so you can see the adding and removing.

293
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:13.270
So when we click here to remove the locks again, we add the deluxe and if we sign in with another user.

294
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:18.900
Let's imagine we sign in with my other Google account.

295
00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:26.760
So let's go to Google.

296
00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:29.590
And another account.

297
00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.350
I don't know, it went outside.

298
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:43.280
So let me quickly add my credentials.

299
00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.790
So here.

300
00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.160
Well, let me.

301
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.930
They're fine myself and my other device.

302
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:08.410
See?

303
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:13.820
OK.

304
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:17.930
So that's finished now.

305
00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:19.530
Let's.

306
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:22.880
Let's sign in with other accounts.

307
00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:31.950
Yeah, I highly recommend you have to two accounts to test your system, so, you know the functionality

308
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:32.310
better.

309
00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:36.780
So you have a I sign in with my other account.

310
00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:43.650
No, you can see that there's no like here because I haven't liked this post with this account here.

311
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.490
So when I like, you should see another idea comes to you.

312
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.310
So you can see now there are two ideas.

313
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.660
The other one is the discount.

314
00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:05.140
And if I remove just remove it, so it's very fast, fibrous, it's very fast because the utility they

315
00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:12.150
use, all the system is based on Google's system and it's everywhere in the world.

316
00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:19.780
And if you want a very fast application or website, I highly recommend to use Firebase.

317
00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:21.460
All right.

318
00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:29.320
So in the next section, we are going to deploy the website to Verso and we're going to get it.

319
00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:32.050
Put it inside a custom URL.

320
00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.350
So let's do our.

321
00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:47.610
Get hop section, so we have to get at and we come at it with a new comment with the message of.

322
00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:50.680
And the message would be.

323
00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:57.740
Apply like functionality.

324
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.160
Functionality.

325
00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.200
So we push it to get hard.

326
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:12.780
Let's review our code because it was a lot of work.

327
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:22.070
So let's review what we have done, so let's refresh our up and go to the last comment.

328
00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:29.860
So we, uh, we created another heart icon and it filled one.

329
00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:35.500
We got it from solid and we created two states.

330
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:41.600
One is the like and one is has liked, so we got the all the likes.

331
00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:48.880
And we also check if the, uh, the the post has a like or not.

332
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:53.620
And we got, uh, all the.

333
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:58.390
This is not the vote for the previous one here.

334
00:28:59.220 --> 00:28:59.520
Yeah.

335
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.680
Here we got all the likes.

336
00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.780
Using on a snapshot and collection.

337
00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:08.190
Then.

338
00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:17.840
We check if it's there's a link with the user name I.D. or not by this one.

339
00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:27.050
This use of bay and the we just use a logic we could we check all the index and we check if the person

340
00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:32.450
is liked or not and if the I the index was minus one.

341
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:38.420
It was not minus fun it it meant that it has a like.

342
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:40.280
All right.

343
00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.120
So, yeah, yeah, it has a like.

344
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:54.370
So we have we have created a function called lactose, which has two things to do.

345
00:29:55.180 --> 00:30:00.670
First one, if there is a lie, we delete the like if there is no like.

346
00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:05.330
We set a light with the user name.

347
00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:15.410
To it and, uh, we create we added another a heart icon, and we said if there is a light show, the

348
00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:19.820
fifth one, if there is no light, just show the empty one.

349
00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.480
And uh, yeah, that was it.

350
00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.470
For this part.

351
00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:29.480
In the next section, we're going to deploy this website.

352
00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:41.660
To the reversal, and we we added to our custom URL as well, if you have it, you bought a domain,

353
00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:47.090
you can add this fund to the domain to I show you how to do it and also you're going to add something

354
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:48.020
called secret.

355
00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.450
If you look at here.

356
00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:53.890
We are always getting an error.

Mostly, we get an error.

360
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:12.570
All of us think that there is no secret to fine, but we haven't get any issue yet because we are not

361
00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.970
in a we are in a deployment mode.

362
00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:21.780
If you go to the production mode, the lack of burst or we we should define a secret is you can see

363
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:24.030
this warning from next off.

364
00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:33.300

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.290
deploy our side to versa.

366
00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:38.760
