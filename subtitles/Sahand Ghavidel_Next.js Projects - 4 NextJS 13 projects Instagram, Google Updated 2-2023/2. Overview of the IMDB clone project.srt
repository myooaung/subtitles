00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,110
All right, in this section, we're going to overview the IMDB movie app, as you can see from the final
1

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,460
version of the project.
2

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,990
We have three sections.
3

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:17,460
The header, which includes the menu with hero icons and IMDB logo.
4

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,490
Then we have the navbar with two taps trending and top rated.
5

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:32,280
When we click on Trending, we can see that genre is changed to fetch trending, and the result is shown
6

7
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,180
accordingly.
7

8
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:42,660
And if we click on top rated, we can see that the genre is fetch top rated now and the results are different.
8

9
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:51,770
In the results section, we have a thumbnail that includes an image, an overview, the title, the
9

10
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,870
release date and the vote count.
10

11
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:03,860
If we decrease the size of the browser, we can see in the mobile screen, we have the menu and the
11

12
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,720
logo on the top of each other.
12

13
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,100
And also we have only one column in the result.
13

14
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:16,250
We're going to achieve this using CSS grid, which is coming from Tailwind CSS classes.
14

15
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:23,570
If we increase the size of the browser a little bit to tablet size, we get the menu and the individual
15

16
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,430
logo next to each other, and we have two columns in the results section.
16

17
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,370
If we increase more, we can see three columns and finally, four columns.
17

18
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:40,340
And if we decrease the Zoom level of the browser, we can see we get five columns.
18

19
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:48,260
This is going to be achieved easily using grid system that is provided by Tailwind CSS classes.
19

20
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,730
In the next section.
20

21
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:56,630
We're going to start installing the Next.js and Tailwind CSS, and we're going to learn how to achieve
21

22
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,890
the first template.
22

23
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,020
So see in the next section.
