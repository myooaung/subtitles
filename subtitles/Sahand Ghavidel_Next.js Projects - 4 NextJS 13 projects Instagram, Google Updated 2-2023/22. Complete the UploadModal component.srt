1
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:08,610
All right.

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,080
In the last section, we have completed the model part.

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:24,400
And we put the etch one inside model that when we click on this circle plus icon, we can see the model

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:24,700
here.

5
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:32,230
And when we click outside the model model, you can see that the model is disappeared.

6
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:39,820
In this section, we are going to complete this model part and make it like the final version if you

7
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,320
look at the final version.

8
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:51,600
Here, when we click on this plus circle icon, we can see that we have a camera icon with the background

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,260
of pink.

10
00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:05,180
And we have an input here and also button when we click on this camera icon, the file pic hair trigger

11
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,350
triggers and we can upload an image there.

12
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:11,960
So.

13
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:13,910
Here.

14
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,330
To we just when we write down to something, the file.

15
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:28,540
Like the caption, if it's going to be recorded, so all the information is stored and then when we

16
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:36,370
click on the upload post, it goes to the the the Firebase database.

17
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:46,100
But now we just want to create this UI, and in the next section, we're going to start connect this

18
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,600
model to the.

19
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,430
All right, let's go back to Visual Studio code and.

20
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,030
We open our.

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,130
Terminal, our local host, three thousand on the right side.

22
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,650
First, we bring the camera icon at the top.

23
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,170
So here we import.

24
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,020
Camera.

25
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,900
Icon.

26
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,730
From Hero Icons to react.

27
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,180
Outline, so now we have to fight if we have it.

28
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,850
Let's show it inside the model.

29
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,730
Let's keep it open here.

30
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,480
So.

31
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,200
Inside the model, let's remove this.

32
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,890
H1 tag.

33
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:57,200
And here inside is the the kid, the camera icon.

34
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:06,770
We can see it's huge now we can install it using tells us, yes, this it just.

35
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,970
At first, we create the cursor.

36
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,590
To be pointer, so when we hover over this camera, we can see a pointing hand.

37
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,910
Then let's decrease the size of it by changing its height 14.

38
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,480
And let's add some background color to it.

39
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,630
The background color is red.

40
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,890
Two hundred.

41
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,130
And let's add some padding.

42
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:54,260
So we have some we push it inside and you want to create this around it, around this, so we make the

43
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,400
rounded.

44
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,900
Full, so it's going to be a circle.

45
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,190
And finally, we at a border of two.

46
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,410
To make it like a button.

47
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:18,430
And we just changed the color of the camera to red as well, but.

48
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:28,050
This thread is going to be five hundred, which is a little bit darker.

49
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:38,140
So that's it for the camera icon when we click on the camera icon, we want to open the file picker

50
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,400
so we cannot connect this inside icon.

51
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:49,360
What we do is we add an input here with the input is going to be.

52
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,270
The type would be.

53
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,530
So we create the.

54
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,970
Input, but the tie up is final.

55
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,360
But how do we know that we click here and actually we don't want to show it?

56
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,530
So we first we make it.

57
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,530
Hayden, which is right down here, Hayden.

58
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:25,350
So we completely hidden it, and then we created reference to it, and we call this reference.

59
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:31,610
File picker, ref.

60
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:46,080
The reason we gave the riff referenced, if you want to when we click on the camera, we want to click

61
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,160
actually on this.

62
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,590
Fire.

63
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,050
Let's refresh the page to be signing again.

64
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,170
It is the same that the file picture is not defined.

65
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,610
So we should go out and add top and bring it here.

66
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:21,760
So after this open, it creates a constant and we call a file picker ref and be using a use ref from

67
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,340
react.

68
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,320
To.

69
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,840
Get the reference, and then the first value would be no.

70
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:39,060
And let's import to use if as well by using counter space and we click on, the first author suggests.

71
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,470
Now we have it here.

72
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,000
Now we have the uh.

73
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,010
Fall picker, Jeff.

74
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:59,590
But when we click, we should connect to that inputs so that the way we do it is to add an enclave to

75
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,210
the camera.

76
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:07,030
So in the camera icon, we add on click and the on click is going to be.

77
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,010
If function.

78
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:11,960
There.

79
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,050
Triggers the file picker career.

80
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,090
And we just can't.

81
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,040
That click.

82
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:34,810
It means that click on the file picker, if so, when you click on the camera, actually they are clicking

83
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,160
on the inputs, but

84
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:45,730
the input is not shown because it's hidden, but it's going to be work.

85
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,850
So when we click on the icon, this one, we should open the file picker.

86
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,860
As you can see here.

87
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,450
So.

88
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,480
It's working nice now.

89
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:09,150
Let's go to the next part, which is the input for the.

90
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,740
Because it is inputs here for caption.

91
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,760
So we had two inputs.

92
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,920
The top is ticks and.

93
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:38,470
Let's limit the max length to be 150.

94
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:45,260
And so they cannot write down more than 250 words here.

95
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,210
That's the limit.

96
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,370
Mostly, the Instagram post has so.

97
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,920
And then we have a place holder of just saying, please.

98
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:08,360
Enter your caption.

99
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,570
Yeah, that's fine.

100
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,130
We just need to style it using children to assess.

101
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:27,220
So first we add a margin of four, so we push the camera a little bit upper.

102
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,590
Then we remove the border.

103
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,350
We just said border, none.

104
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,050
And which we make that takes center.

105
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:51,270
And finally, we added, when we click on it, you want to we want to remove this focus too.

106
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,420
We don't want to see that phone as so.

107
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:58,820
So first, we just change the width to be full.

108
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:04,580
So when we actually its covers are everywhere until here.

109
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,140
But, uh, people write down.

110
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,990
It doesn't go to the end because it has a margin of four.

111
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:24,150
Right, so but we just need to remove that blue line around it.

112
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,830
It's very easy.

113
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,500
We just need to have focus.

114
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:35,510
Rink and the rink would be zero.

115
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,150
Now we don't get that.

116
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:39,470
All right.

117
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,160
Let's finish this moral part by just.

118
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:49,630
Adding the button as well, so here you add a button.

119
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,670
Which had which just saying upload.

120
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,630
Post.

121
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,420
And let's start with.

122
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:15,280
With a class name of, uh, we just make this one fall as well with a full.

123
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:25,200
We cannot see it yet, because it doesn't have any background color, we just see background red.

124
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,550
And the darkness would be 600.

125
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:39,990
No, since see this all the way to the to the end, and we can at some margin here as well.

126
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,670
So the the we just firstly, let's make the text white.

127
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,190
And we add some padding up to so we have some space around it.

128
00:11:59,300 --> 00:11:59,810
And.

129
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:06,380
Let's make it at some shadow effects.

130
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:15,580
We're just a shadow medium, so it can quickly see a shadow under it and.

131
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:23,020
Let's add some hover effects as well, so when we hover over it, we want to decrease.

132
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,210
Their brightness.

133
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:35,180
So we just say hover and let's set the brightness two hundred and twenty five.

134
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,460
It means two hundred and twenty five percent.

135
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:45,660
It means 25 percent more so when we hover now, we can see it's brighter.

136
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,490
Twenty five percent, right?

137
00:12:51,690 --> 00:13:00,870
And in the disabled mode, because we want it to be disabled until the person upload the image and write

138
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,320
down the caption.

139
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,650
Otherwise, they can click on it.

140
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,000
So let's make it disabled and see how we are.

141
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,710
Uh, let's close this left part.

142
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,150
So we have more space.

143
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:20,610
OK, let's make it disabled so we can.

144
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,490
See what we are doing.

145
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:30,250
So here we just say if it's disabled.

146
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:39,590
We just said disabled is equal to the background, correct color instead of red.

147
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,090
We want it to be gray.

148
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,500
Two hundred.

149
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,710
And.

150
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:53,470
We wanted the cursor instead of a pointer

151
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,370
to be.

152
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,600
Not allowed.

153
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,160
So just a note.

154
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,210
Allowed.

155
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:18,510
You can see they're not allowed, and we don't want to have a hover effect when we are in the disabled,

156
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,780
more so in the disabled mode.

157
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,990
The hover effects.

158
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:33,960
The brightness would be instead of one hundred twenty five at the 100, which means no change.

159
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,220
All right.

160
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:38,740
And.

161
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:47,050
So let's ask some padding to the model there, the top level.

162
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,770
If you remember at a height of hundred.

163
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,440
Uh.

164
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,440
And a top.

165
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:11,120
Not this one, the the model that the top, so I added the height of three hundred pixels, let's instead

166
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,080
of this, we just and padding up six.

167
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:25,070
And this way, even the button is not connected to the ground, and it's everything looks fine.

168
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,700
So everything is fine.

169
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:37,140
No, we want it when they choose an image, we want to show it here in the screen.

170
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:41,190
Let's let's let me show you in the final version.

171
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,400
In the final version rhythmically.

172
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:53,710
When you click on the file picture, let me just choose the image.

173
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:06,390
So when we first, we just showed inside this park and then we click on this image again, we see we

174
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,450
can change the image.

175
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,090
So for example, we choose another.

176
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,130
All right, we want to achieve this one now.

177
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,590
So inside this.

178
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,230
More.

179
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,160
First, we create a state.

180
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,200
We just a cost.

181
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,260
And we call the state.

182
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:35,330
Selected file we just selected.

183
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,720
File.

184
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,730
And the next one would be set selected that file.

185
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:55,320
This is the function that's going to sit here and we use the use of state.

186
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:05,160
And the first value, the initial value would be not.

187
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,780
Let's first import use a stage.

188
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:28,370
And then in the input we created as a hadin to pick the file we added on change because when we want

189
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,290
to change, some change happens.

190
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:38,090
For example, if someone is uploading, if something is changing is happening, we want to trigger a

191
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,500
trigger, a function called at image.

192
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:50,410
To post, and we're going to create this function at the top.

193
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,390
So after this selective file, we create a function.

194
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,860
And we call it this ad image to post.

195
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:08,380
Which is going to get the event and the information inside that input.

196
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,410
And, uh, first we create a reader.

197
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,860
And the reader will be a new fall reader.

198
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:33,970
This is a built in function from the JavaScript that is going to read the files inside the input.

199
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:43,430
And we just say if there is a event so that events that we're getting at the top.

200
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:50,520
If there is an event that fails, miss any falls is uploading.

201
00:18:51,450 --> 00:19:00,420
We just if because we want to upload only one, which is we have to just specify zero here in the array.

202
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:10,720
Just say if there is a fire and choose the first one, and so it means that there is a file.

203
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,390
But we want the first one, actually.

204
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:14,890
And then.

205
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,450
And we're going to read that file, which is here.

206
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,600
So we just saw that the reader at a top.

207
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,830
We want to read it as a.

208
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:43,470
Theta, you theta URL, so you can read it as a different things.

209
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:51,100
Like a string of buffering attacks, but you wanted the you are out because we want to get that you

210
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:57,960
are well and show it on the screen so that your health coming from here.

211
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:13,250
And vendors loading part finish when we get the URL, so we can know this one using a reader on low.

212
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,750
So as soon as the load finished, we wanted.

213
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,200
That reader, if you get the reader events.

214
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,990
And this this is similar to the event we got here.

215
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:37,430
Whatever information we got here, it comes to this weather event and we get that through the event

216
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:42,770
and he said it inside this estate, this selected fire.

217
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,420
So this set?

218
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:52,940
Selected file would be equal to reader that event dot target.

219
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,830
The results,

220
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,180
so we got this.

221
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:10,590
You are here and we get this early from this event, as I said, as soon as it is, it is loaded.

222
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,010
And after that, we can get the hell.

223
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,220
Here and set it to send it, said selected file.

224
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,680
Now we have this information.

225
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:30,280
Which is a URL, uh, we can uh, probably we can console log it.

226
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,530
Let's do it here.

227
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:42,650
Now we just know we quickly want to show it on the screen, so.

228
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:53,730
So instead of showing the on only camera, we want this to be eternally ternary operator.

229
00:21:53,820 --> 00:22:00,930
So when we have this selective file, we want to show the file, the image file, otherwise we want

230
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,680
to show the.

231
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:10,900
It camera icon, so we put the camera icon inside at ternary operator, we just say if this selected

232
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,730
file exists.

233
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:15,960
Then.

234
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:25,280
We have we have that image showing otherwise.

235
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,710
We want to have this camera.

236
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,690
So you just put this camera recorded.

237
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,240
And we pasted inside this.

238
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:50,310
And here should be an image.

239
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:03,260
So we just added image tag, and the source would be the selected file.

240
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,910
Now, let's test it, see.

241
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,170
You choose the image.

242
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:20,460
Now we can see the image, so but we don't see the camera.

243
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:29,150
But if we click on this image, we want to remove this image and show the camera icon.

244
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:34,080
But before that, let's install the image as a first.

245
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,840
So we add a class name for a styling it.

246
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:52,050
We just need to sit there with to be full, and we set the max height because some, some people maybe

247
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:58,380
choose an image that is very tall, like a tree.

248
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,720
And then, uh, this is going to be very big.

249
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:10,370
So we don't we want to prevent this by just saying max height of

250
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,810
let's set it to be two hundred and.

251
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,800
50 pixels.

252
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:34,150
And let's keep the aspect ratio by choosing objects cover.

253
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,440
And also, we want the cursor to be.

254
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:49,630
We want the cursor to be pointer, so when we hover over the image, we can see a pointing hand.

255
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,500
So now let's at the UN, click here.

256
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:58,450
So when we click on it, we want to remove this image.

257
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,010
So here.

258
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:08,910
It's very simple, we just need to add and click and unplug is going to trigger.

259
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:14,140
A function which just set the.

260
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,220
Set the selected file.

261
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,540
2P, no.

262
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:32,930
So when we click, no, we can we remove it again, we choose another image this year here.

263
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:37,030
Yeah.

264
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,300
It's working fine and.

265
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:50,200
The other thing is, when we click on side, we want to close the model, but when we open it, we don't

266
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:59,170
want to see the previous image, we want it to be just the camera so we can achieve this one simply

267
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,690
by this on request.

268
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,910
Clothes actually only close to.

269
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:11,130
Kloza just said the open to be false, but let's add something else as well.

270
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,590
So we can return this one.

271
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:25,590
In a way that we can add to things, so we just say this one.

272
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,410
And also we want to set.

273
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,810
Selected file to be null as well.

274
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,540
So now, after saving, you can see a very neat, very neat and.

275
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,500
Let's try it.

276
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,810
So now we have an image here.

277
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,730
Let's close it open.

278
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,230
We don't see an image.

279
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,670
Let's try it again.

280
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,280
We try a different image.

281
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:00,040
We close and we don't see.

282
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:01,650
Image.

283
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,460
So that was it for this part for the model, part with the image.

284
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:17,390
In the next section, we're going to upload this image and also this caption to the database, which

285
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,520
is, in our cases, Firebase.

286
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:31,390
So let's stop this server and B push everything to get off as usual, and we review the code together,

287
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,050
so we have the message of.

288
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:47,270
You just say complete the.

289
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,440
Upload model.

290
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,210
Component.

291
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,100
And we push it to get her by using get push.

292
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,320
Let's check it, and we review the code together.

293
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,870
Let's refresh this page.

294
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,910
We should see 22 commits now, and the last one is this one.

295
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,640
So as you can see, we got A..

296
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,090
Camera icon from Hero Icons.

297
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:34,930
And the use used, we have and use this state here, it created an estate.

298
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:49,650
A state of select that file to record your Elda of the image we're uploading and use this function to

299
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:57,180
read the file first, and then we get the URL and then we pass it to selected file.

300
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,900
So, uh.

301
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:14,430
The next thing we did, we just added the image at the beginning of the model here.

302
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:18,460
And.

303
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:29,590
If there is no image, we see an icon which has an eye which has an unclear which select an input which

304
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:32,290
is hidden and the Typekit file.

305
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,960
And when did we upload?

306
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:45,130
We trigger a function called ad image to post that we have reviewed now and then we have input, which

307
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,800
has the caption in the next section.

308
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,640
Actually, we are going to get the reference for this input as well.

309
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:59,560
And uh, we have a button at the point at the bottom of the model part.

310
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,040
Which is now in this disabled mode.

311
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,950
And we started using Telnet.

312
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,700
So in the next section, we're going to achieve this.

313
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,660
Like uploading to the database.

314
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:28,300
