00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.180
Welcome back.

2
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.590
In this section we're going to install next JS and get our first template.

3
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.710
As you can see, I have put the final version here for our comparison.

4
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.750
The address is IMDB.com 100 JS projects dot com.

5
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.130
As you can see, we have the ability to change the dark mode.

6
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.540
We have the about page and also we have the trending and top rated with the loading effect.

7
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.190
And also we have the ability to search from the movies.

8
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:49.180
I'm going to go to on the details later inside the projects when we are building these parts, but now

9
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.250
let's just start creating the next JS projects.

10
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.720
The first template.

11
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.770
The first thing we need to do is to search for the next DJs on Google.

12
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.580
So let's go to the Google and search for next JWs.

13
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.240
In the search results.

14
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.390
Let's click on the next DJ's dot org.

15
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.920
With their title next year by Verso.

16
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.570
The React Framework.

17
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.160
This is the official website, as you can see.

18
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:34.040
This is the website with the documentation and JS 13 is the latest version, but the next JS 13 is still

19
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.950
in the beta and some of the some of the features are not working well.

20
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.020
But I'm going to show you which one is not working or which one is working.

21
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.510
And for the documentation for the next years.

22
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.550
13.

23
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.570
And you need to add a bit to at the URL.

24
00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.100
For example, here just you just say better dot next years dot org.

25
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.230
This is going to redirect to the next JS better.

26
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.070
Which is going to use the app directory.

27
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.530
So as you can see from the get started tab, the next year's documentation is divided into two sites.

28
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.450
So first is the next year's app Directory beta, which we are going to use.

29
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.400
This is try out the React server components is streaming new data fishing and more.

30
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.800
But there is another documentation.

31
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.560
Next year is 13 is stable.

32
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.500
This is going to be a stable soon as well.

33
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.440
So we're going to work on this section.

34
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.580
So if you go to the installation tab.

35
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:57.540
As you can see from the system requirements, we need Node.js version 16.8 or later and some Windows

36
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.860
or Mac machines.

37
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.610
So let's look and test this one by just opening your terminal.

38
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.860
I'm going to use common prompt.

39
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.700
Which is available inside Windows, but you can use any terminal you would like.

40
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.090
And here we can just check the version of the node by just saying no.

41
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.430
Dash V.

42
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.190
My note version.

43
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.420
The version of my note is version 18.13.

44
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.480
But anything above 16.

45
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.840
Point eight and above would be accepted.

46
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:47.330
And if you don't have this version, you just make sure to go to Node.js website, search it on Google

47
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:57.590
and go to Node.js on dot org and just install the latest stable version here.

48
00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.150
18.13.

49
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.330
Don't install this version which is not stable and maybe make some problem for you.

50
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.720
So that is enough to just need to install it.

51
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.800
And the next thing we need to do, we just go to the installation, we go to the next tab.

52
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:25.870
So automatic installations as we are using the beta version of next year 13 and we are using app directory,

53
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.180
there is a utility we can use which is MPC's.

54
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:38.890
Create an app at latest and you need to add dash dash experimental dash app at the end.

55
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.900
If you want to have app directory automatically in your website.

56
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:54.780
So in our application because we are using app directory, the previous one was using pages directory

57
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.440
instead.

58
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.200
If you are familiar with the next year's 12.

59
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:07.170
So we need to copy this one and paste it inside a terminal to install our application.

60
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:15.510
I want to create this application inside my desktop so I go inside my desktop using CD dash disk.

61
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.190
Top.

62
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.550
And I'm going to you inside a folder called Course.

63
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.520
And I'm going to paste the code and create an app at latest.

64
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.190
And this is going to ask me.

65
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.780
Do you want to install the package?

66
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.220
Create next app version 13 .1.5 and I just say yes.

67
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.080
What is the name of our projects?

68
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.700
So you can choose the name.

69
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.590
I just choose.

70
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.380
I am.

71
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.350
TB.

72
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.580
And the next question is.

73
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.590
Would you like to use, TypeScript?

74
00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.470
So I don't want to use TypeScript So you can just choose?

75
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.010
No.

76
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.450
And press enter.

77
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.980
Do you, would you like to use SW Link?

78
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.950
SW Link is just the utility in Vsco code that is going to fix your and warn you about your spelling

79
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.020
mistakes for your code.

80
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.520
So I'm going to use this one.

81
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.450
So I just press.

82
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.200
Yes.

83
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.620
And would you like to use CRC directory?

84
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:39.460
So if in this case you're going to have an extra folder called CRC and the app directory would be inside

85
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.110
this directory.

86
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.100
So I just say yes, you can just say no, it doesn't matter.

87
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:51.100
It doesn't change your projects, it just makes it more neat and clean.

88
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.410
So we just say yes.

89
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.060
And do you want to use.

90
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.150
Elias.

91
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:04.880
Elias means you want to have, for example, show the address of the package you just said.

92
00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.730
Dot, dot, dot, dot.

93
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.460
Instead of that, you can just create an alias.

94
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.920
So which is going to create all the directories with this sign.

95
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:22.290
So you just write down at 4/a star.

96
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.330
This is going to create that alias for you.

97
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:37.350
And this is going to install packages like react, react dom next next font se link and link config

98
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.460
dash next.

99
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.370
The installation process is going to take a while.

100
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.500
So I'm going to stop the video and I'll be back when the installation is completed.

101
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:50.680
All right.

102
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.580
The installation process has been completed now.

103
00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:00.850
The we can go inside the folder that we have created.

104
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:07.030
So in my case, I just create a folder called IMDB.

105
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.050
I go inside that one.

106
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:17.350
Now we can open the Visual Studio code using just code dash, dot and press enter.

107
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.060
You can use any other text editor you prefer.

108
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:28.540
I'm Visual Studio Code is my favorite text editor because it has a lot of plugins you can add and it's

109
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.590
very fast.

110
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.950
Let me explain you here the folders that the next JS 13 has.

111
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.380
So let me increase the size of this screen a little bit.

112
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:39.790
All right.

113
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:40.570
So.

114
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:52.170
As we choose the option of creating the SRK folder, we have a folder called RC and it has the app directory.

115
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.240
The next is 12.

116
00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:03.090
Didn't have this folder, they only had this pages folder which has the API and also you can add so

117
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.710
your pages here.

118
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.930
But the app directory is different.

119
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.450
App directory has the global CSS for the styling.

120
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:16.950
It has a hit the GC layout page and page.

121
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.350
That module dot CSS is.

122
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.510
We are using 12 in CSS later.

123
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:29.100
We are not going to use CSS for styling our project like the one inside the global CSS.

124
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:36.210
Dan And also we're not using the modular CSS styling.

125
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.960
So so I'm going to delete this file.

126
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:48.450
And also I'm going to go to inside the Global CSW and select everything and delete all of them.

127
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:53.850
So later we're going to change this one using 12 CSS.

128
00:09:55.430 --> 00:10:02.960
So the home page for our website would be created by this page page gsx.

129
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.840
So let me decrease the size.

130
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.950
You can see it better.

131
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:17.690
And if you open it inside, if you open the terminal here inside the Visual Studio Code, you can create

132
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:24.530
a server with this website using NPM run dev.

133
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.850
So you just write down amp and round Dave and press enter.

134
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:36.150
This is going to open your website and create a server on local host 3000.

135
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.680
As you can see here, I can just click.

136
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.660
And keep the control and click here.

137
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.770
This is going to open the website inside the.

138
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.380
Browser.

139
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:53.850
The default browser, which is in my case, is Chrome.

140
00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:01.790
So we're getting an error because I have deleted some file the page that modular CSS, but we still

141
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:08.260
referring to that font inside here inside the page that just so I'm going to delete this one.

142
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:13.850
So let's, let's delete everything here inside the main.

143
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:15.820
Tag.

144
00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:19.900
So I'm going to delete everything.

145
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.790
And instead, I'm going to have ah1 tag.

146
00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.660
Just saying home.

147
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:36.790
K Now inside the browser, we see that home here with the big which is the H one tag.

148
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:39.420
And.

149
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.090
For the layout.

150
00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:52.150
Layout is the file that is going to cover the pages and other pages as well, because it's going to

151
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:53.680
cover a children.

152
00:11:54.190 --> 00:12:01.000
And in this file you can add your header everything that is common.

153
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:07.150
For example, in our in our final version, you can see that even you go to different website.

154
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:17.560
For example, if I go to this page, we see this change, but the header, the number and the this search

155
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.790
button is common.

156
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.440
It didn't change.

157
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.450
So we're going to put these three components inside the layout.

158
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:31.330
So this is an if I create any other pages, for example, this page is the movie.

159
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.710
We still have the same layout.

160
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.320
For example, if you go to about page.

161
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:44.250
Uh, we're going to have the about page, so let's refresh the page.

162
00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.760
So we have the about page.

163
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:51.920
This section is different here, but the other section is still remain the same.

164
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:57.110
So for example, you can do the dark mode or other things.

165
00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:05.430
So we're going to this use this layout layout is actually new and it's just for the next year's 13.

166
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.920
And also it has a hit.

167
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:14.470
So everything related to the head tag can be inside this file.

168
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:22.090
For example, the title is now Create Next App and we can see it here, Create next app at the top of

169
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.650
our project.

170
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.350
So you can just change this one.

171
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.740
For example, we just say IMDB.

172
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.340
Claw.

173
00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:42.710
MTP is this this way So IMDB clone now the hit the title is changed to IMDB, so this is going to apply

174
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:48.070
to all the pages because the head tag is in everything.

175
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:49.220
All right.

176
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.760
So it's.

177
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.080
And.

178
00:13:54.570 --> 00:14:01.830
Let's change the metadata tags, for example, this metadata tag sets the width of the screen to devices,

179
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.000
the screens width.

180
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:11.040
And for example, if you have a mobile screen, the screen with the width of the browser would be as

181
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:11.810
smaller.

182
00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:18.680
Then you have the initial level zoom level, which is 100%.

183
00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:28.310
Then we have the description metadata tag and the content is generated by Create Next app.

184
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:29.450
I can change this one.

185
00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:35.930
For example, I just say this is the item to be.

186
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.300
I am rt the clone.

187
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.880
Website.

188
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.010
So now.

189
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.750
If you go to.

190
00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:56.080
And open the HTML here.

191
00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:04.140
I'm going to use an extension in Chrome called Quick Source Viewer.

192
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:12.800
So if you click on this extension, you can see the HTML of our project and inside the HTML.

193
00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.380
Let me zoom this a little bit.

194
00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:18.760
We can see that we have a metadata tag.

195
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.000
With the description and the content.

196
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.640
This is the IMDB clone.

197
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:27.290
Okay.

198
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:36.020
So and also for other pages, for example, if you create a page four about, you can have a different

199
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.970
head data.

200
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:42.290
So this is going to help you for your SEO.

201
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:51.170
So you can have a different SEO metadata tag for each each of your pages, which was not available for

202
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.810
the React applications before.

203
00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.790
So this is the new feature from the next DJs.

204
00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:06.720
The other things we want to do is to, as you can see, we are using the fab icon inside this public

205
00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.130
folder.

206
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:12.450
The public folder is the things that the user x have access in the browser.

207
00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:19.470
So your files, like the images or fab icons, goes to this folder.

208
00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.740
These three things we don't need, we can delete them.

209
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:26.870
For the Vatican.

210
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:32.270
Now we are using this fab icon, which is the logo of the Verso.

211
00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.820
We can change the fab icon.

212
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.750
I use the website.

213
00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.380
I just searched your fabric on generator.

214
00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.020
In the search result.

215
00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.080
We go to this website Fabricant dot io.

216
00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:55.510
So in this website Fabricant IO we go to generator.

217
00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.480
So I'm going to click on generator.

218
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:00.380
All right.

219
00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:05.810
So now, as you can see, the text is F and the fab icon is showing F.

220
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:10.950
For example, our website is IMDB, so we can just use the little AI.

221
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.530
That's a small AI.

222
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:14.690
You can change the color.

223
00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:17.690
For example, I want to choose this color.

224
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.510
Or background for the.

225
00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:23.650
Inside.

226
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:26.020
I want to use the color white.

227
00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:32.080
And you can choose it to be rounded circle or anything like that.

228
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:36.400
So I'm going to choose circle and I'm going to download this.

229
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.430
This is going to give you a zip file.

230
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.160
It has.

231
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:48.010
It has a bunch of files, but the files you need is just this file there.

232
00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.710
Fabric contact iso.

233
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:53.440
So I'm going to.

234
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.370
Drag this one.

235
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.520
Bring it to my.

236
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:05.670
Desktop and I'm going to drag it again and bring it to this public folder and put it here.

237
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.610
I'm going to replace it with the previous one.

238
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:11.510
Because it has the same name.

239
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:18.590
So now if we open it again, we should see a different one.

240
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.510
So let's open it and see it.

241
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:26.820
So as you can see, the icon is now different.

242
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:36.900
So now if you go back to our website here and if you refresh the page, we should see a different fabric

243
00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.130
at the top.

244
00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.730
So let's close this fabric on generator.

245
00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.710
And this one.

246
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.000
So you can see now the Fabricant is different.

247
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:56.370
So just we have cleaned our project.

248
00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.760
The other things we don't need is this page is folder.

249
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.170
We can just completely delete it because we are using the app directory.

250
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:13.320
I'm just going to delete the pages here and inside the layout dot is x.

251
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:19.440
We can delete this head as well because we are going to use this head to gsx.

252
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:23.550
So I'm going to delete all these explanations.

253
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:33.600
So now that we have completed our template and we have installed the next yes, let's add this font

254
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.590
to the GitHub.

255
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:42.810
So later when we are deploying the website to Versal, we can use GitHub to simply add it.

256
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.310
So let's stop the server here.

257
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.540
It stopped the server using counter C.

258
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:58.250
And we pressed why, if you already have the GitHub you can use git.

259
00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:03.670
In it to initialize a git repository.

260
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:08.170
And then you can just add everything to it.

261
00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.950
Using it at all.

262
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:20.280
And you can create a message by using git commit dash.

263
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:20.790
Hm.

264
00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.530
And the message would be, for example, install.

265
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:27.600
Next, James.

266
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:37.230
So if we press enter now, it's ready to add everything to our GitHub repository.

267
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:43.950
So we need to go to GitHub.com and create the a new GitHub repository.

268
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.780
So I just go to GitHub.

269
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:53.850
So I search for GitHub and in the search result, I'm going to go to the GitHub.com.

270
00:20:55.230 --> 00:21:02.310
This one is completely free as well and I highly recommend you have a GitHub account because you can

271
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:04.980
just track what you do inside your projects.

272
00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:10.950
And also you can easily deploy your projects to places like Versal.

273
00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:17.310
So if you have an account, you should see your user profile picture here.

274
00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:22.590
So for me, it's just I'm signing with my account.

275
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:29.730
Now you can click on the plus icon here to create a new repository once you click on that.

276
00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.280
You can just create a new repository.

277
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.490
You can put the repository name.

278
00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:44.700
For example, I just choose IMDB, which is available for me.

279
00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:50.410
And the description is going to be.

280
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.390
I am deeply.

281
00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:56.780
Clone.

282
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.130
Using next.

283
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:07.870
Yes.

284
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:08.380
And.

285
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:10.750
Tailwind.

286
00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:12.370
Yes.

287
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:13.900
Let me fix this one.

288
00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:14.820
I am.

289
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:18.670
DB you can create this one.

290
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.390
You can make it private or you can keep it public if you want.

291
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:24.940
Other people see your projects.

292
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:32.260
As I'm sharing this one with you, you can just come to this GitHub repository and compare your code

293
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:33.250
with mine.

294
00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:40.030
So I just keep it public and just click here on Create Repository.

295
00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:48.550
So now this is going to give you the commands you needed to upload your GitHub GitHub.

296
00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:52.030
We already done the first three parts.

297
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.580
Initialization, adding and the commit.

298
00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:04.420
Now we need to get use the get removed add and this address to show the address to the here.

299
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:07.120
So I'm going to paste this code here.

300
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.980
And then we need to create a branch.

301
00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:14.080
So we paste it.

302
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.150
Second one.

303
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.240
And finally, the last one is pushing everything to get up.

304
00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:22.330
So we're going to use the git push.

305
00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.680
Dash you origin.

306
00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.600
So now everything is uploaded to the GitHub.

307
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.830
So if you refresh this page now you should see all.

308
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:40.390
Your code inside this page, for example, the public C folder and etc..

309
00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.850
Now you have two comments.

310
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:51.440
The first one is automatically created using next year's app, but the first one.

311
00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.290
Is installed next year is created by us.

312
00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.500
Now let me review what we have done.

313
00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:01.830
We have deleted a couple of files.

314
00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.670
We have empty the globals that CSS.

315
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:10.310
And inside the hideous ex.

316
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:20.000
We have changed the title and also the description inside the layout that G6 and also I have deleted

317
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.760
some head tag because we don't need it inside the next 13.

318
00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:34.070
Inside the page that gsx I have deleted everything and just replace it with the h one tag saying home.

319
00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:40.880
And also we have deleted the file page that modular CSS and these folder pages.

320
00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:46.240
Yeah, that was it for installation of the next DJs.

321
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:49.140
For each section.

322
00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:54.020
I'm going to explain the code first, and then I'm going to review the code using GitHub.

323
00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:57.780
So we're going to review each code two times.

324
00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:01.470
So this is the way I teach coding.

325
00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:11.430
So in the next section we're going to install Tailwind CSS and add its dependency to work with the Nexus

326
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:12.300
13.

327
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:17.940
So see in the next section for the installation of Tailwind CSS.
