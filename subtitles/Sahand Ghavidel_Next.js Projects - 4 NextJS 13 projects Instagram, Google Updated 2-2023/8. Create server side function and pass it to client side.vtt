WEBVTT
1
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.890
All right, in the last section, we have finished the now four section.

2
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:22.580
We added to the request we got the information from the requests that James from here in the Utils folder

3
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.910
and be looked through it here and we used use rather.

4
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:40.520
To push the link when we click on the trending or top rated and we get the Chandra fetch top rated and

5
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.110
fish trendy.

6
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:57.070
In this section, we're going to start getting the information from the API themed API and show it inside

7
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.800
inside the results section.

8
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:09.170
In order to catch the data from the API, we're going to use something called server side rendering,

9
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:19.970
which is exclusive to next year, and it means that when the user comes to our website first, the.

10
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:29.040
Next year, server side rendering, it starts working and get all the information and send it to the

11
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.000
client side.

12
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:40.210
Before the persons can see their website, and it does that one in a very fast matter, so I show you

13
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:48.870
in the practice now in order to create that server side rendering function, we should go to the index

14
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.210
that.

15
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:59.120
Two years inside the pages, so at the bottom, now this is the client side, you should remember that

16
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:06.680
this is a client side and we're going to now go to the server side and create a function.

17
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.910
And this function is not going to be visible for the user just inside the server.

18
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:21.290
And after doing something or, for example, getting the API information, it sends the information

19
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.980
to the client side, which is here to props.

20
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.490
I show you in a moment how it's work.

21
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.330
We just need to create the function, but just say export.

22
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.030
It's async functions and its name is get.

23
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.000
Server side.

24
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.000
Props.

25
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:59.880
And this function is going to get something called context, which is the information, some information,

26
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.580
and one of the information is getting this genre of fish trending or top rated.

27
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.510
So we're going to get the we're going to know which.

28
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.390
You are ill.

29
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.990
Is.

30
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:23.810
In their pages in and we get this key by this key, we're going to get the information from the TMD

31
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.110
database correctly.

32
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.090
All right, so.

33
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.990
So we open a set of curly braces, and first things we need to get is justice genre.

34
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.120
Don't pay attention to the error because we're not.

35
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.360
We haven't finished the function yet because we are not returning anything.

36
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.210
We're getting this.

37
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.530
Error.

38
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.330
So first, you get Chandra with just seconds.

39
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.790
Chandra.

40
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.850
And the genre will be contacts that curry.

41
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.050
That genre.

42
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.300
So if the country was any quarry we can get from the URL using this

43
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:20.570
method.

44
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:30.650
But the bickering we are interested in is this John OKB, who is this scurry inside a constant now?

45
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:43.300
A creative function is just say, uh, we just create a constant call to request.

46
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.020
We're going to get the information from the API.

47
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.680
So this is going to wait.

48
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.240
And fetch some data.

49
00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.160
All right.

50
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.050
The data we are going to get is from this year out.

51
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.680
We just used back to because we need to add the valuable genre inside the.

52
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.870
You are el uh.

53
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.450
I just grab this.

54
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:24.520
Quickly, so this is just the basis for our exit UBS.

55
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:35.500
Double column, the two former Strasz API dot the movie TV that already slashed three and the rest is

56
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.610
the U r l.

57
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.530
We have inside the.

58
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.360
Inside this request suggests the URL is this one.

59
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.790
And.

60
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.080
So we're going to get this one by how we know that which we are all we.

61
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.090
We are getting the.

62
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.320
Information from the.

63
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:14.790
This your uh, this query, fish trading fish first, we detect which genre we're having, and depending

64
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:21.070
on this chance of you getting the information from the this, you are out.

65
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.670
So we know that which we are all we are getting.

66
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.070
So you go to, we go back.

67
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.690
Let's close some of these.

68
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.680
Things that we don't need.

69
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:34.710
Yeah.

70
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:37.160
All right.

71
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:43.430
Inside index that yes, here we create a variable.

72
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.160
And the variable is going to be.

73
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:52.880
Request.

74
00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:01.150
And which request we want first, we need to import requests, so we use country space.

75
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:09.510
To get the auto suggestion, and they require every import request from utilities to request.

76
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:19.140
And as I mentioned, we need to determine which tier you want and the key is comes from this genre.

77
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:25.660
So the quest and genre and the things we want to get is your.

78
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.170
So we just add dots you ought to know.

79
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.590
All right.

80
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.950
And after that, we just need to.

81
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.350
Convert this information to adjacent file.

82
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.770
So here we are at Dustin.

83
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:46.250
And.

84
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:54.740
As you're getting the other suggestion, we're getting a response from this request, and we're going

85
00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:04.190
to convert the response to adjacent file, so we get the response and the converted to adjacent file.

86
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.180
So now this request is that Jason data.

87
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.930
So now we can.

88
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.760
We can export this information from the server side to the client side.

89
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.640
Just one thing we need to remember is we are getting this genre.

90
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:26.510
All right.

91
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:35.620
But if someone comes from a different URL, for example, the route we are here, so there is no genre

92
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:41.810
and we are reading, we are going to get some error because there's no genre.

93
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.370
And by default, I want to show the trending.

94
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:53.720
Uh, data, so we just see if this one exists.

95
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.280
It's fine, if not.

96
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:59.600
Or we get this fish trending on.

97
00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:03.000
All right.

98
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:12.700
So now we need to return the props at the bottom, so we just say return.

99
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:22.580
We opened a set of curly braces, and the things we wanted to represent is props.

100
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:34.010
And this props includes the results and the results is equal to this request.

101
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.980
That results.

102
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:39.690
All right.

103
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:46.910
So now still, the information is in the server side, in order to get this profits, we can get it

104
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.690
inside the client side here as a props.

105
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:52.840
All right.

106
00:09:53.050 --> 00:10:02.770
So we are getting the props, but let's destructor it before and just get the results and we just console.log

107
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.480
it in client side.

108
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:07.830
All right.

109
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:15.180
And be let's open the console using if 12.

110
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:17.860
And here.

111
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.230
Let's go to some of these things like trending.

112
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.860
Let's when we click on Trending now, we're getting an array.

113
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:38.390
Of 20 results, 20 IMDb movies like the first one is, uh.

114
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.170
Yeah, different movies.

115
00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.400
So when we opened it, the first one is.

116
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:54.220
The yeah, the yeah, the title is the Spider man, the second one is Matrix.

117
00:10:54.860 --> 00:11:00.230
So but if we click on the top rated, we should get the different information.

118
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:11.120
So now we are getting a new array and this is the first movie is an Indian movie, and the second one

119
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.090
is just Shawshank Redemption.

120
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:15.690
All right.

121
00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.670
So now we're getting the results correctly.

122
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.520
Let's show them on the browser.

123
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.280
So we are getting to we are getting the results now.

124
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:31.710
Let's pass this as a props inside the results component.

125
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:38.910
And let's get this one inside the results that Jesus, which is here.

126
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:41.440
All right.

127
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.490
We get the props here with destructor it.

128
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.200
And we just say results.

129
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:58.410
And here we can look through the all the results because we have 20, so we can look through it using

130
00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.180
map function.

131
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.020
So we get each results.

132
00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.590
And you return.

133
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.990
For example, we return just, uh, each one first.

134
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.730
Same result.

135
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:31.010
For example, to it and make sure to put this one inside the curly princess because this is a JavaScript.

136
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:32.770
All right.

137
00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:41.030
We are getting some errors saying they cannot read properties of undefined.

138
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.400
So we are not getting to.

139
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.030
This is some stakes here results.

140
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.000
And this phone to.

141
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.960
Results and should work now.

142
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.270
Yeah, now we're getting all the titles.

143
00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:00.560
And also.

144
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.760
If you click on the trending, we get the spider.

145
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.410
And if you go to the.

146
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:09.950
Your L.

147
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:13.640
Just localhost three thousand.

148
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.560
We get the trending again because we determined here.

149
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:27.080
Inside the index, such as if there is no a specific genre, just could fetch the trendy.

150
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:27.840
All right.

151
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.520
So in the next section, we're going to.

152
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:45.410
Create another component called car Kartagis, and you're going to get information like images, title

153
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.180
some overview.

154
00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:55.430
And finally, we're going to show them as a car inside this results section.

155
00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:01.340
So before doing that, let's do the get half section, get hop one.

156
00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.370
So let's clear this.

157
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:07.280
And first, we add everything.

158
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.010
Create a climate.

159
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.610
With a message saying.

160
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.990
Create server.

161
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.260
Site.

162
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.290
Function.

163
00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:28.670
And.

164
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:35.130
Pass it to client.

165
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.460
Clients side.

166
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:48.030
And they push it to the get hot, get beat using get push.

167
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.480
OK.

168
00:14:54.500 --> 00:15:00.410
Let's go to guitar and refresh the page by clicking on this.

169
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.210
So now we have seven seven permits.

170
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:14.030
And the last comments, which is 20 seconds ago, we created the services function and pass it to the

171
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.020
client side.

172
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:25.160
As you can see, we created, we changed the results that is from this to this, we map to the all the

173
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:35.750
