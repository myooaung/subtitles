1
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.130
All right.

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.390
In the last section, we have completed this suggestion area and we got the information.

3
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:24.660
The fake information from minifigure package in this section, we are going to start doing the authentication

4
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.550
part of our project.

5
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.830
If you look at the final version of the project here, you can see that my image is here.

6
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.440
The user name is coded to hand and there is another image here for the menu mini profile.

7
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.380
These are all getting from the Google.

8
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.270
And also, we have the image here as well with the user name.

9
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.650
If you sign out by clicking here or here.

10
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:09.620
We can see that we don't we will no longer we see the image here and we don't see the mini profile section

11
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.070
as well.

12
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:19.510
As soon as we sign in the week, we redirect it to a page called the.

13
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.460
Sign in.

14
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:33.440
The this is the URL of the off and finance, and we have a call back the website and then we have the

15
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.850
logo and the image here with the sign in with Google.

16
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.120
When we click on the sign in with Google, it redirect to a constant Google dot com.

17
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:55.100
And Google is going to suggest the the the email accounts or their Gmail accounts that we have already

18
00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.020
sign in, or we can sign in with a new another account.

19
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.420
So I already been there.

20
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.730
You saw that I was with, according to her.

21
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.720
This time we try this email address.

22
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:18.970
And when you sign in, we can see that the mini profile has been changed to Sarhan, the for the username.

23
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.320
The image is now has the background white and here as well.

24
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.870
And also we can now put the comment or like here.

25
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.140
We're going to achieve this with the package called Nick's off, so.

26
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.710
We can search for next off year.

27
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.130
Oh, let's do it inside Chrome.

28
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.170
So inside the chrome and this is our sides here in the Google search for a off.

29
00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:00.690
This is a package designed for next year and it's very powerful and it has everything you need.

30
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.980
And.

31
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:14.360
Inside here, we can have a live demo so we can check the live demo that they have a website that asks

32
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:21.830
you to sign in and also you can do with your Google account and everything, and some parts are protected.

33
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:33.530
So let's go to the documentation by just saying get started as you can see, and we need to do some

34
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.900
create some files inside Pages API.

35
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:50.050
We create a full folder called off and inside it, we make a file JavaScript file with this name with

36
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.750
a bracket.

37
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.860
Three dots and Nick's off and inside it.

38
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.520
We need to copy this code.

39
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.050
Which imports Nick's off and get her it.

40
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.750
We're not going to use guitar.

41
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.510
Instead, we're going to use Google provider.

42
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.680
So first, we need to install it.

43
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:23.460
So here in the upgrade guide, if you go here are the left upgrade guy, we can install Nix off by just

44
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.860
copying this line of code.

45
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:37.140
So we go back to our visual studio code is stop the server by using controversy and paste the link here.

46
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:50.450
And at the same time, we need for the Google part, we need to have the fire as Firebase as well.

47
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.210
So we here a Firebase.

48
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.090
And we go to Firebase that Google Dotcom.

49
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:11.110
Make sure that your sign in here, I'm not sign in, uh, let me do it, which.

50
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:13.410
OK.

51
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.010
Uh, yeah, let's sign.

52
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:17.500
I choose my.

53
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.100
Emailed to sign in.

54
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.850
So let me do it very fast.

55
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.190
Yeah, if you already sign into Google, it's going to show you some things.

56
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.470
Let me verify my.

57
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.790
Email as well.

58
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.550
Yeah, it's yeah.

59
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.870
OK.

60
00:05:51.220 --> 00:06:00.250
So as soon as the sun in we can go to, you can see your image here and we can go to console here.

61
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:01.870
Go to console.

62
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.950
And here you can see that I have already created three.

63
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.340
Uh, three projects with the Instagram for my practice.

64
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:24.600
We just need to click click on Add Project to start a new project, and we named the project is to install

65
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.740
Insta version for myself, or you can call it anything you like.

66
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:38.770
So and here we just ask you that do you want to enable Google Analytics for this project?

67
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.250
Uh, this is just the for learning purposes.

68
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.960
We're not going to, uh, we don't need the Google Analytics.

69
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.600
So we disable this and we go to we click on the create the project.

70
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.210
In the meantime, we can see that if you already installed

71
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:02.710
nix off.

72
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:14.190
And as I mentioned before we go, we shoot inside the pages and API, we create another folder called

73
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:14.730
off.

74
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:22.110
And inside this folder, we need to create a file called Dot Dot Dot.

75
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.290
Next off.

76
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:38.170
That yes, and this one should be inside a bracket and inside this file, we need to copy that code

77
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.010
here.

78
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:48.140
That inside the introduction, an inside the getting started, they suggested a code it copy this one.

79
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.260
And we go back to next that year here and we paste it.

80
00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:01.420
As I mentioned before, we need to change this getup to Google.

81
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:08.640
So, yeah, instead of GetUp, we just change that getup to Google.

82
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.240
We will provider from next off provider and here as well.

83
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.530
We make it Google.

84
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.190
And.

85
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:28.990
Here, uh, this one should be a Google provider as well.

86
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:36.020
You can add to GitHub later for yourself, too.

87
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.250
But in this video, we just focus on Google.

88
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.810
So we just hear, say, Google.

89
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:51.760
Client.

90
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.960
Good clarity and Google Client's secret.

91
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:09.950
All right.

92
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.870
So we need to create these environmental variables as well.

93
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:21.720
So but first, we need to create the application inside the Firebase.

94
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.460
It's already happening.

95
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:32.160
So we go to Firebase and see the installation already done and the new project is ready.

96
00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.320
So we click on Continue.

97
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:38.320
And.

98
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.250
Here we click on this Web.

99
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:44.920
But the.

100
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:51.140
And register and you are called in to.

101
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.430
Version four and we click on Register app.

102
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:11.350
Now you see that there are things you need to install Firebase, so we just need to copy this line of

103
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:20.450
code and we go to our visual studio code and we paste the code here.

104
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:28.510
Now also, they said, we need to create a file called Firebase that yes.

105
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.920
And to and we copy this line of code inside there.

106
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.860
So we copy this code.

107
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.250
And we go to Visual Studio.

108
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:52.320
Code and here and in the package that Jason level, we create a file.

109
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.450
And they call it, uh, Firebase.

110
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:01.730
Jesus.

111
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.380
So we paste the code here that the only copy.

112
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:16.550
We need to make environmental variable for these things as well.

113
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.840
So, uh, let's uh.

114
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.290
See, the installation has been.

115
00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:26.960
Finished here.

116
00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:27.850
That's fine.

117
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.310
So let's create them here.

118
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.450
Inside the now, let's get the Google API as well.

119
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:38.160
First.

120
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.390
So we go back to console.

121
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:46.550
So it's already.

122
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:57.730
Oh, we already copy this, and we keep continue to counsel and forgetting the Google API that that

123
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:07.600
Google Client ID, we just need to search cloud Google and we go to cloud that Google, that J dot com.

124
00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:17.460
Make sure that you are this sign in with your with the same Google account and you go to console your.

125
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:31.000
And inside this console, you need to go click on this navigation menu.

126
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:37.510
And for the API and services, you go to credentials.

127
00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.840
We click on credentials.

128
00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:48.230
Oh, make sure you choose the application.

129
00:12:49.640 --> 00:13:00.230
So we have now, uh, we don't have the installation for, but if you go to all, you can find it here,

130
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:06.320
you just choose the the the application that you have already created inside Firebase.

131
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:07.580
You can see it here.

132
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:18.620
So we click on version Insta version for now, inside the credentials, go to off or off.

133
00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:20.880
Version two client IDs.

134
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:27.020
And here you click on this pin icon to edit it.

135
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.720
And here you can find your.

136
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.300
Uh.

137
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:50.110
Your client ID and client's secret, so we copy this.

138
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:59.850
Client ID and we go to fire up its visual studio code and inside the environmental.

139
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:12.020
Variable that we haven't created yet, so here in this level, we create a file card that EMV that local.

140
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.920
And here.

141
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.220
B, make it Google.

142
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:33.450
Client ID and just equal it to this one that we have copied after that, we make the Google.

143
00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.590
Client secret.

144
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.400
This one and we cover this.

145
00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:54.210
And we pasted you.

146
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:04.970
So other things, so let's make the other things as well, so in fact base that, yes, we have API

147
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:10.520
key off domain, Project ID, storage bucket and everything.

148
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:10.880
So.

149
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.190
So we need to make the environmental variable for all of them.

150
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:23.510
So instead of this, here we create, we just process that and be.

151
00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:32.300
Now, see that already top line is suggesting me based on the quotes online.

152
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.210
So just say this one.

153
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:41.200
And the copy of this as well, we copy this code.

154
00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.880
We go to Ames, that's local.

155
00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.870
And replaced it here and the equally to.

156
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:51.540
This discourage.

157
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:59.160
Just remember that you don't need to add the double cords in environmental variables.

158
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.650
We just need to paste the.

159
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.790
Key, the next one would be.

160
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:07.540
Off domain.

161
00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:13.690
So we have to process that, and we took a look at this suggestion.

162
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.050
So we passed this one.

163
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:25.000
They copy this, paste it here, and we equal it to.

164
00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.860
I highly recommend Tap Nine.

165
00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.690
It's amazing.

166
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:36.210
So we caught this with the coach.

167
00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:39.090
And we passed it here.

168
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:47.800
Next, next one is Project I.D. So just a process.

169
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.630
And we copy this picture here.

170
00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.550
And we call it the.

171
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:59.400
Despite.

172
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:10.400
Mutilate the overcoat.

173
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:17.090
I think three more left, so we just the process.

174
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.040
A storage bucket.

175
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.520
So you copy this as well, we put it here.

176
00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:49.080
This is the messaging messaging sender I.D..

177
00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.000
That's us first.

178
00:17:58.790 --> 00:17:59.780
You have such.

179
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.880
Senator.

180
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.250
Idea.

181
00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:10.410
Copy this.

182
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:19.530
He said, yeah, it's sorry this fiction is very boring, but we have to do it otherwise people can

183
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:24.180
see our client's secret and everything on the web.

184
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:26.220
So.

185
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:40.620
If you don't do it, people can check your API key or other things easily and on their client browser.

186
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.610
So we copy this.

187
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:50.550
And pasted here, and this was the last one.

188
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.110
That's a long one.

189
00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:04.780
We cut this leads to cut and paste it just after that.

190
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:06.160
All right.

191
00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:14.710
Now we have the Google client idea, Google Client secret, all the Firebase keys here.

192
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:17.310
And.

193
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:28.060
The things the only things we need to do is just add some line of quotes here that protects us from

194
00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.270
creating too many applications.

195
00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:36.520
First, we need to import some things from the Firebase app.

196
00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:43.540
I read the initiative we brought Initialize app from Firebase app.

197
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:47.200
We need two more things to hear.

198
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.180
One is Get app.

199
00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.280
Give up.

200
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.630
And the other one is get apps.

201
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.190
Get up and get ups.

202
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.440
And also, we need to import.

203
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:11.690
The kids.

204
00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.110
Get Firebase.

205
00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.620
So get tour.

206
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.230
GIF fires tore.

207
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:35.280
From a fireplace slash fire store.

208
00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.280
Firebase is store.

209
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.580
The next one is

210
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.690
this is just the initialization part.

211
00:20:53.830 --> 00:21:00.470
It's a little bit boring, but the from the next part be going to the interesting parts.

212
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.460
So bear with me with this part, so we just stick.

213
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:09.970
And also, we need to get this storage, get storage from Firebase storage.

214
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.930
I'll tell you in a second why we imported these things.

215
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:22.850
As you can see in the initial code that we've got on Firebase, we just got the weed.

216
00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.700
We just initialized the app.

217
00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:34.360
But we didn't check that the if the there is an app inside Firebase, if there is a app, we initialize

218
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:34.570
it.

219
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.210
Actually, we're going to make another app.

220
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.490
So we don't want to do this on.

221
00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:43.750
We just want to make sure that we only create.

222
00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:45.450
One app.

223
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:50.160
And if the app is existed, we don't initialize it.

224
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.460
Now here, we just say if.

225
00:21:56.550 --> 00:22:05.730
There is apps, so we've just called that function that we are the imported gift apps.

226
00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:11.800
If this one checks, if there is apps.

227
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.850
So we just say if the the length of the air.

228
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:26.110
Lance, off the air, there is a length or means if more than zero.

229
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:27.840
Then.

230
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:39.440
And because we put the North Mint means this is if it's the length of the APS is zero, then initialize

231
00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.480
it otherwise.

232
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:49.950
Just to get the app that already created before, so we just say, get up here.

233
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:59.200
So that's a very simple ternary operator and we just see if the there's no app initialize it, if there

234
00:22:59.200 --> 00:22:59.740
is an app.

235
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:00.880
Just get there.

236
00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:06.790
After this, we need to initialize the database with just seconds.

237
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.930
The database it calls to get.

238
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:21.520
Fire, a store that's been already imported at a time after that, we need to initialize the storage

239
00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:26.620
just to storage is equal to gifts storage.

240
00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:28.810
Function.

241
00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.630
And at the end, we need to export.

242
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:34.720
All of them.

243
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:40.270
That's the are the initial us, so we just say export app.

244
00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.860
Database and storage.

245
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:47.780
That's it.

246
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:50.360
Yeah.

247
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:58.040
So the initial we got these, uh, builtin functions for Firebase and.

248
00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:08.870
We based on the the keys, we have the initialize the app, and we say if there is no app be initialized

249
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:16.060
there and if there is an app, we just get the app and from that app we get the database and the storage

250
00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.500
and the export this file.

251
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:25.590
No, in any place in the app that we need to fight this, we just import this fire.

252
00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:35.820
All right, that was it for this, but for this video in the next section, we're going to create the

253
00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:38.100
sign in page.

254
00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:45.360
So first, let's add everything to the guitar and be review of a code.

255
00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.070
So we just get command

256
00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:50.700
with the message of.

257
00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:57.210
And so next.

258
00:24:58.890 --> 00:24:59.520
Off.

259
00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.630
And Firebase.

260
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.640
And initialize.

261
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:18.830
To find this.

262
00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:34.160
And we get pushed to the database, to the repository, so we go now to.

263
00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:40.000
Our repository will refresh the page, we should see a new commit.

264
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:51.020
And we click on this one and we see that we create a firebase, that, yes, we initialize the application

265
00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.520
using this code.

266
00:25:54.030 --> 00:26:04.650
And we put everything from here to the environmental variable, so nobody can have access to this information

267
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:08.160
on our internet browser when we.

268
00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:13.430
Finalize the project and also we have a.

269
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:23.810
Instead, the next off and we created the Google Client I.D. and client client secret and added them

270
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:25.790
to environmental variables.

271
00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:34.860
So make sure to check this page as your reference if you have missed because I did a little bit fast,

272
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:44.880
but in the next section, we're going to start with the signing page and we created and add the functionality

273
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.470
to our project.

274
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.510
So see you in the next section.
