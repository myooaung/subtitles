1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:15,310
All right, in the last section, we have finished templating our project and we created all the components

2
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,510
necessary for a work like that header.

3
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:26,530
Now for and the results section in this section, we're going to start creating this header section.

4
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,470
If you check here.

5
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,480
We have.

6
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:46,470
To actually separate there with this size and this size one has to.

7
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:56,180
There I am, the local and the other side is the Nafaa, and each of them has separate component.

8
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,200
Like this one and this one and this one?

9
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:11,340
And finally, the fourth section, and we're going to bring these kind of, uh, logos from the, you

10
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,880
know, icons.

11
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,230
All right.

12
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,460
So.

13
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,620
Let's go back to our code section.

14
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:28,450
And let's decrease the size a little bit and clear the terminal.

15
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,230
And we go inside.

16
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,230
We just run the server thing and pan around.

17
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:38,170
If.

18
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,210
Now we just press enter.

19
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,590
And we opened our.

20
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,170
Browser here.

21
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,330
All right.

22
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,260
So.

23
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:08,420
So the things we are going to do now is just change this header section here.

24
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,400
This header at the top.

25
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,360
So we go to the head of the which is here.

26
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,060
And.

27
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:25,860
As I mentioned inside the final version, we have two separate parts.

28
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,470
And so we just need to add a diff here for the top level.

29
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:44,470
And also, we add the image here, we're going to use the image tag, which is specified for the next

30
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,020
year.

31
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,370
And we're just right here.

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,630
Image this is different from the I am tube attack.

33
00:02:52,440 --> 00:03:00,580
It's optimized and it's completely created for the next two years applications.

34
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,390
That's why we're getting the error.

35
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:12,670
Firstly, we didn't import the image, so we just need to click on the end of the image and we just

36
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:22,960
press counter space and be imported from this auto suggestion, which is saying next slash image, we

37
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,040
see it on the top.

38
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,650
Now we get a different error.

39
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:35,890
Actually, the error is because we need this image tag has three mandatory attributes.

40
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,750
First is SRT, and then we have to add the width and height.

41
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:52,480
All right, so here we just ride SC and SLC will be the image we just go to Google and search for Ion.

42
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,410
And we got two images section.

43
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:08,010
I just want to get the first image, which is from the Wikipedia dot org web site, so we click here

44
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,560
and on the selected image, be right click.

45
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,020
And we click on copy image address.

46
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:33,880
And here in the starting at s to the double coat and inside the double coated paste, the link.

47
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:35,800
All right.

48
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,680
We close this school.

49
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:47,530
We don't need it, and we get another error saying that this your ill upload that Wikimedia.

50
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,880
Dorjee.

51
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,970
So it was risky.

52
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,400
Yeah.

53
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:02,990
So this one is not configured on their images in your next, that conflict that you use.

54
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,910
So in that conflict that yes, which is here on the left side?

55
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:20,150
Next, that conflict that yes, we need to add this up to that Wikimedia that authority you're.

56
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,560
So we copy this.

57
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,510
And here we add something like images.

58
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:36,110
And the openness to the curly braces and here at Domain's and inside.

59
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:46,290
And it's like an air raid as a raid, we just attack double code and inside the double copy paste the

60
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:46,770
link.

61
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:57,300
As we change it, config file, we need to restart the server, as we can see here, said restart the

62
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,600
server to see the changes in effect, so we stopped the server using Contra C.

63
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,860
And once again, we do the NPR on death.

64
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:17,430
As soon as we press enter, we can see the changes inside the browser.

65
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,610
Now we should get a different error.

66
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:33,350
Saying that we don't specify the width and height in the image.

67
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,520
So we close this next, that conflict that J.S. and it go to.

68
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:48,730
The index suggests, and inside there, this image tag it added with.

69
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,670
We just said it to be 100.

70
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,890
And height.

71
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,360
To be handled as well.

72
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,460
We should get the image now you can see here I am deep.

73
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:19,980
The next thing is just at the menu section, which is on the left side, so it should be upper.

74
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,450
And inside this stuff.

75
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:28,200
But as I mentioned, we need to create components for each of them.

76
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,680
So.

77
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,760
We just the.

78
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,760
Create a component inside a components folder and we call it header icon.

79
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,900
Duchess.

80
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,030
We had the template using underlying RF C and.

81
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,610
We just inside the Heather J is.

82
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,300
We add that an icon, so we just say header.

83
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,230
Icon and being auto imported.

84
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,270
We can see at the top.

85
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,600
And we're going to pass some.

86
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,070
Props here.

87
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:41,490
The first problem is just, say, Icon, and you're going to use hero icons to fill this part and also

88
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,650
we're going to pass title.

89
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,960
The title for the first one was home.

90
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,510
Which we can see inside the final version here.

91
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:58,340
So we're going to get this icon from the Hero Icons website.

92
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:06,420
So here inside the browser, we open a new tab and search for new icons.

93
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,820
And in the search results, we have, you know, outcomes that come.

94
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,910
As you can see, we have two types of icons the art line and the solid.

95
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:32,510
All right, so the solid one is filled with the color and the outline is just an empty icon, so we

96
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:45,770
go to documentation for the to, uh, to see how we can install the hero ikonso in the as we are using

97
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,400
react.

98
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,220
So next year is a framework that react.

99
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,810
So we just need to do an python install hero icons.

100
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,410
Forward slash reacts, so we copy this and.

101
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:08,360
Inside the terminal, we we can just open a new terminal, we don't close this one, so by clicking

102
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:14,990
on this icon, we make a new terminal and just be pasted here.

103
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:31,520
And for importing this icon, we just need to add import the icon name from that hero icons slash react

104
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,790
slash solid if you want to, to be solid, which is solid.

105
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,050
And if you want this outline, be read just right outside.

106
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:47,400
So we copy this and we go to hero icons such yes and the.

107
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,380
Uh.

108
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,410
Now we just in the heritage's we pasted at the top.

109
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:04,830
We don't want the baker care, I can't we just want to home our car, so we just sit home and, uh,

110
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,270
we can.

111
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:12,760
Just here, we get a home here.

112
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,320
All right.

113
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:19,390
So we're passing this to the heather icon, so we go to Heather.

114
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,470
I conduct yes, and we get that as a prop.

115
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,710
So we just get the props like this, but we're going to distract it.

116
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,340
First.

117
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,920
And we get the icon and also the title.

118
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,050
All right.

119
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,150
So here inside a return.

120
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,460
So probably everything will be fine.

121
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,490
Because we have already installed, so we close this terminal.

122
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,510
Fish, it's.

123
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:19,840
It says that the module not found, but we have already installed it, but probably we need to restart

124
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,360
the server to see the effect.

125
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,440
So we just say imperative again.

126
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,180
Let's see that we get the error or not.

127
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:49,650
All right.

128
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,380
We're not getting the error, and that's fine.

129
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,330
So inside the header icon, so we get the icon.

130
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:06,930
And also, as you can see, it's an icon is huge now, but that's fine if you're going to style it using

131
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,460
Kolben CIUSSS.

132
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:15,810
And for the title, we just right on title, you're getting it from here.

133
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,480
All right.

134
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:27,720
You get the title and the icon and you're going to start styling it using Telvin See assists, and let's

135
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,920
add more.

136
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,090
Uh, let's first decrease the size of this.

137
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:46,910
So for children, she says we just need to add some classes that it's already have some meaning and

138
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,210
tell us to assess how easily we can get it from the material.

139
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:58,880
So for example, for the heights, we just need to right edge and for the value we just cite, for example,

140
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,160
height five.

141
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,240
Let's reset the.

142
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:15,020
And it looks it looks a little bit small, we just changed it to eight and four meaning and we see what

143
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,520
does it mean to be each?

144
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,680
Dash eight.

145
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:24,120
So we just need to use control space.

146
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:31,830
To get the meaning so you can see here, it says that the Class H.

147
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:41,960
Dash eight means height to R M or thirty two pixels, so it means that we're sitting the high to be

148
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,670
thirty two pixels in order to get these explanations.

149
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,530
Make sure to have the extension called.

150
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:53,960
I think.

151
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,050
Let me.

152
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,450
It's still tailwind.

153
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,930
Yeah, this one, the Tillmans, USS IntelliSense.

154
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:19,230
Make sure to install this extension to get all this information and a suggestion inside the Visual Studio

155
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:19,560
code.

156
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:25,440
All right.

157
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:33,880
So we're getting the whole we need three more icons, as we can see in the final version of the project,

158
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:37,190
we are getting account content and about.

159
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,160
So we go back to the Visual Studio code.

160
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:48,470
Let's keep the browser open on the right side and you go to header that, Jeff and.

161
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,560
We just copy this.

162
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,850
Three more times using all Chief Arradondo and.

163
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,090
It just changed this home to.

164
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,680
Contacts.

165
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:21,430
It was yeah, it first is account, so this third one is contact this, the second one is count.

166
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,780
And the last one is about.

167
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,600
So let's get the icons as well, so we have home icons.

168
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:38,940
The second one is the user icon for the account.

169
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,530
Then we have contact, which is the phone icon.

170
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,700
And last one.

171
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:48,480
Is.

172
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,770
The information.

173
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,820
Information.

174
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,220
Sir Carl Icahn.

175
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:00,360
All right.

176
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:11,310
So now we just need to change this three to this one user icon for an icon here and inflammation circle

177
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:15,450
like it can see the change inside the browser right away.

178
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,570
And the next thing we need to do just style this section.

179
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:30,630
I think it's enough for this video in the next section, we're going to install this.

180
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,630
Heather S. Let's do the guitar.

181
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:43,670
So we just use contrasty to stop the server to clear it.

182
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,800
And we use get to add everything.

183
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:56,300
We use gets comments to add the message, which is.

184
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,380
Create.

185
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,580
The header component.

186
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,910
Component.

187
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,650
All right.

188
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:24,970
And finally, we do get push to push everything to get up.

189
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,650
And let's check it inside to get here.

190
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:39,750
They open it, see, it's better, they go to a movie Dash app, Dash VH.

191
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:51,720
And we see now we have four comments, so we clicked on this and we can see we have create the header

192
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,440
components so we could be open this one and see the changes.

193
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:06,820
So we created the header that year, and we added the hero icons at the top and also the.

194
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,670
Sorry to hit icons and the import hero icons, including home user phone and information circle.

195
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:24,350
And also we created the header icon separately and we passed the props.

196
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,760
Which is title and icon itself.

197
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:40,020
And finally, we have the image at the end, which is this it has a source to Wikimedia that -- and

198
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,730
the additive width and height.

199
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,020
And also inside a hidden icon.

200
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:52,250
We've got the props and we just made the icon.

201
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,060
And the title.

202
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:05,160
In next, a conflict that is the add the domain upload that Wikipedia that allows you to don't get the

203
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,970
error, that's the mandatory for the next year's website.

204
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,850
And that's it.

205
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:17,020
And we also in package that, Jason, we installed the hill icons.

206
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:23,750
Yeah, yeah, that was it for the creating the header section in the next section, we're going to style

207
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,520
this component.

208
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,230
So see in the next section.
