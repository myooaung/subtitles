1
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.590
All right.

2
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.770
In the last section, we have completed the loading effect of our website.

3
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:21.190
In this section, we're going to deploy it to Versal and keep it online so you can share it with your

4
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.730
friends and family or put it in your portfolio.

5
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.070
So the website we're going to use for deploying our website is very solid.

6
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:40.720
So we're going to search Versal on Google and in the search results we can click on Versal dot com.

7
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.860
And it's very it's very it's free to use Versal.

8
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.140
You can deploy your website as you can see.

9
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.670
I have already.

10
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.730
And have many websites in this platform.

11
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.440
They give you many free tiers you can use.

12
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.240
And then as you can see, I'm just using the hobby to free one.

13
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:15.480
But I could manage to put many websites in my in this platform.

14
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.770
So makes you sure that you are already signed in with your account.

15
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.300
And then what you do here is to click on Add new.

16
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.830
Project.

17
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.120
And this is going to bring you here.

18
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.060
If you are not signing with your GitHub repository, you can sign in here with your GitHub repository

19
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.440
and see all the website that you have inside GitHub.

20
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.480
Showing here, for example, this one is the one that I was committing throughout the projects.

21
00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:03.550
So it is a started 12 days ago and when we want to deploy it, you just simply click on import.

22
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.880
And when you click on import, you can just change your project name and it's already detected.

23
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.610
This is a nexus framework and you want to use the root directory for this one.

24
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.690
That is okay.

25
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:27.030
And also here, before click on deploy, you just need to add your environmental variables that you

26
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.920
have inside the project.

27
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.990
So you need to come back to Visual Studio Code, go to Explorer section using Contour Shift E, just

28
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.670
click on the dot and file here and here.

29
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.240
Just you need to copy paste your environmental variables.

30
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.420
So I'm going to copy the first one.

31
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.750
Put it here.

32
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.240
I'm going to come back.

33
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.470
Just create.

34
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.030
Copy the other one.

35
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.060
Paste it here.

36
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.440
So we need to add two more.

37
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.510
One is API key.

38
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.000
Let me copy it.

39
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.510
Hey.

40
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.100
And the last point is context key.

41
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.490
Great.

42
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.010
Simply copy, paste all of them and add it here.

43
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.940
Now that you have all your.

44
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.000
Environmental variables.

45
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.280
Actually, Verso has a system that can protect all these information.

46
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.050
Felt so the users cannot see your API keys.

47
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.930
So now you can click on deploy.

48
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.490
This is going to deploy the.

49
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.120
Your application.

50
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.750
This is takes usually less than one minute to deploy your website.

51
00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:00.260
You can check your building, which is going to get the first is going to clone your GitHub repository

52
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.850
and also done the virtual build.

53
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:11.390
So we're not doing the actually next build or something virtual is going to do it all for us.

54
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.780
So, so make it optimized for the to be faster and better.

55
00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.550
And if you have some warning or or some problem you can see here.

56
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.040
And also it's going to create the aesthetic pages.

57
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.870
And you have some warning.

58
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.240
This is for experimental warning.

59
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.530
That is fine because.

60
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.150
This feature is new next year 13.

61
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.010
We are using the beta version.

62
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.570
That is all right.

63
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.360
So I think it's already completed.

64
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.250
Okay.

65
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.210
That is finished.

66
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.780
And then they're going to say, you congratulation.

67
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.320
And you can see that your website is here.

68
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.060
And with some domains.

69
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.760
Now, if you click on this picture, you're going to see your website online.

70
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.640
So I'm going to test this one.

71
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.300
So I'm going to click on Hello.

72
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.110
So you're going to search for Hello.

73
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.450
You can see if you get.

74
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.010
As you can see, this is the problem of the next year.

75
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.570
13.

76
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.930
Some of the features doesn't work on Versal.

77
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.760
The one that doesn't work is you cannot read this search term hello here.

78
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.050
And instead is seeing the search term undefined.

79
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.860
All right.

80
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.870
There is a solution for that.

81
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:49.220
I have searched inside the word solve GitHub repository and some people had the same problem.

82
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.650
So, uh, it's very simple to fix this problem.

83
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.520
You need to go back to Visual City Code.

84
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:08.500
You go to page that gsx the places that you you need these things like a search perhaps only had a problem

85
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.900
for the server side.

86
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.890
It cannot get this a start index or search term.

87
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:24.130
So what you do here, here at a top, this is for the image.

88
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.370
So for the image, you just go at the top.

89
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.470
Create some space and just make this a statement.

90
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.610
Export.

91
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.350
And create a constant.

92
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.600
And then we just say dynamic.

93
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.870
And this is going to be equal to four force.

94
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.020
Dash dynamic.

95
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.450
And also you can just do the same things for the other page.

96
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.370
So you're going to copy this one.

97
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.420
Go to page six of the Web as well.

98
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.600
And then here, just paste it at the top.

99
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.740
So now let's test this.

100
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.770
We need to add this one to the GitHub repository.

101
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.070
So you need to open the source control again.

102
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.740
Add these two lines and here you just say, for example.

103
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.090
Fix.

104
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:39.020
The dynamic problem you can say or the reverse of.

105
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:44.710
Problem.

106
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.490
Again, we're going to commit and push.

107
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:57.850
This is going to automatically create a deploy our website again.

108
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:03.820
For example, if we come back again to our new projects, which is this one.

109
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:11.660
And you go to deployment, you can see that it's just started to build again.

110
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:19.520
So you don't need to worry about it any time you create a new commit and push to GitHub.

111
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:25.090
Versal is going to detect it and create your website again.

112
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.010
So I'm going to click here to see the.

113
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.840
As you can see, it's just ready now.

114
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.330
So now we can click again.

115
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.850
And go to the website.

116
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.900
So let's try again.

117
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.030
For example, a search.

118
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.360
Hello again.

119
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.000
And you're going to notice that this is much faster.

120
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.560
But as you can see, it's working.

121
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.410
We have the loading effect and also.

122
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.610
Let's see what we got.

123
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.100
Something went wrong.

124
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.820
And, uh.

125
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.330
So let's try the image.

126
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.960
Okay.

127
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.190
Maybe if we got the too many requests.

128
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.700
One.

129
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:25.850
Let me pause the video and I'll be back when it is ready.

130
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:28.480
All right.

131
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:33.380
I have fixed the problem because we have added 10 seconds of waiting.

132
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.670
So that was the maximum execution time for Versal.

133
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:46.280
So now we have more commits in our GitHub repository if you go to the last commit.

134
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:52.220
I just have to remove the waiting promise instead of 10 seconds.

135
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:59.630
I have created 2 seconds waiting, so we're going to show the loading effect as well.

136
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:04.310
So now if we go to a home page and we search for, for example.

137
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:06.690
Hello.

138
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:15.850
And then we can see the search result for Hello.

139
00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.840
Let's see that if the pagination works.

140
00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.360
So the first one is Adelaide.

141
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.290
The music official music video if you go to next.

142
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.690
We're going to see a different one and then for the image.

143
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.600
The loading is working after 2 seconds to see the results.

144
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.420
So the first image is not exists.

145
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:47.850
Let's click the next one and then.

146
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.080
Kate, We should see the next page.

147
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.440
Think I haven't clicked it properly.

148
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:06.870
Okay, Now we went to the next page with the different images, and also the footer is working the API

149
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.370
for the country.

150
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:10.410
Okay, So.

151
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.930
All right, that was it for the project.

152
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.900
I hope you enjoyed and learn many things.

153
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:29.520
If you have any suggestion for the new ideas or if you want me to add more functionality to this website,

154
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.390
let me know.

155
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:33.750
So see in the next project.
