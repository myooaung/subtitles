00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:04.860
All right.

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.350
In the last section, we have completed the dark mode functionality of our website.

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.380
In this section, we're going to create the about page.

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:22.440
So let's go back to our Visual Studio code and we start the server using NPM run dev.

5
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.180
And we need to open the Explorer section using contour shift E.

6
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.060
We need to create a page here.

7
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.080
So this is the home page, because just the page that's in the app directory if you want to create.

8
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.860
Another page.

9
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.290
We need to create another folder called about.

10
00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:01.630
And then inside this folder, we're going to create a file called page dot JS X.

11
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.990
In this way we're going to have a about page.

12
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:13.630
So we're going to use RFC to have a React functional component I'm going to call this one about.

13
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.390
And let's go and see it inside our browser.

14
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.160
Let's refresh the page.

15
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.900
So now if you click on the about.

16
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:35.950
Uh, let's yeah, when we go to about, when we click on it, the URL is changed to about and we see

17
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.500
it about here, which is coming from this page.

18
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.820
All right.

19
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.910
So now we don't get an error for this page.

20
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.960
And also we have the layouts for this.

21
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:55.430
We still have the header for the about page because this layout that JSX is going to apply to all the

22
00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.740
sub directory of this APT folder.

23
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.280
So even here we didn't add any layout.

24
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.920
Page is still all the everything inside this layout is.

25
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.460
A will apply to this page as well.

26
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.180
So.

27
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.620
Well, we have created this one.

28
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.470
Let's create a solid a little bit.

29
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.020
And inside the.

30
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.780
Here I'm going to have an H one tag saying about.

31
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:43.830
Which is going to be to have a bigger size text by changing to x large for the text.

32
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:52.650
And we set the font to be medium, which is equal to font medium sorry, font medium is equal to font

33
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.330
weight 500.

34
00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.880
Then we have we're going to change the text color to amber.

35
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.030
This time?

36
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.260
600.

37
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.070
So let's see now we have this one in the light mode is like this and like that one.

38
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.950
Let's bring this one to the.

39
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.370
Now let's add some class to the upper div.

40
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.700
We set the max width to be 6xl, which is going to be equal to the one we used here.

41
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:38.900
And in order to bring them to the center, we need to use Amex Auto, which is margin X Auto, which

42
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.540
brings this one to the center.

43
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.500
So let's.

44
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.950
Refresh the page.

45
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.420
We see the results now.

46
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.790
Now they're about is here.

47
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.480
And let's add some space between this about.

48
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:05.750
And it takes after that using a SpaceX Y for now.

49
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.430
After this H one, I want to add some text.

50
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.380
So I have already prepared some text.

51
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.150
I'm going to paste it here.

52
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.370
So this is just an explanation about the website.

53
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.410
And.

54
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.270
Let's see it here.

55
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:36.250
In order to just the day, they will be divided, we can put them inside the paragraph.

56
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:48.070
So I'm going to add a paragraph and add some some of the sections to the first paragraph until for example.

57
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.120
Let's see.

58
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.010
We have a.

59
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.440
Okay.

60
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:07.310
Until here, we put in the paragraph, the first one, and then we can add another paragraph, adding

61
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.310
the this section.

62
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.760
Let's add another one and add the last part.

63
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.870
So in this way you're going to have a space between the text.

64
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:27.320
Okay?

65
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.420
Let's refresh the page.

66
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.520
We see the changes.

67
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.590
So

68
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.800
it's a bit styled in a way.

69
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.630
Let's see.

70
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.820
The space X.

71
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.080
This one should be a space.

72
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.430
Why?

73
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.580
Sorry about that.

74
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.890
Because the space should be between the y axis, not the x axis.

75
00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.980
Let's refresh the page.

76
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.530
And now we see that it looks better in the dark mode.

77
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.840
Looks like this.

78
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.820
All right, So.

79
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.770
That was it for the pages section, for the above section.

80
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:18.260
Just we have added a folder called about and inside the about folder we have added the page that gsx.

81
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.710
And everything.

82
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.540
The rules from the layout goes to this section as well.

83
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.530
So let's add this one to the GitHub.

84
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:41.860
Using Contour shift G, we just name this font, create the about page we can commit and push it and

85
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.470
let's check it inside the GitHub.

86
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.930
We come back and we refresh the page.

87
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.610
Now we should see a new.

88
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:58.770
Commit, which is the file that we have created inside the about folder with a div header and the paragraphs.

89
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:06.960
So if you don't want to write down this text, you can come to this GitHub repository in this page and

90
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:14.310
you can just simply copy this three paragraphs and put it in your website.

91
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.750
All right.

92
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.420
That was it for the about page.

93
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.920
In the next section, we're going to create the nav bar component.

94
00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:31.710
So as you can see here, we have a nav bar with two with two item.

95
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:38.260
So this is going to be a component and each of them is a different component as well.

96
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:45.850
When we click on the training, this is going to bring the trending section and also the top rated is

97
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.700
going to fetch the trending.

98
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:55.930
And each when we click on each item, we're going to change the URL with the new parameter.

99
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.700
And this is going to be inside the layout as well.

100
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:06.160
So if you are inside the about page, you still see that nav bar component.

101
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:13.900
So see in the next section for the NAV for component of our project.
