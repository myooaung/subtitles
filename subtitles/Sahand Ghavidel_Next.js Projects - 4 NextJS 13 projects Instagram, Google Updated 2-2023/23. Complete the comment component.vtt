WEBVTT
1
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:07.820
All right.

2
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:18.030
In the last section, we have got all the comments of the post and we show them using map method and

3
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.890
we just got the text of the comments in this section.

4
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:31.590
We're going to complete the comment component and we show them one by one on top of each other.

5
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.100
So the comment section and also the post component are very similar.

6
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.080
We just want to show them like this.

7
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.650
You just want to add some margin or padding left.

8
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.590
And uh, it should be very similar and doesn't have any image or anything.

9
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:59.170
So for us we just go, we can go to the poster Jesus and we can just copy everything.

10
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:07.180
It was in contra a controversy and because the comment that Jeff and we paste it all here.

11
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.720
So now we just just can change them.

12
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.920
Uh, because, uh, we don't want the image part and also the.

13
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.680
Asking for it like and putting comments are a little bit different from here because we are using the

14
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.780
comment I.D., not the post I.D..

15
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.340
Okay.

16
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:38.130
So in order to not get confused here because you're we just getting post an it if you want to get comment

17
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.640
and I'd.

18
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.940
But we want to get the idea of post and also idea of comments so inside I that J.S. instead of just

19
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.690
sending it.

20
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.930
I want to change this one to comment idea.

21
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.930
I highly recommend you do it as well.

22
00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:04.930
And also, we want to pass the post I.D., but because the post I.D. in here is defined as a global

23
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.950
state.

24
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.930
We cannot use the same name.

25
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.390
So instead we just use, for example, original.

26
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.500
Host.

27
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.900
I'd.

28
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.830
That's the same team.

29
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.710
Same.

30
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.130
But, uh, because we cannot use the same.

31
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.080
Same thing for.

32
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.900
Yeah, because we get an error.

33
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.900
Because when we define it here.

34
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.390
When we define it here.

35
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.150
And we cannot get it.

36
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.910
From here, too, because we are defining it two times.

37
00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:01.570
So this one is going to be equal to post I.D., which is getting from the URL here using your router.

38
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.660
So this is going to be equal to ID.

39
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.890
Okay.

40
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.960
No insight comment.

41
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.060
Uh.

42
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.390
Inside this one comment that you instead of post and post, I'd be just get a comment.

43
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:26.960
Comment, I'd.

44
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.770
And also post I.D. So you call it original post?

45
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.140
I do.

46
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:43.010
Just the original post I.D. And also this one would be comment.

47
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.710
And, uh.

48
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.930
We don't want to show the comments.

49
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.370
So we delete this one because we don't want to get the number of comments.

50
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.330
So we delete this.

51
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.080
And, uh.

52
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.320
Everything we can keep here is we are getting the likes.

53
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.810
But we want to get the number of likes inside the comments.

54
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:24.230
So it should be DB post post I.D. or original post I.D., it should say.

55
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.840
Then we go to the comments collection.

56
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.280
And here.

57
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.520
Uh, we should choose that comment.

58
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:42.850
That comment I.D..

59
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.250
Okay.

60
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.440
And we just add a comma here.

61
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.870
So it goes inside that comment I.D. and checks the likes.

62
00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:03.450
How many likes that it has and pass it to this likes state.

63
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.950
And also we want to add this on as a dependency as well comment it to.

64
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.700
Okay.

65
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.220
Then we have the.

66
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.340
We want to get the comments, as I mentioned.

67
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.420
We don't need this.

68
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.490
We delete them because we don't want to add comments inside the comments.

69
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.010
That is going to be very complicated, actually.

70
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:29.750
So we delete this.

71
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.320
Then we want to check that if the comment has a like or not, you can just use this one.

72
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.430
You don't need to change it.

73
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:45.680
That is fine because it checks the if the user I.D. exists inside the likes.

74
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.320
And for liking the post.

75
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.750
Instead of just say like post, which just said like comment.

76
00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.730
And.

77
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.910
For deleting the like.

78
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:13.680
We should go to post or original post already.

79
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.870
And we go to inside the comments.

80
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.200
Collection and then comment I'd.

81
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.580
So we checked the likes.

82
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.810
And we delete that flex.

83
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.830
Okay.

84
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:44.450
And here we should add is so this is very similar we just the original post I.D. likes.

85
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.790
I should go inside the comments.

86
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.150
And comment.

87
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.680
I'd.

88
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.490
This is going to allow for adding the like.

89
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.080
So it's going to add the username as well.

90
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:12.550
And if they are not signing it, they're going to redirect the person to the signing page for deleting

91
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.270
the comments.

92
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.610
Let's change this one to delete comment.

93
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.240
You say, are you sure you want to delete this comment?

94
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.420
Okay.

95
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:28.790
So delete.

96
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:37.920
So I'm going to post and original post already.

97
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:42.660
And after that, we go to the comments.

98
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.720
And we check the comments idea.

99
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.090
And this is.

100
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.750
Should be.

101
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.120
Yeah, this one and this.

102
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:56.770
Okay.

103
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.500
Because we don't have any image.

104
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:05.830
We don't need to have this part and we don't need to come back to the homepage.

105
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.040
Actually, we just stay the same page.

106
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.990
So we delete all of them.

107
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:17.760
Yeah.

108
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.220
To say, if we don't redirect a person, that's fine.

109
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:24.990
Uh.

110
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.240
Here the image for the person.

111
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.450
It's going to be a comment.

112
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.880
And inside the comment, we have user image.

113
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.340
We don't need data for this.

114
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.250
Because inside the IED that J.S. when we got the comment.

115
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.350
Uh.

116
00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.000
Maybe we need to relax.

117
00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.140
Let me just leave it for now.

118
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.910
If you get an error, we can delay this.

119
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.160
I'm not sure about this.

120
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.080
So instead of pause, we just change this one to comment.

121
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.330
This can be comment.

122
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.080
And this is comment as well.

123
00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.080
It's copy this.

124
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:28.170
This is data that comment and instead of text, we have comment.

125
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:37.280
And we don't want the image because we don't have any image for the replies.

126
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.590
So delete that for a chat icon we want to.

127
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.400
Set the post IED.

128
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.200
The post IED here is just the original.

129
00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:56.820
Host Idi and we're going to open it.

130
00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:57.730
That's fine.

131
00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:58.390
And.

132
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.660
We don't want to see the number of comments here, so we delete this part.

133
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:11.600
And if the person is signed in and it's equal to comment.

134
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.510
Actually, we don't have the I.D..

135
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.020
We need it.

136
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.100
We need to add it.

137
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:17.660
Uh.

138
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.320
Because this idea is different from this.

139
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:28.930
We can get it.

140
00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:30.910
I'll show you later.

141
00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:31.420
So let's.

142
00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.070
Let's first trust it.

143
00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.090
We just say delete comment.

144
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.740
And then this kind of like comment.

145
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.830
This is a like comment as for.

146
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.540
If the number of likes is more than zero, that is fine.

147
00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.350
We can keep it.

148
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.550
I think we can now check the browser to see what happens.

149
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.400
Okay, let's refresh the page.

150
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:14.760
So post is not defined and line 84.

151
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.780
84.

152
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:24.970
I know how.

153
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.360
Which pages comment that you use?

154
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.700
Line 84.

155
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.040
So.

156
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.380
This is showing image, though.

157
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:46.730
Say.

158
00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.790
That's so weird.

159
00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.300
So let me try again.

160
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.940
So I see the image.

161
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:13.770
Yeah.

162
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:14.380
ImageD.

163
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.080
Oh, we delete it.

164
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.970
That is different place.

165
00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.700
This is, uh.

166
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.980
Let's close this one.

167
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.640
Our user image.

168
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.830
I'm sure I deleted the image.

169
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:33.650
I don't know.

170
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:34.570
What's that error?

171
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.160
So let me restart the server.

172
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:42.080
Maybe this is just a cache because it's showing a weird error.

173
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.030
We don't have that line, actually.

174
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.180
So let's refresh the page.

175
00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:55.880
Okay.

176
00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.550
That's a different story.

177
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.660
Comment that data is not a function, so we should delete the data.

178
00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.120
So my guess was correct.

179
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.730
So from the top, anywhere we have data we deleted.

180
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:12.390
So.

181
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.650
We're just at this.

182
00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:24.210
Anywhere.

183
00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:25.860
We have data it deleted.

184
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:32.220
This is because we are getting it in a different way.

185
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.440
Okay.

186
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.390
Let's try again.

187
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.130
Still 93.

188
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:48.960
Line 93.

189
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:51.450
Again.

190
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.240
I don't know why it doesn't save this.

191
00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.250
I need to restart the server again.

192
00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.380
I don't know what happened today.

193
00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:10.850
It's not.

194
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.740
It's not updating my.

195
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.770
Page animal.

196
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:23.660
Sometimes happens if you restart this computer, it's going to be fine.

197
00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:24.620
I think.

198
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.740
No, we are not getting an error.

199
00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.410
And also we are getting the comments.

200
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:31.070
Okay.

201
00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:31.850
Sounds good.

202
00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:33.910
That's nice.

203
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.280
So let's add another comment here, which I say.

204
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:42.010
Wow.

205
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:45.720
Okay.

206
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.010
It's added here.

207
00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:49.950
That's okay.

208
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:55.890
And let's add to that, Marge, panning left so we know which one is comment.

209
00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:04.260
So here at the top, dear inside comments, we just add a padding list of 20.

210
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:08.600
And now you're fresh.

211
00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:13.240
Yeah.

212
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.410
I don't know what happened.

213
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:16.720
So we need to restart the server again.

214
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.180
Doesn't affect.

215
00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:32.440
Yeah.

216
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:33.760
You see the padding now?

217
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:38.000
Okay, let's try the, like, functionality.

218
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:38.770
It's working.

219
00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.340
And, uh, still, this phone is working.

220
00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:45.600
Let's add the comment.

221
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.520
We just say.

222
00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.190
New comments.

223
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:53.890
Okay.

224
00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.920
The comments section is working too.

225
00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:04.540
And the problem is I don't see the trash icon for the comment that I own.

226
00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:10.780
So we go back to the place that we have the trash icon here.

227
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:15.420
Here we have the trash.

228
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:21.510
So that is actually wrong because if you look at the Forest Store.

229
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.600
We have the comment.

230
00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:25.630
Okay.

231
00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:35.350
And each comment doesn't have the user ID, we need the user ID and we just want to compare if the user

232
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:39.730
ID is equal to the person who is signing, who has decision.

233
00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.640
So we need to.

234
00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:48.480
When we add a comment inside the comment model.

235
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:58.990
Now we also need to add the user ID so we just say user you ID here are user ID.

236
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:02.830
Okay.

237
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.290
This is going to be equal to session.

238
00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:06.490
That's.

239
00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:10.450
User data, user I.D..

240
00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:12.460
No.

241
00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:17.920
If we had a comment, let's just start the server to be sure first.

242
00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:26.530
Now, if you add a comment, it should add user idea as well.

243
00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:29.980
So now.

244
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.200
Let's add a comment.

245
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:41.290
It's just a current one, for example.

246
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:46.890
Well, let's check to hear.

247
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.890
Let's check the comments.

248
00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.570
I should find the comments.

249
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:52.410
A lot of comments.

250
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:54.870
Uh.

251
00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:58.790
Yeah.

252
00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.520
Comment one It has user I.D. now.

253
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:11.270
Now we can compare this user ID, uh, with inside a comment that yes, we can just say session that

254
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:17.960
user ID user ID is equal to comment dot user ID.

255
00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.080
If this one is equal, show the trash icon.

256
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:25.400
So now let's restart the server.

257
00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:31.970
I'm sure it's still having a problem, but, uh, let's try.

258
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:40.870
Yeah.

259
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:42.290
No.

260
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:47.390
For this comment that has the user idea inside, we have a trash icon.

261
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:50.210
Let's try this.

262
00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.610
And he's asking me, Are you sure you want to delete this comment?

263
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.300
Okay, Scott.

264
00:18:59.320 --> 00:18:59.740
Perfect.

265
00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.570
Let's add another one.

266
00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:03.910
For example.

267
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.430
Hello.

268
00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:09.930
Now you can see I can delete it, but let's sign in with another user.

269
00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.180
Let's sign in.

270
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:24.600
For example, with this one, we shouldn't see the delete our account for this person.

271
00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.610
Now let's comment here.

272
00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.160
For example, say nice.

273
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:38.310
So we are going to be redirected to the this page is you can see I cannot delete this comment which

274
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.900
is not mine, but I can like it.

275
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.760
I can like my own.

276
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.350
And also I can like.

277
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:45.600
My own.

278
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.820
I can delete my own comment as well.

279
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.080
That's okay.

280
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:52.260
The other teams.

281
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:59.760
When we are in the homepage, when I click on the text or this image, I want to be redirected to this

282
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:09.330
post page, not only clicking on the chat icon so we can go to post, but yes.

283
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.290
And add this functionality.

284
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:21.420
So in in the post, the text and post image, you're going to add a router.

285
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.210
So first we need to bring the user out outer at the top.

286
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:29.130
We already have it actually here router a user out there.

287
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.890
So we can just easily use it.

288
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.960
So we have this post text.

289
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:42.480
So inside this paragraph I added on click.

290
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:55.230
Which is going to have a function that is redirect the person using router push.

291
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.680
And the address is uh.

292
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.790
It should be a dynamic.

293
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.900
So at.

294
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.040
Back to work here.

295
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:16.170
It's a slash process and then we should have the

296
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:19.820
post IED.

297
00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.410
Most likely we are getting.

298
00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.530
Uh, I think we are just getting the I.D..

299
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.080
From inputs.

300
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:37.660
Let me check.

301
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:41.750
Or is it?

302
00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:42.260
Oh, here.

303
00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:42.960
You're kidding.

304
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.430
This is the post I.D..

305
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.620
So here.

306
00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.300
Uh, inside the post image.

307
00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.100
Post-tax here.

308
00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.360
This fund should be.

309
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:00.960
Are we doing it?

310
00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:01.900
Actually, this.

311
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.460
Fairly precise just here at the.

312
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:08.290
Okay.

313
00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:12.400
And then we just copy this one and add it to the images file here.

314
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.670
Okay.

315
00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:17.210
Let's.

316
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.350
Try it, click here.

317
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.330
We should be redirected to that page.

318
00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:25.920
It come back.

319
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:33.130
We click on this or this image, we should go to the post section or.

320
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:34.970
Okay.

321
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:38.730
Yeah.

322
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.650
It looks okay now.

323
00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:47.070
Okay.

324
00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.270
Let's add everything to the guitar.

325
00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:57.030
We just can't at all.

326
00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:02.730
And we attic masses by using gift comment.

327
00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.350
And the message would be.

328
00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:06.950
Complete.

329
00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.000
Complete the.

330
00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.630
Comment component.

331
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.780
And we push it to.

332
00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.020
Get.

333
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.500
So let's check GitHub now.

334
00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.640
Refresh the page.

335
00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:41.840
No, we have 24 comments and the last one is complete the comment component.

336
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:47.090
So inside a comment that yes, we actually brought.

337
00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:52.290
Everything from poster J.S. but is in a letter.

338
00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:55.860
Let me briefly explain what I've changed.

339
00:23:56.610 --> 00:24:02.490
So instead of getting post an idea, we've got the comment comment idea and original post idea.

340
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.080
Then.

341
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:11.060
In the U.S effects that people are getting the likes.

342
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.320
We change this after the post we just said.

343
00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:17.660
What was your capacity?

344
00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:22.440
And then we went to the comments collection and then we went inside a comment.

345
00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:24.690
Then.

346
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:27.560
For the likes.

347
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:33.830
We didn't change anything for the car, for the adding, the like or deleting.

348
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:36.530
We just changed it.

349
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.000
Direction like this.

350
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:45.020
The Post original post idea, comments, comments, ideas and likes and for sitting there the likes

351
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:51.680
as well and for deleting we change the query as well.

352
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.380
And, uh.

353
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.820
We added a padding left here.

354
00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:00.810
And also.

355
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:02.900
Yeah.

356
00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:03.360
We add.

357
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:06.210
We deleted the data for all of them.

358
00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:07.900
Yeah.

359
00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:11.940
Everything's, uh, similar here.

360
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.700
We set the post I did to original post I.D..

361
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.190
And, uh.

362
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:23.120
We can change the delete posts to delay delete comment.

363
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.880
Yes, this is fine.

364
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.980
And inside a comment model that yes, we added another.

365
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:40.100
Field called user I.D. so we could use that to add the trash icon.

366
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.260
So we just check the trash icon here.

367
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:55.690
The four poster j Yes, we ve redirected the person when the person is clicking on the text and image.

368
00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:58.140
Using router.

369
00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:05.430
And inside the idea that yes we added we changed it to comment idea.

370
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.450
Also we got the original post idea.

371
00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:09.730
Yeah.

372
00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.620
That was it for this section in the next section.

373
00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:23.140
Uh, probably I'm going to deploy the reps and deploy this, but, uh.

374
00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:26.400
I'm not sure.

375
00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:32.110
Maybe I add more functionality or maybe I add more functionality after deploying as an update.

376
00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.620
So I see you in the next section.

377
00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:41.590
We see what I'm going to do, but for sure I'm going to add more functionality.

378
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.870

A five firestorm section.
