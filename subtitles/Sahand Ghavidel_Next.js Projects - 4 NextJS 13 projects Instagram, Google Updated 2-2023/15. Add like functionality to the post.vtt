00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.670
All right.

2
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.510
In the last section, we have got the information from Firestorm and we populated these post sections

3
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.840
here.

4
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:24.760
In this section, we're going to add the like functionality to the post so a person can link and remove

5
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.570
its life.

6
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:34.030
And also, if a person is not sign in, the person is going to be redirected to the signing page.

7
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.720
So let's just start with the last section.

8
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:46.690
But before continuing, I just realized something that this moment doesn't work.

9
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.890
It's always showing a few seconds ago.

10
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.090
So let's go back to Visual Studio, go and fix it.

11
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.000
So inside the moment we forgot to add that data like this.

12
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.460
So here we just need to add.

13
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.230
Data.

14
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.170
Now, if you look at our work, you see that is.

15
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.990
One day ago the time that I recorded this with you.

16
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.960
Okay, uh, let's continue and add the, like, functionality.

17
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.120
Well, we just need to add a.

18
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.520
On click on this icon, which is the heart icon.

19
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:42.510
And when we click on it, we trigger a function that sends data to the fire store and add the user name

20
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.810
I.D. and a post I.D. inside a post.

21
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:54.390
We searched for the post I.D. and then we add the username to that particular post that we are liking.

22
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.160
So let's do this.

23
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.260
So we go back to Visual Studio code and we just find the heart icon in the poster case.

24
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.400
So we have the heart icon here.

25
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:16.800
So we add it and click on it, and we're just going to trigger a function called like posts.

26
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.610
Let's create the function at a time.

27
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.870
So this is going to be an asynchronous function.

28
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.260
So we just write async function.

29
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:40.630
So you can either make your error function to it's up to you this time I'm using this form of function.

30
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.530
So we just call it like post and here.

31
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.220
Now we're going to await and set a document inside.

32
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.080
Fiery firestorm set.

33
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.320
Dark is a built in function from Firestorm, so we need to import it.

34
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.690
So here, let me.

35
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.330
Yet the author suggests it doesn't suggest me.

36
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.510
So we need to import it manually at the top.

37
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.700
So we just say import.

38
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.230
Said, Doc.

39
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.230
From.

40
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.560
Fire.

41
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.100
Face forest.

42
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.790
Last forest.

43
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.160
Okay.

44
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.840
This set doc takes in a few things.

45
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:39.850
The first one is Doc, and we for the document, we want to add it to the TV document that is coming

46
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.720
from fire.

47
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.440
Uh, here, the fire bass touches the exported DP.

48
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.230
So here we are imported.

49
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.020
And also the import doc from Firestone.

50
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.310
And the document we want to search is the posts.

51
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.300
And what we want to search is the post.

52
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.640
IED.

53
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.210
So if you're getting the post information, you can get the idea here.

54
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:18.710
Just remember, we don't need to add data for the IED because data is just for the other things.

55
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:20.170
Yeah.

56
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.210
We want to create another collection called Life.

57
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.150
Okay.

58
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.320
And inside their lives, I want to add the persons already.

59
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.410
So in order to get the persons, I need a person who is signing.

60
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.780
We need to use the use session.

61
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.350
So we just import who's session?

62
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.860
From Nick's.

63
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.190
Off for slash reacts.

64
00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.800
This should be important.

65
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.210
Okay.

66
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.940
Then we need to initialize it.

67
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.000
So we need to get initialize decision.

68
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.960
We get the data and we call the data session.

69
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.140
And this is coming from use session.

70
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:17.130
What?

71
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.650
So let's add the user here.

72
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.930
So we should say session that user.

73
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.790
Dot I.D., user I.D. or.

74
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.660
This is the Google user I.D..

75
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.890
Okay.

76
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.410
Now, after this one is finished.

77
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.960
Also, we want to add the person's information as a field.

78
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.920
So we just we just saved the user name.

79
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.840
Yes.

80
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.050
They used the session.

81
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.360
That user that user name added here.

82
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.240
So let's test this on.

83
00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:01.290
If you go to our browser in the first picture, we're just saying nice.

84
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.660
Let's add click here.

85
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.920
So we didn't get any error.

86
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.370
So let's go check it inside the database.

87
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.070
It's a database.

88
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.410
So inside a post, the one that is saying nice.

89
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.630
This one now has a collection of likes.

90
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.560
And also it has the.

91
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.430
Username inside, and this is the user ID that the person has.

92
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.740
This is similar to this one.

93
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.760
User ID the person who created the post.

94
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.390
Okay.

95
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.930
Let's try this with another account.

96
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:54.780
Uh, so we go back to the website, I sign out and I signing with another G-mail account.

97
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.960
So let's sign in.

98
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.270
I choose the other one.

99
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.040
So now if I like the first one.

100
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.110
We check the.

101
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.520
Database.

102
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:23.660
We have two likes here and this one is the user ID of the other account.

103
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.400
And then you can see the name as well.

104
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.750
Okay.

105
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.540
We we've done it and now in a way that we did.

106
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:39.410
But the problem is we don't see that the like.

107
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.670
We want to change the color of this one if someone liked it.

108
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.780
And also when we click on it, we want to remove their like.

109
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:53.060
But for doing that we need to get the alikes first.

110
00:07:53.750 --> 00:08:01.430
We should know firstly that the this post has a like or not or it has a like with the person that is

111
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.840
signing or not.

112
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.800
And if it has a like at least show the number of likes.

113
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:13.690
Okay, it's a quite a lot of things to do, but let's do it step by step.

114
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.920
The first step is just make this one read when somebody liked it.

115
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.560
So first we need to get the logs from the database.

116
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.540
So we go back to Visual Studio code.

117
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:36.580
So here at the top we add another piece of state and we call this one likes and we just say set likes.

118
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:47.060
And this is going to first we need to get the likes on database and send it to these state.

119
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.840
So this is going to be called to use a state.

120
00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:03.120
And the initial value would be just an empty array because this is an array of people who like this.

121
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.950
And we need to import.

122
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:10.530
Use.

123
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.230
And States.

124
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:15.910
From.

125
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:20.090
React.

126
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:22.120
Okay.

127
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:29.630
So let's add a space here and here to talk.

128
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.870
No, we got this one.

129
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:41.160
So the other things we need to do is just to be use use effects to get the information.

130
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.250
So we just use a fax.

131
00:09:48.540 --> 00:10:00.510
Use effects going to have a functional also dependency the dependency you want to add I think the database,

132
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:08.640
it's fine and then we need to create the unsubscribe function as we did before.

133
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:19.430
An unsubscribe function is going to get the snapshot on snapshot.

134
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:28.750
And Snapshot, if you remember, has some other things like collection.

135
00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:33.640
So we want to have the check, the collection of the B.

136
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.010
And the TV.

137
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.210
The.

138
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.630
Documents post, and we checked the post.

139
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:45.470
That I.D..

140
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:47.030
You want to check?

141
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:56.310
Because we are in the post that, yes, we want to check the posted I.D. and we check if it has a likes

142
00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:00.000
or not is a like likes collection and.

143
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.600
After this.

144
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.080
We want to get the information as a snapshot.

145
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.220
Shot.

146
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:14.460
It's.

147
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:22.770
And we sit there like that, we have created here at a top.

148
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.890
Here we sit like.

149
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.230
To a snapshot.

150
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.280
Dot docs.

151
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.710
This is information is coming from a snapshot.

152
00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:40.690
Now.

153
00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:45.670
We got the lyrics, we got all the lyrics, if they'd like, is available.

154
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.240
And we said it inside this piece of estate.

155
00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.550
Okay, now.

156
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:57.060
We want to check that the user is sign in.

157
00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.960
Already has liked the post or not.

158
00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.130
So this is going to be another piece of estate.

159
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.510
So let's copy this and we just change this font to has.

160
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:12.840
Likes.

161
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:18.420
Or has it like you can say a set?

162
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.350
Has liked.

163
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:29.010
And the initial value of this would be false.

164
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:34.090
Know you don't want to have lies first.

165
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.280
But.

166
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.460
We check using use effect.

167
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:46.850
That has a like or not so use effect as a function.

168
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:52.720
And also at dependency and dependence.

169
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.950
This is here is the likes.

170
00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.440
If this piece of estates change, we want to trigger this.

171
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:09.780
And use the fact and check that the person has likes or not has liked it or not.

172
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:11.010
Okay.

173
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:12.650
No.

174
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.150
We want to sit has like.

175
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.370
If.

176
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:21.390
We check the likes.

177
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:24.240
First we find the index.

178
00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:29.840
Find the index of the like.

179
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:36.480
We get the like and then we just say, like that IED.

180
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:43.440
Is equal to the person that is signing, which is a session Dutch user.

181
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:44.850
That's a user ID.

182
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.680
And I show you here again.

183
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.590
So this user I.D..

184
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:59.290
If it's equal to the person end.

185
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.460
This is the post.

186
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:07.330
So if you come back, this post is created by this person under 40.

187
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:11.950
So if the person is signing is hundred 14.

188
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.190
Like it and they're.

189
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:20.220
There has the life estate is true.

190
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.560
But if the other person.

191
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:24.730
Comes.

192
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:27.920
Yeah.

193
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.190
This is for the number of likes.

194
00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:37.930
And, uh, yeah, if the person is coming, for example, like the year and the person is a signing

195
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:48.970
has the same user ID we want to make the make their heart icon filled with the red color who we cannot

196
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.320
see we have are getting error.

197
00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.370
So we didn't import to use effect.

198
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.120
So let's bring inside use a fact.

199
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.530
Okay.

200
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:10.200
So now we are checking if they're like are these equal to the decision that it and this is the.

201
00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.140
Now, let me show you about the picture.

202
00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:13.860
Yeah.

203
00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.230
This one is should be.

204
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:19.450
Not equal.

205
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.240
Two minus one.

206
00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.070
I'm going to show you in a second why I did it so.

207
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:35.400
Let's imagine the likes has an array like this.

208
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:45.900
And we have, for example, the first user who, like this one is like a one, two, three.

209
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:50.700
The user I.D. The second one is three, five, six.

210
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.210
And then etc..

211
00:15:54.670 --> 00:16:04.900
Many people this find index is going to check that if the person is signing has the same idea of their

212
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.890
person or already like this one in the array.

213
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:21.610
If this is true, we get the index and the index can be zero one, two and etc. the only things.

214
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:30.260
So if this one is not is equal to minus one, it means that this is outside the array.

215
00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.750
So the person is not liked.

216
00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.230
Has not like the post.

217
00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:40.990
I don't know why I'm explaining it in a way that you understand.

218
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:45.400
That's a sort of minus one is outside the array.

219
00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:47.920
Any other numbers that comes?

220
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.750
It means that the person is already like the host.

221
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.560
Okay.

222
00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:04.770
No, we we know that person is liked or not so we can use this has like now to fill our.

223
00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.110
An icon here.

224
00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.390
Uh, Hart, aka.

225
00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:18.130
So we're going to import another icon at a top.

226
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.070
But this one is from solid.

227
00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.990
So just say import.

228
00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:32.320
Heart icon from hero icons.

229
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:37.920
But this one is instead of heart like solid oak.

230
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:43.890
But because the name is similar, we need to save this one as a different name.

231
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.170
So we just say this one should be heart icon.

232
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.340
Field, for example, it changed the name.

233
00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:54.850
Okay.

234
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.370
So if you use this heart, I can't feel.

235
00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:58.630
Yeah.

236
00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:09.760
So we, we copy this one one time and we change the, the, the top one to field and we added ternary

237
00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:11.230
operator.

238
00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:16.090
We just say if has liked then.

239
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.600
Show this field one.

240
00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.620
Otherwise.

241
00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:27.130
Sure.

242
00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:27.640
The other.

243
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:30.850
Mm hmm.

244
00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.110
And also, uh.

245
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.430
And this one should be a question mark.

246
00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.270
Now, it's correct.

247
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.980
And the first one, instead of hover, gets the text read.

248
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.030
We want the text.

249
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.730
To be a rat instead.

250
00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:48.260
So let's check now.

251
00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.030
Let's refresh the page.

252
00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:00.840
Now on a snapshot is not defined, so we need to import it.

253
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.200
Let's go.

254
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:05.130
Yeah.

255
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.300
On Snapshot.

256
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.300
Let's import this from the fire store.

257
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.960
I feel we need to import collection to.

258
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.560
I think fine index is a built in JavaScript function.

259
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:22.290
Okay.

260
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:23.550
Let's check.

261
00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:27.590
Yeah.

262
00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:28.850
We are not getting an error.

263
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:33.230
And this is filth because the person is like a house like this.

264
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:37.280
So let's try the other one.

265
00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.160
Like this one, which is spirit.

266
00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:43.420
The person is signing.

267
00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.480
Is this fun san media?

268
00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:51.360
So when I like now, this one turned to red.

269
00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.980
So let's check in the database.

270
00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.210
So the.

271
00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:01.480
At this point.

272
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:06.490
The last post that is Bird now has a likes and dislikes.

273
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.080
It's created by this person, which is Sahand Garrido.

274
00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:12.580
Okay.

275
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:16.860
But if is signing with another person, let's say not.

276
00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:26.680
Okay.

277
00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:34.180
We need to protect this one because if you are not signing, you get an error.

278
00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.130
So here.

279
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.720
We just protect ourselves.

280
00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.890
We add the question mark here.

281
00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.460
Hey, let's refresh the page.

282
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.900
Now lets sign in with another account.

283
00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:01.700
But this account got it's hand.

284
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:03.970
Now.

285
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:06.550
The birds should not have any like.

286
00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:09.380
This far.

287
00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:11.540
No.

288
00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:15.350
If we click, we should get A like and B, this one has two likes now.

289
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:16.160
Okay.

290
00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:20.630
But the next step we want to do is to remove the like.

291
00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.690
So now if I click here.

292
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.890
Nothing happens.

293
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.750
Okay.

294
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:35.180
Because it's already has a life and the in its has another attempt.

295
00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:44.450
But let's go back to Visual Studio code and let's look at a ternary operator here.

296
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:51.740
Say if the person it has like this on.

297
00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:56.900
Yes.

298
00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:00.350
If there is no like we want to add the like.

299
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.920
But if it doesn't have like we want to remove the like actually.

300
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.000
So here we want to wait.

301
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:15.030
Because it gives us a promise.

302
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.770
So wait.

303
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:21.270
And instead of said, like, we want to delete the like.

304
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.110
So we just say Delete Doc.

305
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.440
And this is coming from Firestone, too.

306
00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.090
And this is similar to the one we did at the bottom.

307
00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:34.590
So it just gets dark.

308
00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:38.200
DB And inside.

309
00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:47.790
DB We want to go to posts and we just choose the posted I.D. and inside the likes.

310
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.110
We to remove.

311
00:22:51.950 --> 00:23:02.090
That person or uh, which has, uh, which, which is signing which is a session user.

312
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:03.970
Dot user I.D..

313
00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.480
Okay.

314
00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.430
And also, we want to protect ourselves, too, if we are not society.

315
00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:11.270
Okay.

316
00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:13.610
So let's try this.

317
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:20.090
No, this one is.

318
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:21.930
Yeah.

319
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.460
I can see when I click.

320
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.630
The heart goes back to the normal.

321
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.030
And let's check the database.

322
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:38.950
We bring it here at the right time this year.

323
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:46.340
So we add the like you can see a new person is adding and then you click again.

324
00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.390
They're like is removed.

325
00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:50.740
Okay.

326
00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:56.160
So next step we want to.

327
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:00.050
And the number of likes.

328
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:11.030
We already got all the likes here by using these effect use effects and we set it inside this estate

329
00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:11.670
likes.

330
00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:16.890
So we just need to go here in the heart icon.

331
00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:22.140
We add it, let's add a div and cover both of them.

332
00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:23.770
Very.

333
00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.100
Just bring them inside.

334
00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:31.890
And inside this tier, let's add another section.

335
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.180
They just had a.

336
00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:38.880
Ternary operator.

337
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.340
Just say if the likes number.

338
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:48.770
Luck's not length is greater than zero.

339
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.330
If it has a like, then.

340
00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.570
They want to create a span.

341
00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.700
I've done some work like that and.

342
00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:11.430
And inside this band, we want to show the number of likes, just the likes.

343
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:15.360
That length.

344
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:22.440
I think it's going to work now, but it's not the style.

345
00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:26.490
So this one has to like remove this now one like.

346
00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:32.760
Okay, now let's for example, this one doesn't have any like.

347
00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:39.300
Now it has one light, so it's just a little bit starlet.

348
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.370
Let's bring it next to each other.

349
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.360
Both of these.

350
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.890
So we just say flex.

351
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.900
And, uh.

352
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.280
I turn center.

353
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.120
Let's check it now.

354
00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:58.290
It looks okay now.

355
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.200
But when?

356
00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:11.950
And it has a like I want the color to be red and also let's change the ticks a little bit smaller.

357
00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:16.510
So here, let's add a class name.

358
00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.440
And the last thing I want to add is.

359
00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:23.620
Uh, first.

360
00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:30.000
Uh.

361
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.830
Yeah, let's check.

362
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.300
They make this fun.

363
00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.610
Variable.

364
00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:42.700
And we say if.

365
00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.420
Has the like.

366
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:50.090
Then we.

367
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:54.180
We just want to make the text to be read.

368
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:56.160
Text to be.

369
00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:57.760
Read.

370
00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.760
600.

371
00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:02.120
Let's face it now.

372
00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.380
Oh, we get an error.

373
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:09.410
Let's see.

374
00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:09.860
But.

375
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:16.280
We didn't close this.

376
00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:17.360
Yeah.

377
00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:18.170
Okay.

378
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:20.720
Now let's test it again.

379
00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:22.460
It's the first page.

380
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:36.150
Now if you didn't like it, it's just the color is black.

381
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:40.250
Let's make it a small truth.

382
00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:40.630
So it.

383
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.930
Yes.

384
00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:43.170
Uh.

385
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:45.960
Yeah, outside is just a text.

386
00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:47.040
A small.

387
00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.230
And also you can see this cursor.

388
00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:05.100
We can remove this cursor if you don't want to see it.

389
00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.350
Easily just say select.

390
00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:10.000
No.

391
00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:14.770
You don't see the curse.

392
00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:28.070
Let's find the other functionality I want to add and we are not signing like this.

393
00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:30.370
No.

394
00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:31.300
Nobody's signing.

395
00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.540
When I like.

396
00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:37.410
I want to be redirected to do the signing page.

397
00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:38.080
I firstly.

398
00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.370
Actually, we get an error.

399
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:44.400
So we need to prevent the error by protecting that.

400
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.810
So and then also we want to redirect the person to the signing page.

401
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:56.730
So we go back to the Visual Studio code and here in the function like post.

402
00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:03.990
First we check if the person is signed in if the session is true.

403
00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:11.380
Then we want to have this as like everything inside this.

404
00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:16.000
Otherwise, we want to redirect the person to the signing page.

405
00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.900
So we just here we just say sign.

406
00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:21.770
In.

407
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:25.750
And we need to import this one from next off.

408
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:28.500
First batch react at a top.

409
00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:30.760
Yeah.

410
00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:32.020
Okay.

411
00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.060
Now let's test this.

412
00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:35.410
Now, I'm not signing.

413
00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:39.820
So when I click, I go to the sign in page.

414
00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:43.540
It's signing with someone, for example.

415
00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.460
This person.

416
00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:47.650
That is me.

417
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:49.720
Okay.

418
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:50.950
Now we can.

419
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.980
And like.

420
00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:55.690
Okay.

421
00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.180
Looks very nice.

422
00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:04.260
All right.

423
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:05.750
That's it for this section.

424
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.950
Let's add this one to the guitar.

425
00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:21.730
So we just take it at all and B, make a message of, for example, at.

426
00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.020
Like.

427
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:27.840
Functionality.

428
00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:32.250
Twitter posts.

429
00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:35.280
Okay.

430
00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.030
Let's push this one to.

431
00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:42.650
Get half hour check what we have done this.

432
00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.040
We click on Twitter to refresh the page.

433
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:54.350
And now we have 15 commits in our repository and the last one is at like functionality to the post.

434
00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:02.740
So we imported quite a lot from via store collection, delete or deleting.

435
00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:07.560
On a snapshot, we're getting the information as set up for making a new document.

436
00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:10.990
Uh.

437
00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:21.100
We have the session, we can't decision because we want to check if the person is signing or not.

438
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:27.730
We we cut the number of likes from the database and save it to this state.

439
00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:32.290
And we also check that if the person is signing has liked it already or not.

440
00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:40.100
We use this use effect to get the number and all the likes here.

441
00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:49.480
We we use this, you use the fact to check the, uh, the person is liked or not has like the post or

442
00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:49.790
not.

443
00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:59.980
And then we have, we created this function and if the person is signing can like or remove the like

444
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:04.690
by doing this or it's going to be redirected to this signing page.

445
00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.450
We fixed the phone for a moment.

446
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:11.450
And also we.

447
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.660
Now we added another icon.

448
00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:22.720
Heart icon filled that when the person has liked the post.

449
00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.500
This is going to be shown.

450
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:30.410
And the number of likes is shown by this.

451
00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:35.680
So if the number of likes is more than zero, we can show it here.

452
00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:36.430
Okay.

453
00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:38.470
That was it for the next section.

454
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.930
See you for the next section.
