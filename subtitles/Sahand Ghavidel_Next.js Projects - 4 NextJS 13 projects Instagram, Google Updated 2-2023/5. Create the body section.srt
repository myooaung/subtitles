1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,150
All right.

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:15,620
In the last section, we have completed their section, we added the authentication.

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,010
Far from cool.

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,310
Well, we've got this image from the Google data.

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,200
So in this section, we're going to start with the with the forest section.

6
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,070
And if you look at the final version of the project.

7
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,260
We have a.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,660
We have a form here.

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,160
Which includes three things a logo at the top.

10
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,740
We have a.

11
00:00:51,150 --> 00:01:00,300
Kind of input with the two icons, the Magnifier, art icons and microphone.

12
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,510
And finally, we have a.

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,700
These two buttons, one here and one here.

14
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:22,310
So the these two buttons, they have the same kind of styling, so we just make one custom a style for

15
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,520
one of them and we apply it to the other one.

16
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,220
So and then the forum has some shadow effects.

17
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:40,520
And you can see when we focus also, we have a shadow effect and these portents, they have kind of

18
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,660
shadow factor.

19
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:52,180
So let's go to our visual studio code and the open, our local hosts three thousand on the right side

20
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,460
so we can see everything in real time.

21
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:01,630
Then we go to index that you use and we start with the body section.

22
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:10,060
As I mentioned, we have a forum that covers everything you don't need to add action photos for.

23
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:18,030
And inside this forum, we have an image input and also some buttons.

24
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,910
So let's first we get the image.

25
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,820
The image is similar to the image we got.

26
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:37,880
Here in the logging place, if you go to the logging page, this image, they're using the same URL,

27
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:50,420
but here I'm going to introduce you to the image tag from next year, which is a gives us the ability

28
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:59,480
to have a responsive image optimized and also kind of a lazy loading as far.

29
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,490
So we had that image tag.

30
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:18,910
This is just a self-closing, and we need to imported from next forest slash image.

31
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:26,970
So we imported image from Nick's first four slash image, and the image has some.

32
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,570
Let's go to the homepage.

33
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:39,020
When we add the image to it gives us two error.

34
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:48,290
The first one is telling us that the SRT attribute or actually property is required.

35
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,360
So here.

36
00:03:53,180 --> 00:04:01,520
We need to add this FRC, which, as I mentioned before, it's the same URL as we used in the signing

37
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,170
piece, so we go to this signing that, yes, and we can.

38
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,180
Copy the URL.

39
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,090
And the pace that here.

40
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,650
So after adding this, we're going to get another error.

41
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,420
So this is fresh this.

42
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,890
We get another error saying that the.

43
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,560
This URL is not configured.

44
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,400
I'm sorry in this one.

45
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,970
First, the error is the width and height is mandatory.

46
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,460
So we just give a width and height here.

47
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,360
So we just sit with.

48
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,430
And I think it 300 is enough.

49
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,380
And the heights would be.

50
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,710
One hundred.

51
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:13,040
Now we get another error, so we just say this, your EL is not configured in Nick's de-conflict.

52
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,590
Yes.

53
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,090
Which is this you are we copy this earlier.

54
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,550
Simply, we copy it.

55
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,740
And we go to next start conflict conflicts, yes, this fire year.

56
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:39,530
And just under the restricted and React Restrict mode, we add something else, we just add images.

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,180
And inside these images, we had the domains.

58
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:56,080
Two domains is equal to like an array and the first your L, the end is this one.

59
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,380
All right, so refresh the page.

60
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:09,020
Now, because if you change the conflict file, we need to restart this server, so we stop the server

61
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,200
and we run it again, using and run dev.

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,370
And now, if you refresh the page, we should see that image without any error.

63
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,740
Yeah, we got the image.

64
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:32,970
So after the image, we need to add the input as we want some and to add some icons inside the input.

65
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:41,520
Let's add some div here and inside that to be at the icons and the input as well.

66
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,920
So here we need two icons.

67
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,740
The first icon is search icon and the second one is microphone icon.

68
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,880
I'm going to use a website called Hero Icons.

69
00:06:54,790 --> 00:07:01,120
Hero icons is actually created by children, yes, so it's completely compatible with children's cases

70
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,440
and.

71
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:09,670
Actually, let's search for the hero icons.

72
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:24,200
This website, they're in the search result, we see that hero icons dot com beautiful handcrafted SPG

73
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,840
icons by the makers of the tailored access.

74
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:35,900
So we click on this, as you can see, there are two types of icons the first one is offline.

75
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,920
And the second one is solid and the difference is just filled.

76
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,810
So these are filled here and we call them solid.

77
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,800
Let's go to documentation.

78
00:07:51,610 --> 00:08:00,160
And in the documentation, we need to run this line of code to install, you know, our costs, so we

79
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,910
copy this.

80
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:11,070
You go back to Visual Studio code, we can stop the server or we can create another terminal.

81
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,890
Well, let's start the server.

82
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,120
Just the quick installation.

83
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,030
So that's it, I think.

84
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:33,300
We we just need now to import the package, the icons, if you want.

85
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:37,380
So we start the server again using npm run dev.

86
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,450
And here.

87
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,830
At a top are import icons.

88
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,890
Both of the icons are from solid.

89
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,260
So we just right down here in port.

90
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,660
Search.

91
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,440
Icon.

92
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:08,500
And also, the next one is microphone icon, so we just have micro phone.

93
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,140
All right.

94
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,460
And both of them are coming from.

95
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,930
Here are costs.

96
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:21,680
Yeah.

97
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,770
You know, I cast forward slash reacts, you can't see this suggestion.

98
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,900
Now we can use the icons in our.

99
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,890
Project let's.

100
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,570
Bring back our.

101
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,810
Website to the right side, so you can see the changes.

102
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,380
OK.

103
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,000
So after.

104
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,340
Inside a stiff.

105
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:59,220
We add the search icon, justice search icon.

106
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,370
We should see a search icon now.

107
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,350
This man finished a page.

108
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,420
Yeah.

109
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:22,760
We didn't specify the solid or outline, so after this here, I can't react.

110
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:30,400
We just need to write down solid or outline as I want to use the solids, so I just write down solid.

111
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,920
So that is the error we're getting.

112
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,360
So I think this is fine.

113
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,650
Just refresh the page.

114
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,590
Yeah, now we got the icon here, which is huge.

115
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,190
But that is fine.

116
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,210
We're going to style it soon.

117
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:56,090
Well, let's at just some heights to make it smaller.

118
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,760
The height you just said it to be a fire.

119
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,830
That would be OK.

120
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,330
So we're going to style it later.

121
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,580
So let's finish our form.

122
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:17,040
We added input, but a type of text.

123
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,590
Inputs with the type of text, so just uh.

124
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:24,490
Yeah.

125
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:30,730
And then the input is going to have.

126
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,300
It's just the you cannot see the impact, how it's here and see.

127
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,640
So we have the input.

128
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:41,570
That's fine.

129
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,750
So we don't need any placeholders.

130
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,940
We want to make it exactly like the Google wants.

131
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,090
So the Google one doesn't have any placeholder.

132
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,330
So let's add the next icon, which is the microphone icon.

133
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:08,220
And let's add some height to the height for the microphone is five as well.

134
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:18,030
So we have all of them, these things like we have to search our car, we have input now we have also

135
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,830
the microphone.

136
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:25,020
Next is the icon buttons inside the phone.

137
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,900
We have two buttons, the first one.

138
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,740
It's just saying Google search.

139
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:38,520
All right.

140
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:48,170
And let's copy this, and the second one is just saying I'm feeling lucky.

141
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,720
All right, we have two buttons here.

142
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:12,070
As I mentioned before, we were going to style these buttons exactly the same so we we can use the layered

143
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:16,840
components of the to to do it.

144
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:17,860
All right.

145
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,660
Let's start styling our body section.

146
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:30,390
We just the ad flex display flex to the forum at the top, so we had a class name.

147
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,930
We want to bring them to the center so we can use the Flex first.

148
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:44,610
Flex brings them next to each other, but if we change the flex direction to column there, there will

149
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,140
be on the top of each other.

150
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:50,760
And after that, we can bring them to the center.

151
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,680
We're just using items.

152
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:54,850
Center.

153
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,740
And I want to push them a little bit down.

154
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,900
So it gets a little bit more beautiful.

155
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,960
So we just add a margin top of 40.

156
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:17,180
You can do it in other ways, too, like you add a body height of 100 percent.

157
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,650
I just use Justified Content Center.

158
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,760
But this is just for simplicity.

159
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,990
I'm using this margin top 40.

160
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,290
That is fine for one page.

161
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,120
If you have only one page application.

162
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:46,590
So and now let's go start with, uh uh, we just add here to the image object.

163
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:57,540
Fit cover, because I want to prevent this just stretching off the image, so object fig cover.

164
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:04,410
Maybe you don't see any changes, but a subtle movement you saw in the image.

165
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,670
So that is going to.

166
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,340
Prevent the stretching.

167
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,680
All right, so next, we have this inputs.

168
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,130
We want to bring them next to each other.

169
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:27,430
So we start with the let's first some styling for this icon.

170
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:32,110
Let's let me zoom out a little bit so you can see the changes.

171
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:41,740
So for the search icon, we have a we just want to add something like a tex gray.

172
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,850
It's just a tax.

173
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:48,670
Gray.

174
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,920
Five hundred.

175
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,280
So it's not going to be a complete black.

176
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,180
Yeah.

177
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,600
Text Gray.

178
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,890
Five hundred.

179
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,440
So this color.

180
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,670
Then we want to some marching to the right.

181
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:14,630
Off because we don't want to completely connect them to the next one and maybe be added later so we

182
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:23,780
can see the results, so first we at the diff here we make them flex to, they come next to each other.

183
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,330
All right.

184
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,990
And after that, we just changed the width to be full.

185
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,440
That they're so it's a full size now.

186
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,910
I can't see they went to the left, so let's bring them to the center.

187
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,480
Uh, just uh.

188
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:59,770
Let's add some space to between the logo and the input by adding marching top of five.

189
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,360
And then we.

190
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:12,790
We bring them to the center using Amex Auto, mismanaging its auto.

191
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,040
So do you see the change here and decrease the size?

192
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,340
It didn't apply yet, because.

193
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,710
Let's add some.

194
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,610
And Max, with we added Max with.

195
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,310
Of just just in 90 percent.

196
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:58,320
So we don't want to this input connects to the wall, so we added the 90 percent, so it's not going

197
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,150
to be more than 90 percent, but still it's not in the center, so.

198
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:15,590
Let me continue so we can see the results more so the next thing we need to add is just the we want

199
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,850
to add some border.

200
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,080
All right, so we add some border to just a border.

201
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:30,090
Now you can see the actually the diff, actually the div is in the center and it's full size.

202
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,570
But the inside is in the left.

203
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:39,120
So if you're going to fix it soon, so the border.

204
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:48,430
Is grey colour in is in grey colour, and it's just that two hundred.

205
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,770
It's very subtle, and that's see it, but that's fine.

206
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:01,160
And we want the size of this input to be like a flex grow.

207
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:09,260
You know, the Flex Grow is like we want the size of this input to go to the right and push this icon

208
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,070
to the right side.

209
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,670
So let's add this to the inputs.

210
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,380
So we just a class name.

211
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,790
And the input.

212
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,510
Oh.

213
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:31,750
It's going to be flex grow as soon as we do this one, you see that no, the input is covering everything.

214
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,920
And push everything other icons to the right and left.

215
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:48,530
And the other thing is, you want to do in the input section is when we focus, when we click, I don't

216
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,130
want this.

217
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,340
And black a black line.

218
00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:04,280
Instead of this, we want to add the shadow in the diff outside, so we remove this fund using, we

219
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,490
just say when we focus.

220
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,280
So we just like focus when we focus.

221
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,620
We don't want the outliers, so we just aren't lying.

222
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:16,310
No.

223
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,190
So we don't get that on.

224
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,990
So it looks a little bit better now.

225
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,260
So let's continue with this debate at a top.

226
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:38,440
So the other thing is, when we hover over it, we want to have this shadow shadow of large.

227
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:46,100
So now when we hover, we see the shadow also when we focus.

228
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,370
I want to have this shadow as well, so.

229
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:49,960
Uh.

230
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:58,640
We can achieve this easily by just staying focus within mainly focus within when we focus inside this

231
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,010
there.

232
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:06,340
We want to after this window, someone focus on within it.

233
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,560
We want the shadow to be largest for.

234
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,580
Same thing.

235
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,710
So now when we hover, you get --, shadow.

236
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,010
If we click.

237
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,110
Which is focused within which includes the input we have the shadows.

238
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,690
All right.

239
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:31,200
Let's add some margin or the.

240
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:33,740
Padding.

241
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,790
Let's add some padding to push everything inside.

242
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:43,840
So we add some padding of fire, so in the x axis, we push them to the inside.

243
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,650
And for the y axis, we just add three so that it looks much better.

244
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,750
Let's add some rounded corner.

245
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,140
We just say rounded.

246
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:02,930
Fool.

247
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,640
So we have the full rounded.

248
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:16,340
It's like a circle in this side, so you have all the fooled around it in all directions.

249
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:16,970
All right.

250
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,010
So this one looks.

251
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,120
Nice now.

252
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,650
And the other thing is just the.

253
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,290
We add we added everything.

254
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,920
Let's bring everything to the center.

255
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,140
And using item center.

256
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:40,430
We just want these icons to be in the center.

257
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:52,970
And when no, it's in the moment it's going, but when it's bigger, I don't want in the input to be

258
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:53,930
that much big.

259
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,920
All right.

260
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,880
So after the mobile size?

261
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,610
After the small size?

262
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,340
We want the Max with to be.

263
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,750
Let's say it's large.

264
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,750
So when we passed the mobile five.

265
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,450
We get this maximum size.

266
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,050
All right.

267
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,580
This is a maximum size.

268
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,900
But when the screen is large?

269
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,870
All right, Bindi, skiing is more than large, so we want the Max with.

270
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,610
To be even bigger, like two weeks lost.

271
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,430
So just pay attention to the size.

272
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:44,430
No, it's this is a small screen.

273
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,100
So we have the X large.

274
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,850
As soon as we go to the large, we get the bigger size here.

275
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:53,660
This points.

276
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:56,350
All right.

277
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,200
I think that's it for the input section.

278
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,680
That is fine.

279
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:16,440
Remember, I said I want to add the margin right later, so you see that this at this point is very

280
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,640
close to the icon.

281
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,950
It means so much a little bit.

282
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,640
At some margin right to the icon.

283
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,480
So we push this cursor to the right.

284
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,200
So let's.

285
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,740
We should change the search icon here.

286
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:44,910
The Aston Martin writes, let's say not too much, just that breathes fire.

287
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,660
Now we we have some space between.

288
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:49,650
All right.

289
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,760
So everything's fine for the input section.

290
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:59,790
Let's create a style icons.

291
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,650
These buttons, Google Search, and I'm feeling lucky.

292
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,100
So as I mentioned, we want to at the same.

293
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,530
Missiles, so we add a class name here for both of them.

294
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,420
He had a class name and name it, Peter.

295
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:17,370
All right.

296
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,480
And inside the colobus ceased globals.

297
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:29,960
That's yes, we add another layer component and we call it Peter.

298
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:34,620
Now let's stall here, and then we see the result on the right side.

299
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:40,540
So here we need to apply, as we did on the top.

300
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:52,340
The background color, we can add a custom background color is similar to the Google, which is if eight.

301
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,930
If known, if a.

302
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:05,750
So this is kind of gray, but it's different from the we cannot achieve this on using the gray colors.

303
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:13,470
So we can add a custom color like this and then we add some padding of three.

304
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:21,660
We make the buttons around it, but the medium size.

305
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,300
Let me zoom there so you can see the curve.

306
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:35,460
All right, so next week, Max, the a small.

307
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,440
And the.

308
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,100
Changed the color of the text to Gray.

309
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,050
Eight hundred.

310
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:04,260
And when we hover over them, I want to have some boring, you know, similar to what we see in the

311
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,670
real world side.

312
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:11,070
So when we hover over them, I want to have a ring.

313
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,440
For one pixel.

314
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:21,850
So you can see the link, but the ring is blue.

315
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,760
I don't want it to be Blue Origin.

316
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:35,430
The real website has a ring of gray, actually, so we can easily change its approach to hover ring

317
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,400
and we change the color to gray.

318
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,520
Two hundred.

319
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,830
Next, we have when we click on them.

320
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,910
We see they don't have any change.

321
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:58,070
But when we click, uh.

322
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,330
So, yeah, no.

323
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,240
First, remove the outline.

324
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,560
First, we remove the outline, we just see a focus

325
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,530
outline.

326
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:20,820
None.

327
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,290
But we want to add our own outline.

328
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,030
So, uh, when we when it is active.

329
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:37,900
So this one should be this when it is active, it means someone's click on it.

330
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,330
I want the ring to be gray, but a little bit darker, sort of like a.

331
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,890
Three hundred.

332
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,280
It's refresh is still getting an error.

333
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,790
Ring Ring.

334
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:56,950
Grain.

335
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,330
Outline known focus.

336
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,120
Our line is strong.

337
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:24,550
Now, when we click, we see a little bit different change inside the No.

338
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:27,500
You see the ring is a subtle gray.

339
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,220
When we click, it's a little bit darker.

340
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,860
And when we hover over them, I want to ask some shadow.

341
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,370
So let me show this a little bit.

342
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:44,360
So however, we want to add some shadow.

343
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,250
Of medium empty.

344
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,780
So now you see the shadow on the right.

345
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,570
All right.

346
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,700
So everything is fine now.

347
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,610
We just need to bring them next to each other when we have a big screen.

348
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:10,960
And also, we have some space between in order to do that.

349
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,870
It's very simple, we can put the buttons inside a beer.

350
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:21,870
So we created the we bring the both buttons inside the.

351
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,790
And here we add a Flexbox.

352
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,160
All right.

353
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,600
So they come next to each other, but Wendy, this screen is small.

354
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,840
I want them to be actually on top of each other.

355
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,810
So we just take Flex column.

356
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:48,280
But when the screen is bigger than a small, I want them to be next to each other.

357
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,570
So when it's a small.

358
00:30:51,180 --> 00:31:03,270
You can easily change the flex direction to like a column in its column you can change direction to.

359
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,580
Tomorrow.

360
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:18,680
So now, when we have a bigger size, they come next to each other and then we add some width of.

361
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:28,060
For example, one one, one a half like a one.

362
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:34,990
One half, or we can just say 50 percent doesn't matter.

363
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,110
Correct.

364
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,270
See the the bigger.

365
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,630
And then we add some space.

366
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,920
In the y direction y axis of two.

367
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:59,610
So we have some space between them and then we add a margin top of this to add some space between them

368
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,200
and the input section.

369
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,680
And when we are bigger than a small size.

370
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,230
I mean, to the window and next to each other.

371
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:19,970
So we don't want to have this piece by, so we just see a space fly off zero.

372
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,810
So they are completely next to each other.

373
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:38,180
But when the uh, it's a small we want, they have a space between and it's expense.

374
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:43,310
They have a space in x axis and it's going to be for.

375
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,770
But still, they are not center.

376
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:53,620
All right, we can easily fix that one using justify center.

377
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,400
So just to justify center.

378
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:00,820
All right.

379
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,600
It looks very nice and neat.

380
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,870
So that was it for the body section.

381
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,110
Let's add this one to the guitar.

382
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:19,040
So was just kid kids and kids come in.

383
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,810
And the message would be.

384
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:29,080
To create body search.

385
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,900
And they push it to get tough.

386
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,730
So let's check our GitHub and we review our code.

387
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:44,320
This section, I want to mention that this section is completely optional.

388
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:52,000
If you are completely understand the code, you can just skip this one and go to the next section.

389
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,750
But just for people who want to have some preview on the code, I briefly explain it.

390
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:02,320
So now we have five commands.

391
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,150
And the last one is create body fiction.

392
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,210
Let's click on it.

393
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:18,700
We can see that in the next conflict that, yes, we added the domain because we got the error for the

394
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:25,120
image tag up the next next, next next year.

395
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,410
Yes.

396
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:27,400
So.

397
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,030
And then we added a package called Hero Icons for our icons.

398
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:39,510
We've got the icon inside the index, such as search icon and a microphone icon.

399
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:48,150
In the body section, we added a forum and inside the forum we added an image, which is the Google

400
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:52,320
Image, and we just add some with high on object fit.

401
00:34:54,020 --> 00:35:02,930
After that, we added a diff, which includes our input, the input includes a search icon, microphone

402
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,000
icon and also the input itself.

403
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,130
We style it through using Tillmans to assess.

404
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,520
And finally, we added two buttons.

405
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:16,790
Well, Google search, and I'm feeling lucky.

406
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:30,730
So, uh, and also we use a custom, uh, CIUSSS or Terrence's as a styling, we call, we call it,

407
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,070
uh, Beaton and we sell it here.

408
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,180
Yeah, that was it for the body section.

409
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:41,290
It just this is just, uh, the shape of the body, the functionality.

410
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,600
It starts with the next section.

411
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:53,050
In fact, uh, if you look at the final version, uh, this is the final version actually to our website,

412
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,370
this next in the next section.

413
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:02,170
First, we complete our new page, the UI of our page.

414
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:09,580
We add the this uh, footer, and after that we're going to start the functionality like getting the

415
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:15,340
input and pass it to the Google API, get the information on and et cetera.

416
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:22,150
So in the next section, we're going to do this dynamic footer.

417
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,370
So I'm going to teach you how to.

418
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:34,590
Just keep the water always at the bottom of your pitch, so see you in the next section for the future

419
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,100
part.
