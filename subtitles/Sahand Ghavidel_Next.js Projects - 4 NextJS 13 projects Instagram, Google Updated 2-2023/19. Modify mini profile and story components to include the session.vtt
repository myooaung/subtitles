1
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.630
All right, in the last section, we have successfully imported decisions from next off and we implemented

2
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:27.480
the signing and sign out functionality in this section, we are going to fix this mini profile section

3
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.330
and also the story path and the other things we need to do before doing that.

4
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.810
Actually, I show you now.

5
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.320
Well, let's run the server.

6
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.690
I want to show you something first.

7
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.510
As you can see from the mini profile, we need the user name of the.

8
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.720
Person who have signed in, but the Google doesn't provide such a data.

9
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.010
What we do here now.

10
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.430
Let's see the console and console, we can see that.

11
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.170
We get the object that has the user.

12
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.030
That is the name, the email and image.

13
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.720
All right.

14
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:27.560
But we are not getting the username or user I.D. or other things, the things we do, just we go to

15
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.340
nix of.

16
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.650
Yes.

17
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.860
And in under two pages, we're going to add something else called callbacks.

18
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:46.250
This is special and exclusive to NICS off that is going to change the things we are getting from Google

19
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.830
or other providers like GitHub, Facebook and etc..

20
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.070
So we just need to add callbacks and it's in an object.

21
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.980
We can create an async.

22
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:14.130
Function that is going to get the session, but the session provides with three things.

23
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.190
This session gives us the session itself.

24
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:28.970
Give us a token and also the user, so we were using, if you remember we use such session that user

25
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.150
that image forgetting the image, we can get the email as well.

26
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.300
Session that user that email, but we don't have the user name yet.

27
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.030
So we are going to return.

28
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.100
Three things.

29
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.230
First, we want to add the decision.

30
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.990
Dot user.

31
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.310
That username.

32
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.760
The username is equal to sition, and the things I want to do is just the.

33
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.240
So we can see it's made a comeback.

34
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.630
Yeah.

35
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.220
The things I would like to do is just to.

36
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.000
Get the name.

37
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.250
Mick, then lower case and connect them together to create the username.

38
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.300
So here we just get the first the name.

39
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.240
We just say sition that user.

40
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:39.230
But name and after that is split it, so we split all the tanks, picks up a quote with the hand would

41
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.050
be caught with and that.

42
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.620
We split them by and space.

43
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.520
After that, we join them together, so we'd be caught with the hand altogether.

44
00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:06.090
With no air space and also at the end, we're going to make it lower case with just, say, two local.

45
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.530
Lower case, and we often sort of parentheses because it's a function.

46
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.530
So this is going to be the user name.

47
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.330
The next one is session.

48
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.390
But you said that the user I.D. We are getting the idea well.

49
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.860
The idea is inside this token.

50
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.240
So we just need to write token.

51
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:43.600
Dont stop talking that sob is the user I.D. that Google gives us.

52
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.990
I find that we are going to return to session.

53
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.690
All right.

54
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.260
No.

55
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.660
We checked our console, we should get something different.

56
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.810
So let's refresh the page.

57
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.690
Still an.

58
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.930
You know, we need to sign in again.

59
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.970
So we got to sign in.

60
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.330
This signing with Google.

61
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.440
And let's sign with the quote, it's again.

62
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.240
So now we are getting the user.

63
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.820
Which has the expires, the.

64
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.730
And the user now has more thinks.

65
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:47.990
It has the email, image and name, but it gives us the user ID and also the user name, which is good

66
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.410
with that.

67
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.290
This is just the suggestion with someone comes to the website.

68
00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.800
This is going to be their username, but actually, this is not the optimal way of doing that.

69
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:09.170
After that, we should let them to opt to actually modify their username based on their interest.

70
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.000
So this is not going to be covered in our course, but you can edit yourself.

71
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.550
This functionality, and I'm going to help you through it as well.

72
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.620
But for now, you just get the username like that.

73
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.200
But after that, maybe I update the course with this functionality as well.

74
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.030
So.

75
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:41.090
Let's close the console now we are getting the username so we can modify this mini profile as well.

76
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.910
But first, let's add this functionality if you look at the final version here.

77
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.860
When we sign out, look at first we have the means file now.

78
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.260
But when we sign out with this one, we just have one column.

79
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.400
And we cannot see the meaningful fallout anymore.

80
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.150
But this is going to change the number of columns we have in our website.

81
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:16.390
So we have to make this feed section here, feed that just this part, the main part, a little bit

82
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:22.510
dynamic because this is just covering all three columns.

83
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.750
But if you want it to be two columns.

84
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:33.220
In case we don't have the meaningful for fall or in case we don't have a session, so we are going to

85
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.640
get this session first inside the feta cheese.

86
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.250
So we just say import.

87
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.410
U.S..

88
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:45.870
From.

89
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:53.270
Mix of react and we are going to get the decision here.

90
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.970
And you already done that.

91
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:57.260
So.

92
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:10.050
We just equal data decision to change the data, me fix this and this is going to be equal to U.S..

93
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:18.040
With the practices, so we're getting a decision now.

94
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:27.710
Now, in the main part, instead of having a double code, we're going to use the back tick because

95
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.990
we can add the variable there.

96
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:37.340
So instead of this, we add the openness, curly braces and a back deck.

97
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.710
So what happens?

98
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.090
Yeah, you just this part to.

99
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:55.560
All right, now, we can add the variable we need the grid for both of them because it's going to be

100
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.040
great.

101
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:03.360
And from this side forward, we add a variable.

102
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:16.020
And we just say, if this situation existed, OK, if this person is signed in, this is the U.S.,

103
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:16.830
by the way.

104
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.120
And so if this session exists.

105
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.600
Then.

106
00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.690
So we do the same things.

107
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.290
So they've cut this one.

108
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:32.340
Put it here.

109
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.380
Because it's normal because we need the media profile.

110
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.820
But otherwise, if there's no solution.

111
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:50.680
OK, if there's no solution, we need to change the color.

112
00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.180
So I pasted again.

113
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.950
We need to make the column, too.

114
00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:03.310
And also we are going to change the max with from three six excel to three Excel.

115
00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:04.660
All right.

116
00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.200
So let's check that if it's working or not.

117
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.030
So we go to our website.

118
00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.160
No, actually, it's working already.

119
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.140
It's it.

120
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:18.250
No, it's two column and the max with is three excel.

121
00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.890
And when we sign in.

122
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.700
With any accounts, and I care.

123
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.500
Let's just do with this.

124
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:36.080
So, no, we have their come here and then everything works like before.

125
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:46.050
Now, let's change this move for a follow section, so we go to the middle of all that, yes, and.

126
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.080
We are going to.

127
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:57.760
Actually, we need to firstly bring the obsession.

128
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.440
So first, we don't forget it.

129
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.120
The import.

130
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.050
U.S..

131
00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.690
And also, we need this sign out, too, because if you look at the final version.

132
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.500
In with the final version, I show you something.

133
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:31.770
If you look at the final version in the mini profiles section, we also have a sign out button here.

134
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.380
So we need to have the sign out.

135
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:46.600
As well, so we just say sign out and we get both of them from Nick's dash off forward slash react.

136
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:55.150
And then we're going to get the session as it did before.

137
00:11:55.930 --> 00:12:00.820
So session data session from.

138
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:08.500
And certainly not from equal to use fishing.

139
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:12.850
So now we have this session.

140
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:17.470
So instead of having an aesthetic image.

141
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.380
Let's see it here.

142
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.200
Let's refresh the page.

143
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:33.520
Yeah, you can see this is not a correct image, it's a static image, so instead of this, we are going

144
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.080
to delete this and replace it with fission.

145
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.470
Fish and dart user.

146
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.110
That image.

147
00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.410
Sufficient that she is that.

148
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:59.670
It's refresh the page.

149
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:02.880
Chanatry.

150
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.130
They use a.

151
00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:17.180
Yeah, because sometimes I tell you, because sometimes we we are changing this a lot and the service

152
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:25.430
is always, uh, turning off and turning on, it may be the the the person is not signing.

153
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:27.260
So this is not available.

154
00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:32.390
So we need to protect it by adding just a question mark here.

155
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:37.040
So now you shouldn't get any era refresh the page.

156
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.260
But we are getting the correct image now.

157
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:49.110
So sometimes happens, you know, sometimes because this is just because of the development mode.

158
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:57.570
But in the production mode, when we have a stable server that is always running, we won't have any

159
00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:57.990
problem.

160
00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:03.330
Even you can remove this question mark, but this is just the in case we put it here.

161
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:12.450
And instead of this getting this code, what's ahead of heart code if we are going to get the real session

162
00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.530
that user Dutch user name?

163
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:19.680
So this is correct.

164
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.370
I mean, that is the username for this G.M..

165
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:29.670
And finally, for the button that is hard coded, sign out.

166
00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.130
We're going to create.

167
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:37.080
And click here.

168
00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:45.040
Which just implement the sign out ability.

169
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:46.900
So now.

170
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:49.610
That's fresh.

171
00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:54.590
Yeah, we have to protect this one as well.

172
00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:57.590
OK.

173
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.360
Now, refresh.

174
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:08.870
Now, if you click on sign out, we should sign out and sign in.

175
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:20.590
We can sign in, for example, with different Gmail, and we should get different username here and

176
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.310
image here as well.

177
00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.790
This this one is working perfectly.

178
00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.250
The things only need to do.

179
00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:32.740
Things we need to add is here to the image at the beginning of the.

180
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.950
This story part, so we go to a story is.

181
00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.070
In this story, as we look through all the stories, the 20.

182
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.300
First, we need to get the.

183
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.700
Session of the.

184
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:58.310
We did for the previous part, we just say use session.

185
00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:00.870
From.

186
00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.670
Next, dash off forward slash react.

187
00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:12.100
And here we can get this fish.

188
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:18.410
Just say.

189
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:20.530
Data.

190
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.860
Equal session.

191
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.590
Equals used.

192
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:36.230
Session.

193
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.650
All right, we got the session now.

194
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:48.260
We can use it inside the stories, so we have the two stories here.

195
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.540
We want it to be at the beginning.

196
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.710
So the only things we need to do is just to.

197
00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:01.110
At the loop, the loop is here.

198
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.790
Just before the map at.

199
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.480
Our session, we just say if the session existed.

200
00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.000
Then, because we don't have any luck.

201
00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:22.990
Not for the ternary we just need, we can use and double and.

202
00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:32.170
And we just say, if this doesn't exist, then make another story.

203
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.280
Component, but this time.

204
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:44.310
This time just passed this information.

205
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.190
The image would be my.

206
00:17:49.100 --> 00:18:01.100
Session Dot user dot image, which is coming from Google and our session, then we have the user name

207
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:04.940
which is equal to.

208
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:11.090
Session.

209
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:15.140
Well, I think we yeah, we just call it username.

210
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:23.780
So username is equal to sition dot user dot username.

211
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:34.280
And also, we want to know this is the user or not, because we want to add the plus sign.

212
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.760
You can see that there is a plus sign.

213
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:45.600
If I zoom here, there is a plus icon just in front of the image.

214
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:51.450
So because this one doesn't have we one know that which one is the real user?

215
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.820
So we add only to that one.

216
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:58.260
So we just need to add another one.

217
00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.880
We just say it's user.

218
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.580
And for this one is true.

219
00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:09.010
And the other ones, because they don't have it's automatically would be false, false.

220
00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.390
All right, so now we've got all this information.

221
00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:22.000
We go to a story that suggests here we are importing image and username.

222
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:26.200
And next, let's add the ease user as well.

223
00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.770
So we know that is a user or not and.

224
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:34.230
Here we just.

225
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.310
Instead of just saying the user name.

226
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.450
Actually, we are getting to use a name that is fine.

227
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.850
But for the image.

228
00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:56.920
Uh, yeah, after the image, we just want to add this plus icon and a plus icon, it's comes from the

229
00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.000
human costs.

230
00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:06.100
So at the top, we need to import the plus icon.

231
00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.420
From.

232
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:20.720
And, you know, I can't say or react post less solid.

233
00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.570
All right, now, we have the plus icon, so here we say if.

234
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:36.700
The ease user, if the person is the user, then.

235
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:44.780
If the person is user just at the plus icon.

236
00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.870
And the plus icon.

237
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.750
It should be huge now we just need to add the class name and modify it.

238
00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:57.160
Let's see.

239
00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.750
It's probably because it's.

240
00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.750
Here, let's sign in.

241
00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:05.400
Yeah.

242
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:11.010
Let me bring this one this far, so you can see it.

243
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.490
So we just make it.

244
00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:20.190
A little bit smaller, but just set the height to be six.

245
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:25.450
And we want to position this for an absolute.

246
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.370
Absolute.

247
00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:40.960
But if this one is absolute, we want it to be relative to this top div here, we just add a class name

248
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.790
and this one should be relative.

249
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.240
So now we can position this one exactly in the center.

250
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:58.780
Let's, uh, make it top four.

251
00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.630
And left for.

252
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:14.300
So if it goes exactly in the center, but the color is now black list, change it to white by using

253
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:15.350
text white.

254
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.590
All right, looks OK.

255
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:24.290
But no, you can see that the hovering effect is only the image, not the plus sign.

256
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:28.820
Let's make the hovering effect for all these things.

257
00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:35.810
So in order to do that, we can easily here at the group at the top.

258
00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:44.540
You make a group at the top there and if you send the cursor to pointer cancer, pointed to the top

259
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:45.890
instead of here.

260
00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:51.440
So we delete this cursor pointer and hover.

261
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.710
In fact.

262
00:22:55.270 --> 00:23:04.900
Instead of just hovering over the image, only we just say if this person comes on the group, anything

263
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:10.210
here do the hover even now on the user name.

264
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:12.100
We get the hover effect.

265
00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.680
That is happening for everything.

266
00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:20.480
So that's the modification we did to make it better.

267
00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:30.170
So now we have everything working very nice in the next section.

268
00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.960
We are going to start with the model parts.

269
00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:41.450
So if you look at the final version, when we click on this plus sign, we see a window opening here.

270
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:50.930
But in order to have a model, we need to have a global stage because we cannot have a state only on

271
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:56.120
the header because it's not going to affect in all the websites.

272
00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:05.450
So usually people use the redux for global states and we saved the and the state, the piece of state

273
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:06.800
inside a store.

274
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:18.950
But in our case, we're going to use another package a new package called a recoil, which is very powerful

275
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:26.450
and it's very simple to use, and it doesn't have the complex city of the redux anymore.

276
00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.680
And it's going to be a trend soon.

277
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:31.490
I believe so.

278
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:38.800
In the next section, we're going to install the recoil and test it.

279
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:47.230
And after that, we're going to create this model with using the React model package.

280
00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:52.810
First, we just push everything to the guitar.

281
00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:54.160
I put it here.

282
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.160
Can.

283
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.250
Let's stop the server and clear everything.

284
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.840
So now we use the kit and.

285
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.970
And get comments.

286
00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:16.930
It is a lot of things.

287
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:19.990
And this video was the.

288
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:25.350
And modify you, modify the.

289
00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:34.000
Mini profile and a story.

290
00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:38.300
Mr.

291
00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.090
Just say a story.

292
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:42.440
Components.

293
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:52.160
To conclude this session.

294
00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.960
Yeah, that was the things we did.

295
00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.010
And.

296
00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.880
I think we did something else as well.

297
00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:07.410
Yeah, that's yeah, we made it like a responsive as well.

298
00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:12.390
So we we push it to get half.

299
00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.160
And we check.

300
00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.020
They get how we refresh the page.

301
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.240
And we see what we have done in the fight that yes.

302
00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:35.810
We just made it responsive to the columns instead of having always three columns.

303
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:41.390
Now we have two columns and the max width of three excel when the decision existed.

304
00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.480
And.

305
00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:56.000
In the mini profile, we changed the image and the username based on the real data in the stories.

306
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:58.470
Also, we changed.

307
00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:05.510
We added another story at the top and we passed the data and.

308
00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:17.090
Inside the story that yes, we added a plus icon and also, yeah, that was the things we did here.

309
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.300
And we added is user as well.

310
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:25.320
And in next up next, our thought, yes.

311
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:36.470
We modify decision based and we got the username as well, we added the user name and the user ID to

312
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:42.260
the callback session, so we can we use already the user name?

313
00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:51.410
But in the following uh, following videos, we're going to use this user ID as well when we are using

314
00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:59.360
the Firebase for restoring our comments like numbers or other other things.

315
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:06.560
So see you in the next section for the installation of the recoil and testing it.
