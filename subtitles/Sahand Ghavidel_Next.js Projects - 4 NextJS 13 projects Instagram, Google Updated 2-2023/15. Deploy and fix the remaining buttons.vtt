WEBVTT
1
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.900
All right.

2
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.380
In the last six years, we have completed the search path.

3
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.260
We've got the images and also we added the pagination to the images tapos.

4
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.520
Well, in this section, we're going to complete our website, the places that remain like these bodies

5
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.960
at the top and also this button here.

6
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.210
I'm feeling lucky.

7
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.620
So let's start with the header section here.

8
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.090
So we go to a header that, yes, that's close everything else.

9
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.170
So we can focus on the things.

10
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.700
So we need two things that start to import.

11
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.430
We want to add external link, so we add we import.

12
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.460
A link from Knicks forward slash link.

13
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.890
And for this paragraph here.

14
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.460
Like about a store, Gmail.

15
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.720
Let's changed all this paragraph two.

16
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.560
A tax.

17
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.480
And also, let's, uh, wrap this AirTags with a link pack.

18
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.100
So just a link.

19
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.250
And we bring the attack inside.

20
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.970
Let's do the other one as well.

21
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.640
So let's finish the first one.

22
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.530
The first one the.

23
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:04.140
The aircraft for the link tag is equal to ish setpiece.

24
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.130
To forward slash about.

25
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.860
Does Google?

26
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.020
Forward slash.

27
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.770
So now when we click on about, we should go to the about page after Google.

28
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.160
Let's do the same things for this story.

29
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:41.300
So we add the link tag, we bring this a TAC insider link and we add a each riff.

30
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:51.400
And the extra for this one is for the store is this store that Google Dotcom.

31
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.250
It forward slash the.

32
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.730
So now we can test this one as well.

33
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.920
The store goes to the store.

34
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.670
As you can see, you're signing as well.

35
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.470
And finally, for the G-mail, or you need to add another link to.

36
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:30.540
We bring this attack inside, and we've changed it at a hpf and link for this one is Mail Dot, Google

37
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.370
dot com.

38
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.910
So we can and we can test it by clicking on the G-mail.

39
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.820
So this one directly goes to a tumor.

40
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.640
Let's go back to our website for the images I want to go to the images tap.

41
00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.220
So.

42
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.860
Uh, here we.

43
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.000
We had a rather too, so we import use router, so we just import.

44
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.680
Used to be used around her for going from one place to another.

45
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.080
So just from.

46
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.220
This is going to be from next for a stash route.

47
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:32.200
And we need to create a constant here, call throughout her, which is equal to use throughout her.

48
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.150
Now.

49
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.930
Instead of just wrapping this font inside this attack, he added.

50
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.660
Unclear.

51
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.270
And the oncolytic.

52
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:53.930
Is going to trigger a function which returns real to.

53
00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.910
The push and the websites we're going to push is.

54
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.540
Now inside a back take, we're going to go to the search.

55
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.860
With a term of

56
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.590
whatever term is in the link already, which is the writer that query.

57
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.900
That term.

58
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.370
And this is similar what we have before.

59
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.930
This is if the term is existed, we just say we get it.

60
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.170
Otherwise, we just search for something else.

61
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.870
For example, this search for Google.

62
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.400
All right.

63
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:42.450
And then.

64
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:50.310
After this, we went at that search type of image.

65
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.180
Equal image.

66
00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.000
Let's see what.

67
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.980
What is the error here?

68
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.620
So we push it.

69
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.540
And we have.

70
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.120
OK.

71
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.690
Uh.

72
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.910
I think this is unnecessary.

73
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.070
That's fine with when we click on images.

74
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.130
It goes so inside this search result that, yes.

75
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:56.290
Let's go to the search results, Jeff, if you remember in images result, we added a.

76
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:07.880
A question mark here, so to protect if this there is no result, we don't get an error, so we add

77
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.200
this question mark.

78
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.020
We are searching for response, actually.

79
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.890
We didn't correctly write down this.

80
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.650
A.J., yes, there Google actually is connecting to here.

81
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.910
So let's see what we have done.

82
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.600
This one should be an impasse.

83
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.410
No, uh.

84
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.060
Yeah, instead of the that's fine.

85
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.740
So we go back, we click on images.

86
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.550
Yeah, now we are going to.

87
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.860
Actually, this image is wrong, too, so I fixed this image, too.

88
00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:50.940
So we try again.

89
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:57.270
Yeah, know we went to the research Google inside the images tag.

90
00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.120
We see the images from the Google.

91
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.060
That's it.

92
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.100
So we finished with that balance.

93
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.640
Let's fix this, I'm lucky feeling lucky.

94
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.690
Now when we click on feeling lucky, nothing's happened.

95
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.070
We just refresh the page.

96
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.750
But we want to search each time a random word.

97
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:33.650
In order to do so, we can use websites, uh, if you search for, uh, just a random.

98
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.790
Or API?

99
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:48.120
There is a website I found that is very simple, we don't need any API key for this sponsor.

100
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:58.020
There's a website called a random Board that API that Farook or coapt dot com if you click on this website.

101
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:07.600
This one, uh, if you have a get request for this one, this board.

102
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.170
You're going you're going to get 10 random words.

103
00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:13.690
All right.

104
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:21.700
And if we just change this random number, the number two one, we just get one more.

105
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:28.550
So let's try this one, let's copy this one and just paste it inside the browser.

106
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:36.950
We're going to have a request to see that you're getting, uh, 10 different random boards.

107
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.400
If you change this number to one.

108
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.430
We get only one or.

109
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:44.830
OK.

110
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.940
So we're going to use this one to get the random word.

111
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.500
So inside the.

112
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.840
Index such as.

113
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.130
The place that we have the.

114
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:01.870
I'm feeling lucky button.

115
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.090
In other things, before doing this one, we cannot have a.

116
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:18.330
This sign here, we have to remove it or instead, we need to use this site.

117
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.220
So we just need to write.

118
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.740
Ampersand.

119
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:36.270
A post and the Adesanmi column, so this is similar to now we're still getting I'm feeling lucky the

120
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:42.660
same way, but if you don't do this fine, you're you're going to get an error when we are deploying

121
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.380
the website.

122
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:44.910
So our already tested.

123
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.760
So we this one be getting an error.

124
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.270
So let's continue with the things we want to do.

125
00:10:52.510 --> 00:11:02.380
So here in the inside the index that she is inside the I'm feeling lucky button and we inside this button

126
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.670
be added on Click.

127
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.460
And we at.

128
00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.380
A function.

129
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.370
We just call it random search.

130
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:26.750
We already have a search function we created for the Google search button.

131
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:31.820
Now we create another function.

132
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:38.960
But instead of getting the search term from the input, the like the one here.

133
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.090
So we added the function here.

134
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:47.120
The function is going to get the information from the search input value.

135
00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:53.560
And so do the rest, we can just copy this function.

136
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.150
Because this is very similar.

137
00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.160
Instead of saying just search, we changed this one to random search.

138
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.380
So we created the function, but.

139
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:15.560
Instead of getting the turn from the input, we're going to get it from this API.

140
00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:24.370
So first, we need to because this is a we want a Fitchett and we want it away.

141
00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.530
So we need to change this function to asynchronous.

142
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.580
All right.

143
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.320
And here.

144
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.500
The town we changed, this turned to random town.

145
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:45.580
And this is going to fetch from that API.

146
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:52.900
But we you to wait because we want to wait and fitting finish and then go to the next line.

147
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:59.170
So the fish would be from this link here.

148
00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.980
So we did copy this link.

149
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.130
We placed it inside.

150
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:13.920
Inside here.

151
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.920
And we changed the number to one because we want to just get that one number.

152
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:24.380
And after this, when the fishing is finished.

153
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:33.690
Then we we just want to change the response to adjacent time, so we just the response.

154
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:40.040
And we return a response to Jason.

155
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:46.580
So we changed the this the fishing to the Jason file.

156
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:58.440
And then we say, if the random chair not existed, if it didn't fetch the data and we don't need actually

157
00:13:58.450 --> 00:13:59.530
this trim.

158
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.170
Anymore.

159
00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.250
We return it.

160
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.500
Otherwise, we push it.

161
00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:15.600
To that random turn, and we don't need to trim it as far as it's optional, we can leave it there,

162
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.130
but it's not necessary.

163
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.720
So now with let's test it now, here we click on.

164
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.920
I'm feeling lucky.

165
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:29.970
It takes a few seconds to fetch the data and it chooses the word.

166
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.930
In random world was the clock.

167
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.750
I don't know the meaning, but.

168
00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.790
We got the result here.

169
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.820
Based on this search name.

170
00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.120
And also, if you click on again, I'm feeling like we should get another turn.

171
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.430
Redistributive.

172
00:14:52.280 --> 00:15:01.550
And we're getting instant random words and different search results, wishes, images and other things,

173
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:08.600
so they finished with the I'm feeling lucky part as well.

174
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.690
So I think everything is done.

175
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.780
No, we can do the deployment.

176
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:20.690
For the deployment, we need to go to a Web site called.

177
00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.470
Versus.

178
00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:33.980
Russell actually created next year, so it's the best choice to deploying your next year's website's

179
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:34.850
very fast.

180
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.850
And also it's free to use.

181
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.960
For the like, a normal year is not the commercial.

182
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.600
So we go to versus dot com.

183
00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.460
And we can start deploying here.

184
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.230
First, we need to log in.

185
00:15:54.190 --> 00:16:01.360
I'm going to I highly recommend you log in with your guitar because you can get all the information

186
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.350
from your guitar.

187
00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:07.630
And when we deploy our website to when we.

188
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:16.450
And the repository to get help, we can easily import our website from the GitHub and add it to the

189
00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:16.900
virtual.

190
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.300
So we let's continue.

191
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:27.860
So I quickly put my guitar, username and password.

192
00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.660
So I signing here.

193
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.400
So, no.

194
00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:52.200
If we we need to create a new project when we click on New Project, it's going to show us all our repositories,

195
00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.880
which is Google version three, which is the one that are working now.

196
00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:05.970
But we didn't actually push the last last thing that we did here.

197
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:11.140
So let's add everything now.

198
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.950
So and again and and then we

199
00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.570
committed to the message.

200
00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.690
We just fix the remaining.

201
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:40.570
Uh, so actually, I forgot something else as well.

202
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:46.950
Let me finish that one, and then we added, Uh, if we.

203
00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:54.190
If we run the server, we should notice that we always getting an error.

204
00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:00.650
Just saying that, uh, there's no secret here.

205
00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.310
This error.

206
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.470
It before this one doesn't have any.

207
00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:16.400
It doesn't make any problem when you are working in the production deployment, moral authority in development

208
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.880
mode, but into production when we are deploying.

209
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:29.270
If we don't add any secret in our website, we cannot authenticate the person inside the website.

210
00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.220
Adding secret, it's very simple, actually.

211
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.160
You just need to go to two.

212
00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.720
Here in the API.

213
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.810
So in the pages, you go to the off.

214
00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:52.570
Uh, no, no, not here, uh, inside API in off, we need to go to the next author.

215
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.370
Yeah.

216
00:18:54.850 --> 00:19:02.140
And inside this after this providers, we need to add a secret.

217
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:07.590
And the secret will be equal to process.

218
00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:13.220
Don't even be because it's an environmental variable.

219
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:24.800
We want to add and we just call it secrets and inside, let's add the comma here inside this environmental

220
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.850
variable we can.

221
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.000
At this secret, so just secret.

222
00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:36.380
And the secret can be anything, just the random words.

223
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.870
OK.

224
00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:42.950
It doesn't matter anything, you put it works, but it's going to secure your web site.

225
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:51.240
So now, if we restart our server, we should get the same result.

226
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.480
Uh oh, all right.

227
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.180
You should get assemblies are no.

228
00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:00.270
No change in our website, but in deployment, we shouldn't get any error.

229
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:06.170
So, no.

230
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:12.660
We add everything to get her so we can see it inside the vessel.

231
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:25.200
So first we get everything, we make a commitment with the message of just saying fix the remaining.

232
00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:28.070
Remain.

233
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:30.980
I mean.

234
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:33.810
Buttons.

235
00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:41.890
Plus, I'm feeling lucky one, so I'm feeling.

236
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:45.060
Lucky.

237
00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:52.140
As well as.

238
00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:55.670
As well as.

239
00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.070
The secret.

240
00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:08.620
Adding the secret.

241
00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:15.620
All right, so let's push this one ticket, and we have a quick review to our website.

242
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:21.820
Here as well, and we quickly we can deploy our website after that.

243
00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.250
So, you know, uh.

244
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:29.050
Come, it's no we have it last on is fixed the remaining buttons.

245
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:38.210
So we added quite a few things in this header that, yes, we fixed all the links and the link to the

246
00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.840
appropriate website, the related website.

247
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:52.730
And also we added the ability to go to the images when we click on images into the results that we added

248
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:56.660
just a question mark to protect our result.

249
00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:08.540
That item in of that, GSP added secrets in index that, yes, we created a function to fetch the data

250
00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.690
from this website and onboard API.

251
00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:21.500
And we just, uh, by clicking on this button inside this, uh, I'm feeling lucky when we click on

252
00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.610
IM feeling lucky.

253
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:29.300
Each time we fetch a new word and we go, we search a random term.

254
00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:35.600
So that was it for the things we did know if you go to the reversal here.

255
00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:42.110
We should see if you refresh the page, you should see that the guitar.

256
00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:44.420
Uh.

257
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:47.970
I should see a different issue.

258
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:55.690
Actually, Kim, but maybe this phone is if he imported, it should be, it should be fine, though.

259
00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.640
We need to just add environmental variables here.

260
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:03.860
It's already detected.

261
00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.630
This is in next year's website.

262
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:13.050
The environmental variables inside in that file, the first one is Google.

263
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.780
Google Client ID.

264
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:19.660
You copy it quickly and paste it here.

265
00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.050
The next one.

266
00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.290
Is the.

267
00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.300
Google Client's secret.

268
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.660
Then we have the API key.

269
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:46.690
I really quick on a copy this thanks.

270
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:50.570
Next is context key.

271
00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.540
And finally, we have this secret.

272
00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:03.920
Tier.

273
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:12.560
All right now, we added all our environmental variables.

274
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:17.540
We just we can deploy them if deployed now.

275
00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:26.710
Deployment ticks, usually 51 minutes is my experience usually takes about a minute.

276
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:35.530
You can see the building now it's the start it initializing and building the wrong time and looking

277
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:40.640
up the cash caches and everything else and the think.

278
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:46.450
The other thing is I want to do is to add our website to a custom URL as well.

279
00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:54.650
So I use it, Google domains for my dominant domains.

280
00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.480
Just the main school.

281
00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:03.370
So I go to domains that Google that.

282
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:10.490
Com And I sign in with my property, G-mail, which is this one.

283
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:16.040
We are getting an error inside the reversal.

284
00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:32.660
Said that use rather is called in function search, but that is neither a react function component nor

285
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:37.950
custom, there must start with an uppercase letter.

286
00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:47.790
Rack hooks name must start with the use use.

287
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:57.520
So let's go to search the to see what's the error here.

288
00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.450
Search that, yes.

289
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:09.890
So we have.

290
00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.910
She started off her case.

291
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.520
Well, to.

292
00:26:54.080 --> 00:27:00.820
You know, the problem is here in the search, we need to use a capital s.

293
00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:01.400
Yeah.

294
00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:12.140
So relax, functional components should have a capitalized default, can be a small because we are using

295
00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:12.930
use router.

296
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:13.910
We need to do that.

297
00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.970
So let's add this one to the.

298
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:18.630
Guitar.

299
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.210
Just the message would be.

300
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.000
Fix.

301
00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:32.840
This.

302
00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.090
Search.

303
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.220
Search.

304
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:45.040
Search.

305
00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:45.540
Yes.

306
00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.960
And we push it to get her.

307
00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:55.790
So now we can deploy again, so we go to the home page.

308
00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:05.870
And we refresh we see that now need new commitments.

309
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:07.820
Is added.

310
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.070
And also.

311
00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.320
In the deployment tab at a top.

312
00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:26.280
You can see that the deployment actually automatically started.

313
00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:29.320
Let's check it here.

314
00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.990
This fund, this fund is going actually nicely.

315
00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.930
And this fund will be fine, actually.

316
00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:39.880
Let's go to Google Domains.

317
00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:46.480
The Google domains, we choose the website we want to use as a custom domain.

318
00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:51.100
The website, I'm going to use this 100 year projects dot com.

319
00:28:53.230 --> 00:29:00.820
And I go to DNS so we can have a custom record here.

320
00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:02.310
I had a new one.

321
00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.870
I manage their customer records and here.

322
00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.230
Just add a new one.

323
00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:15.840
I call it Google version three, the type would be a.

324
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.620
And uh, here we need to write down the.

325
00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:27.790
This this number, which is that.

326
00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:33.010
IPV four, this one that you can get from your first store.

327
00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:40.920
So the already deployed actually our website, so we can test that.

328
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.710
You can see that the.

329
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.890
It should work now is search for hello.

330
00:29:52.800 --> 00:30:00.080
Now we're getting the results for Halo, the images is working to everything should work, except this

331
00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.950
authentication because we need to fix it after deployment.

332
00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.640
But let's add first a custom URL.

333
00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:12.920
So here we can go to.

334
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:16.970
Let's go to.

335
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.890
It's closed this.

336
00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:28.270
Assigning the domains here at the bottom, we can manage it here.

337
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:33.400
The custom we go to the manager, we add the.

338
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:41.360
Our the website we created is the Google version three.

339
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.590
Dots hundred.

340
00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:50.210
Genius projects dot com.

341
00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:59.000
So we can add this and this is going to quickly create the SSL certificate, et cetera.

342
00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:04.130
So now I think it should be fine now we can check the website now.

343
00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:12.080
This is our custom URL and this is our website, the contested again, but just say, searching next

344
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:12.450
year.

345
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:16.490
Yeah, it's working fine.

346
00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:19.850
Let's fix this authentication part as well.

347
00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:28.160
If we know we click on signing with Google, we should get an error inside accounts that Google does.

348
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:32.450
Just saying the redirect your L mismatch.

349
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:39.920
So we open the request details and be copied is we direct your air.

350
00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:47.540
And then we go to cloud.

351
00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:51.410
Google dot com.

352
00:31:55.750 --> 00:32:03.460
And we first we sign in with the email that it created the project that is for me, this the sand,

353
00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:04.840
that's GSA.

354
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.480
We go to console.

355
00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:16.040
And then here we click on this for.

356
00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:24.200
And we go to apps and services and finally credentials.

357
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:31.980
So now we have this one.

358
00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:43.620
Make sure to sign up to have your proper, uh, project name, which is for me, is cool Dash.

359
00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:44.850
Version three.

360
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:55.950
So and then here in off version two of two client IDs, we click here on the edit or off client.

361
00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:12.300
Here in the redirect URL, we need to add to the URL that it gives us and sign in here, we copied this

362
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:15.150
one and we pasted here.

363
00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:24.880
And also, we copy the manual and pasted inside the first you are.

364
00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:30.720
And finally, we click on Save.

365
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:42.190
Now, if you come back to our custom, you are here, sign in it, go back.

366
00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:43.360
And we try again.

367
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.390
It should work this time.

368
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:49.860
Now we can sign in with any accounts we like.

369
00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:54.750
So we have the authenticator Shen now and the person.

370
00:33:55.850 --> 00:34:03.040
The session has started and we got the image from Google so you can try it.

371
00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:04.970
I'm feeling lucky as well.

372
00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:08.970
Here we can see everything is working.

373
00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:15.990
Yeah, that was it for our project, I hope you enjoyed.

374
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:25.410
I'm going to add more actually more features to this website, like I add more taps here, like news,

375
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:29.700
we can search for videos on YouTube later.

376
00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:37.890
So I have some ideas for the developing our website, so make sure to check for the update.

377
00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:43.410
And also you can check the other projects inside the course as well.

378
00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:48.270
So I hope you enjoyed this project so soon.
