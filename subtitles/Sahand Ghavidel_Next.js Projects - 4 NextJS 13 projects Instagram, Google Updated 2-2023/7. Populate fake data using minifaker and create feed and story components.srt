1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:16,890
All right, in the last section, we have made the heinous S. Heather component is sticking to the top

2
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:24,990
of the page and also we added a shadow effect in this section, we're going to start creating our feed

3
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,710
section.

4
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:33,720
And as you can see from the final version of the project, we're going to create all these sections,

5
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:44,430
including the stories, the posts, mini profile and also the suggestions before starting with just

6
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:55,800
first, let's change the color of the fit section like this gray by just going to the index that year

7
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,680
and a top level div the one next to the return.

8
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,070
You just add the background and background color to be gray.

9
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,140
50.

10
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,100
Let's refresh the page.

11
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,030
And you can see the color yet because it doesn't have any dimension.

12
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,510
So we just say, mean hide.

13
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,480
2B, the screen size.

14
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,290
This is similar to we just say, midnight.

15
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,280
100 percent of the viewport might be used in CSIS.

16
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,260
All right.

17
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:49,610
Let's keep continue and create our feet section in the index such.

18
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:56,570
So we need to create a component called feed inside the components folder.

19
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:05,690
So we click here and we click on the this icon to create a new file and the not the name of the file

20
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,230
would be.

21
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,380
She dot J.S..

22
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,810
We can use our IFC to create the React functional component.

23
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:25,140
And, uh, we just as we are using next year, we don't need to import react from vehicles so we can

24
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:33,570
delete it or it's optional, we can leave it, there still works and inside the feed section.

25
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,370
If we have.

26
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,680
A main tank.

27
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,720
Let's change a stunted man.

28
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,970
And we have two sections one in the left and one in the right.

29
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,690
So in the fit that we just create a section.

30
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,870
And the first section includes stories.

31
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,020
And posts.

32
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,930
The second section.

33
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,870
Includes the many profile.

34
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,820
And also the suggestion part.

35
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:30,680
All right.

36
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:39,460
So let's create the stories, let's first import this one inside the index, such as here.

37
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,900
So we just say feed.

38
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:53,750
We can use control space at the end of the feed and import the feed components so we can see at the

39
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,110
top.

40
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:02,060
And also, let's create a stories component as well.

41
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,780
So the story is that, yes, and we use our sea.

42
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,270
And we can delete the.

43
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,620
Import from React.

44
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,730
Here in the story section.

45
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,550
Uh, we were going to have many stories like we have it.

46
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:35,090
We have one historic component and we're going to loop through an array of stories in order to create

47
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,780
the.

48
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:50,720
Where did these fake, uh, users with the username and the profile image, we can use a package called

49
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,820
Meaning Faker.

50
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,650
So if you search here.

51
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:05,510
On Google, we just a mini Fakir together like it should be together and in the search result, we see

52
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,830
an npm package called Mini Faker.

53
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,200
We click on this and they scroll down a little bit.

54
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:16,840
He's.

55
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:27,240
We can see that many fake or generate fake data, and also it's an alternative to a fake of the GST.

56
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:34,650
Actually, I used to use fake or touches for populating fake data, but.

57
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:44,780
Actually, it's, uh, the fake duchess owner decided to delete.

58
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,910
It's package and the package you can see it's completely empty now.

59
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:57,320
So nobody knows what happens to that person and why he decided to do that.

60
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,750
There are some stories on YouTube you can check, but it's not important.

61
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:10,760
I found it very good package called minifigure that does similar things and show you how to use it.

62
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,980
So in order to install.

63
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:15,700
Fake.

64
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:21,630
We just need to you and pan install minifigure inside our terminal.

65
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:27,340
So first, we stop the server and we the implant.

66
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,650
I mean, if Faker.

67
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,300
So you just need to import.

68
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,520
M.F.A. at a top.

69
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,480
So important, any figure from any figure and.

70
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,230
Here we create a state.

71
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:10,290
So we we just create a state with we just a story.

72
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,430
Users.

73
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,710
And since a story uses.

74
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,970
And the vehicle is to use the state.

75
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:43,140
So we are going we are using Hook to create the users, the state, and it's the initial value will

76
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:48,850
be an empty and empty array, and we need to import use this state as well.

77
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:55,470
So we just use counter space to automatically import, use this state from react.

78
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,270
So after this, we can use use effects.

79
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:14,090
To populate this information, just the time that the page is loaded, so use effect is actually is

80
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,090
from reactors, so we need to import it.

81
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:25,460
And the way it works, we just need to create a function.

82
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,870
And inside this function, we're going to create the.

83
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:39,250
This story, you users using any fakers, so we just take a hands.

84
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,350
Its story users and.

85
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,790
Magnifica has.

86
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:52,220
A function called pray that it's going to create a number of arrays that we define.

87
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,720
OK, we just need to write mini fake hair dot array.

88
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,400
And we can specify the number of array we want to create.

89
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:15,210
We want to create, for example, 20 users in stories, so we just need to arrive 20 here and we can

90
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:24,990
get the index of this each one using just saying apprentice's instead of parenthesis inside a set of

91
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,550
parentheses.

92
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,430
Just right.

93
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:27,240
All right.

94
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,650
And.

95
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:37,610
We just had an area and open a set of parenthesis and inside this function.

96
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:46,610
We are going to create an object, including the information that we want to have inside this.

97
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,120
Story, users.

98
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,920
The first information is user name.

99
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,270
You want to create and the user name will be.

100
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:03,790
We can use the user name function of minifigure yesterday M.F.A..

101
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,700
Dot username.

102
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,970
This actually, this is going to create, uh, if you check here.

103
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,050
Inside the manufacture.

104
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,110
We can just assure you the user name.

105
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,970
User, yeah, yeah.

106
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:37,750
User name, the user name can be in English or French, so we for you, which is if you want to create.

107
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:43,640
A random username, both English and French, you can just leave it like this.

108
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,250
But if you only want to make English users, you just need to specify your look.

109
00:10:51,740 --> 00:11:00,240
So we open this sort of parenthesis and inside instead of curly braces, we just write local and we

110
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,520
equal it to English.

111
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,620
But we need to import local.

112
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,850
From manufacturers.

113
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,990
So here we just import.

114
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,250
Directly, M.F.A., faker slash locals.

115
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,640
And the locals will be English.

116
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,920
Simple as that.

117
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:30,890
All right.

118
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,590
After this username, we can create.

119
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:46,700
The image part for the image we are using, we can use a website called PR Avatar.

120
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,680
So if you search PR Avatar on Google.

121
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:59,720
We begin to see a website called PR Avatar or Avatar that CC.

122
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:06,900
So we click on this and we can see that, yeah, I have a lot of avatars.

123
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,080
The fake people we can use in our web site.

124
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:23,300
There are there is a method we can get it to image by using this, uh u r l and the R if you see the

125
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,430
all the images.

126
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:31,230
There are 70 images inside this website, so by using this.

127
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:38,060
Uh, you're out and changing the number of image from from one.

128
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:46,100
Or from zero to 70, we can get the, uh, different types of image.

129
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,300
I don't know one or.

130
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,470
Yeah, yeah, from one to 70.

131
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,270
All right.

132
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,420
We just copy this.

133
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,540
You are our MVP, sit here as a back take.

134
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:11,520
Inside the back deck, because we want to make this tree valuable so we can use a dollar sign and sort

135
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,960
of curly braces to create a valuable and we can use math.

136
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,180
Dot Random.

137
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,730
To create a random number.

138
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:28,510
And we can multiply to 70 to create from zero to 70.

139
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,290
And, uh.

140
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:42,010
But this is this is not around the number we need to run this number using math.

141
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,990
Dot seal.

142
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:55,310
So this is going to be from one to 70, because, yeah, if you use math that floor, you're going to

143
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,800
create from zero to sixty nine.

144
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:04,190
But math the still makes the number from one to 70.

145
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,920
So we create let's add.

146
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,570
The comma at the end, and then next thing is just the.

147
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,470
Already, you're getting the idea here.

148
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,760
I just need to equal eye to I, so we get the ideas.

149
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:36,870
So now we created the story user inside the use effect.

150
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,480
Let's add the dependency for the users as well.

151
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,580
We just make it an empty array.

152
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:50,250
And here we sit the story users to.

153
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:52,590
This.

154
00:14:53,670 --> 00:15:00,810
Constance, no, we actually we saved our state and we can use it in our application.

155
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:09,250
Let's first console log in and see the all the users information.

156
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,450
So if you go to our website and you use NPR and Rhonda to start.

157
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,120
The server.

158
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,270
Now, if you open the console using F12.

159
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,470
That's a fresh two page.

160
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:53,320
We didn't add this story component to fit sections, so in the future, we just need to add this story

161
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,030
to hear.

162
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:06,420
And we just need to use counter space to import it now when we refresh the page, we can see inside

163
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,290
the console.

164
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,040
We have.

165
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,270
Let's bring it up a little bit.

166
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:23,170
Yeah, now we have an array of 20 users, so it starts from zero to 19.

167
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,550
And each of them have an I.D. image.

168
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,550
I don't know what it was.

169
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,390
None.

170
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,810
So probably we made some mistake here.

171
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,390
Let's check own math to see.

172
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,880
After a random.

173
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,380
Let's change this year to floor.

174
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,900
Still, none should be.

175
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,520
Some.

176
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:14,630
Yeah.

177
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,380
Yeah.

178
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,840
We forgot to add apprentices here.

179
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:23,930
So because the random is the function, so we need to add apprentices at the end.

180
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:34,710
So if you check now we have the I.D. and image with a random image number and the username.

181
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,270
The the problem is the username is capitalized.

182
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,680
So let's add, uh, two lowercase.

183
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,370
Function at the end of the.

184
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:54,490
Use a name to make it lower case now in the new era.

185
00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:04,180
We are getting all the users lowercase because an Instagram official, the user's names are in lowercase.

186
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,780
All right, so we got all the information.

187
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:13,710
Let's look through this array and show it inside there.

188
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,850
A story component.

189
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:24,910
So inside the witness section, we loop through the story users.

190
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,140
By using Map.

191
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:36,010
We get each user here and.

192
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,570
We just directly return it.

193
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,780
And we create a story.

194
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,560
Component here.

195
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:58,700
So we just see a story that, yes, and we use honesty to create the functional component.

196
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,910
And we imported inside this story section.

197
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,580
So we just saw a story.

198
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,760
The EU's counter space to import the story component.

199
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:22,110
And we need to pass these three information, so first, we need a key.

200
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:29,430
We just say user I.D. for the keys, so we don't get an error inside the console.

201
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:37,710
Next, we need to pass the user information, for example, the user name would be.

202
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,980
User dot username.

203
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,460
Then we have image.

204
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,030
Which is user that I am.

205
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,450
And inside.

206
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,260
And inside this story.

207
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:10,900
We can distract it and the kid I am, she and user name.

208
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,990
This is a props, so destructive props.

209
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:23,950
Are we getting it like this, so let's close this console and see the images first.

210
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:30,160
The image ASIC is set to be I am G.

211
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:39,890
The alternative is just a username, and we have a paragraph of.

212
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,750
Use of name.

213
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,970
All right, now, we're getting the images and also the username at the bottom.

214
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:59,520
And each time you refresh the page, we should get a new image and different user name because it randomly

215
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,580
creates each time using use a fixed.

216
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:11,610
So, yeah, that was it for this part in the next section, we're going to style this story section

217
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:22,110
and make this beautiful story section inside our website using Telvin CSF before finishing the prayer.

218
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,680
This video let's add everything to the get

219
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:37,770
created comments, using an image, using a message of saying.

220
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,210
Uh.

221
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:47,940
We just populate fake data using.

222
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,950
M.F.A..

223
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,490
And.

224
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:01,400
Map two at.

225
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:08,880
And.

226
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,150
A story.

227
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,520
Components.

228
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,990
Let me just, uh.

229
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:48,730
Yeah, just sick, populate fake data using minifigure and create feet and story components that could

230
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,370
be better components.

231
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,420
All right.

232
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,120
Use, get push.

233
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,530
To push everything inside the.

234
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:07,470
Get you refresh the page inside, get how we see a new comet.

235
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:15,300
So we did a lot actually inside this video inside this section, so we create the feed that.

236
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,080
Yes.

237
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:27,090
And the added all the sections and we created the stories that GST imported minifigure and we create

238
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:34,950
an estate and use effects to create and populate the dataset using minifigure array.

239
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,570
And also we map through it.

240
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:50,930
And we passed the information through the props inside a story that you use and the packages we installed

241
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,060
was M.F.A..

242
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:03,310
Inside the index that we just added the color, background color, and we set the mean height to be

243
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,660
this great size.

244
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,010
All right.

245
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:12,040
In the next section, we're going to create and style this string section.

246
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,080
So see you in the next section.
