1
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.200
All right.

2
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:16.770
In the last section, we have created some data inside the post that, yes, and we look through it

3
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.390
inside the post, such as by using map and we create another.

4
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:35.130
A component called post-purchase, and we just showed the user name of the, uh, each dummy data.

5
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.800
In this section, we are going to create the header.

6
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.380
Section of the.

7
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.410
Let me increase the science in the header section of the post.

8
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.800
If you zoom a little bit here.

9
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.330
We can see that we have.

10
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.640
Inside this one, we have.

11
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.430
We changed the color.

12
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.080
Now we have the header section, which has three parts.

13
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.390
The first one is the profile image.

14
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.600
Then we have the user username.

15
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.130
And after a space, we have an icon here.

16
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.730
So let's go back to the.

17
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.960
Please, we have the post such as.

18
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.820
So here we delete the user name.

19
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:54.020
Let's do NPR and Ron there to see it real time, so we delete the user name.

20
00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:04.480
And inside this death, we create a section called header.

21
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.650
Or just say, posted a.

22
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.610
And here would be.

23
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.880
And, uh, it did an empty of.

24
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.610
And inside this, we have an image tag, which this source is.

25
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.620
User image.

26
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.770
Let's refresh the page and see the changes.

27
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.400
This is the user image.

28
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.720
It came the all it will be, you just say username.

29
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.060
And then after the death, we have.

30
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.570
We have a paragraph.

31
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.450
Here we have a paragraph.

32
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:18.870
Just saying we just want to use the name, so we just say user name.

33
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.970
We should see it here in the center.

34
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:32.420
And after the paragraph, we have the there are costs you're going to use the euro I cost.

35
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.650
The name of the hero icon, are you going to use is just a dots.

36
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:52.060
Yeah, that's Horizon icon, I think this is the one from the from the I outline.

37
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.190
And just to be added here.

38
00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.290
Don?

39
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.390
That's Horizon icon.

40
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.340
Now we should see the three dots as well.

41
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.010
Yeah, here it's a huge.

42
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.900
That's the style everything.

43
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.730
First, we decreased the size of the image we have here.

44
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.510
So inside the image tag, you had a class name.

45
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.380
We just changed the height to be 12.

46
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.310
And we just make it round it by saying rounded, Oh.

47
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:48.120
And let's make let's make it keep the aspect ratio in case someone have a different size of the image,

48
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.950
we just see object cover.

49
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.390
Maybe you don't see any change here, because this this image is square.

50
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:09.580
And then we have this and the border, just one pixels and the some one big and padding.

51
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.150
This is four pixels, paddy, you can see.

52
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.660
Let me zoom a little bit here.

53
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.810
You can see the paddy.

54
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.980
And let's add some.

55
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:31.110
Yeah, just add some marching right off trick, so all right.

56
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.250
And the paragraph, let's start a paragraph.

57
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.750
I mean, the username.

58
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.640
So we had a class name here.

59
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:53.810
And the paragraph style would be a first we make it bold with just a font bold.

60
00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.920
And, uh, that's it for for it now.

61
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.090
Just leave it there.

62
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.410
That's a style the.

63
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.460
The dots icon.

64
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.230
The thoughts I can't just have the height of five.

65
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.160
All right, now, everything is a small and nice.

66
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:29.090
Let's make bring them next to each other by just changing the class name of the top level to flags.

67
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:42.690
And we use Item Center to bring them to the center horizontally, so vertically, if you can see now

68
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.480
that that is upper than this one, we just see item center.

69
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.130
Let's see the change.

70
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:58.420
And no, this one in the center and we want this, want these thoughts to be here.

71
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.930
So the things we do.

72
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.990
Let's add some padding first.

73
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:16.100
So we push everything aside and we want to bring this wanted and we just need to change the flex of

74
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.010
this user name to Flex one.

75
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.940
Want a flex?

76
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.800
One means it.

77
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:33.980
It's like this one actually occupies all the air space and push this icon to the right side.

78
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.620
So every time you want something.

79
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.390
And covers everything we just use Flex one.

80
00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:49.800
So the let's change the background color of the post.

81
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:52.220
To be.

82
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.630
At first, we need to add a class thing.

83
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.500
Let's change the background color to be a white.

84
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:10.480
And let's add some marching to the y axis.

85
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.770
Of seven.

86
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.270
So they get a little bit of space from each other.

87
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:24.650
We add some border want pics so we can see now.

88
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:33.890
And we just make it round it by using Rounded.

89
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:45.760
Media and we cannot see the round one now, but when we we have a smaller size like the final version,

90
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.380
here you can see the rounded corner.

91
00:08:55.050 --> 00:09:02.610
Before finishing this section, because this is a short video, let's add this image as well so we can

92
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.900
keep continue for.

93
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.440
And then in the next section, we create these buttons.

94
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:22.070
So inside post such as after this, we create the post header, we create another section called we

95
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.650
just say post image.

96
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.770
And this is just an armed attack image tag.

97
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:35.570
And the source would be this time I am G.

98
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.360
This is the image you are getting from here.

99
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:45.810
This comes from the Post's, which is posted by Empty.

100
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.410
So now we can see the images.

101
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:55.820
Everything looks fine, but uh, we just add some class.

102
00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:02.810
In case someone put a different size, that size, you just say object.

103
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:06.260
Cover.

104
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.700
And the worth will be for.

105
00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:20.970
We don't see any change, but now if we decrease the size, this is actually taking all this space,

106
00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:30.130
but later, when we are creating the right side of the feet section, we're going to make it responsive

107
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.360
and make it a smaller.

108
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:36.560
So just for now, leave it like this, but it's going to be very easy.

109
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.470
We going to make this fun possible using Flex.

110
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:49.040
Yeah, that was it for the this section, let's just add everything to the guitar.

111
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.770
Using kit at all.

112
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.010
And just to get comment and the message would be.

113
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:12.400
Uh, create the header and image sections of.

114
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.430
The Post's components.

115
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:20.490
All right.

116
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:26.250
Learn if you use get push to push everything to get up.

117
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.970
And let's check by refreshing the page.

118
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.270
Just now we had it.

119
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.610
I did a new commit.

120
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:44.130
So we imported the Dutch horizon icon from here, I can't.

121
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:50.000
And we just made the post header section.

122
00:11:51.310 --> 00:12:01.960
By adding that image, the username and the horizon icon, and we make them made them flex and.

123
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:12.870
Bring them next to each other and you'll be used at Flex one to push the user name and just to make

124
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:17.520
it like a larger to occupy all the space.

125
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:25.230
Then we added the image section, which has the classes of object cover and with full.

126
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:34.440
In the next section, we're going to create this past the bottom part, so see you in the next section.
