1
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:07,490
All right.

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,610
We'll come back.

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:16,400
In this section, we're going to install next year 13, and we're going to have the first template.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,270
I have put the final version here for our reference.

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:27,110
You can visit this on Google dot hundred JS projects dot com.

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,520
As you can see, we have a whole page similar to Google.com with the header.

7
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:39,460
We have the search box with the I am lucky button as well.

8
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:46,030
And also we have a footer here which shows the location of our country.

9
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,700
And we can search here, for example.

10
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,540
I can search next JJ's.

11
00:00:53,610 --> 00:01:00,180
Which is going to redirect us to another page, we can see a loading effect first.

12
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,300
And first we see the result for the web.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,380
And also here we have the pagination.

14
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,850
So when we click on next, we go to the next page.

15
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:18,580
And also we have the ability to see the images for this search term.

16
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,810
We have the loading effect is specifically for the image.

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,700
And also we have pagination here as well.

18
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:34,840
The other things we can do in the home page, we have the I'm feeling lucky button, which is going

19
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,760
to fetch.

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:46,190
A random word and it is going to show us the result related to that random vocabulary.

21
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:52,460
So we're going to start by installing the next year 13.

22
00:01:52,490 --> 00:02:02,360
So if we go to Google, so we have Google, but I'm going to search here in the real Google next J's

23
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,500
13.

24
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:13,070
In the search results, we see that we have a website with the URL better dot next year dot org.

25
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:20,390
This is the documentation related to the Nexus 13 because it is in the beta version.

26
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,540
They have their special URL for that.

27
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,160
So we click on that.

28
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,120
We're going to.

29
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,640
Their documentation, as you can see here.

30
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,560
Let me zoom this a little bit.

31
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,240
So as you can see, the next day's documentation is divided into two sides.

32
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,510
The first one is the beta one, and the other one is this table.

33
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:49,200
So the next year's version that we are going to work on is the beta version.

34
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,930
So we're going to work on this version.

35
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,740
And here on the left side, we click on installation, So we go to the installation part.

36
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,760
For the system requirement.

37
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:11,470
We need to have Node.js version 16.8 for later in order to be able to install next DJs.

38
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,030
So I'm going to open the common prompt.

39
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,630
This is the terminal I use.

40
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,540
You can use any terminal you prefer.

41
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:29,190
And here we can just write down Node dash V to check the version of the node JS that we have.

42
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,520
We have the version in my computer.

43
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:40,620
I have the version 18.13, which is enough because 16.8 is enough.

44
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,470
If you don't have that version, you can simply search Node.js on Google.

45
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:52,830
And here just in the search result, go to next year dot org.

46
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,490
Here.

47
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:05,660
You can download the latest version, which is the long term stable one version 18.14.

48
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:11,000
So this is the version I recommend you to install.

49
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:20,840
And this is the beta version which is not stable yet, so just install this version once you install

50
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,320
it.

51
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:27,710
Come back to the documentation and here you can see the automatic installation.

52
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:38,780
So to automatically create a new Nexus project using the app directory, we can use this command inside

53
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,770
the terminal.

54
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:48,560
So we can copy this one, which is include the NPCs utility Create next app app add.

55
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,640
Latest dash dash experimental app.

56
00:04:52,850 --> 00:05:02,670
This experimental app is going to add the app directory for us and also some some codes inside the next

57
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,030
step config file.

58
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,810
So I'm going to copy this.

59
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,810
And I go back to the terminal.

60
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:19,120
I go to inside my desktop and I want to go inside a folder called Force.

61
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,010
You can create it anywhere.

62
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,770
So I want to create it inside a folder called course.

63
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,740
I'm going to paste the code.

64
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:33,280
You can press enter, and this is going to ask you the name of the project.

65
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,430
So I'm going to call this, for example, Google.

66
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,740
Clone next.

67
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,000
Uh, next year's version.

68
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,700
I just say next year's 13.

69
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,040
So I'm going to.

70
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,500
Uh, press enter.

71
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,330
This is going to ask more questions.

72
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,460
The first question is.

73
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,190
Would you like to use TypeScript with this project?

74
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,290
So I don't want to use TypeScript, but if you want to use Cypress Grove, you need to say yes, I'm

75
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:19,630
going to say no for this one and asking me to install SE link, which is going to help us for the.

76
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:31,400
Some suggestion about the vocabularies and the RA it suggests use some coding correction for you.

77
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,040
So I'm going to have this in my project.

78
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:42,880
And also the next question is would you like to use CRC directory with this project?

79
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:50,770
So I'm going to say yes, this is going to create an extra folder called CRC and the app directory would

80
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,690
be inside this folder.

81
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:59,000
And also what import alias would you like to.

82
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,560
Would you like configure?

83
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:08,540
So this is going to have an alias for example this add sign over slash the star.

84
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,080
The ad sign for Slash is going to be the root of your projects.

85
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:20,770
And for example, if you want to go to the components folder, you just write down add forward slash

86
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:26,020
component for Slash, for example, the name of the component I'm going to show you later inside the

87
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,120
project, but you can just choose this one for the alias.

88
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,340
So now the selection process is started.

89
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:46,010
This is going to install packages like React React next, next font, SW link and SW link config next.

90
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,600
I'm going to stop the video.

91
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,810
I'll be back when the installation is completed.

92
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,250
All right.

93
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,280
So the installation process is completed.

94
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:02,660
Now we can just go inside the folder that we have created, which is in my case is Google Chrome next

95
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,680
year 13.

96
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:10,250
So I'm going to write this one after this CD, CD Dash clone.

97
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:19,820
So you can just press tab to get the suggestion and then we press enter to go inside the folder.

98
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:31,070
And here we can use code dash dot to open the Visual Studio code with the this folder to be open as

99
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,250
the default folder of the VTS code.

100
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,670
So I'm going to press enter.

101
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,070
This is going to open the Visual Studio code.

102
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,810
But I'm going to use Visual Studio Code.

103
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:45,910
But you are free to use any text editor you are familiar with.

104
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:52,360
So we wait for the installation and initialization of the Visual Studio Code.

105
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,160
I'm going to show you the folders that is created for us.

106
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,270
So let me zoom this a little bit.

107
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:08,230
So inside the left side you can see we have this folder is for the installation, like a node modules.

108
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,600
We don't need this folder to check.

109
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,720
The next one is the public folder.

110
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:22,970
The public folder contains the assets that the user can have access to inside the browser.

111
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,320
For example, the fabric on the images and etc..

112
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,030
Then you have the C folder that is created for us.

113
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,800
This folder is included includes the app and the pages folder.

114
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:47,510
The pages folder is actually for the next year's version 12, but still you can use it.

115
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,060
And also it still works for you.

116
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,300
But the new version.

117
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,480
Next is 13.

118
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,940
It uses the app directory.

119
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,790
It's kind of simpler and more neat to use.

120
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:08,890
And also, if you want to have API, you still can use this folder.

121
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,810
We're not going to use this folder.

122
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,150
I'm going to delete this folder for now.

123
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,560
So you can delete it.

124
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:22,460
But inside the app folder, inside the CRC, we have few files.

125
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,480
First file is the global.

126
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:34,570
This is the global styling of our projects, which is going to be replaced by the styling of tailwind

127
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,060
CSS.

128
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,210
So we're not going to use CSS in our project.

129
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,050
So I'm going to teach you how to deal with this one.

130
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,900
So I'm going to completely delete everything inside this globals that CSS.

131
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,530
So another folder is page that modulus CSS.

132
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,550
This is still when you want to use CSS in your project.

133
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,990
You use this kind of files, but we are not using we are not using CSS.

134
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,890
We are going to use tailwind CSS.

135
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,940
So I'm going to delete this file as well.

136
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,450
So I'm going to click on it, press delete.

137
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,200
Then we have three more files.

138
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,910
Page, that is.

139
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,530
Which is let me decrease the size.

140
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,070
Page that is is the home page.

141
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:31,230
So this is going to contain everything that we see in the forward slash box of our website, the home

142
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:31,770
page.

143
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,260
Everything here is going to be there.

144
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:35,550
Well.

145
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:42,270
So this is having the initial template of the next year that is created for us.

146
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,040
We don't need any of them.

147
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:55,320
We can just completely delete it and we can use RFC to create a React functional component and we can

148
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,510
just change this font to form.

149
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:06,270
If you cannot see the RFC working for you, probably you haven't installed the extension for the RFC.

150
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,230
I'm going to show you which extension are used.

151
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:16,020
You can use contour shift X to open the extension part.

152
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,790
So let me briefly show you which extension are used so you can get the idea.

153
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:31,120
And if you need this, these extensions, you can simply search the name of the extensions here and

154
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:36,010
press install to install these extensions.

155
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:45,700
The first extension I use is auto rename tag, which is going to change the closing tag name based on

156
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,010
the opening tag.

157
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,450
So automatically change the tags name for us.

158
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:59,300
Then we have the code, a spill checker, which is going to check the spelling mistakes in our code

159
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,180
and suggest correct spelling.

160
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:09,060
The dark low contrast team is the team of that I'm using for my VTS code.

161
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,120
It's optional for you.

162
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,330
You can install it or you can just keep your own thing.

163
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:23,200
The next one is is seven React redux React Native snippets, which is going to suggest us that for example,

164
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:34,300
RFC four the React functional component are some other useful shortcuts for us to easily create a components.

165
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,010
The next one is GitHub copilot.

166
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:49,940
This is created based on the Git GPT three and this is going to suggest use some codes and some.

167
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:56,930
For example, when you are typing something or for example you are here, this co-pilot always suggests

168
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,040
you something.

169
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,820
For example, let me show you here something.

170
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:06,920
As you can see, it's just suggested me dev home, for example.

171
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,500
So this is suggested by GitHub copilot.

172
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,300
So I'm going to use this one.

173
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,250
This is not a free extension.

174
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,630
You need to pay $10 per month for this extension.

175
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,770
But if you are if you are a student, you can get this one for free.

176
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:31,960
So I'm using it because it makes the coding much faster.

177
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:37,760
So I use this GitHub pilot for my everyday coding.

178
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,910
The next one is inline fold.

179
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:49,550
This one we use, especially when you are using Tailwind CSS, we, we write down many classes in our

180
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,380
code.

181
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:58,340
For example, we write down classes related to colors and hover effects and etc. and this is going to

182
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,930
mess up the code.

183
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,870
This extension is going to close the classes by three dots.

184
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:11,690
So we're going to see the effects of this one in the next section when we install tailwind CSS.

185
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:19,040
But for now, if you need this, you can install this extension that which is going to help you to have

186
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,060
a clean code.

187
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:29,700
The next one is live server, which is going to create a server when you are creating an HTML, CSS

188
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,200
and JavaScript projects.

189
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:37,950
But for the next years, because next year's is creating the server for us, we don't need this extension.

190
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,710
The next one is prettier, which is useful when you are saving your code.

191
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:53,770
This is going to automatically format the code so it makes your code clean and easy to read.

192
00:15:53,950 --> 00:16:00,850
And the last one is 12 CSS IntelliSense, which is a very useful when you are using Telmex, CSS.

193
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:07,390
This is going to suggest you many classes based on your typing.

194
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:13,690
For example, if you want to create a text to read color, you just write down text.

195
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:19,410
And this is going to suggest you all the colors available and this is very useful.

196
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:24,220
I highly recommend you write to you install Tailwind, CSS, IntelliSense.

197
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:24,910
All right.

198
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,060
That was it for the extension part.

199
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,130
So let's come back to the code.

200
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,570
You go back to the Explorer section using contour shift E.

201
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:44,480
So the page that is that we have created, I would like to the extension to be jsx x, so I'm going

202
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,660
to rename this one actually hs x.

203
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,210
This is exactly the same.

204
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,080
But the.

205
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,540
Uh, this is my preference.

206
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,990
I want to have JSS X as an extension.

207
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:06,870
And then we have layered the cheese, which is the we use when we have a different pages in next year's

208
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,680
this layer, the cheese is going to help us to have some layers.

209
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:18,010
For example, if you have a common header or footer in your website, you can have this layout that

210
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:27,790
cheese, so you can have the children, which is the this page and you can add the head and other things

211
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,360
here.

212
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,250
Let me change this one to JSX.

213
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:35,200
I'm going to explain this layout in the header section more so just for now.

214
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:42,010
We know that this is for creating layout and this is only an exclusive for next year's 13.

215
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:50,530
Then we have the head JS, which is going to have our title metadata and the link tags, and this is

216
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:56,220
going to cover all the pages that is under this folder.

217
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,000
For example, we have a page.

218
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:08,430
And inside F if you have another folder called for example post, this hit is going to cover that page

219
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:08,730
too.

220
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:15,900
So I'm going to explain you later when we have different pages, how we can have different headers and

221
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,010
meta description.

222
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:23,880
This is very useful for SEO and you, you don't have this ability inside react.

223
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,980
JS But in next year you can have it SEO friendly website.

224
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,700
So here I'm going to change the title to.

225
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,520
Google.

226
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,440
Cologne.

227
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,190
Next.

228
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,690
GS 13 and then.

229
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,570
Did this description.

230
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,600
This is the first metadata tech is going to set the width of the.

231
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,620
A browser to devices with.

232
00:18:53,620 --> 00:19:00,670
For example, if you have a mobile screen, the width of the screen is going to be a smaller than when

233
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:04,370
you are using the bigger screen like desktop or tablet size.

234
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:11,140
And the initial scale is the initial zoom level of the browser, which is set to be 100%.

235
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,520
Then we have the metadata tag related to description.

236
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,090
So I'm going to create the description for this file.

237
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:25,780
For example, I say Google clone created by.

238
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,930
Next.

239
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,930
Case 13.

240
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:42,000
So and then we have the salon, which is going to see inside the browser in order to see our website

241
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,560
inside the browser.

242
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:48,540
First, let me change the name of this file to hit that gs6.

243
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:56,190
Then in order to see this one inside the browser, we can open the terminal using contra bektic.

244
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,220
Or you can go to I think for you.

245
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,130
And open the terminal here.

246
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,000
As you can see, I have used contour practic.

247
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:19,310
Then here we can just write down NPN run diff to start a server and see our website.

248
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:24,530
So this is created a server on port 3000.

249
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:30,020
And the URL is local host clone 3000.

250
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:36,500
As you can see, we have a warning saying that you have enabled experimental features app directory

251
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,840
in next that config that DJs.

252
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:47,820
First they thank us for testing that and ask us to please leave our feedback at this URL.

253
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,430
If you see any mistakes or any suggestion you can give the feedback to.

254
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,740
Virtual team that you created.

255
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,200
The next day is framework.

256
00:20:59,590 --> 00:20:59,890
All right.

257
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:00,610
So.

258
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:08,200
And actually, they warn us that in the experimental features, there may be some unexpected or broken

259
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,740
application behavior.

260
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:17,230
So actually, there is one mistake in the next year 13, I'm going to tell you later when we deploy

261
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:17,380
it.

262
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,330
And there is a solution for that on the Internet.

263
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,590
I'm going to show you that.

264
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,990
Don't worry about that.

265
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,300
So everything is going to work finally for us in the app directory version.

266
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:36,590
So now we can just keep the control and click on the localhost 3000 to open it inside the browser.

267
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,950
My default browser is chrome.

268
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:46,100
As you can see, only we have all here, which is the page that gsx.

269
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,750
And let me zoom it.

270
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:54,200
You can see the all and we have a title Google clone next year 13.

271
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:03,460
And if you open this extension, which is a quick source viewer extension in in the crawl, we can see

272
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,330
that we have a metadata tag.

273
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:13,240
Description tag saying Google clone created by next year 30.

274
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,290
So.

275
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,030
This is completely seal friendly.

276
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,040
So that's it for installing the next year's 13.

277
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,840
And the other things we need to do before going to the next section.

278
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:36,090
I want to create a GitHub repository for response because we need to have GitHub when we want to deploy

279
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,800
this website to Versal.

280
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:42,120
So this is going to help us simply deploy our website.

281
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,100
So I'm going to show you how to do it and it is completely free.

282
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,380
So we go back to our website.

283
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:57,150
I'm going to stop the server using Control C and press Y here, let me clean it using CLS.

284
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,820
As sorry.

285
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,780
Clear.

286
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,640
So now we're going to create a GitHub repository for this.

287
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:13,050
The first things first, we need to just write down Git in it.

288
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,270
And then this is only this.

289
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,380
You can see it better.

290
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,330
So I'm going to create a write down.

291
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,010
Get in it, press enter.

292
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:31,390
This is going to initialize a GitHub repository and then we're going to add everything to GitHub using

293
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:35,410
git add dot, which means get add all.

294
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,930
After that.

295
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,230
They're going to have kids commit.

296
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,990
And let me clear this and you can see it there.

297
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,200
So we're going to have kids commit.

298
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,250
And we can add a message to it and we just say install.

299
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,690
Next case and create.

300
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:06,550
The first template.

301
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,940
So now.

302
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,120
Let me clear this again.

303
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,930
Now we need to create the GitHub page.

304
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,150
So we need to go to GitHub.com.

305
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:28,750
So we're going to go to GitHub, we're going to search GitHub on Google and we go to GitHub dot com.

306
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:36,240
And here you need to sign in with your GitHub account or create an account.

307
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,850
I already signed in with my account here.

308
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:47,170
And here we click on this plus icon at a top and we click on new repository.

309
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,430
Here we can create the name of our repository.

310
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:59,220
For example, I just call it Google Clone next.

311
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,190
JS 13.

312
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:16,230
And the description is going to be Google Cloud using next JS 13 and tailwind CSS.

313
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:24,280
You can keep it public so everybody can see your GitHub, see your progress.

314
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:31,840
For example, I keep it public so you can go to this URL which is GitHub.com forward slash provider,

315
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,570
slash Google clone.

316
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,440
That's next year 13.

317
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,920
And you can check the codes that we are working on.

318
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:45,520
Or you can keep it private so nobody can see your repository.

319
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,920
It's it's totally up to you and you just can come down and click on.

320
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,980
Create repository.

321
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:01,720
So this is going to give us some instruction how to create a repository.

322
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,900
We have created the first part.

323
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:08,380
For example, we have initialize it added created a comment.

324
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:14,530
We go to the next part, which is creating a remote and add the origin and this URL.

325
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,130
We are going to copy this.

326
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:20,640
Go back to Visual Studio Code and paste this one.

327
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:29,760
And then the next line is creating a branch in the main directory.

328
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,420
So I'm going to paste this one as well.

329
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:38,000
And then the next one is going to push this one to the origin may.

330
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:46,730
So now, after pressing enter, this is going to upload our codes to the GitHub page.

331
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:55,850
And now if we refresh this page, we're going to see that all the code is uploaded to GitHub repository.

332
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,380
And now.

333
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,880
Now we have.

334
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,410
Two commits here.

335
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:11,470
And if you click here, we can see that the first commit is automatically created by Create Next app

336
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:18,070
20 minutes ago, but the last one is created by us.

337
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:23,900
Which is installed next year and create the first template.

338
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:31,970
If you click on it, we can see the codes that we have created or changed inside the GitHub repository.

339
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,010
So this is very useful.

340
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:38,300
When you create a section, we create a commit.

341
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:45,050
You can come here to the GitHub repository and check what you have done and review the code.

342
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:52,850
I'm going to I'm going to explain the code one more time, always after each section in the GitHub repository

343
00:27:52,850 --> 00:28:00,020
briefly so you can have a some overview and bigger image of the code.

344
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:07,360
So as you can see, we have deleted everything inside the globals that CSS.

345
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,570
I'm going to close this.

346
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,670
The next section.

347
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,780
We have changed the name of the DJs to hit the DJs.

348
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:24,390
And also we have changed the title and the meta description here.

349
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,140
Now close this one.

350
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,560
The next section you have created.

351
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,980
We have changed the name of the layouts to layouts.

352
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,940
Then also we have deleted.

353
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,040
I'm sorry.

354
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,790
We have changed this file.

355
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:50,930
Page that changes to page G6, and we have deleted everything inside this file, and we replace it with

356
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,210
just a div saying how.

357
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:59,710
Then we have deleted the file called page that module CSS.

358
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:05,900
We have deleted this complete folder pages folder inside the CRC.

359
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,420
So that was it.

360
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:16,940
That was it for creating and installing the Nexus 13 and create the first template of our project.

361
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:26,600
In the next section we're going to install Tailwind CSS and start installing our project using Tailwind

362
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,560
CSS.

363
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,390
So see you in the next section.
