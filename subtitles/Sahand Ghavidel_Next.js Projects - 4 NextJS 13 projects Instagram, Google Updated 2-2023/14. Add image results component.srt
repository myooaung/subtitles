1
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:15,650
All right, in the last section, we have completed the presentation of the page for the results section.

2
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,720
In this section, we're going to complete the image images, just tap.

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,990
When we click now on the Images tab, we see the result for the images, but actually in the form of

4
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,360
the video results.

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,830
We wanted them to be like the final version that we have created here.

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:45,220
We want to have like a grid showing the preview of the image with the URL at the bottom.

7
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:51,070
And when we click on, then it goes to the related page.

8
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,930
And also, we have the pagination at the bottom as well.

9
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:07,410
So first thing we need to do is to change our mark because our mark now is based on the web search results.

10
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:18,880
Now where we are in this search for the Telvin CSIS with the images, let's copy this object from the

11
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,910
console using.

12
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:29,620
We open this console using F12 and we have the object that has the items related to the images.

13
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:40,800
You can see it's all images, so we copy this object and we go to Visual Studio Code.

14
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,550
We go to the response.

15
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,080
Dutchy is here.

16
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:56,830
And after the export default, we choose everything, we select everything, and we delete them instead,

17
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,450
paste the new.

18
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,030
Objects.

19
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,130
And inside the search statue, yes.

20
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:14,890
We've changed the mark data from first to true, so we have the data for the image now.

21
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:25,020
And we can start styling without exhausting our API requests.

22
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:31,860
Now, in both in all and images, we get the images data.

23
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:42,280
So let's go to Visual Studio code, and we create a new component.

24
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,730
And we call this.

25
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:59,940
Image results, Duchess, and we use the RF C for React functional components.

26
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,720
And let's add this one at the end of the.

27
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,510
Results section.

28
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:18,900
Actually, at the end of the search, that is if you remember in search that, yes, we had the header.

29
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:25,730
Then we created the search results, and this is going to be a search.

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,530
Search where and.

31
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,350
Images, results.

32
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,650
And this is going to be two components.

33
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,740
One is the image results.

34
00:03:50,530 --> 00:04:01,960
And one is the search results, but we want to add some kind of ternary operator to show the search

35
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,490
results.

36
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:11,530
Bend your elbow has the search type of empty, but when you have this search softer image, we want

37
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,960
to see this component instead.

38
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,690
So here we can add a.

39
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:27,110
We already have the use router and router, so we can use the router to detect that that query search

40
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,510
type is equal to image or not.

41
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,860
So we're just here.

42
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,320
We just say router does query Dot.

43
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,690
Search time.

44
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,770
If this one is equal to image.

45
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,920
We want to see.

46
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,860
This image results.

47
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,710
Otherwise.

48
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,340
We want to see the search results.

49
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,700
Also, we want to pass the results.

50
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,540
Here, as well as a props.

51
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,430
Now we get the props inside, the image results in image results we can start.

52
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,550
Image resolve is not defined.

53
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,260
Let's see image results.

54
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:39,220
Duchess, yeah, we didn't import it, yes, so we can use control space to import it, so we shouldn't

55
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,270
get an error now.

56
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:50,410
So now in the image just tab, we see the images result in all the tab, we see the normal results.

57
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,740
So now we are working in this part.

58
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,470
Let's start our coding inside the image.

59
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,980
Image result is inside this, but you're going to have another day.

60
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,900
And we're going to get the results.

61
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:18,980
As the props here, so we just the results and here we are going to loop through the results.

62
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,710
Actually, we're not going to look through the results.

63
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,080
We're going to look through the results that items.

64
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,090
Let's check the object again inside the console.

65
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,420
Yeah.

66
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:45,980
As you can see, inside the items, we have 10, an array of 10.

67
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:55,840
So each of them, they have different things like this play link format, file format and image.

68
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,300
We're going to use this context link.

69
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:09,850
Context length is the length of the page that Google's showed the image from.

70
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:16,330
So if you're going to use this one to click on the image and go to this link.

71
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:28,720
We can get the thumbnail as well, but it's not necessary, you can use this same, uh, this uh.

72
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:38,980
You know, this link to get the image as well, but in high quality, but it's fine for now, but if

73
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:47,680
you want to have a very small thumbnail, you can use inside images, you can get the thumbnail link.

74
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,640
And also, we have the title here, so we're going to use as well.

75
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,280
So that's it.

76
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:06,090
So let's uh, let's get the look through the result, that item.

77
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,610
Items, result items.

78
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,850
So here we just see results.

79
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,380
Dot item dot map.

80
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,480
And this is going to gives us each individual result.

81
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,500
And we're going to return.

82
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,780
First for you, when to return, it did.

83
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:44,600
And if you remember, we always have to add a key when we are using map.

84
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:53,000
So here in cientista and a key which is equal to the result, that link, which is a very it's a unique

85
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,280
things to use.

86
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,680
Now you're getting an error because we use item, it should be items.

87
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,470
And also, we can protect this one by adding a question mark here.

88
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:19,660
So if sometimes if we did, we didn't like it fitted correctly.

89
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,140
So if this one is not available, we don't get an error.

90
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,330
All right, so.

91
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:29,650
Here.

92
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:41,590
And let me show you inside the final version when we hover over this image or here or here we see underline

93
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:47,260
on under this links, so we need to create a tier with a class of group.

94
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,220
So we put everything inside that there.

95
00:09:51,700 --> 00:10:02,020
And when we hover over that div, we we can we add the underline under these two things, like a title

96
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,610
and a display link.

97
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,460
So.

98
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,150
So let's add that deer here.

99
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,730
They have there is a class of groups and insiders there.

100
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,240
We have an attack.

101
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,680
To with the link and the link is.

102
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:46,180
As I mentioned, we need to use the result that image dot context linked.

103
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,920
Contacts Link is the link that we used to go to the place.

104
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:02,200
Uh, here you see, when we hover over it, just pay attention here.

105
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,270
This is the final link that goes to that place.

106
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:07,930
This is.

107
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,840
It's a first offense.

108
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,270
This is coming from here.

109
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,020
Items.

110
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:27,130
And inside each one, we have image and inside the image we have.

111
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,110
Context link this link.

112
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:40,110
Inside this and AMP attack, so we have the.

113
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:48,270
And image tag and the source for the image is just the result that link.

114
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,540
We should see now 10 images.

115
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,920
As you can see here.

116
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,090
Getting.

117
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,440
And out of boredom is.

118
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,630
We just don't ask for this because the variable.

119
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,860
We can act like a result of the title or something.

120
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,690
Let's see.

121
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,600
So inside the object, we have items so we can see the result.

122
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,280
Yeah.

123
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,460
Title for the year.

124
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:45,080
Alternative search results dot title.

125
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:56,950
So we have the image now after the image, we are going to have another amp attack, another attack,

126
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,920
so we have this one as well.

127
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,620
We have the same result that image, that context link.

128
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,140
And inside this EMP attack, we have.

129
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:20,110
Now we have an itch to tag just we get the result, the title.

130
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,010
So you can see the title under each image, no.

131
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:33,710
Here.

132
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,380
Next, we have.

133
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,050
Another one in our appetite, let's copy this.

134
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,860
And this one instead of H two.

135
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,040
We're going to have a paragraph.

136
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:59,920
And inside this paragraph, we're going to have results that display link this play.

137
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,630
Link.

138
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:12,310
So this is not actually the link we going, but it's a short version of the link.

139
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,560
We call it display link.

140
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:18,520
All right.

141
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:28,290
Now we can start adding our styling to the this thinks.

142
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:36,930
As you can see, not only we have one column and when we increase the size, actually the images get

143
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,680
super huge, but we don't want like this.

144
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,480
We want it to have four columns when we have a big screen.

145
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,540
Then we have three, two and finally one.

146
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,640
We can achieve this one easily using a grid system.

147
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,230
So here in the second.

148
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,900
They're at the top here.

149
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,060
We had a grid.

150
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:12,850
So we changed the display grid and then for the mobile size we we make the grid to have a one column.

151
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,140
All right.

152
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,670
This is a default for mobile.

153
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,190
Then we say if the screen is bigger than a small.

154
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,270
You change to create two two columns.

155
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:27,940
Then.

156
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,020
In the, uh, in the large.

157
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,120
If screened, we want.

158
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,430
Three columns.

159
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:45,620
And finally, for the ICC's largest screen, we want to have.

160
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,520
Four columns.

161
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,080
So let's check.

162
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:58,860
Now we have one as soon as we got to a certain point, we get to the end.

163
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,470
Here we should get three and finally, we should get four.

164
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:04,730
Yeah.

165
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:12,640
So, no, everything is nice, but we don't have any space between the images, and it looks a little

166
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,780
bit messy here.

167
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,640
So let's add some space between these tanks.

168
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,850
So here at the end, we can add this.

169
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:28,600
First, we added padding x axis of tree.

170
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:38,920
So we is squished them next to each other, and we had a space between the items of.

171
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,310
For the space of four, so now we have some space between the items.

172
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,000
And you can see here.

173
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:04,620
And also, the size of the some of them are longer, some of them are shorter, so the heights are different,

174
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,920
so we're going to fix these things as well.

175
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:14,080
So we have a very neat display, so let's finish with this part.

176
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,610
So we have we have already finished.

177
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:27,050
Let's add some space between the these options and the top by just adding at a top the margin top of

178
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:27,540
four.

179
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,890
So you see space then for the image itself.

180
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,740
We have a.

181
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,260
We just have a class name.

182
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:52,720
First, we will just add a shadow when we see someone hover over everything.

183
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:59,470
So when they hover over the group off, I mean this, they're in everything.

184
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:06,250
When someone or hover over them, we want to add a shadow.

185
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,990
Of X large.

186
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,070
This one.

187
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,010
So no one, we hover over this.

188
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:17,860
Yeah.

189
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:19,750
Shadow.

190
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,780
I see the sizes of difference.

191
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,890
So are you going to fix this one?

192
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:39,350
And after that, we changed the width to be full to we always have a full size.

193
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,740
We had a height of 60.

194
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,060
And we add the objects.

195
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,830
Contain to always have this if it don't scratch it, stretch the image.

196
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You see now the images in the similar high of 60, and some of them are smaller, but we have a space

197
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,730
on top and bottom equally, so it's quite nice now.

198
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:18,750
Actually, I had to choose something else, like we have a different images, so look better, but we're

199
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,440
going to test this one with the real data, so.

200
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,090
OK, so that was it for the image.

201
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,140
Let's solve these titles as well, so.

202
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,130
The first title is here to tag.

203
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:50,540
Uh, let's uh, uh, for the for the image here we have it a tag that covers everything.

204
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,710
Actually, that's a tax she didn't cover.

205
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,290
So we have to bring this one outside.

206
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,710
So now.

207
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,960
This this is the correct one.

208
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:16,570
So this attack includes the image, this attack includes an H2 and the other one is the P-TECH.

209
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,160
So this is a correct way.

210
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:29,010
Up doing that, and then we have a diff that covering everything with a class of group.

211
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,110
For the first, a tank.

212
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,150
Let's.

213
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:51,050
The first one was just and for the first one, we don't need actually any classes for the second one.

214
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,050
We have, uh, we just changed the size of the tax.

215
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,620
Uh.

216
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:10,750
Well, I think the size this fine, we just added on the line when we hover, so we just say if someone

217
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,160
hover over the group.

218
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,180
We want to add the line, so we just say under no.

219
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,840
That's fine now.

220
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,120
And then we have, uh, the same things for the next one.

221
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,220
So we copy this for the other eight targets for.

222
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,450
Now, if you hover over, we see the underline under them.

223
00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:02,930
And then the other things I want to do is just in the H-2 tank, I want to add some.

224
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,680
First, we want a truncated.

225
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:18,060
So when we have a longer title, we want to have a small like a truncated, especially in the bigger

226
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,780
screen, you see, this one is truncated here.

227
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,680
So when we have a long title, we have truncated.

228
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,190
Sue, this down again.

229
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:47,150
After the tragedy, we have other things, we just change the text size to be x large.

230
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,330
So we have a bigger title.

231
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,600
Then for the P tag.

232
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,360
Here.

233
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:06,950
We had a class name, and the classes we want to use is first, we want to change the color of the text

234
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,320
to be 600.

235
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,360
Now it looks.

236
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,220
Yes, sometimes the images get big in the small size.

237
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,250
So here.

238
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,660
That's fine for the mobile screen.

239
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:50,010
Let's add some margin bottom, so we have some space between the images.

240
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:57,110
We can do it here inside this there, that they're just under the map.

241
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:01,960
Here we an emerging bottom of faith.

242
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,660
So we have a little bit of space between them.

243
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,960
That looks fine now.

244
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,320
So let's go at the pagination as well.

245
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:30,290
The bottom that is very simple because we are the created the patient issuance button.

246
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:42,430
So just under this year, we added dear and inside this therapy at the pagination bottoms component.

247
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,650
And we're going to imported using contour space.

248
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,750
We have the pager page initials here.

249
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:58,790
But in the larger screen, we see that it connects to the world because now we don't have the.

250
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,760
This tiling that we had before in the.

251
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:11,860
In a way, we will limit it to here, but in the image we don't have, that's fine.

252
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:16,510
We can just add a margin, laugh at this there.

253
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,560
Of 16 to fix this one.

254
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,860
Now we see this one here and also when we have a bigger screen, we have a little bit of a space you.

255
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,260
So let's try our real data.

256
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,540
Let's go to the thermostat, yes.

257
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,610
And here.

258
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:45,620
In front of the constant, constant mock data, we change the true to false.

259
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:51,050
So we're using now the real data to refresh the page.

260
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:59,140
Let's search something else, for example, next chance.

261
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,840
Now we end it first in the whip results.

262
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,400
Let's go to the images now we see the images.

263
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:19,620
The first image is from Wikipedia, so we go to the next page and this image is found next just to watch.

264
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,930
So everything's working correctly.

265
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,590
So that's the that's that was it for the Web site.

266
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:32,660
We some some small things left us still.

267
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:43,340
For example, in the home page, we still didn't link these buttons like about store Gmail and images.

268
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:52,490
We're going to fix them in the next section, and we're going to deploy our website after that to virtual.

269
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,110
So first, let's and everything to get off.

270
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,990
So we just get at.

271
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,310
And we add the comments with a message of.

272
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,200
And.

273
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,720
Image results component.

274
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,810
And we push everything to get half.

275
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,620
Let's review our code.

276
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:38,100
So we refresh the page here, and we go to the last comment by clicking on this.

277
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:45,750
So we're going to be created a component called image result.

278
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,470
Yes.

279
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:58,540
So this one is just the way we look through a results that items we added three links, one for the

280
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:04,210
image, one for the title and one for the just the display link.

281
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:09,790
And also we added the page pagination button at the end.

282
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:16,410
Furthermore, we added a ternary operator inside this search duchess.

283
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:25,770
We just said if the router that Quarry does search time is equal to image.

284
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,240
The.

285
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:35,320
Image results, component, otherwise show search results, components.

286
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,960
We just changed our mark at the beginning.

287
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:48,940
So we just changed the mark from the normal weight result to the images result.

288
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,800
Yeah, that was it for this section.

289
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:06,200
In the next section, we're going to first fix these bombs and then we're going to deploy our website

290
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,280
to restore.

291
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,710
So see you in the next section for the deployment.
