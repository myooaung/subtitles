1
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.820
All right.

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.080
In the last section, we have completed the input part of the feed component.

3
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.030
In this section, we're going to start creating the post section of this feed component if you look

4
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.370
at the final version of the project.

5
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.300
Let me zoom this a little bit.

6
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.140
We want to create this UI, but with some dummy data.

7
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:43.320
We create an array of two objects and we're going to create some fake data for two posts, and we're

8
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.100
going to use these data to create our post.

9
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:57.330
But later, when we finished finished creating the UI part, we can start using the real data from Firebase

10
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.790
and fill this post.

11
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.490
But for now we just use the dummy data.

12
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.700
So we go back to Visual Studio code.

13
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.530
And uh, we open the our localhost 3000 on the right side.

14
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.750
Inside the feed 30 years.

15
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.490
So after the input we going to create the post data.

16
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.420
But first we're going to create the dummy dataset, as I mentioned.

17
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.550
So we create a constant and we call it hosts.

18
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.500
And this is going to be equal an array and inside the array.

19
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.870
They have an object.

20
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.890
So the first element is an I.D. and we just said it to be a one.

21
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.250
Then we have the name.

22
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.630
I just put my name.

23
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.570
But you can use your own name.

24
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.660
Then we have username.

25
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.330
I just write.

26
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.120
Don't forget to add this comma.

27
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.550
I add my.

28
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.760
Uh, Twitter user name code with a hand.

29
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.540
Then we have that user image.

30
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.200
So I can use the same image I used before.

31
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.270
Uh, which is this one?

32
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.260
I can copy the image address and paste it here.

33
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.660
After that we have the post image.

34
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.550
The Post image we can find from some websites like unsplash.

35
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.060
Com.

36
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.460
So I search Unsplash.

37
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.590
So in the search results we click on unsplash.com.

38
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.100
Here.

39
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.990
We search for some photos.

40
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.330
For example, I search for nature and we can't get any.

41
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:10.790
Pictures.

42
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.370
And this is fine.

43
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.710
We just click on it and right click and click on copy image address.

44
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.080
Then we paste the link here.

45
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.060
After the image.

46
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.490
We have two more things.

47
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.290
First is the text of the tweet, which is, for example, I say nice.

48
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.900
View.

49
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.660
Then finally, we have the time stamp.

50
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.560
Later, we're going to get it dynamically from.

51
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.920
Firebase timestamps function.

52
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.000
But now we just write, for example, to.

53
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.970
Our psycho.

54
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.330
Okay.

55
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.120
So this is the first post.

56
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.950
Let's make another one.

57
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.800
So add a comma here and copy this one time using all shift arrow.

58
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:09.190
Done.

59
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:18.130
Just change this idea to the name and the user name and the user image can be similar.

60
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.790
But for the image we choose another image.

61
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.840
Anything like this.

62
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.700
We click on it and copy image address.

63
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.350
So we changed the second image.

64
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.580
Right.

65
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.330
The texts we just say.

66
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.210
For example.

67
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.440
Wow.

68
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.510
And the time stamps.

69
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.440
This farm, for example, two days ago, is that it's not important.

70
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.220
These things that were just making some spectators.

71
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.190
No, we're going to use this data and create the post.

72
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.930
So we close this unsplash.com web site and here.

73
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.420
We can create another component, as we call it, and just here.

74
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:27.550
We call it Post Dot J.S. and we can use RF C to create a react functional component.

75
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.690
And we don't need this import, as I mentioned before, because we are using next use.

76
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.450
All right.

77
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:44.730
So inside the yes, we're going to loop through these two posts.

78
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.900
After this image inputs.

79
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.770
So we looked through it using map function.

80
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.590
And.

81
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.570
We can get each post here.

82
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.060
And we can return.

83
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.020
Directly return.

84
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.230
That posts.

85
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.880
Component that we have created.

86
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.250
You just need to import the POS.

87
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.600
So we use controls space to get the auto suggests.

88
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.080
All right, now we can pass the data.

89
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.320
This one should be posts actually.

90
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:34.460
So we get the each post here and the key can be.

91
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.990
Because we need a key for map function.

92
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.310
So the posted I.D. can be a key because it's unique.

93
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:50.820
Then we we can pass all the posts and we get it inside.

94
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.890
So we pass this as a prop.

95
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.520
And inside post Sturgis.

96
00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.980
We can get it here as a prop.

97
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.530
But we can structure it.

98
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.740
Just now and we get the post.

99
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:12.880
So here.

100
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.480
We can just get the post.

101
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.790
That idea so we can see it.

102
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:26.700
Yeah.

103
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.050
So we got one and two.

104
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.110
I don't know what this post is, so let me check.

105
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.480
So inside of it that.

106
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.110
Yes.

107
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:45.930
That's fine.

108
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.310
Let me refresh the page.

109
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:48.360
Yeah.

110
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.280
That was the catch from the last one.

111
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.590
So we got the one to the Ides.

112
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.500
So we are getting both of their posts.

113
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.750
So let's let me show you how we are going to create this post.

114
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.180
So let me draw it for you.

115
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.750
So this is the diff that we have.

116
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:15.920
Everything inside it.

117
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.470
This is the diff.

118
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:19.580
Then we have.

119
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:30.030
One, the fear that is covering the image or we just can use the image tag.

120
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.790
Then we have another div on the right side.

121
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:38.370
All right.

122
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:42.390
Here at a top.

123
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.990
We have a diff that is covering this.

124
00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.140
And coat with a hand.

125
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.430
Sorry, Sam, I deleted the username.

126
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:55.850
The time stamp.

127
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.760
And also we have this logo.

128
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:05.090
So this is one div, but inside it has another div.

129
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.910
So this is a div.

130
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:08.310
Two.

131
00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:09.490
And this is a Dave.

132
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.880
And then we have this caption.

133
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.450
Or text.

134
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:18.910
Here.

135
00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:23.320
Then we have the image and finally we have another.

136
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.200
They have that is covering all the icons.

137
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.450
So this is the way we have to create.

138
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.580
So I'm going to break down this.

139
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:40.050
So it's very confusing because a lot of ifs inside each other, because if you make one mistake, you

140
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.550
cannot a style.

141
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:42.630
It's easily.

142
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:49.340
So let me break down this inside Visual Studio code.

143
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.690
So inside posts.

144
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.860
Let me.

145
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.100
Delete this.

146
00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:01.270
So this this this is the diff that is covering everything.

147
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:01.870
The yellow.

148
00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.030
The yellow one I created.

149
00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.210
Then we have the image.

150
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.560
So we have the image here.

151
00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:13.960
And here we have the right side.

152
00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:16.900
Okay.

153
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.600
So the right side is at this.

154
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.750
Then inside the right side, we have one day at a time.

155
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.140
For.

156
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.670
At the header.

157
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.870
So we have the header.

158
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:52.950
Which has the there and this div includes one div here.

159
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.670
And this is the outcome.

160
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:56.370
So.

161
00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.480
Here we have the.

162
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.950
For example, user info we can say.

163
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:13.320
Or post user info after which is a diff.

164
00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.660
And after that we have the this icon.

165
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.320
So we have the icon here that that icon.

166
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:26.360
Okay.

167
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.520
So after this div, that is a header.

168
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.550
We have the techs, the post techs.

169
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.940
After this, we have the image.

170
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.570
The Post image.

171
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.280
So the first one was the user image.

172
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:58.930
And after the post image, we have to add the icons here.

173
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.220
Which includes at Def.

174
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.260
All right, now we have everything.

175
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.360
We can fill them up easily.

176
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:20.170
So that is the way I recommend when you want to create something first you make the break down the know

177
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.550
what we thought you were going to do, so you can do it.

178
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:32.210
And so and then everything will be similar for everything because you're using the component base and

179
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.760
it's creating.

180
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.570
Okay.

181
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.430
So let's start with the user image.

182
00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.090
For the user image, we just can.

183
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.460
Let me keep it on the right side.

184
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:55.750
We can use a I am g tag and the source would be similar because I'm using uh, sorry, because we brought

185
00:12:55.750 --> 00:13:01.540
the post here so it would be post dot user.

186
00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.010
I am g.

187
00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:05.600
Okay.

188
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.410
They're getting two because it's two toss.

189
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.090
There are two top posts inside and we are getting from the dummy data from here.

190
00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.820
The alternative is the user image.

191
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.920
Then on the right side for the header.

192
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.440
We have the.

193
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:32.710
The Post.

194
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:33.050
Uh.

195
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:35.820
User info.

196
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:40.820
So first we.

197
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.540
We have an itch for.

198
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:56.160
Which just getting the post that name.

199
00:13:59.360 --> 00:13:59.660
Okay.

200
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:08.960
Because the names are similar as well after this age for we have an a span and their span is.

201
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.010
Post dot username.

202
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:17.490
Okay.

203
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.750
And finally after that, we have.

204
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:32.750
That, uh, timestamp so we can get the post date time stamp.

205
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.320
Which is 2 hours ago.

206
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.120
Okay.

207
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.100
So we have everything here.

208
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:45.390
After that, we have the icon, which is dot.

209
00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:52.240
All rise an icon from you icons.

210
00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.160
Here we getting this suggestion.

211
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:59.080
So we click on the auto suggestion and we go into auto imported from here.

212
00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.800
Icons for a slash react or slash auto.

213
00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.200
We should see now the.

214
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.630
And there are, too, because it's very big.

215
00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.480
Let me decrease the size.

216
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:15.400
Real quick.

217
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:20.200
We just said the height to be, for example, a ten.

218
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.980
So now we go to the next part, which is post techs.

219
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.160
And this is going to be.

220
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.110
A paragraph and.

221
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.770
This is post dot.

222
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:43.390
Text.

223
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.040
We can see now.

224
00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:47.850
Nice for you.

225
00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:49.230
And the second one is for you.

226
00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.010
Wow.

227
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:53.080
Post image.

228
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:58.260
That is an IMG tag and sources.

229
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.740
Post Dot.

230
00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:05.380
Image.

231
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.080
Or I think I used EMG check.

232
00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:14.530
So I feel that.

233
00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:15.450
Yes.

234
00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:17.020
Yeah, I am.

235
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.150
So we just changed this one to I.A..

236
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.950
We should see the images as well.

237
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.510
For the icons.

238
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.550
Well, we're going to use.

239
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.840
Five icons.

240
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.680
So the first icon is chat icon.

241
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.410
So it's going to be chat.

242
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.190
Icon.

243
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.280
From online the imported.

244
00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.680
Yeah, we can see it.

245
00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.300
Let's small.

246
00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:59.860
Make it small as well.

247
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.030
So this one, I just hit the height to be nine.

248
00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.080
All right.

249
00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:10.640
So we need to copy this a few times.

250
00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:13.990
Five times.

251
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:18.040
And the second icon is trash icon.

252
00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.950
It's important to.

253
00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:24.210
The third one is.

254
00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:28.990
Uh, my heart icon.

255
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:39.910
You can see here chat, icon, trash and hard.

256
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:43.270
Next one is Cher icon.

257
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.000
This one.

258
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.490
And the last one is chart for icon.

259
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:04.070
Okay.

260
00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.380
Now we got all the icons.

261
00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.790
And, uh, everything's done.

262
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:14.210
We just need to style our, uh.

263
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:16.460
Post section.

264
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.070
So let's start with the image.

265
00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.580
With the user image.

266
00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.420
So we add a class name here.

267
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:38.090
Let's make make it smaller first by just saying the height to be 11.

268
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.810
And we sit there with the B 11 as well.

269
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.490
And we make it rounded.

270
00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:52.840
I guess I would say again, because my picture is around, I don't need to make around it.

271
00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:58.180
But the picture we are getting later from Google is actually is is square.

272
00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.960
So we need to make it rounder.

273
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:06.240
And let's install this part of.

274
00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.890
Let's make.

275
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.900
Bring everything next to each other.

276
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:16.890
As I mentioned, we have a div that is covering the image and the rest of us the rest.

277
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.420
So in this the main div at the top.

278
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:26.040
We changed the display to flex.

279
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.480
So everything comes next to each other.

280
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:33.490
The images in the left, the everything else is on the right side.

281
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:38.350
And, uh, let's add some padding.

282
00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.060
So we make a.

283
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:42.890
Padding of three.

284
00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.640
They push everything to inside.

285
00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:56.770
We added cursors to B pointer because every every where in the post I want to see a pointing hat because

286
00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:05.230
later when we click on the posts, we, we're going to be redirected to a new page.

287
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:09.550
So we need to have a cursor pointer.

288
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.450
Now let's add a border bottom.

289
00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.440
Here.

290
00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.640
You can see the border.

291
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.580
Now let's change the color of the border.

292
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.060
To be grey.

293
00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.070
200, as we did for the previous things.

294
00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.920
So for consistency, we do that.

295
00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:40.820
Let's add some margin to the right stuff, the right side of the image.

296
00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:44.060
So the image here, the ad in margin.

297
00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:44.740
Right.

298
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:46.220
For.

299
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:49.860
That's fine.

300
00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.970
Let's just start installing this part.

301
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.280
So we bring everything next to each other, and we put this icon here.

302
00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:08.040
And also we want this icon to be similar to this for same effects.

303
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.600
Background blue.

304
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:14.050
And the darker blue color as well.

305
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.950
Uh.

306
00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.810
So let's first create the icon.

307
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.960
So we want we are going to use this same.

308
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:30.760
Uh, hover effect class that we have created before.

309
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:33.570
So we're going to use this same one.

310
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:43.660
So now it has a hover of fact, but let's add their width to be ten to.

311
00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:47.740
So it becomes like a circle and.

312
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:59.400
We have when we hover over it, I want the color to be blue and not I care now, which is gray.

313
00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:01.920
So the background color.

314
00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:06.690
I want it to be a sky which is very similar to blue.

315
00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.760
Like this and also the color of these dots.

316
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:15.230
I want it to be blue as well.

317
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.490
So when we hover over it, I want the text color to be a sky.

318
00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:22.460
But this one 500.

319
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:24.760
Like this.

320
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.460
And also, let's add some padding.

321
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.330
So we push it a little bit inside like this.

322
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.730
This is the one we are looking for.

323
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:35.290
All right.

324
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:42.790
So let's bring these three next to each other.

325
00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:43.960
Which is these three?

326
00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.970
So we a flex here.

327
00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.340
Like this.

328
00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.450
But they are just connected to each other.

329
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.370
So we can add a.

330
00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.530
Space X.

331
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.040
Just one is enough.

332
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:02.700
I think.

333
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:06.840
And, uh.

334
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.220
Let's make this one both.

335
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:11.880
So.

336
00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:17.850
So this edge for.

337
00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.740
So I want the text to be pulled.

338
00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.260
And the text size.

339
00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:32.040
I want it to be 515 pixels.

340
00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:34.990
But when we.

341
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:41.500
This is for mobile size, but when we have a bigger screen than mobile.

342
00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:54.370
So after it's M and prefix break point fix fix, we change the text size to be 16 pixels.

343
00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.720
And then when we hover over it, I want to see it underline.

344
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.180
So we can just add hover effects.

345
00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.540
Sue the class.

346
00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:12.760
And we just say underline.

347
00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:17.140
Like this.

348
00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:30.990
So let's bring everything.

349
00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:34.590
And so let's install this code with the hand.

350
00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.470
Actually for username.

351
00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:41.610
We need to edit ampersand here like this.

352
00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:46.510
And after that we need as.

353
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.530
Okay.

354
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.290
Dash line.

355
00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:58.210
So let's continue with the username.

356
00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:08.350
So we install the username and let's make the text to be a small but in the mobile size and above.

357
00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.710
I want to.

358
00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.200
To change.

359
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.810
Make it.

360
00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.760
15 pixels.

361
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:26.410
Okay.

362
00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.600
And for the.

363
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:38.030
Timestamp.

364
00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.340
Let's make this one.

365
00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:48.540
Uh, Texas, small as well.

366
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.380
And above and mobile size.

367
00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:56.670
Let's make the ticks to be 15 pixels.

368
00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:59.320
Okay.

369
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:05.930
And, uh, I want this one to have a underline, too, when we hover over it.

370
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:08.530
So just say, hover on the line.

371
00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:14.470
Like this.

372
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.330
So everything looks fine.

373
00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:32.460
The problem is when if someone has a very small screen, they see that they go to the two lines so we

374
00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.720
can prevent this.

375
00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:39.820
Just here, we can add, uh, white space.

376
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:40.490
No rap.

377
00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:44.970
Which prevents going to the second.

378
00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:47.650
Like this.

379
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:49.980
Hey.

380
00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:53.640
So this is fine now.

381
00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:00.770
So let's bring this, uh, icon to the here, to the right side.

382
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:02.930
We can simply do this one.

383
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:07.080
Uh, this is the diff here.

384
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:08.000
Until here.

385
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:10.370
Then we have to authorize an icon.

386
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:12.920
This is the diff that is covering both of them.

387
00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.290
So we can add a flex here.

388
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:18.090
So they go next to each other.

389
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:23.250
We can bring them everything to the center using item center.

390
00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:32.200
Then we can bring this one on the right side by just to justify between.

391
00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:36.140
Like this.

392
00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:38.720
Then this one, too.

393
00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.380
Uh, they are not in the same line.

394
00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:48.300
So we can add the item center here as well.

395
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:53.270
The data that is coming out of.

396
00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:54.110
Okay.

397
00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:57.730
This one looks fine.

398
00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:01.040
So let's solve this.

399
00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:01.530
Uh.

400
00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:03.540
Hey X.

401
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.720
Uh, the text is here.

402
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.010
The post techs.

403
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:27.510
We add a classic name, we change the colour of the text to be a gray.

404
00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:31.350
Let's make it like great.

405
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:33.660
800.

406
00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:41.230
It make the text to be 15 pixels.

407
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:54.010
And in the bigger size, they make it to be 16 pixels, which is the base one.

408
00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:57.000
Okay.

409
00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:03.280
And then we add some margin at a bottom of two.

410
00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.930
So pushed that on a little bit down.

411
00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:12.760
I think that's fine for this.

412
00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.510
For now, let's just tell the image.

413
00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:25.600
You can see that everything we are applying is going to be applied at the bottom too, for the image.

414
00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.860
We just, uh, make it around it a little bit.

415
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.220
So we just add a class name and we make it rounded.

416
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.830
To excel.

417
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:47.820
And we add some margin right off to sorry a little bit.

418
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.080
Bring it in to the left side.

419
00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.550
So that's it for this part.

420
00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:03.860
Let's just call this icons.

421
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:17.790
Let's bring them next to each other by just adding the flex display to flex and we will make them separate

422
00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:23.070
it until here by just saying just fight between.

423
00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:36.350
And we changed their color to be gray 500 and we add some padding.

424
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.320
Off to to push them inside.

425
00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:45.780
So that's the same as we did for this icon.

426
00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:47.670
We're going to do it for here.

427
00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.970
So I add a.

428
00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:56.040
Cursor for all of their.

429
00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:58.080
We're going to.

430
00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.630
Set the width to be nine as well.

431
00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:08.880
And we add the hover effect that we created before that class.

432
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.090
You should see a little bit of change.

433
00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:18.040
Then we add a padding of two.

434
00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.310
So pushed him a little bit inside.

435
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:31.500
And when we hover over it, we want to change the text color.

436
00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.960
I mean, the color of the icon to be.

437
00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:37.990
Uh, for some of them, I want to make it blue.

438
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.140
Some of them read like the thrash icon and heart icon.

439
00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.010
So we just make it blue first as a default.

440
00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:49.780
Like this.

441
00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:58.830
And also when we hover over it, I want the background to be a sky.

442
00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:00.790
100.

443
00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:02.810
So.

444
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:04.990
So this is fine.

445
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:10.240
We just for the two icons we have like trash in heart we changed the.

446
00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.540
A sky to be red.

447
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:16.250
So here.

448
00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.830
And this one, this one.

449
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:19.940
This one would be red.

450
00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.230
There's some red.

451
00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:23.840
At this.

452
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.810
But the read I want to read to be 600 a little bit.

453
00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.140
Different.

454
00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:38.190
This one, too, and the background would be.

455
00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:41.960
Read 100.

456
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.220
Like this.

457
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:49.850
You can see it here, too.

458
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.890
Okay.

459
00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:57.610
Let's make it bigger so we can see it in a bigger size.

460
00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:05.440
As you can see, everything is nice.

461
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:11.700
Okay.

462
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:16.320
That was it for the post section we have created.

463
00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:20.540
Let's add everything to the gear top now.

464
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:27.590
So we use kids at all.

465
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.620
And we can you.

466
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:33.140
We used to go get commands.

467
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:36.200
To add a message.

468
00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:39.220
And the message would be.

469
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:42.200
And.

470
00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:49.720
The Post's section of the FT.

471
00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.460
Components.

472
00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:58.650
And we can push everything to get her by using get push.

473
00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:01.890
So let's review what we have done.

474
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:06.060
We can refresh the page by clicking on this Twitter.

475
00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:15.690
Now we have six commits in our repository and if we click on it, we go to the and the last one is at

476
00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:18.150
the post section of the feed components.

477
00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:29.630
We just inside the fetus, we added at dummy data for two posts.

478
00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:38.300
Then we looked through it using the map method and we got each post and we passed.

479
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:39.950
Pass it as a props.

480
00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:46.130
To a component that we have created here, this one.

481
00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:48.840
The post that.

482
00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:52.830
Yes, we created that one and.

483
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:57.600
So we added the image on the right side.

484
00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.100
We added the header.

485
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:05.320
The icons and etc. on the image and we have started using terms.

486
00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:09.820
Use this in the next section we are going to start creating.

487
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.300
This.

488
00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:13.580
Uh.

489
00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.690
Search bar.

490
00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:23.330
And if it's not too long, we can create this what's happening section as well.

491
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:28.010
So we're going to create this is start to create this widgets section.

492
00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:30.320
So see in the next section.
