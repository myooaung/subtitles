1
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:07,790
Alright.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,010
In the last section we made the fifth section responsive.

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:12,800
In this section.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,650
We're going to start with the mini powerful section of the feed that J.S..

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:31,550
In this section we just the here we added there and we put everything inside this there.

6
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:39,930
Because the reason I'm putting this two sections inside is because we want to make the.

7
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:49,200
There's a meaningful qualification fix at the top, at the right section.

8
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:54,150
So when we're going down, we always see this path.

9
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,610
And the right side.

10
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,950
So let me zoom out a little bit so you can see that there's a fix completely on the right side.

11
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,480
And also, if you look at the this one closely, you can see that we have.

12
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,760
Uh, one div that covers.

13
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,900
This part.

14
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,360
And then we have the profile image we have here.

15
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:34,490
The username and the welcome to Instagram and also we at the end we have the sign out button this two

16
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,610
part actually they are on the top of each other.

17
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,700
So there are two sections as well.

18
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,820
So we have one and two parts.

19
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:53,600
So let's go back to Visual Studio code and here inside the mini menu profile.

20
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,760
Section.

21
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,060
In order to see it, we have to decrease the size.

22
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:07,490
So I put here in this website, I have to be high and I open it here so you can see the changes at the

23
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,120
right side.

24
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:17,330
So here first we have, as I mentioned, we make it fixed and we give it a width of.

25
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,300
380 pixels.

26
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,580
And inside this we have to create the mini profile components.

27
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:40,050
So inside the components folder, we create a new file and we named a file meaning profile.

28
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:41,980
Doug.

29
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:49,370
And we use RF C to create a react functional component.

30
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:57,390
As I mentioned before, you can get enough this part because in next year we don't need to import react.

31
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,660
So for now, we just add something like.

32
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:14,680
Many profile and in scientific touches we can import this component, which I say many.

33
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,210
Profile and the use.

34
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,640
Control space to author imported.

35
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,690
And now we can see at the top.

36
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,650
Because both are located at the same directory.

37
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,660
If you just need to write a dot slash menu for a file.

38
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:39,430
All right.

39
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:45,070
Now we can see it meaningful at the right side and you can see it fixed at the top.

40
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,810
Now.

41
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,280
So inside the army pathology.

42
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,840
Yes.

43
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,530
Instead of just having a H1 tag.

44
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,840
We create.

45
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,990
An image tag.

46
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:11,730
And inside the image we just use the same image we use for the header that just this, this image.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,990
But later we are going to actually get this one from the database.

48
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,210
But now we just hardcoded.

49
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,240
I think this is the warm.

50
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:22,850
Yeah.

51
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,630
This is the one after the plus circle icon.

52
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,470
That image.

53
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,240
You just copy this.

54
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,430
Now we go back to meaningful politics and we pasted inside this 30.

55
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,900
We should see the image here now.

56
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,780
It's huge, but that is fine.

57
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,310
Later, we're going to.

58
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,960
Make it a smaller using children.

59
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:55,670
See if this the alternative name will be user image and after the image tag we have.

60
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,450
Another diff that has two things.

61
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,020
As I show you here in this day, we have two things.

62
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,410
The user name and also the will come to Instagram.

63
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,820
So inside this thing we have one inch to tag.

64
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,320
Which thing?

65
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,400
Just same code with Farhad.

66
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,680
This is a hard coded.

67
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:28,590
And later, as I said many times, we need we can get this one from the database with the real user

68
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,330
that sign up in our website.

69
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:42,270
So we sit here cold with the hand, and just after this tour we have another tag heading tag, but this

70
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,650
one is H3 and it just saying welcome.

71
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,280
To.

72
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,350
Instagram.

73
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,880
And finally at the end, we have a button.

74
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,970
Bottom.

75
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:11,980
Just saying.

76
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,530
Sign out.

77
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,040
All right, so let's stall everything.

78
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,550
First, we decrease the size of the image so we can see everything clearly.

79
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:37,970
So in the image tag, the added class name and the classes we are going to use is just the edge.

80
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:46,170
16 for height 16, which means height 64 pixels.

81
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:55,040
So we make it smaller and then we make it rounded by using rounded four.

82
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,080
Then we add a border.

83
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,260
Let me assume a little bit.

84
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,200
You can see it nicely.

85
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:11,100
We added a border, and between the border and the picture, we're going to add a padding.

86
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,070
So we just added padding of two pixels.

87
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,860
So we pushed the image a little bit inside.

88
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,160
We have to pick something.

89
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,350
And also we have the border.

90
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,240
That's it for the image.

91
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:34,920
Next.

92
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,330
Uh, let's, uh.

93
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,270
Let's first decrease the size.

94
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,500
The next, we're going to start this quote with a hand.

95
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,550
Uh.

96
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,840
We just need to add these classes.

97
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,530
We just need to make it actually only bold.

98
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,280
We just see font bold.

99
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:08,940
Four.

100
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,210
Welcome to Instagram.

101
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,440
We change the color of the text.

102
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,010
Uh, just the class name.

103
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,190
The font will be the same.

104
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:32,180
Just make the text a little bit smaller, and the text color would be gray.

105
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,220
And 400.

106
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,880
Next we do the styling for the class.

107
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,380
For the baton.

108
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,150
So we're just a class name.

109
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,580
We make it semi bold.

110
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,990
Not completely bold.

111
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,400
We just font semi bold.

112
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:11,910
And we change the colour to be blue, but not the very dark blue.

113
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,420
We just saved 400.

114
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:22,500
And we make the texts a little bit small, like the welcome to image built from the Instagram.

115
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,290
So now everything is next to each other.

116
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:30,510
We just need to add a flex, add a top in this diff.

117
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,490
That is.

118
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,430
Let me.

119
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,070
Dented a little bit.

120
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,690
So we have image here and we have a div that covering these two things.

121
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,540
Then we have the button.

122
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,980
So in the div.

123
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,600
We have.

124
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,480
A class name, a flex.

125
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,920
So you bring everything next to each other.

126
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:07,680
Then for bringing everything to the center we can use item center.

127
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:19,670
And we just use just the five between to have a space between these three tanks, then decrease the

128
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,740
size so you can see it better.

129
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,410
All right.

130
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,000
So we added just the five between to we added the space between there.

131
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,020
But uh.

132
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:53,220
We just the idea marching at the top of 14 pixels and marching to the left of ten pixels.

133
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,450
For this to hear these two.

134
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,520
We use Flex one to Occupy.

135
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,770
This area completely.

136
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,290
So it pushes this one to the left.

137
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:24,930
But we can use margin left for four to bring it a little bit at the right side.

138
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:30,270
So, no, we have the sign out button at the right side.

139
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:37,230
We have this part which is occupying this size in the center and the profile image.

140
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,620
In the next section we're going to create.

141
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,870
Despite this suggestion part.

142
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:54,510
So this suggests so far it's similar to story fiction.

143
00:11:54,530 --> 00:12:03,830
We are going to get all this information from the fake M.F.A. package that we already installed for

144
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:11,060
this story, and we're going to get the username and also we're going to get the jobs after each username.

145
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:20,220
And these images are coming from this that PR avatar, that CC website.

146
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,250
So let's say first we push everything to get HOF before for getting.

147
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,900
We can't commit and to commit would be.

148
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,290
Create the Mini.

149
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,970
Paul.

150
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,630
Component.

151
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,170
And we push everything to get hot.

152
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,640
Let's review our code.

153
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:02,110
So we go to our code and we check the last commit by clicking on the now.

154
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,240
So as you can see in the feed that.

155
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,990
Yes.

156
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,080
We?

157
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,480
Added this part.

158
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,170
Here.

159
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:20,370
We make the class name fixed and also we add a width of 380 pixels.

160
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:29,300
And also we added the meaningful component here and then we created mini pathologies.

161
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:35,090
And in the mini pathology pathologies, we have the.

162
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,030
The diff that covering everything, which is Flexbox.

163
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,830
And also we have an image.

164
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,030
For the profile.

165
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:56,720
And in order for that to pass the work squad would send and welcome to Instagram and also we had the

166
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,500
bottom at the end.

167
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:03,890
They only think it was a little bit difficult with the flex one.

168
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,950
And I think everything is fine.

169
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,850
It wasn't new.

170
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,850
This fix was new as well.

171
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,140
All right.

172
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,930
In the next section, we're going to create this suggestion part.

173
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:29,060
If you if you see that's actually when we refresh the page, we always get the new users and the new

174
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,660
images.

175
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,820
So see you in the next section.
