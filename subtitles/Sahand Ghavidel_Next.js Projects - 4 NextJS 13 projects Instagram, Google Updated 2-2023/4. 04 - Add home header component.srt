1
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:07,710
All right.

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,600
In the last section we have completed installing Tailwind CSS.

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,000
In this section, we're going to work on the header section of the home page.

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,160
If you look at the final version and we go to the home page.

5
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:33,010
We can see that we have a header here that is only common for the home page, because if we go to other

6
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:41,380
pages, for example, inside the pages related to the result, we have a different.

7
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:50,910
Uh, format of the header, but this header for this page is common for all the pages, like for example,

8
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:59,190
the image page or the web page and also the footer is common between the home page and the.

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,110
That page related to the results.

10
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:13,510
So we don't need to add this header for the home page inside the layout that is, but we need to add

11
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:21,730
the header of the result page in the layout just for the.

12
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,950
A result page.

13
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,250
So I'm going to show you later how to add it to the layout for the result page.

14
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,750
But for now we just add this header inside the home page.

15
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,510
So if we go back to Visual Studio Code.

16
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:48,050
We can open the Explorer section using Contour shift E and here we just go to inside the app page six

17
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,990
inside the app directory.

18
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:57,760
And instead of this div, we're going to return just the component.

19
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,530
So I'm going to delete this div, I'm going to create an empty fragment.

20
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:12,550
And inside this empty fragment we're going to have the that component that we're going to create.

21
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,430
So I'm going to create a component here with the name home.

22
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,380
Header.

23
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,030
And we need to create another folder here inside the SRT folder.

24
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,790
Cause components inside the circuit.

25
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,940
You just choose SRK folder.

26
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:48,980
And here we click on the new folder icon and we just call it components.

27
00:02:53,140 --> 00:03:00,100
And inside this folder we're going to create another file and we call it home header.

28
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:14,680
That gsx we can simply create a React functional component using RFC and we press enter.

29
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,930
We have a component now, so now we need to import this one inside the page that Gsx just after the

30
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:32,380
home header, you just put the cursor and use contra space to all to get the auto suggestion and click

31
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,730
here to import it.

32
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:41,200
And if you remember, we have an alias add sign forward slash for the root directory, which is the

33
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,610
SRT folder.

34
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,500
And so instead of just going back and just choose.

35
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,200
The component.

36
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:57,060
We just say add sine forward slash component components for slash home header for importing this component.

37
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:10,020
So now if we go to our website, we go to the local host and we refresh the page, we just see the home

38
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,480
header which we have created.

39
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,670
All right, So now we just bring this one to the right side.

40
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:27,930
So we're going to work on it and we bring the paste code on the left side so we can have the and see

41
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,820
the changes on real time.

42
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,520
So I'm going to close this one as well.

43
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,930
So we have more space on the left side.

44
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,760
Let me increase the size of this one as well.

45
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,350
So let me show you what we are doing in the final version.

46
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,080
So let me draw it for you.

47
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,370
So we have a.

48
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,020
Yeah.

49
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,590
Header component at the top.

50
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,520
So let me change the colour here.

51
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,190
So let's make it red.

52
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,080
So we have a header.

53
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,160
Tag.

54
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,270
Which includes another div inside it.

55
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,280
And this tape is going to have these three places.

56
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,050
And we're going to push this tip to the right size.

57
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,840
So it's going to be this side.

58
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,500
And then we're going to have a link tag for the Gmail images.

59
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:42,970
And we're going to have this icon, which is going to get from a package called React Icons.

60
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,720
And then we're going to create this button.

61
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,390
And these two, when we hover over them, we see a underline.

62
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,480
And also the cursor is pointer.

63
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,090
So we're going to create a custom tailored CSS class for these two.

64
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:05,310
And also we're going to create this hover effect for this one and this for the button.

65
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:11,280
So we go back to home JSX ex sorry, Home header six.

66
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:20,260
I'm going to change this diff to header tag, which is going to help for the SEO purpose because we're

67
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:27,340
going to tell the search engines that this is a header inside the website.

68
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:34,810
So as you can see, we are getting some suggestion from the GitHub copilot.

69
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:43,730
So I'm not going to use it now, but sometimes they are very helpful, so I'm going to use them on type.

70
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,070
So I'm going to create another diff.

71
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:53,420
As I mentioned, we're going to have a diff here and inside the diff we're going to have to link and

72
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:58,040
I'm going to use a link tag from next JS.

73
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:07,140
The next chess link tag actually helps us to go from one page to another without refreshing the page.

74
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:15,630
And also it's very helpful for the SEO purposes because it's going to add automatic anchor tag inside

75
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,950
this tag.

76
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:23,280
So I'm going to create a link tag which is coming from next forward slash Link U.

77
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:29,490
We got the auto suggestion, so we we need to close this tag.

78
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,580
And inside this, the first link tag.

79
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,090
I'm just going to say Gmail.

80
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,570
So let's see it here inside our website.

81
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,910
Let's refresh the page.

82
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:48,230
Sometimes the auto refresh doesn't work, so you need to refresh refresh it to yourself.

83
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:56,430
And we got an error saying that the H shift property is empty, so we need to add it.

84
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,740
H ref tag.

85
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:04,270
So I'm not going to send places any places.

86
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,240
So we just kind of want to add.

87
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,880
Now we can just add some.

88
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,310
Where you are.

89
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,130
For example.

90
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:16,790
H.

91
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:18,850
T.

92
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,250
T.

93
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,680
P.

94
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,570
S.

95
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,740
And we just send them to mail dot google dot com.

96
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,170
This one should be h t t ps.

97
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:35,550
All right.

98
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:39,000
So now we see that Gmail here.

99
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,760
It has a hover effect, but it doesn't have underline.

100
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:55,300
So it probably we don't need even to have the custom term CCIS as well because we just need to add some

101
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,570
underline for it.

102
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,830
So I'm going to add a class name here.

103
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,070
And then we just want to add some underline here.

104
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,970
If we just write Down Under.

105
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:17,780
When we hover over it, we want to add underline.

106
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,280
On the line.

107
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,800
Now, when we hover over this Gmail, we see.

108
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,890
And the underline.

109
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,580
So we need to have two of this one.

110
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,620
Another one for the image, as you can see from the final version.

111
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:46,720
So I'm going to copy this one using alt shift arrow down.

112
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,920
And this one is going to be images.

113
00:09:53,970 --> 00:10:00,270
Which is going to go to image that Google.com.

114
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,760
So, for example, here, this Gmail or image, when we click on images, this is going to go, Oh,

115
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,440
I think this one is image image.

116
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,240
All right.

117
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,750
So when we click on images, it's going to redirect us to images that Google does come.

118
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:24,370
Okay.

119
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:36,510
And if you just redirect the person to your own pages, you're not going to refresh the page.

120
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:42,710
It's just going to be instant because this is coming from the next year's forward slash link.

121
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:49,100
And also if you check the SEO for if you check the quick source viewer.

122
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:56,580
You can see that an anchor tag is added automatically inside.

123
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:05,720
So the link tag is actually a div and also an anchor tag inside.

124
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,050
And the class that we have added is added to the anchor tag.

125
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,660
So the edge strip is there.

126
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,660
And also you can see the closing tag.

127
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,170
And so this is very good for SEO purposes.

128
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,100
Oh, sorry.

129
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:31,330
This device we have already, we added the link tag is only added the anchor tag, but this one behaves

130
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,510
differently in in our own website.

131
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,400
It doesn't refresh the page.

132
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,140
So we go back to our website, we bring it to the right side.

133
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,050
So let's add the button as well at the here.

134
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,320
So just under the link tag, first we need to add this icon.

135
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,870
So I'm going to create this icon using a package called React Icons.

136
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,860
So we need to go to Google and we search for.

137
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,930
React.

138
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,280
Icons.

139
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:14,050
And in the search result, we see a GitHub repository.

140
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:22,870
Called uh react dash icons dot GitHub, dot io forward slash react icons.

141
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,920
This is a GitHub link and if you click on it.

142
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,150
We see that this website.

143
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,010
Risk icons any.

144
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:40,780
If you want to have any types of icons you can find here, they have a collection of all the places.

145
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:52,090
For example, if you are familiar with the hero icons or material design icons and also even found awesome

146
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:59,980
icons, all of them are here, so we don't need to install them individually so we can find them separately

147
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,430
here.

148
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,690
The first thing we need to do to use this package is to install it.

149
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,500
So we need to just write down MP and install React icons.

150
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,010
Dash v dash save.

151
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,790
So I'm going to copy this.

152
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:23,130
Go back to Visual Studio Code and we stop the server using Control C, press Y, and we can paste the.

153
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:24,680
Code.

154
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,020
To install it.

155
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,920
This is going to install the package.

156
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:39,790
And for using that, we just need to search the icon here and imported from React icons and add it as

157
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,900
a component inside our website.

158
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:51,850
So I'm going to search for that icon that I want to add is called Grids Grid Dots.

159
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,760
So you just for example, you want to find something similar.

160
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,030
You just write grid and find your icon.

161
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,660
And this is from all these places.

162
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,110
So we just say, I want it.

163
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:11,770
My icon is called Grid Dot, so I'm going to search for that.

164
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:17,200
And if you click on it, this is going to copy the the tag for you.

165
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:24,850
And if you come back here, we can start the server again using NPM run dev.

166
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,290
And here we can add the icon.

167
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:40,210
So I'm going to open a tag, paste the icon and close it and we need to import it as well at the top.

168
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,880
So we're just going to import.

169
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,640
As you can see, we get a suggestion like that.

170
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:55,220
But this is going to be inside here and it's coming from.

171
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,720
Reacts.

172
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,890
Dash icons.

173
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,690
Forward slash.

174
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:13,660
This one is this started with TB so it's going to be react dash icons slash TB.

175
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:22,040
So if you get it from font awesome, it starts from f b and you need to add PHP at the end.

176
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:28,400
So now we should see the icon inside our website after refreshing the page.

177
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:32,840
Okay.

178
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,730
We need to wait after the.

179
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,800
We start the server.

180
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,530
Okay, Now we see the icon here.

181
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,290
So let's add some effect to the icon.

182
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,350
So here inside the icon, I'm going to add a class name.

183
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,740
So the.

184
00:15:53,710 --> 00:16:03,250
Classes we need to add is firstly think First I want to change the background colour to be transparent

185
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:08,860
in the normal time, but when we hover over it I want to have a different background colour.

186
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,060
So transparent for the background.

187
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,300
Then when we hover over it.

188
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,320
I want to change the background color to be gray.

189
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,980
200.

190
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,220
So now we should see the grey colour here, but it's completely square.

191
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:41,880
I want to make it rounded, so I'm going to add rounded fold to make it fully rounded, which is equal

192
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,250
to border radius.

193
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,940
It at 10,000 pixels.

194
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,900
All right, so.

195
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:58,330
After this, we're going to make it a bigger by just saying takes.

196
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,940
Four x.

197
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,580
L.

198
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:09,500
The reason you see it so big, because I have added a zoom level 3000.

199
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:17,450
So for you to to see it better, but actually this is three times or four times as smaller than you

200
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,320
see here.

201
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,220
And then.

202
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:29,610
We want to add some padding of two pixels, so add some space between the background and the icon.

203
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,560
So now we see it like that.

204
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,730
So after that, we're going to add the button here.

205
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:41,910
So as you can see, this class became three dots because we are using that

206
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,150
extension called inline fold.

207
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,040
If you haven't installed it yet, you can solve it.

208
00:17:53,040 --> 00:18:02,100
And this is going to help you to have a when you don't see this class, this is going to be disappeared.

209
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,910
So it's going to help you to easily read your code.

210
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,160
So after this icon, we're going to add a button.

211
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,500
Saying, sign in.

212
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,840
And then we're going to style this button as well.

213
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,100
So the style is background blue.

214
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,930
We change the background color to be blue 500.

215
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,840
And then we change the text color to be white.

216
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:48,880
And after that, we're going to add a padding in the x axis of six and in the Y axis of two.

217
00:18:52,750 --> 00:19:03,700
And we can change the font weight to be medium, which is equal to font weight.

218
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,780
500.

219
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:15,470
So now after that, we're going to add and we want to make it rounded a little bit in the corner.

220
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,920
So we're going to add the rounded to be medium.

221
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,040
And when we hover over it.

222
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,700
We want to have a brightness.

223
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,470
Of 105%.

224
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:40,590
So now when we hover over it, we see it gets a little bit brighter.

225
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,840
So like this.

226
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,010
And also we want to add some shadow, too.

227
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:54,360
So when we hover over it, we want to have a shadow of media.

228
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,700
You see a small shadow under that.

229
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,930
So if you want to make it a little bit smooth, that changes.

230
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,840
You can add some transition.

231
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,260
For example, transition on the shadow.

232
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:21,140
So when we hover over it, you see the changes a little bit slower.

233
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:21,830
All right.

234
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,070
So now let me decrease the size.

235
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,590
So this is the actual size.

236
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,680
Now, the things we want to do is just bring them to the right side.

237
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:39,710
So we need to install them using the diff here we have at the top.

238
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,600
So we need to first think first we need to install this dev.

239
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,170
First, we added the class inside the header.

240
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,650
We're going to bring them next to each other by changing the display to flex.

241
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,770
So actually this is going to be a.

242
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:09,490
Because this is a diff, we need to change the flex here to bring them next to each other.

243
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,740
But this flex is going to help you to push it to the right side.

244
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,000
Now displays flex here.

245
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:26,590
And then we can just change the just to fly content and to push them to the right side.

246
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:36,730
And also we can add some padding of five so we have some space between them and the role of the browser.

247
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:47,350
And also we can use the text is M to make the text a little bit smaller for these two text.

248
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,450
Then for here we want to add some space between them.

249
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:57,540
So we just say a space X for, for these icons.

250
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:01,540
Now they, they get a little space between them.

251
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,220
This is a very useful.

252
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,390
And it's exclusive for 12 seasons.

253
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:16,550
And if you check that and see this syntax, as you can see by for adding this simple class, we need

254
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:28,820
to work a lot in the CSS part, but the services automatically create these classes syntax for us because

255
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:34,100
this is going to add a space only between the icons, not before or after.

256
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,540
So this is very helpful.

257
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:43,880
So after that we want to bring them all of them in the same row vertically.

258
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,990
We want to align them.

259
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:51,680
So we're going to use something called Items center, which is going to bring the items.

260
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,820
Exactly.

261
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,980
In the center vertically.

262
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,610
So this is the mobile screen.

263
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:02,940
And in the bigger size, we see them like this.

264
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,390
Okay.

265
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,450
That was it for the creating the header section for the home page.

266
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:24,880
Let's add this one to the GitHub by using contour shift G opening the source control.

267
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:33,250
And here we can add everything to GitHub using this plus icon and we just create a message for that

268
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,030
which is going to be add.

269
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,440
Let me.

270
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,350
Pipe down at all.

271
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:46,990
Header.

272
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,240
And we can just see components here.

273
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:59,330
So we can just commit and push using this icon and click on the commit and push.

274
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:04,160
This is going to apply the changes inside our GitHub repository.

275
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,820
Let's go back to our GitHub repository.

276
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,790
We click here to go back to the home page of our GitHub repository.

277
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,510
As you can see, we have.

278
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,900
Now.

279
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:26,620
Four commits and the last commit is add home header component.

280
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,970
So let's review what we have done here.

281
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,390
We have installed a package called React Icons.

282
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,600
To get the icons for our website.

283
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:44,950
We can use this for later as well to add more icons inside and different parts of the website.

284
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:54,160
Then also inside the page that we have just selected this whole text and we have added our home header

285
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,300
component.

286
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:05,770
Inside we have created a component called Home Header dot JSX, which is importing a link tag from next

287
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:14,710
forward slash link, which is helping us to create a link tag for our Gmail and images.

288
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:19,300
And also we have imported an icon from React Icons.

289
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,850
Then you have to added the header tag for the parent.

290
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:33,110
And inside that we have a dev which includes the to link tag to gmail and images.

291
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:37,370
And also we have an icon grid dot icon.

292
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,510
And finally we have a button saying sign in.

293
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:47,420
So in the next section, we're going to work on the body part of the home page.

294
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,050
So we're going to create this section here.

295
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,150
So see you in the next section.
