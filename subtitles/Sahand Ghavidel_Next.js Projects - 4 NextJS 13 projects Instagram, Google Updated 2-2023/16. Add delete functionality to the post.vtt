1
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:07.740
Alright.

2
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.600
In the last section we have completed their like functionality and we were able to align and remove

3
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.870
their likes from their firestorm.

4
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.720
In this section, we are going to add to the leading functionality we want to when we click on this

5
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.850
trash icon, we want to delete the posts.

6
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:39.450
But first we want to be sure that this person who is signing is the owner of the post.

7
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:50.750
So for example, this Sandra reader cannot remove or delete the post from this quote.

8
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.380
It's a hand one.

9
00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:00.570
Okay, so let's go back to Visual Studio code and we find a trash on.

10
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.390
Uh, it should be inside poster as inside components folder.

11
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.360
So we have a trash icon here.

12
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.640
So we want to add a tourney operator if the person.

13
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.300
Always is signing.

14
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.560
Has the same idea.

15
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.840
The person who created the post.

16
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.340
So how do we know that?

17
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:37.010
So we if you look at the database, each post has a unique ID and also the idea of the person who created

18
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.200
the post is saved in the the field to make.

19
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:52.380
So we want to check that if this idea is equal to the ads, the idea that we get from session.

20
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.160
Okay.

21
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.680
So let's first check the if we imported this session.

22
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.270
Yeah.

23
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.140
We have the station here, so let's check it.

24
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.110
So here we say if this session.

25
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.140
Session.

26
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.880
That's user, but we can protect that too if the we don't get an error here service.

27
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.680
Yes just say session that user dot user ID is equal to.

28
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.110
And, uh, just say.

29
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.950
Post.

30
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.960
So if you remember, we can get the near post I.D. here inside the database.

31
00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:00.690
We can get the this I.D. using post that I.D. But for getting this I.D., we need to have post that

32
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.030
data, that I.D..

33
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.260
Okay.

34
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.320
So this is different from this one.

35
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.200
And in other posts they see this is the owner.

36
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.360
This is the idea that a fire story is automatically created for our posts.

37
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.560
Okay.

38
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.430
So here we just say post dot data.

39
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.670
That's.

40
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.000
I'd.

41
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.470
And, uh.

42
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.850
We can protect this one, too.

43
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.930
Okay.

44
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.530
If this one is true, we want to show the trash icon.

45
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.150
So we bring this trash icon inside.

46
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.830
Now, if you look at our website.

47
00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.470
We cannot see the trash again because this post, this one and this one is created by someone else.

48
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.340
Okay.

49
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.110
But if you create another post for us, for example.

50
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.200
We just say.

51
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.130
And JavaScript.

52
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.170
King.

53
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.530
You too.

54
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.750
Channel That is my channel name.

55
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.970
So we can't.

56
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.240
Just tweet this one.

57
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.680
You can see that now.

58
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.140
We can delete this because we have the icon here, but we can add the functionality for everything now.

59
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.480
But we cannot have access for deleting icon for other posts.

60
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:53.350
Okay.

61
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.940
That was the first step.

62
00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:03.520
The next step is to addict on click to the trash icon and we trigger a function.

63
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:15.480
Which deletes the and this posts completely from our firstly from Firestorm database and also we want

64
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.200
to delete it at least this image from the storage as well.

65
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:28.610
So let's go back to Visual Studio code and we go to Trash Icon, we add on Click Event.

66
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.620
And we just trigger a functionality called a function delete.

67
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.260
Post.

68
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.320
Okay.

69
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.780
And we're going to create it here at a top.

70
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:53.040
Just after like post we create another function and this is going to be async function to.

71
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.640
I recall this one late.

72
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.150
Post.

73
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.640
I think Kerry doesn't need this one.

74
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.260
Okay.

75
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.580
That's fine.

76
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.100
I think we missed the trap.

77
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.970
Okay.

78
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.350
No.

79
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.730
When we add this, a function is called we want to delete the document.

80
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.510
So we just say Delete Doc.

81
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.350
This is a building function for fire store.

82
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.880
And so we already import it, I think.

83
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.330
Because we use it before, I think.

84
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:50.590
Uh, let me see if we have the delete talk because we use it here for deleting the likes.

85
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.920
Then we have the dock.

86
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.430
We want to have the reference.

87
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.690
The reference is dark.

88
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.240
And you on it in the database.

89
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:11.680
We want to check the Post's collection and if we want to delete the document post.

90
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:21.210
That I.D. the document with their I.D. and we're getting the I.D. here from the input posts.

91
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.070
So this idea, as I mentioned before.

92
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.610
Is this I.D.?

93
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.480
Okay.

94
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.890
We want to delete this phone completely from here to the end.

95
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.010
Whatever is inside is going to be deleted.

96
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:38.970
Okay.

97
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:49.100
So for example, I think this is the first one week I created the JavaScript Kink YouTube channel.

98
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.610
Let's test this 1/1 and let's go to.

99
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.110
Our website.

100
00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.060
Refresh the page.

101
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:02.920
Okay.

102
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:06.910
We are signed in with this Twitter account.

103
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:08.890
We can delete this.

104
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.930
So we click on this.

105
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:12.910
Okay.

106
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.510
It's gone.

107
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.080
Let's check the database.

108
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.740
I see the that.

109
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:23.990
Document.

110
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:30.720
In that document inside the post collection is completely off.

111
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:31.830
But.

112
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.380
They're still in the storage.

113
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.240
We still have that image.

114
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:45.870
If you check now inside the post folder inside this storage, now we have four images.

115
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.580
So we want to add the ability to delete the.

116
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.490
Delete from the storage too.

117
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.380
So the function for deleting the storage is delete.

118
00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.310
Uh, delete objects.

119
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.870
We need to import it from Firebase Storage.

120
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:12.740
And.

121
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.180
Yeah.

122
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:20.840
For the reference, we had a reference here because we want to know which which one to delete.

123
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:29.090
So we import reference to and the reference is from a storage that we need to import a storage from

124
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.730
uh, fire.

125
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:39.120
If fiber is storage, we need to we need to bring it inside from the fireplace.

126
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.820
If we remember in Firebase that yes, we export it there.

127
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.260
DB And his storage is the storage is a data from our storage, so.

128
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.890
We want to know which is stories to tell.

129
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.460
So here we are, the stories as well.

130
00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.340
So now we can use it.

131
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.500
So inside this storage.

132
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.440
We want to delete.

133
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:08.720
Firstly, we check this all.

134
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.740
All of them are inside a folder called posts.

135
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.150
So we need to add posts here.

136
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.640
After this.

137
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.040
We have a forest lash and we have the post IED.

138
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:25.580
This is.

139
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:33.770
And if you check now, this is post I.D. and if you go to fast store.

140
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.840
Database.

141
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.350
I open it.

142
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.190
A new window.

143
00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:40.640
Uh.

144
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.660
For example, these fun v.

145
00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:44.410
If i.

146
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.330
This one verify.

147
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:54.580
This is just to post I.D. so we can add the post I.D. here.

148
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.290
And after that, we just say image because, uh.

149
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:05.840
Inside here, if you click the name of the image, it's just image.

150
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.490
Okay.

151
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.140
And it can be a different image.

152
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:17.370
This one is, for example, a beef passport image that a beef maybe the other one is different.

153
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:22.800
Depends on the what type of image we uploaded.

154
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.380
We get different things.

155
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.190
Yeah, this is PG, for example.

156
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.390
So we don't mention the pattern and the format.

157
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.430
We just say image.

158
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.930
Okay, let's try this.

159
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.500
Let's go back here and we upload another.

160
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:42.070
One.

161
00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.060
I just write down whatever.

162
00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:48.280
Uh, here.

163
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.980
Okay.

164
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.690
Well, let's tweet this.

165
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.470
Okay.

166
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.540
Let's check our database.

167
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.150
So we just refresh the storage.

168
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.160
We should have now five images.

169
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.990
And we have a new.

170
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:21.940
Yeah.

171
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:24.010
This this phone with this text.

172
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.150
This is dummy text.

173
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.570
I did.

174
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.620
So they post IDs.

175
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.710
Why B, why?

176
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.890
And here we have yby2.

177
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:38.080
So by deleting this, we should delete this one and this one together.

178
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.730
So let's try it.

179
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.390
So here we click on Delete.

180
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.130
So it's gone.

181
00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:47.270
Okay.

182
00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.200
Let's go.

183
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.530
Refresh the page why be why you remember?

184
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:55.530
That's so v refresh.

185
00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:57.810
We shouldn't see y y anymore.

186
00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:58.280
Okay.

187
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:03.660
In the storage is gone and also it's deleted from our database.

188
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.470
Okay, so that is working perfectly.

189
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.540
The only thing I want to add is.

190
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.050
Because the deleting is actually needs a confirmation.

191
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:24.120
So I want when we press delete, the browser asks us, are you sure about deleting the post?

192
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.620
And then when we confirm it, it's going to be deleted.

193
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.690
So let's add this file.

194
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:36.140
So inside that this function first we open.

195
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:37.800
We add a condition.

196
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.660
So we open a window.

197
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.900
And it's going to be a concern.

198
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:51.070
And we're just going to say, are you sure you want to delete this post if you get this suggestion from

199
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:51.760
Tap nine?

200
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.060
So now if this one is true.

201
00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:58.150
We want to do it this.

202
00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.040
Okay.

203
00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.750
Otherwise it's not going to be delayed.

204
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:07.330
Okay, so let's try it.

205
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.910
Let's upload another time.

206
00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:12.370
Okay.

207
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.060
They tweeted.

208
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.250
No, we can do it.

209
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:27.320
So when we press on delete, we get a confirmation window.

210
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.630
Are you sure you want to delete this post?

211
00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.380
If you press okay, you're going to delete.

212
00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.670
If you press cancer.

213
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:35.630
You don't delete it.

214
00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.610
So let's try one more time.

215
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:38.090
You press.

216
00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:38.510
Okay.

217
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.960
And we don't see the post anymore.

218
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.580
Yeah, that was it for this section for deleting.

219
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.690
So let's add this one to get half.

220
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:55.300
We just take it at all and we add a message.

221
00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.480
Uh, we just say at.

222
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:03.510
Delete.

223
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:07.990
Functionality.

224
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.420
To the post.

225
00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:14.850
Okay.

226
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.170
And they push it to get up.

227
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:23.680
Let's check and we refresh the page by clicking on this tweeter.

228
00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:29.860
Now we have 16 comments and last one is created 10 seconds ago.

229
00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.510
Right click on that.

230
00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:39.100
So as you can see inside the post, such yes, we have imported stories from Firebase.

231
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:45.550
Also we have the imported delete object, a reference from Firebase Forest Storage.

232
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.630
We added a function for deleting the posts.

233
00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:57.330
First we asked a person that is sure about deleting by opening a window confirmation.

234
00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:05.430
Then we deleted the document from the database first and then we delete it from this storage.

235
00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:10.630
Uh.

236
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:12.950
Okay.

237
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:13.840
The another thing is.

238
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:15.080
Actually, I forgot.

239
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.690
Uh, I just remember that.

240
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.120
Let me show you something.

241
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.590
If this person tweets something.

242
00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.740
I think we need to start the server again.

243
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:33.740
Okay.

244
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.630
Let's refresh the page.

245
00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:45.060
So if the person tweets something without adding an image, we should get an error when we are deleting

246
00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:45.260
it.

247
00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.520
So I forgot to add that once.

248
00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:54.240
For example, if you just say hello without any image, okay, this post is here.

249
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.560
When we delete this, fine.

250
00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:01.050
We delete it, but we get an error because we don't have that image.

251
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:01.890
Okay.

252
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.120
So we just can avoid this one.

253
00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:09.310
Just adding a condition here as well.

254
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:10.230
We just see if.

255
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.220
The posts.

256
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.000
DOT data.

257
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:23.780
That image is existed, then deleted.

258
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:26.600
Okay.

259
00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:30.510
So let's try again.

260
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.560
So just say hello retweeted.

261
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:36.900
Now we delete.

262
00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:39.730
Okay.

263
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.570
We didn't get any error.

264
00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:44.740
Okay.

265
00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:51.880
Uh, let's add this one real quick to get half as an update.

266
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:55.840
So just say the same message.

267
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:58.150
We just stay updated.

268
00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:08.830
Updated for.

269
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.270
Uh.

270
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:14.570
Deleting.

271
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:17.280
Image.

272
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.120
The only thing error or deletion.

273
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:25.220
Image delete error.

274
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:27.480
Okay.

275
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.910
If pushed is fun to get to.

276
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:31.910
Okay.

277
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.770
Let's continue to review what we have done.

278
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.400
So inside of trash icon we added.

279
00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:43.510
Uh.

280
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:44.860
Yeah.

281
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.510
The trash in the trash can be added on on click event.

282
00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:54.430
So it's going to trigger the this delete host function.

283
00:18:54.970 --> 00:19:03.450
And also we add a, uh, we have added a condition that if the person is signing has created the post

284
00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.250
is the owner of the post can delete it.

285
00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:08.380
So you can see the trash icon.

286
00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:09.670
Okay.

287
00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.320
That was it for this section.

288
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:13.110
Uh.

289
00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:18.660
In the next section we keep continue adding functionality to our project.

290
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.310
So seeing the next section.
