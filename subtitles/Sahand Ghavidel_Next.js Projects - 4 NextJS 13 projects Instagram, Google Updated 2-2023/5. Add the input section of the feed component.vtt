1
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.200
All.

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.810
In the last section we have completed the header part of the feed section.

3
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.500
In this section we are going to create the input section.

4
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.060
If you look at the final version of the project, you can see that.

5
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.110
Let me throw it.

6
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.970
We have a diff here.

7
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.030
That has an image on the left side.

8
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.910
Fact is this, Dave.

9
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.460
And then we have another div.

10
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.260
That is covering.

11
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.970
The input section and also the down section.

12
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.490
So this is an input.

13
00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:00.250
And finally, we have another div that is having two icons from here icons.

14
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:09.870
And also we have at Button, the icons has the same hovering effect as we created here.

15
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.830
So we can use the same hover effect class for these icons as well for the inputs.

16
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.140
As you can see, we have a placeholder of what's happening.

17
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.170
And if you write something, you can see that this is a scrollable and also you can change the size

18
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.130
of this as well.

19
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.300
Okay.

20
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.830
Uh.

21
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.570
For the archive, opening the images and opening the emojis.

22
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.970
We will do it later.

23
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:54.850
We just now make the UI and for the image as well.

24
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.260
We have a hover of fact.

25
00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.050
So just now we are making the UI after our projects.

26
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.590
Later we are going to add functionality to the project.

27
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.380
For the input section, we are going to create another component.

28
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:20.510
So let's go back to Visual Studio code and we keep open the localhost, 3000 on the right side.

29
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.490
Let's go to let's open the.

30
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:34.230
Explorer section using Control B and we create a new component and we call it input.

31
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.770
That.

32
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.440
Jesus.

33
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.110
We can use our C to create a react functional component.

34
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:52.500
We don't need this import react from React because we're using next year and let's import this and bring

35
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.600
it to index edges.

36
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.070
Let's close this sidebar.

37
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.030
And uh, now we need to add it to the that.

38
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.660
Yes, sorry.

39
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.820
So just after this dinner that we had our header.

40
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.640
Now we add the input component.

41
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.350
We can alter imported.

42
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.480
And we closed the attack.

43
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.930
If you refresh the page, we should see the input now.

44
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.330
The text that we are getting from here.

45
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.150
All right.

46
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.480
Let's start with the.

47
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.130
Inside this, dear.

48
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.240
First we add an image tag.

49
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.050
For the image here.

50
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.850
So I'm going to again use a static image, but later we're going to get this image from Google.

51
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.800
So.

52
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.870
As I can use this same image we were using for the sidebar.

53
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.690
This this image here.

54
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.010
So I can get it here so I can just right click and copy.

55
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.120
Image address.

56
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.060
So we get the image adverts again.

57
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.120
They're out.

58
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.590
The alternative text can be user image.

59
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.380
After the image, as I mentioned.

60
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.560
As I mentioned before, we have a.

61
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.150
Diff that is covering both the input and the bottom section.

62
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.970
So one input here and one diff there.

63
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.540
And also another diff that is covering the text area.

64
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.900
So here we added div and inside it's there we add another div.

65
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:59.070
And inside the div the second day we add the text area, we just say text.

66
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.700
Area.

67
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.870
You can use contour space too to add the auto import.

68
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.830
We don't need to name or I.D..

69
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.220
Also, we don't need columns for this one, but for the role we just choose.

70
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.590
Maybe two is enough.

71
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.840
So we can see it here in the text area.

72
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.320
You just add a placeholder and a placeholder would be what's happening?

73
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.360
Just.

74
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.580
As you can see here, we've got the place holder as well.

75
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.360
And let's style it later.

76
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.120
So after this, Dev.

77
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.460
We are going to have another day that is covering the hour images.

78
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:09.960
And also important, as you can see from the final version, these icons and also the button.

79
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:12.910
So we had the beer.

80
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.990
And first thing in the deer is the emojis.

81
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:25.570
But we put both of the emojis inside a diff because we want to use the Flexbox.

82
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.820
Bring them next to each other.

83
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.750
So we use another day for the icons.

84
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.680
And the icons we're going to use is photograph icon and also emoji happy icons.

85
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.240
So I can use.

86
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.790
Uh, if for two.

87
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.340
Photograph icon.

88
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.640
This one, we are getting the auto suggestion.

89
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.510
Let's close this.

90
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.550
You should see it now.

91
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.720
And the next icon is.

92
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.310
Emoji.

93
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:06.740
Happy outcome.

94
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:10.740
This one.

95
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:22.260
Let's make these emojis a smaller file and a dual curse.

96
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.440
It wasn't all.

97
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.130
I had a class name.

98
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.130
And we just set the height.

99
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.710
Maybe heights?

100
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:37.640
Yeah.

101
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:38.180
Heights.

102
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.190
We said it to be ten.

103
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.870
It's a bit bleak now, but I want to add padding.

104
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.240
So the padding is going to push it inside.

105
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.220
So that's just fine.

106
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.130
So you just add a width of tennis ball.

107
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.670
So later I'm going to style it.

108
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.230
Let's continue and finish and add the button as well.

109
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.500
I would like to always create everything first and then a silence.

110
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.500
So first here we add the button.

111
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.270
The button was just a tweet.

112
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.100
You can see everything now.

113
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.680
Let's just start styling our project first with a start.

114
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:27.980
This.

115
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.970
Haymitch and make it smaller.

116
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:37.800
So we add a class name for image and the.

117
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.100
We set the height and width to.

118
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.440
11.

119
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.690
Then we make it around it.

120
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:53.970
Actually, my image is rounded, but if you're using a square image.

121
00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:04.800
You should make it rounded like this rounded form and we add a cursor pointer so we have a pointing

122
00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.420
hand when we hover over the image.

123
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.020
And finally, when we hover over it, I want to change the brightness to be 95%.

124
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.390
So it becomes a little bit darker when we hover over it.

125
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:24.970
Yeah.

126
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.310
That was it for the image.

127
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.720
Let's bring everything next to each other.

128
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:36.470
So we in the above div, I add a class and I make the display flex.

129
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.080
So we bring everything next to each other.

130
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:42.120
And.

131
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.150
We add a border at the bottom.

132
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:50.740
So.

133
00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:52.420
Bottom.

134
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.890
We have Australian cases.

135
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.780
We just need to say border be.

136
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.030
We can see it here.

137
00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.330
Then we changed the colour of the border to.

138
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.020
Gray.

139
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:08.720
200.

140
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.840
To make it consistent for the above and other things.

141
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.970
Then we added padding of trees.

142
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:23.940
So we push everything inside like this and we add a space between there.

143
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.650
So we just see space.

144
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.810
Three can see the space between the image and these tanks.

145
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:32.160
And.

146
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.110
The other things we want to do.

147
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:44.760
I want to make this one to have the full size in from here.

148
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:47.050
We have it.

149
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:55.330
So, uh, in the div that is covering everything we just and the weight of all.

150
00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:59.870
But still we cannot see the full week.

151
00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:05.680
We need to add this with full to the class and text area as well as the text area.

152
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:11.470
We add a class name and we sit with to be full as well.

153
00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.010
Now we see that this came until here.

154
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.310
For styling the text area.

155
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:24.690
I always recommend to install a package called.

156
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.620
At to CSF forms.

157
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:34.960
The address is this form package actually is going to package or we call it plug in.

158
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:44.100
And it's going to add a basic styling for forms in our project.

159
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:50.590
And when we are using our website in different browsers, we don't see a different shape or different

160
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:50.980
things.

161
00:11:52.060 --> 00:12:01.120
Uh, I always, when I write, when I install this plug in, I never had any problem with the forms

162
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.860
because different browsers treat their forms in a different way.

163
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.500
So we in the Google, we search for Tilman CSF forms.

164
00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:16.460
And in the search results, just skip the first one.

165
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:22.580
The second one is a GitHub repository and the name is Tailwind Labs.

166
00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:26.510
Forest slash children's uses the ash forms.

167
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:28.700
So we click on this.

168
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.200
First we need to install it.

169
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.080
So we copy this NPN install code and we go here.

170
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.600
We stop the server using controversy.

171
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.740
And we pasted a link.

172
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.910
It pays to, quote, hear our press enter.

173
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:56.310
The next thing we need to do, we go to tailwind that convicted jazz and we add this plug in.

174
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.850
Here.

175
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:02.750
Inside the plug ins, we add this tailwind to this form.

176
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.440
So we copied this from required to the apprentices.

177
00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:11.540
And we go to tell that conflict that J.S..

178
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.400
And inside the plug we paste the link.

179
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:21.840
Just require an inside of parenthesis and exit of.

180
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:27.670
Quote, We just write at Children's Justice for a slash form.

181
00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:36.640
Now, if you start a server using an pin drawn diff, we should see a change inside the form.

182
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.220
Let's refresh the page.

183
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.590
Now we can see that we have a different form.

184
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:56.040
We have black borders and when we focus on the Yeah form by clicking on it easier border.

185
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:58.580
Change to blue.

186
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.780
So let's close this tailwind.

187
00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:07.010
That conflict, that Jesus file and.

188
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.980
Let's continue a style our text area.

189
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:18.350
Next thinks we remove the border using border now.

190
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:22.680
So.

191
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:28.190
And then when I focus, I don't want to see this blue line as well.

192
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.540
So here we just save the focus.

193
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:37.260
And I want to ring around the border to be zero.

194
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.210
So now we don't see it anymore.

195
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:47.160
Let's change the, uh, like a font size.

196
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:50.300
And the.

197
00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.210
And we just had text to be large.

198
00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.670
And let's change the color of the place.

199
00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.180
HOLDER So we're just a place holder.

200
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:11.560
And the set the color to be gray 700, which is a little bit darker.

201
00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:14.000
And the.

202
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.390
I want this more space between the characters up there.

203
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.360
What's happening?

204
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.260
So we can use tracking.

205
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.190
White.

206
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:29.600
Just pay attention to.

207
00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.960
It see a little bit space.

208
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:43.440
It's like a line, a spacing in the text, but for a placeholder, we just add tracking white.

209
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.860
And we set the mean heights of this.

210
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.840
To be 50 pixels.

211
00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.370
This is the height from here to here.

212
00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.070
And then let's add a border here.

213
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.390
So we separate it like this.

214
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.150
And the.

215
00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:11.740
Before that.

216
00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.700
Let's change the color of the text too.

217
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.290
So when we write something here.

218
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:19.250
Uh.

219
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:24.030
I want the text to be gray.

220
00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.080
700.

221
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.490
Okay.

222
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:32.040
So that's it for this part.

223
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:38.870
Let's add this border at the bottom like the one we have in the final version.

224
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:39.410
This one.

225
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.440
I see it's moving to.

226
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:48.610
Uh, so we can do a trick here.

227
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:50.790
At.

228
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:54.950
Here.

229
00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.180
Out of here.

230
00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.140
We can add.

231
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.030
We just said divide.

232
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.790
So divide this part and this far.

233
00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.070
In the Y axis.

234
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:21.010
And we set the colour of the divide to be.

235
00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.260
Gray.

236
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.170
200.

237
00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.770
Actually, we need to change.

238
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:34.600
We put this one.

239
00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.070
Here in the top there.

240
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:42.710
Because we want to divide the area and the east of here.

241
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:47.180
So we should put it here so now we can see it.

242
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.980
And the.

243
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:57.210
I deleted that with full.

244
00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.400
So that's fine.

245
00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.070
This part.

246
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:08.040
So let's start styling this emoji.

247
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.730
The icons and the bond button.

248
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:20.910
As I mentioned before, we're going to use the same hover effect we added for the icons.

249
00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.610
So for both of these.

250
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:30.070
We had a dual cursor and we add.

251
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:32.310
The hover effect.

252
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:34.800
Class.

253
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.550
Now.

254
00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.910
We should see something behind when we hover over there.

255
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.590
And, uh, let's add some padding here.

256
00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:51.160
So the padding would be two, which is eight pixels.

257
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.490
You can see it like that.

258
00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:57.660
And I don't want the background color to be gray.

259
00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:07.470
I want it to be a bluish color so we can use a color called a sky, which is similar to blue but is

260
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.010
different.

261
00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.560
So you just say a.

262
00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:23.230
First we change the colour of the icons by using text sky and the amount of the colour I want to use

263
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:24.970
is 500.

264
00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.800
And for the background color.

265
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.660
So when we hover over it, I want the background color to be a sky.

266
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:37.340
But 100.

267
00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:40.600
So it's like this.

268
00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.040
Then I want the icons to be next to each other.

269
00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:55.780
So here at the tip that is covering the icons, we changed the display to flex and we bring them.

270
00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:57.890
Uh.

271
00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:58.720
That is enough.

272
00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.810
I want this button to be here.

273
00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.230
So we change the displayed flags here as well.

274
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:12.600
And we bring them horizontally next to each other.

275
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:14.970
By using.

276
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:17.310
Sorry.

277
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:20.730
Vertically next to each other, using items.

278
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:21.700
Sorry.

279
00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:29.060
Uh, we cannot see the result yet, because with the tweet, the button is still not styled.

280
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:38.820
But do you know that the intent center and justify a center is to bring the item inside a dif vertically

281
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.620
and horizontally center?

282
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:49.550
So we add the items center and we add justify justify between.

283
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.180
So push this one to the end.

284
00:20:55.490 --> 00:21:00.050
And we had a pat patting tarp of 2.5.

285
00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:03.470
So add some space between them and the top.

286
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:07.420
So everything is working.

287
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:11.890
Everything is nice for the icons and the input section.

288
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:12.730
Yes.

289
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:13.840
Refresh the page.

290
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.390
Let's install this button.

291
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.750
For the bottom.

292
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:26.030
We add a background color of blue.

293
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.450
400.

294
00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:33.090
We changed the text to be white.

295
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:38.630
Let's add some.

296
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:48.060
Padding ex of four and padding y of 1.5.

297
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.500
Then we make it rounded using a rounded.

298
00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.410
Full.

299
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:59.720
And let's change the text.

300
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:04.980
And to be bold by using font bold.

301
00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:18.050
And finally we have we can just add a shadow effect by using shadow medium.

302
00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:24.330
And for harboring effect.

303
00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.450
I want the.

304
00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:35.210
When we hover over it, I want to change the brightness to be 95% as we did before for other things.

305
00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:45.650
The only thing left is when it's disabled.

306
00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:50.600
Like in the final version, it's default is disabled.

307
00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.540
But when you write something, we see it's enabled.

308
00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.190
So the disabled.

309
00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.720
A version is different.

310
00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:01.070
So let's make the.

311
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:05.710
But tend to be disabled by default.

312
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.050
So we're just say disabled here.

313
00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.120
Now it's disabled.

314
00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:13.540
But the as you can see, the.

315
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.000
The styling is the same.

316
00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:28.120
So for disabled we just say if disabled, I want, uh, let's change the capacity to be 50%.

317
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.560
So you can see the disabled is like this.

318
00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.330
So let's remove the disabled for now.

319
00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:38.750
But later we going to disable it dynamically based on the.

320
00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.090
If someone upload the image or write something.

321
00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.540
And we we see that.

322
00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.800
We see it disabled.

323
00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:48.120
All right.

324
00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.430
But for now, we just leave it like this.

325
00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.820
And that was it for the input section.

326
00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:02.790
Let's add everything to GitHub, so we just take it at all.

327
00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.170
And we just.

328
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:07.140
Commit.

329
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.670
iMessage and iMessage would be.

330
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.820
And.

331
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:15.050
The input.

332
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.300
Fiction.

333
00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:23.770
Of.

334
00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.720
The feed component.

335
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:38.060
So let's push this one to get up and we review what we have done so far.

336
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.930
So we refresh the page by just clicking on this tweeter.

337
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:51.740
Now we have five commands in our repository, and if you click on it, we can see the last one is at

338
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.500
the input section of the feed component.

339
00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:01.750
In the end, we created inside the fetus.

340
00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.010
We added the input.

341
00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:10.630
Component and we created the input that JS component inside the components folder.

342
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:18.090
So we had an image for the user profile image and then we had.

343
00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:26.390
At DIF that is covering the text area and also the icons on the bottom.

344
00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.040
So yeah.

345
00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:39.360
And also we have install tailwind thesis forums to make and to add the basic styling to the forms.

346
00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:45.300
And we added this plug in to the tailwind that conflicts.

347
00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:46.690
Yeah.

348
00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.010
That was it for the input section in this.

349
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:54.250
In the next section we start creating the post area.

350
00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:57.040
We create this post section.

351
00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:02.410
First we create a dummy data for this using for the post section.

352
00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:11.200
But later we're going to get all the post data dynamically from our database, which is Firebase.

353
00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.720
So see in the next section.
