1
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:07,730
All right.

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:16,240
In the last six years, we have installed Nicks off and Firebase and we've got two API key for the firebase

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,860
and also the Google credentials.

4
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:26,410
In this section, we're going to complete the signing page of our project.

5
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:33,490
I only have, uh, I only made one mistake last with you.

6
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,870
We can fix it quickly.

7
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,220
This way.

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,340
Here, inside the Firebase touch is.

9
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,200
For API key view wrote process start and be firebase API key.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:53,970
But in India environmental variable we added the next public, but we forgot to add the next public

11
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:54,870
here as well.

12
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:03,780
Next public is added because if you don't do it, you're going to get an error when you're deploying

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,850
your side in production.

14
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,050
Mode and you're going to definitely get an error.

15
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:18,740
But in deployment or in development mode, maybe it's fine and you don't get any error.

16
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,270
Okay.

17
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:27,330
Let's continue and create our signing page by default.

18
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,510
Next off has a signing page by itself, but we want to create our own custom.

19
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,330
Signy page, so we should define it inside the next off thought.

20
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,110
Jesus.

21
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:47,890
So here, just after the providers, we can add the pages as well.

22
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,540
And here we just say this signing page.

23
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,570
You can write it like this or this way does not matter.

24
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,510
But the.

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,160
No, I think you should right here.

26
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:11,700
But here when you're defining the name of folks like signing.

27
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,220
You can add the hyphen here.

28
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,210
That's fine.

29
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,550
But you just leave it like this.

30
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:26,080
And now we inside the pages, we close everything.

31
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,960
Inside pages, we create a folder called off.

32
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,880
And inside this folder, we are going to create a page.

33
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,860
Call Signing Day at J.S..

34
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,300
We can use r, f, c to create a react functional component.

35
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,310
And, uh, let's bring it inside.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,630
Uh.

37
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,000
We don't need to do anything, actually.

38
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,520
And the.

39
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:10,370
We can just visited now I think where let's start a server using NPN and rendezvous.

40
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,210
And let's open it inside.

41
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,960
The Chrome.

42
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,880
Okay.

43
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:27,670
Okay.

44
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,460
Our page is loaded.

45
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:36,020
Now we can go to the page that we have created, which is for slash offering.

46
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,340
Slash sign.

47
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,120
Yeah.

48
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,230
Yeah.

49
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,100
You can see the pages created.

50
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:51,390
Now we need to continue at the complete this page.

51
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,600
So here inside this div.

52
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,070
Now, first of all, we need to get the providers.

53
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,820
As here we we we got the providers here from Google.

54
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:17,010
So we can get this providers using a building function from next off called get providers, but we can

55
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,560
use the server side rendering to do it.

56
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,560
And it's going to be very fast.

57
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,230
So here we just export.

58
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:35,200
It's in synchronous function because the get provide this function brings us a promise.

59
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,490
And so insulin a function.

60
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,310
And we just get server side prompts.

61
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:49,600
And inside this function, we're going to get the providers.

62
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,350
From.

63
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,210
Kit providers.

64
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,230
And we need to import this.

65
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,200
So let me import it at a top.

66
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,240
Just read the latest imports react from react.

67
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,440
We don't need it and we just need to import.

68
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,530
Get.

69
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,580
Providers.

70
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:31,820
From.

71
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,960
Knicks forward slash react.

72
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,530
And then we need to return it to pass it to our clients.

73
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,050
This is a server side.

74
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,340
This is a client side.

75
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,250
So we just return.

76
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:55,980
Props.

77
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,290
And the props.

78
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,790
We want to return is provider.

79
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:10,890
Now we can get this one inside our client's side as a props and restructure it like this.

80
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:12,510
Okay.

81
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,080
So inside this div first I want to add some image.

82
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,940
So let's search for an image.

83
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,230
Let me bring this one to the left and you can see our.

84
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,070
Page on the right side.

85
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,350
Its search for.

86
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,820
You know, Twitter.

87
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,790
And for images I want to image with phone.

88
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,530
But I wanted to be transparent.

89
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:05,300
So for tools, I go inside color and choose transparent.

90
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,060
This one or this one would be fine.

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,290
I just chose this one.

92
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:21,710
And then we right click on it and we click on copy image address and we pasted here.

93
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,310
And the alternative is to either.

94
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,570
Image.

95
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,940
Inside a phone.

96
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,020
Right now we see the image here.

97
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,530
After the image.

98
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,780
That's additive.

99
00:07:52,260 --> 00:08:01,620
And inside this stair we're going to now we can loop through the providers because this provider is

100
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,700
not only one.

101
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,520
Depends on the number of providers.

102
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:13,310
For example, in next off we can add many providers like Google Gear, Top Facebook and etc..

103
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,610
So we have to loop through it.

104
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,660
So we just.

105
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,120
And a curly braces.

106
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,700
And inside this one we get the value of the providers using object.

107
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,820
That value.

108
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,820
Values and.

109
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,020
We passed the providers.

110
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,250
And now we can map through it.

111
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,630
It was just a map and we get each provider here.

112
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,190
Now we can return.

113
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,230
Directly.

114
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,640
And here we create another div.

115
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,340
And inside that there, I want to add some Twitter image.

116
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:15,160
We are going at the same image we have in our sidebar.

117
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:23,170
So we go to the sidebar dots and we copy this image from there.

118
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,180
And we go back to signing that.

119
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:29,670
Yes.

120
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,680
Piece pasted you.

121
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,070
We should see an image here as well.

122
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,150
This alternative for this one is just Twitter logo.

123
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,230
Okay.

124
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,810
After this image, I'm going to add some.

125
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,220
I'm going to add some paragraph.

126
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,780
Wow.

127
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,590
I just want to say this at.

128
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,870
It's created.

129
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,350
For.

130
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,050
Learning purposes.

131
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:28,550
The reason I'm adding this one, because we want to tell the official Twitter owners when they accidentally

132
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,150
visit our website that this is just for.

133
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,140
Learning purposes and this is not a copy or we didn't try to

134
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,570
do the copywriting or something like that.

135
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:44,530
So.

136
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,250
So we have that on.

137
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,040
After this paragraph, we add a button.

138
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,600
And that button is just say sign in.

139
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:06,140
But, uh, with the provider name.

140
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:11,260
So we should make like this.

141
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,790
You just say provider dot nay.

142
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,900
And we should see something.

143
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,500
Right there.

144
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,180
So I fixed this.

145
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,330
Let's see.

146
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,600
Yeah.

147
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,880
We're getting signing with Google.

148
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,730
Let me bring it.

149
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:37,200
Upper level best you can see you're signing with Google.

150
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,130
So that is correct.

151
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:39,810
And.

152
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,130
No.

153
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:50,470
I mean, we clearly nothing happens, but we when we click, we should be redirected to another page

154
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,750
to choose our G-mail account.

155
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,480
But first, let's star lists and then we do that functionality.

156
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,930
So for the above there.

157
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:12,870
Let's add a class now and you change the display to flags and we bring them next to each other and they're

158
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,060
like this.

159
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:20,580
But I don't want to see this image when we have a mobile size.

160
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,410
Uh.

161
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,530
We can do this one.

162
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:30,960
We just add a class name to the image and we make it hidden.

163
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,220
Now we don't see it.

164
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,010
But when?

165
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,250
The size is bigger than medium size.

166
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,580
I wanted to be in line.

167
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,620
Flex.

168
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,140
So now we can see it.

169
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,420
Let's remove that hidden for now.

170
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,710
And then I signed it.

171
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,080
And then we bring it back.

172
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:09,160
Okay, so we all want it to be object colour.

173
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,000
Because I don't want to change the aspect ratio when I'm changing the height and width.

174
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:32,600
And for medium size and above, I want the width to be let's make it 44 and height.

175
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,800
To be 80.

176
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,300
Maybe this is not completely correct, but it's going to.

177
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,460
Now you can see the size.

178
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:51,200
Actually, this is the size because the medium size we want to make this active and then.

179
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,440
That's it.

180
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,000
I think that's it.

181
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:56,830
We just.

182
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,170
I just wanna rotate it.

183
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,560
So just say rotate six.

184
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,410
A little bit tilted to the right side.

185
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,300
So let's add the hidden too.

186
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,460
So we don't see it in the mobile size.

187
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,860
Now.

188
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,950
And the bigger size.

189
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,330
We should see it.

190
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,490
Let me check.

191
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,280
A medium.

192
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,740
Like this.

193
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,420
Now we are seeing it.

194
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,780
Okay, let's bring everything to the center.

195
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:40,590
So we just say after these flags we just added justify center.

196
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:45,840
Like this.

197
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,980
And then we add a margin top of 20.

198
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,830
So they push them a little bit to death.

199
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,110
I think that is fine.

200
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,470
Uh.

201
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,140
That's decreased the size.

202
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,330
Let's establish logo.

203
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:15,860
So for the image here, we add a class name.

204
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,640
Let's say it's the.

205
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,240
Wait to be 36.

206
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,440
Then we make it.

207
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,990
Object cover too.

208
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,910
So prevent this.

209
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,040
Stretching.

210
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,210
And then.

211
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:43,920
Yeah.

212
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,300
That's it for this one.

213
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,170
For this for the div at the top here.

214
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,000
We make it flex.

215
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,950
But I want full flex direction to be color.

216
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,180
Then we.

217
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,270
Bring them everything to the center.

218
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,090
Using items centre.

219
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,520
It's a fresh two page.

220
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,420
There aren't incentives.

221
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,350
So I didn't see the results of.

222
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,570
J Items Center.

223
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,000
Still not centered.

224
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,880
Let me check.

225
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:47,790
That's for this Texas Athletics Center.

226
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,260
Oh, sorry.

227
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,670
I added this on here.

228
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,300
This one should be in this.

229
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,770
They're actually.

230
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,180
Now we can see the results.

231
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:15,840
Okay.

232
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,540
So let's continue with this text.

233
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:32,060
So text center, we bring it into center using that, then let's make it smaller using text to smaller

234
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,910
than we make it italic.

235
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,700
And now we can add a margin Y of ten.

236
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,150
So the space between.

237
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:51,030
That's on the button and.

238
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:53,510
Yeah.

239
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,040
And that's.

240
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,120
That's it for this fall.

241
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,960
Let's install the button here.

242
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,330
So we had a class name.

243
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:09,210
And we just changed the background color to be a red 400.

244
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,910
We make it around death.

245
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,460
Large.

246
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,450
Then, uh.

247
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,970
And a padding of three.

248
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,490
Let's change the text color.

249
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,190
So we make it.

250
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,800
Why?

251
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,550
I think that's okay.

252
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,370
And when we hover over it.

253
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:52,090
I want to the background color to be red 500 instead.

254
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:56,890
Like this.

255
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,160
So in the big size, it's like this.

256
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,640
But let's add some space between these two.

257
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,810
So that's.

258
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,190
I think we need to add a space.

259
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,610
X of.

260
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,610
Example.

261
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:24,720
Or.

262
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:27,750
Okay.

263
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,720
It looks okay now.

264
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,490
Let's add the functionality when we click on this one.

265
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,590
We go to Google.

266
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:50,950
The first thing we need to do is to go go to console.

267
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,330
Who will you just search for?

268
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:56,990
Counsel.

269
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:02,990
And we should go to a website called council that claw claw that Google dot com.

270
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,790
I want to add the localhost 3000 to the Google search.

271
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,210
It's as if to recognize our website.

272
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:16,190
So first we choose the projects here.

273
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,280
The projects are.

274
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,500
The name of my project was Twitter version four.

275
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:27,210
But you choose the name you you have chosen for your project.

276
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:32,280
Then here on the left side, we click on the hamburger menu.

277
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:38,660
Then we go to APIs and services and we go to credentials.

278
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,330
Now we should see our.

279
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,840
Uh oh.

280
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:50,950
Of information here of 2.0 client IDs.

281
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,890
So here we click on the edit.

282
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:03,770
And inside here we should see the website that authorized as you can see, the local hosted by local

283
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,710
post 5000 is authorized.

284
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,770
Let's change this 1 to 3000.

285
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,350
And save it.

286
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,270
Now.

287
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:30,000
Let's go back to our signing and uh, let's add in other things from next off.

288
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:40,160
Which is a function call sign, and it's going to redirect us to the provider that we are choosing so

289
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,790
we can use this one inside that button.

290
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,990
So here, inside the bottom, we add on click.

291
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,590
Okay.

292
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:58,350
And this oncolytic is going to trigger.

293
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:07,370
This sign in function that the we have imported from next off.

294
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:15,240
And this is going to get the provider I.D. because we want to know that which provided you want to be

295
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,530
signing so proud provided that I.D..

296
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,400
And the next argument.

297
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,600
Is, uh, we need to have a callback.

298
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:40,060
The callback means that when these are signing with Google, which page you wanna be re redirected next.

299
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,180
So we just say you are callback url and this is going to be equal to forward slash.

300
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,570
So when we are signing, I want to go to the homepage.

301
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,550
Okay, uh, let's try this.

302
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,010
See, we don't get any error or something.

303
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,570
So this is a localhost 3000, a signing page.

304
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,800
It's clicked on.

305
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,940
Sign in with Google.

306
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,310
Yeah.

307
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:09,150
You we went to the Google accounts at Google, but we are getting an error.

308
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,810
This is a common error you get.

309
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,170
It's telling us that you re direct.

310
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,520
You are a mismatch.

311
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,560
You just need to open this.

312
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,940
And you need to copy this earth.

313
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,070
This is a redirect.

314
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,080
You are you copy this one.

315
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,230
And we go back to the credentials.

316
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,150
People were here and we got there.

317
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,980
We change this on.

318
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,960
We just go to the edit again.

319
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:46,680
And in the redirect URLs we need to add this that we have copied, we save this.

320
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,880
And now if you try again and you go back.

321
00:23:52,160 --> 00:24:01,310
If we try again, we should be going to to the correct page if this is going to ask us to sign it.

322
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:02,960
Okay.

323
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,930
I'm going to sign in with my email.

324
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,930
This just takes it's a hand.

325
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,940
And at G.M. dot com.

326
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,000
Let me quickly add my.

327
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,040
Password.

328
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:30,580
Okay.

329
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:36,220
Now we are going to be redirected to the homepage, which is localhost 3000.

330
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,570
So that was completely okay.

331
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:43,380
Now, now we are actually authenticated.

332
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,620
So we have we went by Google.

333
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,540
So we have we can get the now the information from Google as well.

334
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:58,110
So in the next section, actually, we are going to get the information and get the decision information.

335
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:04,440
And we we want to get this image is here and here.

336
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,730
From the real.

337
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,860
An image from Google.

338
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,380
So from your Google accounts image.

339
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:14,440
Okay.

340
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:20,150
Let's add the end everything to get off first as usual.

341
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:30,470
And the review, the pay review, the course of it and that's using it at DOT and we use get comment

342
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,810
and we add a message.

343
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,710
And the message would be.

344
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,020
Complete.

345
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,300
This signing.

346
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,540
Hey.

347
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:49,250
Okay.

348
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,610
And we push it to get.

349
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:50,900
Huh?

350
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,490
Let's check.

351
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,090
What we have done so far.

352
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,590
So we refresh this page.

353
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:12,740
Now we have 11 comments and if you click on it, we can see the last one is complete the signing page.

354
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,750
So we just fix this error.

355
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,280
That's the mistake I made.

356
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:26,380
We added the next public inside the next authorities.

357
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:36,500
We added the pages because we want to tell the next off that we we want this page to be our signing

358
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:37,700
custom page.

359
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:46,090
Then inside the signing that year we got there get providers and signing from next of our statutory

360
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:55,450
act get providers gives us all the providers like that, like Google, etc. We only have one providers,

361
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:59,230
but we need to look through the all providers here and get the.

362
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,500
Each provider.

363
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:08,530
And we added an image to images for a logo and a mobile image.

364
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,740
We added this text and the button.

365
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:19,480
We created signing with Google by just adding provided that name and.

366
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:27,270
We added on click, which is going to use this signing function from next off.

367
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:31,800
And we provided the provider I.D..

368
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,660
And we specified the callback URL.

369
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,240
So this phone was the homepage.

370
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:39,660
Okay.

371
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:46,910
And also we got the providers using the server side rendering functionality of next year's.

372
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:55,100
So in the next section, we're going to update the images of the this what's happening section and the

373
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:00,010
code we and this part, the mini files section.

374
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,420
Also, we want to create this quote.

375
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:07,820
We had a name and also the and user name.

376
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,360
So see in the next section for this part.
