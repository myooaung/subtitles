1
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:14.590
Arrived in the last section, we have completed the about section of the result component.

2
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.320
In this section, we're going to complete the results of the page.

3
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.160
If you look at the final version of the project here.

4
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.000
You can see that we have and we need three informations.

5
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.750
One is the display you Earl.

6
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.130
One is the title.

7
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:47.010
And also, we have snippets at the bottom, but the snippets actually highlights the search we have,

8
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.990
for example, we search here nice.

9
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.000
The word nice is like a bolt.

10
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.690
All right, so if you says something else, for example, next, J.S..

11
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.890
We can see that the next U.S. turn is bold.

12
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.030
This is coming from the information of the.

13
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.460
Google API, if you look at the.

14
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.870
Our own sign.

15
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:31.000
Here, the local host three thousand, and if you open the console using F12 and we check the object,

16
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.000
we can see that each item.

17
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.460
The item array has 10 had 10 items.

18
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.140
You can see that the.

19
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.340
We have to we want to use this display.

20
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.680
Link here.

21
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.890
Or instead of this, we can use the format it URL.

22
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.890
Here doesn't matter.

23
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.980
Whatever, it's uh, it's both of them.

24
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.860
Let me increase the size, so this one is this one.

25
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.550
Then we have to format it.

26
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.600
You are out.

27
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.860
And finally, we have, uh, we can have the title, which is here.

28
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:32.300
And then are snippets and snippets is this is the normal snippet we have to HDMI stampedes, estimate

29
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.710
a snippet, stupid bolts, the search results, for example, I search minus the video.

30
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.050
As you can see, the world have noticed both.

31
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.760
But we cannot show this one in our.

32
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.220
JavaScript.

33
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.560
We need to pass this estimate.

34
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.520
So we're going to install a package called EdgeHTML, man, I think it's extremely.

35
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.220
React, passer.

36
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.770
So we're going to be getting to that in a moment.

37
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.640
So first, let's close this.

38
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.420
Counsel for now, and we go back to.

39
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.250
Our visual studio code.

40
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.500
So we need to go.

41
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.930
To the search that, yes, we are in the search, yes.

42
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.610
As you hear, we made this search result components, so we go to search results component.

43
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:52.180
And just under the P, which is related to this about, we're going to look through this results.

44
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.630
As I show you in the.

45
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:08.630
Console, the result that items is an array of 10 items, so we can look through the results.

46
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.830
That items.

47
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.130
By using Map.

48
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.750
And then now this map is going to gives us the each results.

49
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:39.800
We just needed to put inside parentheses and we get the all each result.

50
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.160
And then we can just directly reach her.

51
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.600
All right.

52
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.940
So here we can return a death.

53
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.410
Just always remember when you have math, you need to add a key.

54
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:11.900
So the key here would be, for example, result that's linked because the link is a unique things.

55
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.700
So it's it's going to be unique inside the 10 items.

56
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.070
So we use that link for the key.

57
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.930
So let's show, for example.

58
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:39.250
Result the title and check with our code is working, so we just say result the title.

59
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.520
If you refresh the page.

60
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.080
We're getting an error here.

61
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.420
So I think.

62
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.420
Let's check.

63
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.050
So we have apprentices here.

64
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:09.080
We are we have we missed one parenthesis, just something here.

65
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.190
Yeah, it's working now.

66
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.640
So now you can see we have 10 titles here.

67
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.080
Just to.

68
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:29.250
And then the other thing is, we want to get is just, for example, we can get a link.

69
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.660
And the next.

70
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.320
For example, we can't get this for Matthew.

71
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.330
You, Earl.

72
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.410
But this.

73
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:55.200
And the other thing we need is just the small snippets and HTML as the bits.

74
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:09.230
As you can see, it didn't bolt the the name just added the tech around it, so we need to pass this

75
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.410
one.

76
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.410
So let's install the package first.

77
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.670
So we stop the server using Contra see?

78
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.810
And we install a package called.

79
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:28.860
Etched cmll or hatch this Ash, the email reacts.

80
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.400
Parcel.

81
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.140
When we installed this.

82
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.120
We need to import.

83
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:52.090
They need to import it at the top, so we just import parts from.

84
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.040
The the name of the package is similar.

85
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:00.810
React, Pastor.

86
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.520
Now, if we.

87
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:05.060
Up.

88
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.320
If you wrap this result, that extremely snippet, we should.

89
00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.500
Get the effect of the HMO tax.

90
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:23.610
So we're just here to say passer the openness parentheses, and we close it here.

91
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.620
Let's run the server using NPR and wrong there.

92
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.310
Uh.

93
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.130
Let's refresh the page.

94
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:52.900
Yeah, know, instead of getting to the TAC balls, yeah, we are really seeing that the name is bolt.

95
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.380
All right, that's is working.

96
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:56.280
So let's.

97
00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.220
A start to our code.

98
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.400
So let's treat this fine, and we.

99
00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.100
Instead of this, did we add another dear?

100
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.830
We want to know if you look at the final version.

101
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.470
Even we will hover over this link.

102
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.330
The title has the underlying.

103
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:28.370
If you're, for example, here, I'm hovering over the display link, but.

104
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:40.210
This link is has a underly we can achieve this one intelligence says, just using a device covering

105
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:43.450
both of these things and the add a class of group.

106
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:53.600
To it, and then instead of just saying hover, which just a group dash hover, let's do this in practice

107
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:54.710
and we see.

108
00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:07.160
So we have a div and inside this there we have the attack, the attack, the the riff.

109
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:13.150
Or the destination link is resource that link.

110
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.490
Then we have.

111
00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:22.840
Inside this.

112
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.300
A tag we have.

113
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.000
The result dot.

114
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.690
Just a formatted URL.

115
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.650
Formatted.

116
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.220
You are.

117
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.380
Then let's add another attack.

118
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.730
And each trip would be similar.

119
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.610
The result that link.

120
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:16.160
And inside this eight attack, instead of just writing directly something, I wanted to put it inside

121
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.300
edge to attack.

122
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:25.070
So I created it to try and to tag has a result, the title.

123
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.630
So just a result.

124
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.170
That type.

125
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:39.320
So now at the top, we have to just the formatted URL, then we have the title.

126
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.710
After this, we have, uh.

127
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:56.940
It outside this did this there, because as I mentioned, we wanted both of these have the hover effect,

128
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:05.140
so we added that there, but also this there we have a paragraph and inside the paragraph we just say.

129
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.710
Results dot HMO.

130
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:14.740
A snippet.

131
00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:23.720
But if you remember, we we needed to pass this on to see the.

132
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.810
There's also perhaps this one by a passer.

133
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:36.630
Now we have the format and we have the timetable, and here is this snippet.

134
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.110
But let's style this a little bit.

135
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.440
Doesn't look like everything is squished together.

136
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.770
And I don't want this to come until here.

137
00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:52.190
I want to limit it until here as well.

138
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:58.480
So we go to first, we start with the.

139
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.890
Live at the top here.

140
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.540
The one that has a key.

141
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:13.090
So here we just say Max with to limit the width of the.

142
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.040
Everything to explore, large.

143
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.810
No, this one doesn't go more than this.

144
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.820
All right.

145
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:29.460
Then we have the Martin button of.

146
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.460
Margin bottom of eight, so we have some space between.

147
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:44.340
Yeah, that's it for this one here, as I mentioned, we had a group because we want to have a hover

148
00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:53.160
effect that if we hover in each of these items, we want to see the underline under the title.

149
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.100
Fodder for the attack.

150
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.940
If the first attack, we had a class name here.

151
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.270
And just to make the ticks a small.

152
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:20.660
And we going to truncated, I don't want if the link is too much.

153
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.100
I want to try and get that.

154
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:38.630
So here is sometimes the link is very large like this, and we truncated by it, that's.

155
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.480
And finally, we have.

156
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.710
Inside this a tank.

157
00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:54.850
Let's.

158
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:57.680
At a class there.

159
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:13.070
And this is going to have this is we just want to see if someone hover over the group.

160
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:14.660
It means all this.

161
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.000
And there we want to add underly.

162
00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:24.280
On July.

163
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:35.740
No, and see that when we hover at everything at above there we have on the line under the title.

164
00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:38.940
Like this?

165
00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:55.140
And at the end, we just add some classes here in the.

166
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.290
Edge to attack.

167
00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.210
First, we truncated.

168
00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.350
So we don't want it to be too long.

169
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:15.140
And just in case, and then we just change, it takes to be a little bit bigger.

170
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.250
It's large.

171
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:25.300
And then we can add to boldness using font or font medium.

172
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:34.930
And let's change the color to text blue.

173
00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.320
Like eight hundred.

174
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:41.290
At this.

175
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:53.090
The problem is when we if you look at the underlying, the island is not blue, it's black, actually,

176
00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.950
so we can hear when we.

177
00:16:56.050 --> 00:17:03.520
Changed the scientists when we added the underline they can change the color of the on the line using

178
00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:05.380
decoration.

179
00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.030
Just for just a declaration.

180
00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:15.520
Declaration, we changed the color to Blue.

181
00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:17.410
800.

182
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.150
No, the underlined colors is blue to.

183
00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:35.130
And let's change the color of the snippets, so the snippets in this paragraph at the end.

184
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.030
We've changed the color of the text to Gray.

185
00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:40.770
Six hundred.

186
00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:47.840
So it looks fine.

187
00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:58.330
All right.

188
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.960
Well, let's.

189
00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.070
Test this one.

190
00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:16.330
If you look, if you click on this or any places at the top, there you should go to the related website.

191
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:22.380
So this is my profile, and we will explore this color.

192
00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.510
So that's correct.

193
00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:33.370
Everything looks fine, so let's add everything to get her by using get at.

194
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:39.080
Pitts commits to the message of.

195
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.160
Completes.

196
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:52.740
The results section and in-store.

197
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.010
It's tumor.

198
00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:58.900
Reacts.

199
00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:00.950
Pass.

200
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.690
And we push everything to get.

201
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.680
Let's check what we have done.

202
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.690
We refresh the page.

203
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:18.990
Here, and you should see that we have now 12 commits.

204
00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:25.440
And the last one is complete the results section and install estimate react, pastor.

205
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.400
So we installed the Iraq parser.

206
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.670
This is the version one point four point eight.

207
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:44.580
The things we did here in the research results that, yes, we imported this package.

208
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:57.360
We looked through the result that items that map and then we looked through this using map method begun

209
00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:01.670
to each result and we show it like a.

210
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.090
First, we created a group at a top.

211
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:08.960
Which has two links.

212
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:09.710
One.

213
00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:10.440
Yeah.

214
00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.910
Just a formatted euro and the one is the title.

215
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:19.310
And when we hover over each of them, we get the underlying.

216
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:21.510
Under the title.

217
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:31.580
And finally, we showed the snippets and the said using this package.

218
00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:34.730
Yeah, that was it for the results section.

219
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:39.470
In the next section, we're going to start with the pagination.

220
00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:46.400
So if if you look at here, we have next year and the first website is.

221
00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.760
Next year, that authority.

222
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:57.180
But when we go to click on next, we go to the next page, which is different results.

223
00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:04.800
And also, if you pay attention to the URL, we have an extra tanks.

224
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:15.990
Extra query called Start and when we click on next, this is start, no changes.

225
00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:21.790
At the beginning is one and then get 11 twenty one.

226
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:31.680
And we keep continue, we go to 91, which is the Max one, because the Google API only provides you

227
00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:37.200
with 100 results, so you cannot go more than 100.

228
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:41.640
So you're you're going to get an error.

229
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:46.680
But we limit that number to ninety one, so we never get an error.

230
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.650
And when we go to the last one?

231
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:52.370
Which is the ninety one?

232
00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.270
We should actually.

233
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.470
Let me go.

234
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:13.920
Yeah, this is the last one when we go to the ninth one, which we don't see the next page, we only

235
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.300
see the previous one.

236
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:17.690
Right.

237
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.820
And when we're at the beginning.

238
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.990
If we don't have this thought.

239
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.990
We don't see the previous button.

240
00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.620
So we're going to achieve this one in the next section.

241
00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.180
So see you in the next section.
