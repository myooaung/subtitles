14
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,220

19

20
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,270
to worry about complex data management.

00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:53,440

24

25
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:59,110
segment loads, the new content is automatically swapped in once rendering is complete, giving your
25

00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,750
users a smooth and seamless experience.
