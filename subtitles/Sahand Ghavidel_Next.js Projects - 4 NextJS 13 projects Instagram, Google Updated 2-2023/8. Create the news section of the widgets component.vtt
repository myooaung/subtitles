1
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.040
All right.

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.050
In the last six years, we have completed this search bar of the Bridges section.

3
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:21.150
In this section, we're going to start creating the What's Happening section or the news API section.

4
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.790
If you look at the final version.

5
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.640
We can see that we have we are getting requests.

6
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.950
Yeah, we are fetching some data from an API and showing it here.

7
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:43.400
And by clicking on show more we see more news title, an image and when we click of each of them the

8
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:53.330
and new open, the new tab will be opened and we can see the full news.

9
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.640
On the on the new tap.

10
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:08.680
So before starting, I just want to have some modification in our code because our version, it's a

11
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.230
bit different than the final version.

12
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.460
We have more marching left on the page.

13
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.810
It's.

14
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.110
It's very simple change.

15
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.870
Just follow me here.

16
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.240
First in index.

17
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.810
The G?

18
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.350
Yes, in the main tag.

19
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.060
Just remove this Max with seven Excel.

20
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.270
Dent Inside Parts and components folder.

21
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.490
Just at the end of this main div after the return.

22
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:59.770
Just add four x large prefix and above change the margin left to.

23
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:03.600
24.

24
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.870
Now, if you look at our final version, it looks a little bit different.

25
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.190
But that was the mistake I made.

26
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.750
So sorry about that.

27
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.490
And let's continue creating our What's Happening section.

28
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.400
Okay.

29
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.530
So in order to get the news API, I'm going to use a news API.

30
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:39.540
Uh, that does not require any API key in a new tab.

31
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.380
Just search for news API.

32
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.010
So Rev, this is the person that created this API.

33
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.940
So if you search for this.

34
00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:02.770
The first result is so rare that tech and news API first slashed news API.

35
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.980
As you can see, the title is News API without any API key.

36
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.490
If you click on this website.

37
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.260
You can see the documentation.

38
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.460
We have a basic URL, which is this one.

39
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.600
Then we can have the.

40
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:25.400
Like it.

41
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.460
You can get it, Jason.

42
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.740
Based on the category or top headlines, you can see some examples here.

43
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.490
For example, in this one, we get the top headlines from the category Health in Country India.

44
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:49.940
And for the next one, we are getting for everything, every news in CNN just from CNN.

45
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.450
So let's take this, for example.

46
00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:03.050
First of all, when I click it, you can see we are getting 64 total results and all the ah, ah, uh,

47
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.120
all the articles are inside this app, this array here.

48
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.620
In order to to get this API resolved, we're going to use the server side rendering of next year.

49
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:31.360
So, uh, let's copy this, the first one, and we bring it to our Visual Studio code and we go to index.

50
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.730
That's the main, main, uh, section, the main page.

51
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.680
And just at the end.

52
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.130
Let me just.

53
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.740
Comment this and paste this link.

54
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.100
So we're going to use it later.

55
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.330
Just in a minute.

56
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.820
So the category is health.

57
00:04:52.820 --> 00:05:01.180
And in India, I want to change India to you as a US language and the health category.

58
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.080
I want to change it to business.

59
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.010
Okay.

60
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.210
And then.

61
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.980
Okay.

62
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.870
Let's, uh, get the.

63
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.040
This.

64
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.340
Lets fetch this API using this server side rendering of next year.

65
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:32.560
Similarly, the side rendering actually means that this rendering is going to be inside the server which

66
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.850
is verso, which is the owner of the.

67
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.870
Uh.

68
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.410
Next year and it's going to be very fast.

69
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:49.940
So it doesn't matter how fast is the computer of the person is using our website or.

70
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.980
How fast their internet is.

71
00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:06.340
Fishing is going to be done on this fast server as is the pace going to be a pre-rendered for the user.

72
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.710
So let's let me show it here.

73
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:20.170
So we're just going to use asynchronous function and a function which is a built in function from the

74
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.530
next year.

75
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.580
It's called get server side props.

76
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.340
And here.

77
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:40.800
We are going we are going to create a consent and we call it news results.

78
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.570
And this is because it's returning a promise.

79
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.920
So we need to wait for the fitting.

80
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.420
So we just wait.

81
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.210
Fitch and the website we are going to fetch is this one here?

82
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.350
Just copy this.

83
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.750
And just leave it there as your reference.

84
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.020
You can get it inside the repository.

85
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:18.380
And after getting it after fetching it, then we we're going to convert the result adjacent file.

86
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.650
So we just say the result we get here.

87
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.080
I recall it was.

88
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.560
And we converted to Jason.

89
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.930
They just say, Jason.

90
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.050
But this.

91
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.580
Let's save it.

92
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.250
And you can see it in a two lines now.

93
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.070
Now we we got it.

94
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.780
And this is in the server.

95
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.710
It's created inside a server.

96
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.820
Now we want to pass it to the client side, which is here.

97
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:59.510
The way we passed this one to the client side is just by returning it as a props.

98
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.240
So we just return.

99
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.250
Props.

100
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.310
And a promise we are going to return is news.

101
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.300
Results.

102
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.190
That is enough.

103
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.990
And now we can get this one inside the client side, which is here.

104
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.220
You can get it as a props or we can de structure it.

105
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.950
Just say news results.

106
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.620
Now here.

107
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.860
We can pass this one as a props to the widgets components.

108
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:39.550
So we just send news result equals news resource.

109
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.290
Now in widgets.

110
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:47.290
The widget suggests we can get this fun as a props.

111
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:53.700
It is structures first and we can look through it here.

112
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.420
But first, let me show you something.

113
00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:04.230
We are getting the results like this, but the result is inside the articles.

114
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:05.600
Here.

115
00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:16.120
So before sending a result, which is let's come, let's just send the articles, not the new stuff

116
00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.690
to resource.

117
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.090
So in index that.

118
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.870
Yes.

119
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.830
Let me close this extra.

120
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:24.270
Thanks.

121
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:29.490
Okay.

122
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:30.420
Sidebar.

123
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:31.760
Inputs.

124
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:32.910
Okay.

125
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.200
Insert index that.

126
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.150
Yes, we can just return.

127
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.740
News is a result that articles.

128
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:50.800
This is coming from the articles is an error and it's it has 64 elements.

129
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:58.180
So now we are getting all the sixty-fourths elements and we can look through it here.

130
00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:07.300
So after this search icon that we have created inside the widgets, I mean this section.

131
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.350
You need to refresh the page first time.

132
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.820
So now.

133
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.260
After this.

134
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:17.980
Here.

135
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.950
We're going to look through it and show you.

136
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.170
So the news.

137
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.600
Results.

138
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:36.700
We can look through it using math map method and we can get each article here.

139
00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:44.290
We just say article and we just return, for example, at paragraph.

140
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:55.340
Which is same article, that title.

141
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.170
Article that cash.

142
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.910
Okay, now we are getting all the titles for the 50.

143
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.360
News headlines.

144
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.450
Yes, you can see it here.

145
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:24.420
We can get many things like the title image I can show you here.

146
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.010
We can get the name.

147
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.920
You can get the author title.

148
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:31.590
We can get a description.

149
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:34.370
Image.

150
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:36.880
You are able to image here.

151
00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:39.210
Yeah.

152
00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.910
Many things when it's published or other things.

153
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.980
Okay.

154
00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:56.410
So now instead of doing this one, like directly doing that, directly looping through it, I want to

155
00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:04.450
create another component and we call it news that J.S. And inside the news we are going to have one

156
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:13.300
component that is having the title and the origin of the news and also the image, and we're going to

157
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.260
install it there.

158
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.830
So it's going to be a little bit more clean and neat.

159
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.520
So inside components folder.

160
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.910
We create another component and we call it News Digest.

161
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:35.520
And we can use our C to create a react functional component and with the latest import.

162
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:42.150
And we just the bring it inside the widgets.

163
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.270
We delete this paragraph.

164
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.110
And we just saw a news.

165
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.440
And re-import the imported here or the auto imported.

166
00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:01.830
And first, we need to have a key because we are looking through something.

167
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:13.740
And the key would be the titles are mostly unique, so we can use the article, the title as a key and

168
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.140
we can pass all the articles here.

169
00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.550
We just the article.

170
00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.860
Is equal to article.

171
00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:31.370
And we can get this one inside the news as a and as a props and with this structure and.

172
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:33.580
Bring it here.

173
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:34.840
So just say Arctic.

174
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.620
Okay.

175
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:42.510
So instead of dead, we can pass the article.

176
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.560
So here.

177
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:55.400
Uh, let's continue for the redheads, because I want to see the title.

178
00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.070
What's happening as well?

179
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:08.890
So after this there we create another div and inside this we're going to have edge four and we just

180
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:09.640
see what's.

181
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.180
What's happening?

182
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.330
Okay.

183
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:18.340
We can see it here.

184
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:25.090
And after that, we're going to look through this after the H4.

185
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:30.210
So we bring this one inside this and the.

186
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:33.910
There we have it.

187
00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:34.910
We can we.

188
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:40.000
We're going to have another thing, which is a button and a button.

189
00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:46.750
Is going to say no more.

190
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:50.980
Okay.

191
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.250
So let's just call this a letter, Beth.

192
00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:01.260
We changed the texts to Gray 700.

193
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.480
And we add some space.

194
00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.000
Between the.

195
00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.820
Between them using a space y tree.

196
00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.830
We change the background color to Gray 100.

197
00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:29.350
Then we make it round there using Rounded Excel, which is 12 pixel.

198
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.550
Then we can add some padding at a top of two.

199
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:44.180
And we sit there with to be 90% like the one we did for the search bar.

200
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:51.980
And when we have a bigger screen, I want the width to be 75.

201
00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.310
Percent.

202
00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.250
Exactly like their boss.

203
00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:03.360
So that's.

204
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:03.720
That's.

205
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.760
Was it for that?

206
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:05.310
Uh.

207
00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:12.190
We're here for the edge for which is saying what's happening.

208
00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.230
We change the font to be bold.

209
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.750
And we can change the text size to be ex large.

210
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:28.750
And we can add some padding on the X.

211
00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:35.320
Level X axis of four like this.

212
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.940
Okay.

213
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:47.680
Now let's astounding button here.

214
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.580
The button is going to be blue the color.

215
00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.390
So we just see blue 300.

216
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:06.710
And the added padding left for and padding bottom off three.

217
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:18.830
And when we hover over it, I want the text to be blue but with different range, which is 400.

218
00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:23.300
So when we hover over, it is a little bit darker.

219
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:28.090
So everything's fine for the title.

220
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:28.750
And here.

221
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.440
Let's.

222
00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.910
Make the news here.

223
00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:46.390
As I want to show you here in the final version, when we click on any news, we will going to be redirected

224
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:47.800
to a new page.

225
00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.760
We're going to be inside a new place.

226
00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.650
So we need to have an anchor tag.

227
00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:57.900
But with the targets of blank.

228
00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:58.780
So.

229
00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.620
We we changed this div to anchor tag.

230
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:08.410
And each riff it would be.

231
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.120
Article.

232
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.030
That you are our.

233
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:35.850
And as I mentioned before, we need to have a target to be underlined black inside this anchor tag.

234
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.650
Are you going to have a death?

235
00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:44.110
Because I want to separate this section and the image section.

236
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.940
So this is going to be one death.

237
00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.490
Wonder if that is covering everything.

238
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:56.900
One default is to pass one, which is the image.

239
00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:10.400
So we have one there for all of them and one there for the title and the news, uh, organization one.

240
00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.880
Then after this, did we have the image?

241
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.100
Let's open the.

242
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:26.340
Localhost, 3000 here and we just put it here, we can see the result.

243
00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:32.970
So inside this there we have h six heading six.

244
00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:36.910
And the just the article that title.

245
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.560
So we're getting all the titles now.

246
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.490
And then we click.

247
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.410
Now we go to the.

248
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.320
That pitch any of them.

249
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.860
Because we put it inside and anchor attack.

250
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.760
Okay.

251
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.400
Our food is age six.

252
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:07.970
So we have a paragraph and this going this is going to be article.

253
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.270
That source.

254
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:31.380
That name, which is the name of the news agency for first time on cnbc next vice president fox business

255
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:32.490
and etc..

256
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.890
So after that we have the image tag and the sources.

257
00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.280
Article.

258
00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.860
Dot you are URL.

259
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.970
Two image.

260
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.120
I mean, the fish do perch.

261
00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.860
We should see the images now.

262
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.210
Okay.

263
00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.750
And, uh, let's just style it a little bit.

264
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:18.330
So for the top there, we added a space, a first.

265
00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:20.280
We make it their flex.

266
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.080
So we bring them next to each other.

267
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:34.260
And uh, we just use items center to center it and we just justify between to have a space between,

268
00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:42.210
you know, the image is so big, so, or let's first, uh, change the size of the image and we set

269
00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:43.050
it to be.

270
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.130
I know with to be 70.

271
00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.130
So 30, 70 pixels.

272
00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.360
And heights to be.

273
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:02.450
$76 at Spa.

274
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.350
And.

275
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.500
Well, we make it rounded.

276
00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.450
On the full.

277
00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:22.980
Not for the.

278
00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:23.340
Sorry.

279
00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:25.240
Um.

280
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:25.870
Maybe.

281
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:26.290
Yeah.

282
00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.780
Expel is enough.

283
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:38.420
And I think the, uh, it's a bit scratched now so we can make it.

284
00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:46.670
Now, let's do this width and height outside the image, because when you do it like this, it's not

285
00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:47.780
going to scratch it.

286
00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.430
So stretch it.

287
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.390
So with 70 and I.

288
00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:55.930
Seven.

289
00:22:58.450 --> 00:22:59.800
Now it looks better.

290
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.210
Should it be done?

291
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:04.350
It's hard to see that.

292
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:05.880
That's what this.

293
00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:07.960
Okay.

294
00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:09.670
Looks fine.

295
00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:11.560
Let's continue here.

296
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.100
At a top level there that is covering everything.

297
00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.460
Let's add some padding to the X.

298
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:24.760
Axis of four padding in the Y axis of two.

299
00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:31.480
So we have some space between them and then we add some space between.

300
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.520
These two, uh.

301
00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.480
We just say space x one.

302
00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:44.830
Then we make the cursor to be pointer.

303
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.830
Well, we don't need actually, because we have an anchor tag.

304
00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:54.660
We already have the cursor to be pointer by default.

305
00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:04.400
And let's when we hover over it, I want to change the background color to be 200 instead of 100.

306
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:05.630
So we see a.

307
00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:10.200
Background color to be gray.

308
00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.330
200.

309
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.300
Now we should see a gray color.

310
00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:22.080
Let's add some the animation to, let's just say, transition.

311
00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:32.110
And the duration of transmission would be 200 milliseconds.

312
00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:39.700
So when we go on top of them, we see a different movement.

313
00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.300
In this color change.

314
00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:48.350
So let's continue with styling the title here first.

315
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:57.930
Uh, well, here we add some space between the title and the, uh, the news agency in name.

316
00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.200
So we just say if space y.

317
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.430
Half a.

318
00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.220
Point zero, which is the.

319
00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:11.360
Yeah.

320
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.760
125 0.125.

321
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:15.260
Are you?

322
00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:30.560
And for each six we create a class name and we change the text to be a small.

323
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.990
We change the boldness to be font bold.

324
00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.250
And, uh, for the p tag.

325
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:42.000
Yeah.

326
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:51.520
You make the ticks to be extra small and you change the boldness to be medium.

327
00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:59.790
And the ticks to be dry.

328
00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:02.520
And, uh, I think.

329
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.880
500 would be okay.

330
00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:09.520
A little bit brighter.

331
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.570
So that's it for this part.

332
00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:19.140
But the problem is we are seeing now all the 50 news titles.

333
00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:21.780
That is a lot for here.

334
00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:23.850
We can just show three of them.

335
00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:29.430
And then when we click on the show more here we see each time.

336
00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.650
Three more news headline.

337
00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.860
And that is very simple to do.

338
00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:41.220
We can just go to the widget search is when we are mapping true to our article.

339
00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:45.030
Instead of mapping through all of them, we can slice them.

340
00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:51.680
Here and then we just can.

341
00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:57.040
If, for example, we said 0 to 2, we just see two news title.

342
00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.320
If you say three, we see three.

343
00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.080
But I want this to be dynamic.

344
00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:11.350
So I make a variable here and I just say article number.

345
00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:12.610
Okay.

346
00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:18.130
And then at a top here, I create a hook.

347
00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:20.800
We just say article.

348
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.590
None.

349
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:28.980
CET article non.

350
00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:34.130
And this is going to be equal use a state.

351
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:36.410
From React.

352
00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:43.140
So we need to imported from react this user say we just import.

353
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:47.310
You stay.

354
00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.060
Romney reacts.

355
00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:58.210
And then the initial value we just said, it's anything we suspect.

356
00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:59.290
Now, if you say a one.

357
00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:07.850
We should get one title user status at all.

358
00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:08.600
Okay.

359
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.600
Now we should see one.

360
00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:16.460
And if the initial value is, for example three, we get three.

361
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:22.040
But by clicking on this button, I want to see more articles.

362
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:26.180
So inside the button we add it on click.

363
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.310
And we just.

364
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:35.490
Create a function and we just sit.

365
00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.540
The article number.

366
00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.840
To whatever article number is.

367
00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:48.490
Plus three.

368
00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:56.620
So each time now we press on this show more, we see three more articles.

369
00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:03.940
So until all of them are finished, which is I think 50, we are getting all of them.

370
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.120
The number was 64 until 64.

371
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:07.630
We can't get.

372
00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:09.680
Hmm.

373
00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:15.720
And when you refresh the page, we see only three now.

374
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:21.130
So this news is going to be change every few days.

375
00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:25.050
This API is going to be updated every few days.

376
00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:31.260
So if a user comes later, see new and new title.

377
00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:32.360
Okay.

378
00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.690
And that was it for this what's happening section?

379
00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.730
Let's add everything to get off.

380
00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:48.430
So we just take it at all and we make commands with a message of.

381
00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:52.750
Period.

382
00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.110
The news.

383
00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:04.240
Section of the widgets.

384
00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:06.750
Components.

385
00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.110
And we push it to get her.

386
00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:15.760
Let's check.

387
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:19.580
Let's kick it inside the hour.

388
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.200
Get her.

389
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.000
Refresh the page by clicking on this Twitter.

390
00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:35.340
Now we should see that we have eight commits and the last one is create the news section of the widgets

391
00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:36.840
component.

392
00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:41.950
So here we did quite a lot, actually.

393
00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:50.520
We created the news that jazz component and as well we did it here we add anchor tag and inside this

394
00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.300
we got the title and the image.

395
00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:01.600
We did some modification in our code inside fighter jets, we added.

396
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:04.580
A Marching Live Off 24.

397
00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:07.550
And inside we get that.

398
00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:08.320
Yes.

399
00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:10.650
Uh.

400
00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.190
We added a section here.

401
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:18.820
I think this is the new section we added.

402
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.600
And we looped through all the news.

403
00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:24.520
The results.

404
00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:38.390
And index that yes, firstly we remove this max with seven Excel and we pass the data to the widgets

405
00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:47.140
component and we got the data using server side rendering of next year using get server side props is

406
00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:48.650
synchronous function.

407
00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:56.030
And we've got the news resolved using the fetch method and we got it from.

408
00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:08.370
At the surf surf that tech news API and we've got the category business and US language, we convert

409
00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:13.410
it to JSON file and we pass it through a props.

410
00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:19.670
Back like this and we pass it inside the service side here.

411
00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.160
That was it for this section.

412
00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.160
In the next section, we are going to create the.

413
00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.230
The next part inside the widget.

414
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:31.070
That is.

415
00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.570
Which is this part.

416
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:33.530
Who to follow.

417
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:35.000
Here.

418
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:42.640
Also, we're going to use some API which does not require any API key.

419
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:46.430
So this is going to be achieved from the API.

420
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:54.830
And also you can see here, when we click on Show More, we see more things and this section is a sticky

421
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:56.060
to the top two.

422
00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.370
So always you can see it here.

423
00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.790
We don't see the new section, but here is always at the top.

424
00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:07.930
And we can see all the suggestion.

425
00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:15.640
These are all random created users by and by free API.

426
00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:19.440
So see you in the next section for this part.
