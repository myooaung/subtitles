WEBVTT
1
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.430
All right, in the last section, we have finish the court this component.

2
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:26.900
We got the image, the overview, we truncated the overview, we've got the title, the release date,

3
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:35.180
we've got an icon from hero icons and also we got the vote counts in this section.

4
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:45.710
We're going to style this car and also make it responsive when we have a bigger screen and the.

5
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.960
We change the background color and et cetera.

6
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.770
All right.

7
00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.610
Let's first go to the top level, which is here and the contact, yes.

8
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.350
And let's add some padding.

9
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.610
First.

10
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.280
We add padding three.

11
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.210
You can see now.

12
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:23.270
Actually, now we are designing the mobile version first, and later we're going to go to the larger

13
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.900
screens.

14
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.210
So we have padding here.

15
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.720
And also, I want some padding for this section as well.

16
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.490
So here we add some padding to.

17
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.600
Which is I believe it's eight pics of SIA padding, eight pictures.

18
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.110
All right.

19
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.630
And, uh, yeah, let's change the background color.

20
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.540
So we go back to results that.

21
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.510
And here we had a class.

22
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.120
We change the background color is the same as the Heather.

23
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.130
So the background color would be gray and 700.

24
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.570
All right.

25
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.560
Then we have the text color to be great.

26
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.670
Two hundred.

27
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.690
Let's go to Carter chance and make this

28
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.520
overview a little bit bigger.

29
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.290
So after the truncated at large.

30
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.670
All right.

31
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:46.070
And then be changed at home, uh, texts too large as well.

32
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.070
And also make it bold by using font.

33
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.700
Pulled.

34
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.950
All right.

35
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.400
And let's bring everything next to each other this section.

36
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.190
So we need to make it make them.

37
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:14.590
Flex.

38
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.320
So first, we make them flex to come next to each other.

39
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.040
And we, as you can see here.

40
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:37.260
The icon is a little bit, uh, upper than the other section, so we can fix this file by using Item

41
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:44.940
Center, which is equal to text and a line item center and CSC.

42
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.580
And also, let's ask some marching left for the.

43
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.790
This thumbs up, the margin left would be three.

44
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.260
And marching right to be to.

45
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.100
Or just one is enough.

46
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.530
All right.

47
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.860
This one looks OK.

48
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.950
And also, we want to remove the ability to select which is annoying in the mobile.

49
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.310
So in the result, yes, here we at Select.

50
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.330
None.

51
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.370
So we can have selected.

52
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:41.530
And in the context, yes, let's add the ability to hover, so we just say here at the top.

53
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.930
We just say if someone holler.

54
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.270
Let's change the text color to be white.

55
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.690
And also, it's at the cursor to be pointer.

56
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.490
So when we hover over the element, we see a pointing hand.

57
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.840
They say they're different, and also, let's add the active.

58
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.480
Sued a class for changing the color to red.

59
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.020
We just say active text.

60
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.680
Rent four hundred.

61
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.560
So when we click on there, we see the color change to red.

62
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.210
All right.

63
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.880
That's looks OK now, we just need to make it responsive, because now when we increase the size, you

64
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.500
see that image increase.

65
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.270
Yes, we are, but we want it to be in.

66
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.420
Two columns went like we are in the tablet sized three columns.

67
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:55.180
And finally, four columns and five columns, and we have a huge screen, so that is very easy as well.

68
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.260
We just need to go to resolve that.

69
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.800
Yes.

70
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.320
And here.

71
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.040
We just say if the screen is bigger than a small.

72
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.220
We want the we want it to be great.

73
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.040
And also, we want to create columns.

74
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.270
To be to.

75
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.720
Let's check.

76
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:40.440
So we increased the size and slowly went as soon as we get to the size bigger than small.

77
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.360
We get two columns.

78
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.190
Let's continue this one.

79
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.800
So we're going to we want to have the three columns.

80
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:56.090
So we just say great columns, three, when we have a size modern, large.

81
00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.570
All right.

82
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:14.380
And also, we want four columns when we have size more than six large, so we have created for.

83
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.230
So now we have a full screen, which is x large.

84
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.300
We have four columns.

85
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:23.490
And finally.

86
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:26.190
We want to have.

87
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:36.420
Five colors when we have X-Class, which is in bigger screens, monitors or in a 4K TV or whatever,

88
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.150
we just say great calls.

89
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.800
Five.

90
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:53.850
So now if we decrease the zoom level, we can get the five columns and let's add some, so some zooming

91
00:07:53.850 --> 00:08:00.150
effect when we hover over the car, when we we are in the large size or.

92
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:06.910
So we just say when we have a screen more than x light, which is here.

93
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.040
Let's to.

94
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.290
Let's change this scale.

95
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:29.700
Lists changed his skill to be a hundred and five percent, so now.

96
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.640
Actually, we shouldn't do here, we should do it inside the and continents, you know.

97
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.610
That is actually wrong.

98
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.110
Let's remove this.

99
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:53.540
And inside the car, we should do it, so in the top level, in the car they see when we have this screen

100
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.760
more than next large.

101
00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:01.390
And we hover over the element.

102
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:02.110
Let's.

103
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.040
Increase the scale.

104
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.130
Two hundred and five percent.

105
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.270
Now we see the change.

106
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:18.690
Yeah, here and actually in the two weeks large, we get the same team as well.

107
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:23.310
But let's make it more s'mores by adding some transition.

108
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.050
That is simple too.

109
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:35.340
We just need to right transition and transition and transform property because a skill is a part of

110
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.060
transform.

111
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:44.750
And do you want the duration to be two hundred milliseconds?

112
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:52.340
No, when we hover, we see that beautiful animation and smiles zooming effect.

113
00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:00.770
But we don't have this effect when we have a smaller screen because it doesn't make sense in the mobile

114
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.780
screen because we don't have a mouse when we're using a website inside and mobile.

115
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.830
We're just using the touch screen.

116
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:12.330
All right.

117
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.420
That was it for our project.

118
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:21.460
Uh, in the next section, we are going to add the project to the.

119
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.020
And.

120
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:32.060
First, sell and deploy it and also get a custom URL.

121
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.290
So we can have a real you out for our Web site.

122
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.710
Let's say before finishing, let's at this.

123
00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.690
To the guitar.

124
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:53.300
So we just take it at all, then we get come, it's.

125
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:56.620
And the message is.

126
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.170
Uh, just a complete.

127
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:08.610
The card components.

128
00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:13.360
And make it.

129
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.010
Responsive.

130
00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:27.790
I'll make the websites response or make the results section responsive.

131
00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:37.090
And finally, we use get push to push it to the.

132
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.140
Get up and refresh it here.

133
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:44.610
We have now.

134
00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.850
Nine comments, click on comments.

135
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:54.370
And here we see our last comment, which is in 18 seconds ago.

136
00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:04.910
As you can see, we just style it, it's style different section, like can't yes, and also resolved

137
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:05.570
that jazz.

138
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:13.280
That in the next section, we're going to deploy the website to Verso Seotioa in the next section.
