WEBVTT
1
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.870
All right, in the last section, we have finished styling with the header section, in this section,

2
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.130
we're going to start.

3
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.290
Uh, on the NAV Bar section.

4
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.340
So.

5
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.680
We go to an components section and open the NAF now border chase.

6
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:38.920
And if we look at the final version of the project here, we see that we did have one section, has

7
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.110
a different color and has two taps trending and top rated.

8
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.630
When we hover over the.

9
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:59.500
Tabs, we can see that the color of changes to white and when we click on the tab, they can see the

10
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.600
red color and also changing in the euro.

11
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.340
So in the trending we see the genre is fish trending.

12
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.940
And top rated, the genre is fish top rated.

13
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.200
You're going to use something called use effect.

14
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.510
Sorry use router from next year's router to create and push the.

15
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.630
The drought to this specific genre.

16
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:43.230
All right, if you go back to our visual studio code and we create a new folder called.

17
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.210
You tells.

18
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.600
And inside this folder, we're going to create a file called requests.

19
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.050
That, yes, this is the fault that we are going to use to have this information like.

20
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.610
Fitch Top-Rated or Fitch Trending and also these trending and top rated.

21
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.890
As well, so these are not hard coded, you're going to get this information from this file.

22
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.830
So here first, we need to have a.

23
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.640
An API key constant for getting the API key of the IMDb database.

24
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:51.830
So if we create a constant and we call it API underlying key and we are going to get the API key, this

25
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.720
is not a public concern.

26
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.310
It's going to be from our.

27
00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.040
Environmental and local environment.

28
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.490
So we just write process that Ian B Dutch API key.

29
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:16.750
So when we're up there pushing our application to get job, you're not going to push this variable and

30
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.300
it's amount because it's going to be from a environmental variable Soviet.

31
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.950
Let's create the environmental valuable here out in the main directory.

32
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.090
We just create a file called Don't Envy the local.

33
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:37.250
And.

34
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.590
So we made a mistake here, just to rename it, it's local, not local.

35
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.750
All right.

36
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.680
Now, if you pay attention, we can see this color is a little bit gray.

37
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.660
So it means that this file is not going to be pushed to the guitar.

38
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.530
And also these files to the notes modules and that next.

39
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.030
So here we are going to define the API key.

40
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:36.770
And let's go to A.B. website and the database, the database for I am divorced from the website called

41
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.500
TMT.

42
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.360
So and deep.

43
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.800
So 10 debates.

44
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.600
The website is the movie TB dot org.

45
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.710
This website we're going to use to get the Hey API key, so we click on the website.

46
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.890
And let's zoom out a little bit.

47
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.570
Yeah, here in the website, you can see it here, there is a log in or join Team BTB.

48
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.480
Make sure to join it.

49
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.310
It's very easy.

50
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.470
Just you need to just have some basic information from you.

51
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:26.710
So I already signed up for the website, but I just say looking and I just quickly write down my user

52
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.290
name and password.

53
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:49.170
And log in once I log in, I can see my stats and rating and other things in if we click on this icon.

54
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.220
If you click on it, they see the menu and there is a sitting.

55
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.540
So we click on Settings.

56
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.100
And here on the left.

57
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.160
Here we click on API.

58
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.830
So here we copy our API key.

59
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.340
And we go back to Visual Studio code and we paste it here.

60
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:27.330
All right.

61
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.060
And it's it's uh.

62
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:41.210
It's like a config file, we need to restart the server to see the effects.

63
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:51.550
So just stop the servers using contrasty and we just write down npm run dev to run the server again.

64
00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.090
All right.

65
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:07.580
So these are finished, so we have this and in request that, yes, now we have the API key.

66
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.920
So now we just need to create our export and create the files.

67
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.220
You just need to export.

68
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.340
Defaults.

69
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:37.420
The open is sort of curly braces, and here the first one, as if you remember it was fetched trendy

70
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:38.330
here.

71
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.330
So we just tried to fetch.

72
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:45.480
Trending.

73
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.380
And the fish stranding has two things the title.

74
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.260
Which is.

75
00:07:58.750 --> 00:07:59.500
Trending.

76
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:15.860
And also, we have the euro for the getting this and the the euro that's going to fetch the trending

77
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:24.440
data from the I, MTV or MTV website, which is forward slash trending.

78
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:30.660
And we have weak.

79
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:37.000
So before a week, we have all and.

80
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:47.680
So we are getting the trending of the week for all the movies, and after this we have the API key.

81
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.440
So there is a.

82
00:08:51.820 --> 00:09:02.200
So there is a question mark and we have API key, which is equal to.

83
00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.020
This API key here.

84
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.330
But.

85
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:18.300
But it's a variable, so we need to write it down inside a variable, but we need to change this double

86
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:24.560
quarterback back take to be able to write down variables.

87
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.820
So the variable is API key.

88
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:35.950
And after that, we have the language of the fishing.

89
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:42.100
And the language is English, so language equals English.

90
00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.650
So for this kind of object oriented orientated.

91
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:52.500
Kind of.

92
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:58.010
Template, this is this is going to be key.

93
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:03.490
And these are the values which are title and you are.

94
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:11.280
There's going to be another one which is top rated.

95
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:12.020
That's it.

96
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.260
I just want to grab that and paste it here.

97
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.600
It's very simple and similar to the top.

98
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:27.560
This one, instead of trending, we have top rated for the title.

99
00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:37.300
And you are and we are using to fish the data is movie top rated instead of trending all week.

100
00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:43.180
The API key is similar and also the language is English as well.

101
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:51.200
OK, now it's time to get this information inside the nafaa, don't you?

102
00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:51.710
Yes.

103
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.490
And look through this to.

104
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:04.880
It fetched trendy and top rated, so we go to now for the chase.

105
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.380
And we're going to import this first.

106
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.820
So at the top.

107
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.370
We just import.

108
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:17.710
Requests.

109
00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:25.540
From Utils slash request, and we're going to look through it, so.

110
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.590
Because it's object oriented, so we just right.

111
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.390
We just need the right optics.

112
00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.440
Dot.

113
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.660
Entries and.

114
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:56.760
Which one, what have you on a map is requests, so here would be requests inside the parentheses.

115
00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.460
And we're going to map through this.

116
00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:05.010
So the map is going to give us this kind of information.

117
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.660
They're going to give us the key.

118
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:09.000
Which was.

119
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:20.140
This one and this one and also it's going to give us the value, the values, I mean the title and the

120
00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:27.730
euro, but we need to destroy this structure it so we instead of values, we just try title.

121
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:30.910
And.

122
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.370
You are.

123
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.350
All right.

124
00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:41.510
So this is going to.

125
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:54.840
Return, let's just listen as a woman to see the results and first.

126
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.140
Uh, first we just returned key.

127
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.620
We saved a file.

128
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.740
The precious.

129
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:20.940
You're getting an error that's saying objects are not is not defined.

130
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:22.450
This is not objects.

131
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.910
These should be objects.

132
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.120
If that is so, it is, save it again.

133
00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:33.000
OK, now we are getting the Fitch trending and top rated.

134
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:42.790
So let's instead of queue, we get the title that's beneath it, which is trending and top rated, and

135
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:47.290
as we are mapping through something, we need to provide the key.

136
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:48.870
Here.

137
00:13:51.810 --> 00:14:02.250
So the key would be the same key we have this is necessary for react because we are again getting error

138
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:08.730
after that if you don't do it, especially when we are deploying the website in rehearsal.

139
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.510
It is common to get the error of not providing key.

140
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:15.700
All right.

141
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.300
So let's style this trending and top rated.

142
00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:22.890
All right.

143
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.150
You just change this class name.

144
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.470
To Flex to bring it.

145
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:37.770
Then next to each other and then the it's using justifies center.

146
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.080
We bring them to the centre horizontally.

147
00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:48.970
Excuse me.

148
00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:55.210
And then we change the background color to gray.

149
00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.650
The race instead of 700 that we used here.

150
00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:08.320
We're going to use six under to it be a little bit different.

151
00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:13.980
And let's change the color of the text to.

152
00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:17.500
Gray, 200.

153
00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:24.700
And.

154
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:33.740
The other thing is we need to do just, uh, we want to.

155
00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:42.130
Remove the ability to select that was that is annoying in the mobile version, so we just say select.

156
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:46.030
None.

157
00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:53.790
And, uh.

158
00:15:56.090 --> 00:16:02.510
Let's increase the size of the ticks, which are, say, ticks ticks large.

159
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:13.620
And when this size is bigger, I want to know when the size is bigger than large.

160
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:17.690
I want the changes of the text size to two x large.

161
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:27.900
So when we are here, the text is bigger than when when the size is smaller.

162
00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.810
Let's add some marching around each of them.

163
00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:42.780
So here we need to at children's stylists with this hat, each one.

164
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.330
Or let's make it to.

165
00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.100
It makes more sense.

166
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:57.180
So here we are at M6, marching six around it, so it looks better.

167
00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.470
Let's change the cursor to be pointer.

168
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:07.900
So when we hover over each element, we see a pointing hand.

169
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.510
Then when we hover over it, we want to change the text to white.

170
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.500
And when and.

171
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.360
It's.

172
00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:35.590
You can see the change and when they are active, it means that we are clicking on them.

173
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.890
Let's change the color to red.

174
00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:48.870
I can't.

175
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.320
So the we did everything now here, except the.

176
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:05.640
Except this changing to the you are out there, Chandra, and a top rated that is as simple as well,

177
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:07.230
we just need to.

178
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:13.690
As I mentioned, we need to import something called.

179
00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:22.650
Use router from next.

180
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:23.990
Slash.

181
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:26.460
Round her.

182
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:30.240
And let's create.

183
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.340
The constant here.

184
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.890
Recall this constant throughout her.

185
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.880
We equal this to use now to.

186
00:18:54.340 --> 00:19:00.310
And here inside this, it's too we add it on click.

187
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:19.070
So this unclear is going to be a function.

188
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.300
That's returns.

189
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.770
Throughout her.

190
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:31.460
Not push.

191
00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:41.990
And there you are, it would be wrong to push is let's add some Bektic, so we have we can have a variable.

192
00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.650
So there you are and will be Chandra.

193
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.160
Equal to.

194
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:56.550
The key the key is Fitch trendy or Fitch top rated.

195
00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:01.460
Okay.

196
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.120
They're getting some error.

197
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.130
Yeah.

198
00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:24.570
The error is because of the this user out there, it should be camel case.

199
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:25.320
Yeah.

200
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.060
Now it should work.

201
00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.210
Sorry, my laptop is a bit slow now, because on.

202
00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.540
Recording at the same time, but should be fine now.

203
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.190
Yeah, it's working now.

204
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:57.230
So when we maximize the window and tester, we click on trending and we get Chandra fish trending.

205
00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:03.380
And we click on top rated and we get John Traffic top rated.

206
00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:09.950
So in this in the next section, we're going to start.

207
00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:15.110
Getting that data from the API.

208
00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:27.280
And using these contexts, fetching from the URL and based on these keys, you're going to get the results

209
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.000
from the IMDb database.

210
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.710
As we can see in the final version.

211
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:37.440
All right.

212
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:46.950
So before ending the video, let's go to the guitar.

213
00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:48.810
So we just.

214
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:59.510
And everything that we did in this video and we did, we do the comments.

215
00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:09.940
That was created to now for.

216
00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:13.600
Components.

217
00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:20.540
And.

218
00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.320
Requests.

219
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.110
Is.

220
00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.810
All right, let's get pushed to it.

221
00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:52.040
All right.

222
00:22:52.960 --> 00:23:02.890
So let's go inside to get hopped up to come and refresh the page by clicking on this movie app version

223
00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:03.280
eight.

224
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.360
And we click on commits.

225
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:15.770
As you can see now, we created the Knapper components and request she.

226
00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.880
So in the network that yes.

227
00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:25.920
We created this file.

228
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:31.170
We imported the request from utils slash

229
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:39.600
request, and we imported the user out router from next router and be looped through the.

230
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.570
The object inside their request.

231
00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:54.360
And we created the request that yes, and get the export, some keys and title and the URL.

232
00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:05.310
Yeah, that was it for this section in the next section, we're going to start working on the server

233
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:07.620
side rendering and we're going to.

234
00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:19.470
Get the information from the A.P. first and populate the data and send it to send it to the client side.

235
00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:22.110
So see in the next section.
