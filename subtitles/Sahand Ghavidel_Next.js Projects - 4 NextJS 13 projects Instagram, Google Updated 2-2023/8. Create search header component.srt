1
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,000
All right.

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:16,780
In the last section, we have completed to the ability to get the data from the input and send it to

3
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,770
the URL.

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:26,000
In this section, we are going to start with the header section of the search page.

5
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,240
We have a header section for the home page.

6
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,440
And if you look at the final version of our project.

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:43,200
Here, when we search for something, we get the turn into this input

8
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,540
and we have it Heather here.

9
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,200
And also the results section is at the bottom.

10
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,350
So if you look at carefully what we have here, let me try it.

11
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:00,880
Or you?

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,630
So we just checked.

13
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,550
We have this is the head of.

14
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,710
From top to the bottom.

15
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,080
And we have a logo here.

16
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,520
And we have an input actually to form.

17
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:37,270
Which has a few things, the input itself, which is here.

18
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:46,490
We have a button to clear the this area to clear the form.

19
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,550
We have a microphone icon.

20
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,830
And we have a search icon.

21
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:06,720
They're good at getting these three icons from hero icons and and on the right side, we have our logging

22
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,390
thinks we don't need to create this one again.

23
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:19,140
We just, uh, add the user component here so we can simply have our authentication and user here.

24
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:28,210
This is for this section in the next section, we start with this options here, which is a.

25
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,360
Let me try it with a different color, so we have option here.

26
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,180
It has the whip search and also the imitators.

27
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:41,840
All right.

28
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:52,000
So let's first create this search page now in the final version, we have something called perch.

29
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,980
So when we go to.

30
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:04,120
Uh, let's go back to Visual Studio code, we open our site on the right side.

31
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,710
Let's start the server using npm run dev.

32
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,830
So now if we search something, for example, hello.

33
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:37,260
We get to tell at a top and then we go to the page called search, but the page is not created yet and

34
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,690
we get a forum for error saying this page could not be found.

35
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,310
So we create this page you see in the pages.

36
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:55,590
We create a new file and we call it search 30th.

37
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,930
We can use RF Sea to use to create a reactor functional component.

38
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,240
We don't need to react here and.

39
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,690
Here we start creating our page.

40
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,450
So let's go to that page now, as you can see now we have the page.

41
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,470
No, you're not getting the error anymore.

42
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,670
So for the page, because it's a separate page, we need to hit tag.

43
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,260
This is a hit attack from.

44
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,100
From next year.

45
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,240
Just be sure to to to be capitalized here.

46
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,950
So, uh, this is a hit track and we need to imported from the next.

47
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,460
So we, you know, we get the auto suggestion.

48
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,640
We're getting it from next forward slash hit.

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,280
And inside the head, we can add, for example, at titre or method tax so tightly, we just say first

50
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,880
like a search page.

51
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,790
Now we should see it at the top.

52
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,680
Now I can see the search page.

53
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,980
All right, so after the attack.

54
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:28,620
As you hear, you can see we have the header and also we have the results section.

55
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,810
And finally, we have the patient issue.

56
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,700
So for the year, we just add the.

57
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:43,380
So we have to search harder because it's different from the our home header.

58
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,580
And then we have search results.

59
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,680
Let's create a component and we call it search header.

60
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:07,700
So here in the Components folder, we create a component and we call it a search

61
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:10,700
header.

62
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,510
That's Jed James.

63
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,260
And we can use our fear to create a reactive functional component.

64
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,310
And let's delete this part, and we go to search that, yes, and we import that.

65
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,290
So we import search.

66
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,400
Header.

67
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:40,630
And we imported automatically from components search.

68
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:51,300
So now we can see in the search page and we are getting this search had.

69
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:58,840
So let's continue our work inside the search for the tech genius.

70
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,240
So this did we change it to header tank?

71
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:16,910
And this Heather Tagg is going to have some intelligence classes if we want the hitter to stick to the

72
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,360
top.

73
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,580
So we make it sticky.

74
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:27,260
So because if you look at the final version, when we're scrolling down, the here is always at the

75
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:27,620
top.

76
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:36,900
And the hitter has a background color of whites, so it's not transparent, so we need to do two things.

77
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:42,000
First, we need to stick it to the top by using a sticky top zero.

78
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,780
And we just need to change the background color to whites.

79
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,130
So now.

80
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,540
We have the hill now at the top, so whatever we do, we always add a top.

81
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,240
Then we added Div to have everything inside us.

82
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,520
So in the final version, we have the local input and this user.

83
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,930
So let's create these components, these elements.

84
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,100
So.

85
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,530
Let's start with the image.

86
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,020
The image is very similar to the one that we created for the home page.

87
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,840
So we can copy that one, if you remember in the home page.

88
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,980
He added.

89
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,180
Image.

90
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,460
Here.

91
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,080
We want the same image, but with the different width and height.

92
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,960
So we copy this image here.

93
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,800
So we don't need to create it again.

94
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:57,570
So if we go to Senator Grassley, we can close the search, said yes and floater.

95
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,840
So we pasted here.

96
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,900
So let's go to our page.

97
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,110
There's something.

98
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:17,980
And we need to import the image from the Knicks forward slash image, and we should see it right now.

99
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:18,280
Yeah.

100
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:30,730
Just we changed the width and height, the width, we just said it to be 120 and height to be there,

101
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,090
for example 40.

102
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,780
And we can't we can change the object, faith.

103
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,660
We can keep it covered or we can choose to contain.

104
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,650
So now the size is fine.

105
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:53,270
And also, when we click on this image, we want to come back to the home page, so we need to edit

106
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,360
and click to this image tech.

107
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:06,230
So it's very simple we need to click, but before that, we need to use our router to do that so we

108
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,530
can use user data from next.

109
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,580
So we need to import to use about router.

110
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,710
From next Phobos-Grunt.

111
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,390
And then here at the top, it creates a constant.

112
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:34,610
And we call this content constant router equal to use throughout.

113
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,210
Now we can use on Click.

114
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:49,310
And we create a function, actually, which returns rather.

115
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:58,520
The push and the page we want to go is homepage, so we just and a forward slash.

116
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:04,040
So now if we click on this logo, we should come back to the homepage.

117
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:15,800
Simply, so let's go back to that page and let's add a cursor to be like the Ateca cursor to be pointer

118
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,800
so we can see a pointing hand when we hover over the.

119
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:20,920
Local.

120
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,100
So we just at a.

121
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,950
Class name.

122
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,430
Cursor point.

123
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,880
Now, when we hover over the logo, we should see a pointing.

124
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,370
All right, so that's it for the image part.

125
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,430
Let's continue with the forum and the.

126
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,720
Input.

127
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,310
So after the image, we create a form.

128
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,470
We don't need to action.

129
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,970
And in scientist form, we at.

130
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:08,720
And if you think we need the input, we need three and we need three icons.

131
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:15,310
This icon, the microphone and also the search icon.

132
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,230
So first, we create the input.

133
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,880
We just say input.

134
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,860
And the time is.

135
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:36,290
The type should be ticks, and then this one has a reference to it because we want to create and we

136
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:40,370
want to get the information from this form as well.

137
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,790
Now we can see the input here.

138
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,800
Should be sorry.

139
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,160
Yeah.

140
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,090
Can't see the form and the input.

141
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:01,880
But we want to we want to what we want to get is we want to get that, uh.

142
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:09,860
When we, for example, we write hello here, you want to see the hello inside this inputs?

143
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:16,070
And also we want to get the information later using use ref.

144
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:26,360
So first, we need to define the default value to be we can get the information from the crowd.

145
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,860
Rhonda, you are using and it's.

146
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,380
We can we can get it using router.

147
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,870
Dot query.

148
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:47,770
And we just need to add the term, so when we do this one, we get the hell out here.

149
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:56,870
And if you go back to homepage, we search for something else, for example, uh, background image.

150
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,360
Although something similar is simple, the search for nice.

151
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,040
We see nice here.

152
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,620
All right, so.

153
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:17,210
And then, uh, next is we want to get the information as well, so we need to create a riff and we

154
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:17,750
call it.

155
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,400
Similar to the previous one, we call it search.

156
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,690
Search input, ref.

157
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,290
And we need to create this one.

158
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,510
Now you can see we are getting an error saying search input ref is not defined.

159
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,540
Let's create that one at a time.

160
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,780
So we create a constant and we call it search.

161
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,090
Input riff and we equal it to use with.

162
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,740
And the initial value is not.

163
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,940
And we need to import Youssef from React.

164
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,040
Similar to the one we did for the homepage.

165
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:18,560
So now we can have access to this information, are you going to use it later?

166
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:27,350
First bullet and the buttons and other stuff so we can when we submit the form, we can get the information

167
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,210
as far.

168
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,620
So you can change the route or that time.

169
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,780
So we got the input.

170
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:46,560
No, let's import the icons, the X icon.

171
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,300
The ex-con, the microphone and the search are upon.

172
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,620
So at a top.

173
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,470
The import.

174
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,970
The icons, the first I found this microphone.

175
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,050
Our car, this second one is search.

176
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,020
Search icon, and then we have the X icon.

177
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,680
And all these things coming from here are icons.

178
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,390
First, react, former Soviet.

179
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,430
So let's use these icons here.

180
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,350
So after the inputs.

181
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,220
They have the X icon.

182
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,340
Let's make it a little bit smaller so we can continue.

183
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:04,660
Later, we're going to completely astound the pace first and everything and then be we do there just

184
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:09,690
to be at the height of seven for this.

185
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,980
Next, we have the microphone icon.

186
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,160
We set the height for this one.

187
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:21,660
Six.

188
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,550
And then we have the.

189
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,020
Search AKA.

190
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,610
Let's set the high to be successful.

191
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:47,380
So everything is fine, and then the final thing we need is just the user after this form, the we add

192
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,510
the user component that we created and we're going to import it.

193
00:17:54,050 --> 00:18:01,640
From the same level, so as you can see now, we have the signing and sign of that bill.

194
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,970
All right, so let's now.

195
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,700
It style our pitch.

196
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,620
We already start the Google Image.

197
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,450
First, we make the display to Flex to bring everything to next to each other.

198
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:28,700
Then we change the width of this diff to be full.

199
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:38,020
And finally, we add a patty of six to push everything a little bit inside.

200
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,110
And we can center them using items center.

201
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:50,400
So now you can see everything looking good, except this part that we're going to fix it.

202
00:18:51,660 --> 00:19:00,960
And I want this user to be on the right side, so I want this user half the class of margin left auto.

203
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:09,570
But if we go to user and do this fine, it's going to affect the other header as well.

204
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,830
So we don't want to do it.

205
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,320
We just want to do a valuable

206
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,740
class.

207
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,290
So here we can add a class here.

208
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,020
We can add a clip and we just add our the class we minute just margin left auto.

209
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,200
So you're going to push it to the right side.

210
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,850
But in order to see the effect, we need to add this class stamp to the user.

211
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,340
So if we go to user touches.

212
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:46,090
And be at this class name here and get it.

213
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,870
As a prop.

214
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:58,710
So we get the class name and we add added to the birth of things like, we want the image to be like

215
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,310
this one.

216
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,680
So we add we change this.

217
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,280
Uh?

218
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,830
Class name.

219
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,370
To the back takes so we can add a.

220
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,380
Valuable to it.

221
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,550
And inside this, we add a variable and we call it class.

222
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,040
We should do the same things for the.

223
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,810
The other return as well, so.

224
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,620
And here in the class name.

225
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,350
We changed the tactic.

226
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:43,890
So.

227
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,500
And yeah.

228
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,800
So we add the class stamp here as far.

229
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,590
Now we can see that the signing went to the right side.

230
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:14,030
So this is only been affected for the heinous action, not for the home page.

231
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:23,930
So this is the trick you can use for have a dynamic and class four component.

232
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:25,730
All right.

233
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:33,920
So before we finish for the user, this and this part, let's style this form.

234
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,090
So we want the forum to have some classes.

235
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:47,500
We want to bring everything next to each other using Display Flex and.

236
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,500
Let's add some border.

237
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,360
As well, so we can see what's inside.

238
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,460
And we want the borders to be.

239
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:09,440
Gray hair color would be gray, so we just say border gray.

240
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,100
For example, two hundred.

241
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,810
Let's make it rounded using rounded full.

242
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,750
And we add some shadow effects, so we just a shadow.

243
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,740
And we make the Shadow Lodge.

244
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:39,760
And finally, we we can we need to add some padding in the X level x axis of six.

245
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:48,970
So push me here and then we have a padding on the y axis.

246
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,190
This one is three.

247
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,220
And we have a margin left of 10.

248
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,230
So we have some space here.

249
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,320
And then we have a margin right of five.

250
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:19,150
So we have we just continue with we need to add flex growth, so we want this have a kind of completely

251
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,200
get this space.

252
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:25,990
So we use flex grow and we use max width of.

253
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,560
Three weeks now.

254
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:40,840
So when we have a like a bigger, a bigger screen, the maximum is three weeks out like this.

255
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:52,640
Then finally, we sent her everything using items center.

256
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:01,370
So push these icons a little bit down to make them center.

257
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:07,380
So don't worry about this logos, we're going to fix it.

258
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,850
Soon and then for the inputs.

259
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,290
We had some class name.

260
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:22,550
And this is going to be a very simple, we just add this with a full.

261
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:30,050
So you can see that the icons came back and then we have to focus.

262
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:39,110
And when we focus, we don't want to have this ring around it, so we just say ring and we can say at

263
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,680
line.

264
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:45,960
None.

265
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,070
So we don't have any bank here.

266
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:59,810
So as you can see, it's not that's beautiful to have this like icons.

267
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,740
When we have a smaller screen.

268
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:10,720
So if you look at the final version, when we decrease the size of this grain, let me increase the.

269
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,740
Make it bigger.

270
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,220
When we go to the mobile sites.

271
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,760
We don't have this microphone and the.

272
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:28,490
This search icon in this point.

273
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,650
And then.

274
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:45,190
So we have this sign in page, and we can fix this one using water white with space, no rap.

275
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,880
No problem, and then, uh.

276
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,710
The logo itself is getting smaller.

277
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,510
As well.

278
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:05,990
So let's just remove these icons and also let's fix fix this signing.

279
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,360
First, we go to.

280
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:16,340
This sign in, we can add something called white to space, no wrap.

281
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,840
There's always like this.

282
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:34,610
And then let's remove these icons when we have a smaller screen, so there will be heat in when we have

283
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:34,850
a.

284
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,060
A smaller screen.

285
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,090
But when it's bigger than a small.

286
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,880
When they're bigger than they are in line Flex.

287
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,120
Let's add this phone to the microphone as well.

288
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:01,190
And then we should see them in this.

289
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:21,450
So let's style these three icons first, so make it a little bit bigger so we can see all the icons.

290
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,350
And then I put this one at the top.

291
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:30,420
Let's close the left side so we can have more space.

292
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,580
So the icon?

293
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:46,620
The X icon we have, we can change the color of this using text gray, just fix it to be maybe five

294
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,860
hundred is fine to just have a sun grey color.

295
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:54,890
And then we have we want to have something like.

296
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,340
We want the cursor to be pointer.

297
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:06,570
So when we hover over this year pointing hand and then the other things we can add is just the.

298
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:18,410
When it was just added when it is smaller and this screen is bigger than a small like this, this size,

299
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,840
we want to have a margin.

300
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,410
Uh, margin right of three.

301
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:35,390
So we have a little bit of space from the X icon and this one, and we want to add something like a

302
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,860
border here as well.

303
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:44,030
So you use the microphone icon for adding the border for the microphone icon.

304
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,440
We changed the color to be blue.

305
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:56,500
Actually, both of these a search like on a microphone, I find they have a blue color, so we use dual

306
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,280
cursor to put two and four, both of them, so we just ticks.

307
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,610
Blue 500.

308
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:11,240
For both of the six blue, five hundred.

309
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,240
And then let's see what we had they have.

310
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,990
So that's fine for this.

311
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,530
This search icon looks fine.

312
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,130
Just the microphone icon, let's continue for that.

313
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:34,340
Then we added more padding left for.

314
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,140
And then we add a border

315
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,530
in the left.

316
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:56,370
And also, we said it to be two, which is two pixels, so we have a border.

317
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:01,600
Here and then we want the border to be gray.

318
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,070
So we just changed the border color to be gray.

319
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,410
And three hundred.

320
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,450
So we can see it more clear.

321
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:25,100
Then we can add something like marching right after three, so have a little more space from the search

322
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,030
icon as well.

323
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,570
Next, you want to add the ability when we click on this.

324
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,040
OK, but I can't.

325
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,750
We want to remove whatever inside this input, so I have something here.

326
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,060
When I click here, it should remove it.

327
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,090
It's very simple to do so.

328
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,540
We in the X icon, we can add unclaimed.

329
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:02,520
And it is going to trigger a function which is going to return.

330
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:10,730
If you remember, we got the information from the inputs using search input, ref.

331
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:14,420
So we can change the current value.

332
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:19,520
Of this, we just a current that value.

333
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,210
Equal to an empty string.

334
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:30,220
So now, if you click, we should delete whatever insight.

335
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,230
The simple as that.

336
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:47,100
OK, now our uh, everything looks fine, we just need to get the information and show it on this screen

337
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:54,150
as well on the URL, because then we are typing something, nothing is happening.

338
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:04,960
In order to get the information inside the forum, we need to add a bottom, so we just add a button,

339
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:11,560
but I don't want we don't want to show the button so we can make the button hidden and we just add a

340
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:16,870
type of submit for the button and we trigger a function.

341
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,720
So we add a button here.

342
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,070
The Typekit would be submit.

343
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,590
And.

344
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:30,180
There is nothing to write down, and the.

345
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,560
We just use the hidden tax review to make it hidden.

346
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,770
And the add oncolytic.

347
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:53,490
The anklet is going to try to call a function like the one, the previous one we did for the homepage.

348
00:32:55,390 --> 00:33:01,180
Now we need to create a function because we are getting an error saying search is not defined, but

349
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:07,930
at the top we can create the function function is completely similar to one we did in the home page,

350
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,840
but let's create it again as a review.

351
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:16,120
So we create a function and we call it search.

352
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:21,600
And this is going to get some thing like events.

353
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,620
We can use that event to prevent refreshing the page.

354
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,000
So we just say events that prevent default.

355
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:40,180
Then we can get the information from the input and we put it inside a constant called turn.

356
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:46,130
This term is equal to that search input, ref.

357
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,950
The current value.

358
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:54,430
All right.

359
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,220
So we get the term.

360
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,210
Now it's time to check the term existed or not, you just say if the term is not exist, it.

361
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:14,690
Just return, but you want to know this, someone is using the website doesn't put this space, so we

362
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:23,960
can trim it, so this trim is going to remove all the spaces before the return.

363
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:31,060
And finally, if the term exists, we want to go to death.

364
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,720
You are out, so we just see rather that push.

365
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:44,260
And we can specify it with the back tick, because it's dynamic.

366
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:49,430
You are out, this is going to go to the search page.

367
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:53,920
With the Korea term, which is equal to.

368
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:04,380
That term, but we want to remove the space bit before that, so we use trim.

369
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,190
So let's try this.

370
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,460
So we go here and search, for example.

371
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:11,810
Hello.

372
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,170
And if you look at the URL now, we have the term hello.

373
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,470
And in the search pitch.

374
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,360
Yeah, that was it for the header section.

375
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:31,490
It's fine you can go to the Logan.

376
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,050
Who just fell?

377
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,830
And the.

378
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,880
Let's search something.

379
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,470
Now we can see here that so.

380
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,790
Yeah, that's that's it looks fine.

381
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,930
And let's put everything in, get her first.

382
00:35:54,230 --> 00:36:02,720
And we just, uh, just and everything using it, and we can commit it with the message of.

383
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,330
Create search.

384
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:16,430
Heather components.

385
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:24,520
Components and we push push it to get.

386
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,980
Let's go to GitHub and check.

387
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:35,260
And the review of a code very briefly.

388
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,720
So we go to the last comment.

389
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:44,620
As you can see, we created a new component called search filter that yes.

390
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,250
Which we are just a.

391
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:54,320
A death.

392
00:36:55,330 --> 00:37:05,500
Which has the image of the Google icon, then we have the form that includes input and tree icons.

393
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:18,190
And when we submit the form using a hidden button, we call it function if it's going to route the URL.

394
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:26,790
To the this font to search term, and we get the term using use ref.

395
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:32,610
And also we inside the user that, yes, we've got that dynamic.

396
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:43,440
Classes using we just got the class them using props, and we added to the both of the image and also

397
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,940
the button so we could bring the set.

398
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,620
That's it.

399
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,510
User to the right side using margin left auto.

400
00:37:53,410 --> 00:38:02,140
And in the search, such as we just added component search, yeah, that was it for this heather part

401
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,530
in the next section, we're going to create this.

402
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:12,880
Options and we call them search header options.

403
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,270
So two options are available.

404
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,980
One is all and one is images.

405
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:25,370
So when we click on all this, we should see the web search and then we click on images.

406
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,490
We should see the.

407
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:33,080
Images of deaths tour, which is now as Hella.

408
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,920
So in the next section, we're going to do that, so, sir, in the next section.
