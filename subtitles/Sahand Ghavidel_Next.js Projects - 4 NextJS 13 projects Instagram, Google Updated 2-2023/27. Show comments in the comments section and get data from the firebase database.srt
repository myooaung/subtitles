1
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:14,610
All right, in the last section, we have completed the ability to submit a comment to the database.

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:24,080
In this section, we're going to look through those data that's in the database and show it here, either

3
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,370
at the bottom of the caption.

4
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:36,600
So in order to do that, we're going to use the same method we used to get the post, which is the use

5
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,140
effect.

6
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,210
And uh.

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,720
You're going to look through the fetch data using map method.

8
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,790
So look at the if you look at the final version of the project here.

9
00:00:52,870 --> 00:01:02,260
We see the comment section here, which is scrollable, and let me sign in with another account and

10
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:02,740
we do.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,690
The.

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,740
His signing with.

13
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:12,730
This account.

14
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,830
And here I put another comment.

15
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:31,500
Just a nice press enter, if you can see that we the the last comment comes first and at the top of

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,620
other comments and we can see the time here.

17
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,690
The previous one is two days ago.

18
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,960
This one is a few seconds ago.

19
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,920
And if you wait for a minute, we see that this might change to a minute ago.

20
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:57,660
We're going to get this status from the time stamp of the comment that is created and show it with the

21
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,770
package called a react moment here.

22
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:12,930
So let's go back to Visual Studio code, and we open our local host 3000 at the right side.

23
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,070
And we go to post that, yes.

24
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:25,830
And here at the comment, at the top first we get the data.

25
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,460
No, we have only one stage S. comment.

26
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,530
Let's create another state.

27
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,610
Let's copy this one using all shift Oradan.

28
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,350
We changed his font to comments and this font of comments.

29
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:53,250
And if first, initial value would be an empty bracket so we don't have any comments at the beginning,

30
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,980
then we're going to use use effects to get the data.

31
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:09,220
So just here, we create a use effect and hope that it can fetch the data.

32
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:18,670
So don't forget to add the dependency so we don't request too many from the database.

33
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:29,140
So as we we did before, we should create a constant called unsubscribe.

34
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:38,620
And this is going to be this is going to be from on the snapshot.

35
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:52,870
So we just create a snapshot and this snapshot is coming from Firebase Restore that the use effect is

36
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,100
coming from react.

37
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,270
So we imported both of them.

38
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,060
And, uh, let's.

39
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,450
This fund would be inside.

40
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,460
So we create a collection and a collection.

41
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:18,310
It's from our DP, which is coming from fire base 30, yes.

42
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,550
And we have the collection of posts.

43
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:31,830
Inside the post, we want to target the IED, which is coming from here.

44
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:44,040
Which is the idea of the post and then we get the collection comments.

45
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:57,030
But this one, we want it to be ordered by the Senate, so we had a query here.

46
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,190
I recover all of their.

47
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,300
And here we add an order by.

48
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,750
The order by IS based on timestamps.

49
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,140
And it should be descending.

50
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:37,360
So we need to bring these things and see we're getting an error saying courey is not defined.

51
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,680
So we just import Corey after that.

52
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:50,110
The Import Collection collection is already imported, so we order order by.

53
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:52,300
Yeah.

54
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,550
Shouldn't get any error.

55
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,860
And the ATP as a dependency.

56
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,670
As well as the.

57
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,030
Anything that is valuable, we should.

58
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,520
And there's a dependency.

59
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,000
OK.

60
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:19,590
So and finally, we need to get this information using a snapshot.

61
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,070
So when the courier is finished.

62
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,600
Here.

63
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:33,400
We get the information, the data using the snapshot and the snapshot.

64
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,760
If inside the snapshot, they're going to set the comments to the state, we have to set the comments

65
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,710
to be a snapshot.

66
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,420
Dot dock.

67
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,620
This is the similar to the one we did for the post.

68
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,420
Are you already familiar with?

69
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,030
So.

70
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:10,290
We just using it on Snapchat, got the data from the collection and we started using curry.

71
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,410
And finally, we put it inside the comments using set comments.

72
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:25,710
Hook here we use the user statehood and using set comments, we got the value for the comments.

73
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,250
No, we need to show this comment inside the.

74
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,220
After this caption, so let's find the caption.

75
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,400
The caption is here.

76
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,000
So after this paragraph.

77
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:50,780
We we just create a ternary operator saying if there is a comment, so we just say comments that Lance.

78
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,580
More than.

79
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,510
Zero.

80
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,630
If the length of the comments on more than zero.

81
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:07,710
In other words, if there is a comment, then show these things.

82
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,580
First, we create it.

83
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,030
Year.

84
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,360
And inside this, they're going to use.

85
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,530
A map map method to get all the comments.

86
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:29,070
So it's just see comments that map and maps is going to give us each comment.

87
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,670
It's like this.

88
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,220
And inside this.

89
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,320
We're going to have another day.

90
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:48,760
And inside the day, we're going to have if you look at the final version, we have the image username

91
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,470
and a comment.

92
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,050
And finally, we have them the moment.

93
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,850
React Moments package.

94
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,510
So first, let's get this image.

95
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,760
So we have an AMG.

96
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,740
Which this source is.

97
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,630
Comment.

98
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:21,870
But if you remember, we need to add data parenthesis to achieve the information and the user image.

99
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,100
Because in fact, the.

100
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,250
Firebase, if you look at the data.

101
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:34,900
For example.

102
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,730
We.

103
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,860
Let's see which here we added a comment.

104
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,340
So.

105
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:52,510
The comment has an idea, and inside we have the fields which think green and it has the user image.

106
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,700
So we are using that one.

107
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,760
Inside here.

108
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,550
But we need to add the data.

109
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,880
To get the information.

110
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,280
The alternative is user image.

111
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:10,990
All right.

112
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,280
And, uh, let's do the other one.

113
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,520
Let's see that we are getting the data now.

114
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,800
Yeah, we're getting the image here.

115
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,410
So after the image.

116
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,450
We need to add a paragraph for the username.

117
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,320
Let's see if we can.

118
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,150
Yeah, we just need to add the username here.

119
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,350
Here would be.

120
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:02,420
Comment dot data dot.

121
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,370
If you look at the database, it's.

122
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,470
It's comments.

123
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,390
We just need to write comment.

124
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,320
So it would be two comments to comment that data.

125
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,370
That comment?

126
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,570
So let's see.

127
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,220
Yeah.

128
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,430
So we got the comment.

129
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:37,440
Sorry, we need to get the username here, so just copy this and the above would be user name.

130
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,520
So we have the use and then we have the comment.

131
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,000
And finally, we need to get the time.

132
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,320
So we need to install a package called reacts.

133
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,280
A moment.

134
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,610
So let's search for this moment first.

135
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,880
So here in the Google, the search for react.

136
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,390
Moment.

137
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,810
At just one a.m., So there is a champion package.

138
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,290
Called the react moment.

139
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,080
If you click on that.

140
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,200
For installing this package, we just need to copy this line of code.

141
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,570
And pasted here.

142
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:37,780
And for using it, we just need to import moment from react moment.

143
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,920
And finally, we need to wrap.

144
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,440
We use like this a moment, and we add the date and time for other things.

145
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:54,850
So let's run the server and run.

146
00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:00,780
Did I just add the above we import?

147
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,650
The import moment from React moment and here.

148
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,390
Let's do that.

149
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,640
We did.

150
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,120
The comment section here.

151
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,810
Just here, we need to at the moment, we just say moment.

152
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,430
They close it, and here we need to add the information and also inside it.

153
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,100
We have

154
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,370
comments.

155
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,400
That data.

156
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,650
The time stamp.

157
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:55,440
So we are getting from here the timestamp.

158
00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:01,200
But this time, Pakistan looks doesn't look good, if we put it like this.

159
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,310
So if you look at our web site.

160
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,630
Now.

161
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:17,090
We are getting the time actually saying invalid date.

162
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:18,630
But.

163
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:28,690
First, we need to protect it, because maybe maybe the time is not available, so we don't get the

164
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:37,120
error and then we should convert this fun to faith by using to date function.

165
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,590
This today's function is actually a built in function from the JavaScript.

166
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:49,720
So we are getting the time like this, but this is not cool and nice for the website, and it's very

167
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,610
hard to understand information.

168
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,960
We have the date, we have the time, everything and time zone.

169
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,930
No, this is different.

170
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,530
So we have a Tuesday, but we wanted to show this how many minutes ago this it came.

171
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,230
So for doing that, we just right here.

172
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:19,480
From now, this is the attribute that is building for the React moment.

173
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:26,530
As soon as we add this one, we can see this is it two days ago, two days ago?

174
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,290
And if you add another one?

175
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,200
That's amazing.

176
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:40,660
It should come to do the beginning and says a few seconds ago.

177
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:41,980
All right.

178
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:47,860
So let's install this one to make it look cooler and nicer.

179
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,370
So at the top, they've.

180
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,460
That is covering everything we need to.

181
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,120
We just say the Max.

182
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,050
Sorry, the margin X.

183
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,750
Would be 10.

184
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:15,070
So we just push them a little bit to the right side and from the here and now we just see max height

185
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,260
to be 24.

186
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,580
So this is going to limit the place, see?

187
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,040
But you cannot see it.

188
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,930
We cannot even scroll it.

189
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,980
We need to add something we did before.

190
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,270
So a scroll.

191
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:32,950
For.

192
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,890
No, the first we just make the overflow.

193
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,350
In the y direction to be a cruel.

194
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,880
Now we can school here, but we don't want this ugly scroll bar.

195
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,450
You don't see it in websites like Instagram.

196
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,920
So we if you remember, we installed a package called.

197
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:18,330
Show you here and package that, Jason, if you remember for previously for this story section, we

198
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,410
installed a package called Tillman Scrollbar.

199
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:31,920
This Tillman Skirboll allows us to remove the scrollbar by just saying a scroll bar.

200
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:32,910
None.

201
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,750
So we hide it, and it's just you can just ask for.

202
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:41,300
All right.

203
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,370
Let's change the other styles we have.

204
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,290
So for the image.

205
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:58,650
Just after all this debate that is covering everything, first, we need to create a flex.

206
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,540
So we bring everything next to each other.

207
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:07,380
So we changed the display to Flex so you can see everything is next to each other.

208
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:13,920
And then we center everything using item center.

209
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,280
It brings us to the center.

210
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:26,970
And let's add a space between them using a space x to.

211
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:37,900
And finally, we had a marching button of two and a little bit more space at the bottom.

212
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,780
So let's install the image now.

213
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,850
The image would have a height of seven.

214
00:18:52,850 --> 00:19:00,740
So make it smaller, and then we're going to run it or make it circle using round it for.

215
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:17,220
And if someone upload a image that is not like a square, we can add object cover to prevent is stretching

216
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,180
the image.

217
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:25,640
So that is just in case someone put the bad, bad image.

218
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,130
All right.

219
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,650
Let's do it for the.

220
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,480
This username.

221
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,720
The username, we just make it semi-public both.

222
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,380
We just say font semi bald.

223
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,150
All right, and then we.

224
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:04,850
We push this one to the end by using Flex one for the common section.

225
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,890
So we just say class name.

226
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,620
It's late this.

227
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,610
So this is going to be Flex one.

228
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:21,930
So push this one to the end, and also, if someone's right, too many, too much things, we wanted

229
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,810
to truncate it, so suggested truncate.

230
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,340
Truncates, so if I write so much

231
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:35,600
like this.

232
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,220
This is going to be truncated.

233
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,660
So that was it for this part.

234
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,440
I think that's that looks fine.

235
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:57,670
Let's test it to the other section and compare it for the final version.

236
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,260
Yeah, we just increased the size.

237
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,330
Yeah.

238
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:08,560
Now you can see, not even the comment is not truncated because we have more space.

239
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,680
So let's try it here.

240
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,660
Nice image.

241
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,840
All right, it's working nice.

242
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,670
Amazing birds.

243
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:35,580
So that was it for this part in the next section, we are going to add the lack of ability.

244
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:45,370
So if you look at the final version, this one when we like this post, for example, with this account.

245
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,510
The like button would be.

246
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:55,360
And also we it's showing one likes.

247
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,540
So let's see it for the next one, too.

248
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,120
So we have one light.

249
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:08,380
And then if we go with the other accounts, I want to show you that the number of the lights would increase

250
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,480
if we.

251
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,750
So the other icons.

252
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,290
It's signing with quote, it's a hand.

253
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,470
So now if I.

254
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:37,060
Lie, because if you can see that I didn't like this one before with this account, but we still have

255
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,930
one like you.

256
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,760
But when we like now?

257
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,830
We should see too lax.

258
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,270
So if more accounts for more people like this since on day, this number is going up, going to updated.

259
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:55,110
And if I dislike it, it's, you know, it's bollocks, so it's going to calculate the number of the

260
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,620
likes.

261
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:01,980
And also if checks that if I liked it or people to change the color of the like button.

262
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:12,560
So in the next section, we're going to achieve this first, we just add everything to the guitar and

263
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:20,090
the reference and we review what we have done now, so we add a message of

264
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:23,960
show.

265
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,030
Comments.

266
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:34,770
In the.

267
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,650
Comments section.

268
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:47,190
From the fire.

269
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,060
Base.

270
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,220
Database.

271
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,040
And just say.

272
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,180
And get.

273
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:19,850
Data from five tested, yeah, so we just push everything to get half and which we refresh the page

274
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,260
to see the new comment.

275
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:33,410
So let's review what we have done, so we create a use effect to get the data from the database using

276
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:38,780
on snapshot, we sorted everything using courier and ordered by.

277
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:47,990
And finally, we show them inside this section after the caption, so we look through the comments.

278
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:58,930
And we showed the image, the username and also the comment itself, and we use a package called Moment

279
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:07,330
or React Moment to show the time that is passed using from now attribute here.

280
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:13,360
So here we can see that the stealth and react moments.

281
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:18,010
So this is actually installing Moment two.

282
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:22,680
So this is based on the another package called moment.

283
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,010
All right.

284
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,320
So in the next section, we are going to achieve this.

285
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:34,530
They're like functionality and we're going to save the lights inside the database and get the data and

286
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,010
shows.

287
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,240
Show it here.

288
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:43,770
And before the the user name caption, so see you in the next section.
