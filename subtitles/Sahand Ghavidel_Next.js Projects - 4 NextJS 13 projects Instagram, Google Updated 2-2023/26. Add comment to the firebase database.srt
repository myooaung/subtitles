1
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:17,170
All right, in the last section, we have implemented a way that we hide the buttons and the input box

2
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,810
when we are not signing in this section, we're going to implement the

3
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,540
comments feature and we can send the comments to the database.

4
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,990
Let's start the server using npm run dev.

5
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,860
And bring this one to the right side.

6
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,350
All right.

7
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,140
So if you look at the final version of the project here.

8
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Now we are signing with the.

9
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:17,810
My Gmail account quote with sand and in the first image, which is this account's honor, I write a

10
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,360
message, for example, say.

11
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,100
Just beautiful.

12
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,110
Just say nice.

13
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,180
And as you can see.

14
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,380
We're getting this a few seconds ago.

15
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:41,900
The user name and the profile image, and if you look at the.

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:51,080
Database and we choose the final version one, which is instead version one.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,570
Now.

18
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,530
The one with the nice bird one, we have another.

19
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,320
S..

20
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,840
In other.

21
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:10,920
Collection, which is the name is comments, and it has the idea.

22
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,370
And the idea.

23
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:26,230
If you click on ITV, you see the comment, the time stamp, which is the time that comment is posted,

24
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,350
then we have the user image and username.

25
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,490
Let's do it with the other image.

26
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:39,040
So, uh, fantastic.

27
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,270
And if you check the first one now, it's a minute ago.

28
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,950
This one in a few seconds ago.

29
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,970
This is all automatically created by a package called Moment.

30
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,340
So let's go check.

31
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:06,590
So if you go back to the other post, this post has a comment collection, too with that document.

32
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:16,220
And the field is fantastic as a comment, and they have the time stamp user image and username.

33
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,120
So let's do this one in our own project.

34
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:31,430
I mean, the one that we're building now, so we go to Visual Studio Code, we open our website at the

35
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,270
right side.

36
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:44,300
First thing we need to do is to just this, uh, this button, which is related to the comment section,

37
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,880
you want it to be disabled when there is nothing inside the comment section.

38
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,450
So in the bottom.

39
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,960
This is for the signing, this is the header that you have in the post that in the button section which

40
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,240
has which is saying.

41
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,740
Post, we need to add a.

42
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,210
Disabled more.

43
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:23,380
And before turning to this one, we need to add a state here at a time called comment, so we know that

44
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,260
if there is no comment, we want to disable the button.

45
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,130
So we just say sit comment.

46
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,130
And we call it to use this stage.

47
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,440
And it's would be empty at the beginning.

48
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,700
Let's import you this state from react.

49
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:54,660
And here now at the bottom button section, we say if there is no comment.

50
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:03,830
Make it disabled and also we want disabled when there is no.

51
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:16,530
When there is no moon summer at its base, just imagine someone put two men in space here and post to

52
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,110
post it, so we prevent this one by just saying comment that.

53
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,570
First would trim it and then we check so.

54
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,080
So now.

55
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,750
That's fine.

56
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,370
It's it's disabled now because there is no comment yet.

57
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,690
And also we are not tracking the comments are still disabled, even after writing something.

58
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,780
So we go to the input section.

59
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,430
Here and in the input.

60
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:05,420
He set the value for us to be equal to the comet, so whatever comment, this would be the value.

61
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,280
And also we want to say if there is a change in the comment section.

62
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,920
So we added on change, we trigger a function and we get the event here.

63
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:28,000
So we can we want to get the information inside the inputs and when we get it, we set the comment.

64
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:39,660
To be equal to events, this event that target death value, so any value inside the inbox will be set

65
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,800
as a sad comment.

66
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,380
So, you know, if you refresh the page.

67
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,720
We go to comment section and we write something.

68
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,230
We see that the button is enabled.

69
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:03,460
But if there's nothing, it's disabled and if we.

70
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:13,550
Just to put this faith is still is disabled, so you cannot post it.

71
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,700
Let's make this one a little bit dimmer when the.

72
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,410
When it's in the disabled mode as well, so we just said disabled.

73
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:39,470
So we changed the text color to blue, but instead of 400, make it 200.

74
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,170
So we can now differentiate between disabled and enable what?

75
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,670
All right.

76
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:58,870
No, we want to add on the bottom, so when someone click on the post when the Post Linda button is

77
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,780
enabled, we want to trigger a function that send the information.

78
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,230
This this comment to the database so we can edit and click here.

79
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:25,890
Which trigger a function call, send comments, and we're going to create this at the top.

80
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,090
So let's go at the top.

81
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:39,840
Here, just after the comments we created after the state that we created here, we create a sync function

82
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:49,680
because we want to wait for the information going to the database, so we made it as a sync function

83
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,380
and we call it send comment.

84
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:00,880
Let's get the event here as well beyond that, because we want to prevent refreshing the pitch when

85
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,380
someone click on the button.

86
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:11,950
So we just say here, event dot prevent default.

87
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:22,240
So this is going to prevent the page to be refreshed when someone click on the button and then.

88
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,740
We're going to create.

89
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:37,060
A constant and we call it comment to send, and we equal this to this comment here.

90
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:45,190
So whatever the comment, if we create a constant and be equal, that one to and after this we cleared

91
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,450
the comment section and we set the comment to be empty.

92
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,550
So when someone click.

93
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,190
Then someone write any comment.

94
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,420
Click on this one.

95
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:14,140
So, uh, the reason is the refresh the page is refresh is the the button here doesn't have the time.

96
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,280
So we create a tie and we set it to be submit.

97
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:27,420
Now if someone comments and press, enter or click on the post, yeah, still refreshing.

98
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,340
So this is the wrong that clicks should be.

99
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,810
This should be a cap in capital.

100
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:45,020
So the envelope should be in a camel case, not only test should work out, that's now be it the patient's

101
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,890
not through fishing.

102
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,250
And yeah.

103
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:58,820
So now we have the information, all the information we get, the comment and the empty the comment

104
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,300
section.

105
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,760
So here.

106
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:14,070
We we we use it a way to get the information from the database and we use at dark as for use before

107
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:20,130
and the dark is coming from the.

108
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,700
Firebase, so we should add it at a top.

109
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:37,200
So we just import at dark, and this is going to be from a Firebase

110
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,570
Forest slash firestorm.

111
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:57,790
And after that, at dark, we just need to add a collection, so because we want to specify the connection.

112
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:07,420
This one is coming for Firebase Forest, Ash Forest or two, then this is going to be from a database

113
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:14,190
as before we did and from the collection post.

114
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,970
And after the post, we specified I'd.

115
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,040
And.

116
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,640
After that, the other collection's name is comments.

117
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,690
So now we created this part.

118
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:42,350
So they think the next thing is just to create the object.

119
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:52,470
And the object is going to have a few things, first is the comment.

120
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,390
And the comment is equal to.

121
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,650
And this comment sent.

122
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:10,420
After that, we have user name, which is coming from sition.

123
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,540
Doth user the death username.

124
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:28,700
Next, we have user image, which is equal to sition that user that image.

125
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,700
And finally, we have the time stamp.

126
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:47,650
The time stamp for time, which is we can get from server time to stem utility, which is coming from

127
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,280
fires based, so we need to import this to.

128
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,650
It should work.

129
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,710
Let's check the imported everything.

130
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,410
We didn't import this tbh.

131
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,040
This is coming from.

132
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,320
Fire Firebase, that.

133
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,010
Yes.

134
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:13,410
So are you going to import it manually here or just import?

135
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,950
And this is coming from.

136
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,170
Here the five is that yes.

137
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,530
Let's try this.

138
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,900
We put the comment.

139
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,880
Just a nice horse.

140
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,300
We've posted we checked the database.

141
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,390
This is the final version we choose the institution for.

142
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,570
So the one, uh, that have a comment.

143
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,390
Mixture, of course, now we have another collection, vicious comments.

144
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,640
It has that idea.

145
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:09,500
And.

146
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,330
The comment was nice costs.

147
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,520
And this is the time stamp user image and username.

148
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,240
So let's try this with another one.

149
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,600
So this one say, uh.

150
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,250
Well, just say whatever.

151
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,600
Just say.

152
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:42,050
Green, I'm very bad at commenting, so let's check the.

153
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,460
Nice, big one, now we have comments.

154
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,540
We stay the comments is grim, yet we we implemented correctly.

155
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,370
And in the next section, we're going to show this.

156
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:08,590
Information from this comment section inside the posts related to that comment, so.

157
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,360
If you look at the final version, you can see that as soon as you write a comment.

158
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,030
So just write a random comment.

159
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:25,370
We see it at the top because this is the newest comment, so it comes at the top.

160
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:26,900
And.

161
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:33,890
The other one goes down, and if you add more, you see that this is a scrollable.

162
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:45,830
And we don't get the height more than this part and the first one comes and at the top.

163
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,420
All right, in the next section, we're going to achieve this.

164
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,640
First, let me put everything and get half.

165
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,490
So we just take it at and create a comment.

166
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,430
Get comments, and the message would be.

167
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,990
Add comment.

168
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,730
To the.

169
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,050
Fire.

170
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,180
Base.

171
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,150
Database.

172
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,760
And we push it to get her.

173
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,860
Let's check and review what we have done.

174
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,690
You just get it here.

175
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,000
So it was very simple.

176
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,410
So.

177
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:56,950
As we did with for the most part, we use at collection as service time stamp.

178
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,760
To create an asynchronous function.

179
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,370
And.

180
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:15,820
We got the information from the input, and we pass it here to the collection with these with this format.

181
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:24,910
And also we added the value and unchanged to the input section and for the button we added the Typekit

182
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,540
you submit and click and disable it.

183
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:37,540
So in the next section, we're going to bring all these comments to the to the associated post.

184
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,370
So see in the next section.
