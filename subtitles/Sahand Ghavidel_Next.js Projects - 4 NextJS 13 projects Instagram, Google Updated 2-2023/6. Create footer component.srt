1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:07,860
All right.

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:14,220
In the last section, we have completed that audio section, in this section, we're going to complete

3
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:16,870
the footer.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,660
Yeah, if you look at the final version of the project, they have just the text here.

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,660
Copyright copyright sign.

6
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,910
This is the No.

7
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,990
This is the year, but it's this is dynamic.

8
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:39,610
For example, someone comes next year is going to see 2023 instead of 2022.

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,620
And this is just minor.

10
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:42,730
That's fine.

11
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,230
So we go back to index that year.

12
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:47,850
Yes.

13
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:57,110
And a button for the future, let's create a component inside a components folder, we just call it

14
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,480
future touch.

15
00:00:58,730 --> 00:00:59,240
Yes.

16
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,060
And we use our C to create a react functional component.

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:06,820
And.

18
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,190
Let's change this thing to footer.

19
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:22,640
And inside the photo, we add a paragraph just saying first.

20
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,590
Copyright.

21
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:34,090
And then for the copy sign, you just need to add impasse send.

22
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,460
Copy and semicolon.

23
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,950
So let's add this photo component inside the.

24
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,220
Index that you use, and we import it here.

25
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:59,350
Just say food can be imported using counter space, we get the author suggestion we imported at the

26
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,770
top.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,840
So we should see it now in our page.

28
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,520
Yeah, you can see it here.

29
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,530
Copyright the copy.

30
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,620
A simple symbol.

31
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,500
And after that, we're going to have a dynamic here.

32
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,810
We can just say 2020 to next year.

33
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,750
We need to update our page.

34
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,450
So instead of doing that, I'm going to teach you how to do it.

35
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,770
Dynamic these two women add a bracket to add JavaScript here.

36
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,860
Or J6 and we just a new date.

37
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:41,860
All right.

38
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:50,550
It's a function, there's a building function for JavaScript date, and then we just get the full year

39
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,520
to get.

40
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,720
Full year.

41
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,600
This is a method to.

42
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,250
So now we are getting the 2020 two, but this is completely dynamic.

43
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,680
This is a big year change and we don't need to update our website.

44
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:16,070
And after that, we just can't see Google or just add my name and I will give it.

45
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,620
So let's bring this copyright just to the bottom and stick it to there.

46
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,370
So how we can do it.

47
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,920
It's pretty simple.

48
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,410
We need to change to the position to be absolute.

49
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,840
For the future, so here at the top, we're just a class name, absolute.

50
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,340
Absolutes.

51
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,550
And we changed the bottom to be zero.

52
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,370
This is going to push us to the bottom of the page.

53
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,040
So let's bring it to the center by just saying left.

54
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,090
50 percent.

55
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:29,210
This is actually bring the age of to this paragraph to this center here in the center, in order to

56
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:42,020
bring this center really into center, you can use Translate Transform X minus 50 percent as we do inside

57
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,890
the CFS.

58
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,670
But until this year, we just need to say translate.

59
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,000
Higgs.

60
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,860
Minus 50 percent.

61
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,720
But inside the brackets.

62
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,380
As you can see, it came exactly in the center now.

63
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,360
And.

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,190
If you Zoom, you see that they come in into two lines.

65
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,330
We can prevent this using white airspace.

66
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:37,600
No rap, so we can just see why this space, no rap for preventing this and we can add some padding

67
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,100
to.

68
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:50,750
Push it a little bit upper, let's remove this resume the chickens and all five, that's fine, and

69
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,440
let's decrease the size of the text to small.

70
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,190
And let's change the color to be gray.

71
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:06,390
So let's just say Tex Gray, and we said it to, for example, of six hundred.

72
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,210
That's that's for it, that's it for the.

73
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:22,800
Uh, food restriction, actually, this is not similar to the future of the Google Real clone, but

74
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:32,130
it was just a waste of time to make our website exactly like Google Twitter because just, uh, if you

75
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:37,290
check the website itself, the search team works not.

76
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:45,560
Is see that the future is just the sum terms of service, privacy and something like that.

77
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,150
So for simplicity, I just kept our website like this.

78
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:58,700
But we're going to work mostly on the functionality and search and also the the routing or something

79
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:04,430
like that that is more important for next year and learning Telmex CCIs and next year.

80
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:11,360
So in the next section, we are going to get the term from the input here.

81
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,920
For example, whatever we write here, we want to get this information and we redirect the page to the

82
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,000
related page.

83
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,480
So we just say, for example, localhost 20.

84
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:30,350
Let's show inside the final version, for example, here, if we search something like, Hello,

85
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,050
this is going to redirect us to.

86
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:45,540
Forward slash search that term is Helo, and the search type is empty, which is the web page and inside

87
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,220
if you click on the image.

88
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:57,380
The Search tab is image, so in the next section, we're going to change this URL here, so we redirect

89
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,450
our page to these pages.

90
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:07,480
So before doing that, let's add this photo to the get help as well and review our code.

91
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:12,120
So we just said get at and we get comments.

92
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,980
And I would just say.

93
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,530
Curious.

94
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,010
Router components.

95
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,470
Components.

96
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:29,300
All right.

97
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,360
And then we push it to get.

98
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:43,040
If you look at our getup and refresh the page, now we have six commits and the last one is here is

99
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,960
saying now we click on it.

100
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,010
We just created a component called Photodex.

101
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,140
And it has only a paragraph.

102
00:08:53,590 --> 00:09:01,060
And we use the date constructor to create to get the full year dynamically.

103
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:11,830
And we just use absolute button zero to stick and stick the footer always at the bottom of the page.

104
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:21,520
And we added the components inside the index, that genius, so in the next section, as I mentioned,

105
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:28,390
we're going to get the data from the input and every right we redirect to page.

106
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,760
To the related page.

107
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,980
So see you in the next section for this.
