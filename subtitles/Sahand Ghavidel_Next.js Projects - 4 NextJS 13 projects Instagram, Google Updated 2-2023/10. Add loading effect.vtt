1
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:03.560
All right.

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.700
In the last section, we have handled the error section.

3
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.300
In this section, we're going to add the loading effect.

4
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:19.730
So next year, 13 actually provides you with the loading capability as well.

5
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.290
It's similar to error.

6
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:29.870
You need to just add a file inside the app directory to handle the loading effect.

7
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.010
So when you come back to Visual Studio Code.

8
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:46.050
If you use contour shift E to open the Explorer section just here, we need to add a file with this

9
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.350
name.

10
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.160
Just loading lowercase that J is X and here.

11
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.140
We can create the loading file.

12
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.220
Which is similar to the error file.

13
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:07.690
We need to create a React functional component and also let's create it first.

14
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.710
We use RFC to create a React functional component.

15
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.080
The name would be loading.

16
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.020
And the.

17
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.900
Now we just say loading.

18
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.990
Dot, dot, dot.

19
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.340
Now.

20
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.580
In our website.

21
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.940
When we, for example, go to the about page.

22
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.440
And we go to trending.

23
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.370
We see a loading at a top very in a very short time.

24
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.220
Or here you see the loading.

25
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:52.760
So next year, 13 actually automatically understand that there is a wait and see system inside your

26
00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:00.080
You are waiting for the result from a page for example the about page or the trending page trending

27
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.890
one and this is going to show this file instead of that section.

28
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.650
Uh, until the result comes.

29
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.020
So this is a great feature of the next year, 13.

30
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.160
So I don't want to just write downloading.

31
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.130
I want to use a loading spinner.

32
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.190
So there is a website.

33
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.650
It's called loading.

34
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.690
I o.

35
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.000
If you search loading.

36
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.300
I.

37
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.510
O.

38
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.590
There is a website called loading dot io and you can just download free spinners.

39
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:52.990
SVG Spinner SVG file is very is in a very low size so it doesn't consume a lot of internet.

40
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.890
So it's going to quickly load for us.

41
00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:06.220
And these two rows are free and if you want to get a more advanced one, you need to pay.

42
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.340
So here we just click on.

43
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.570
For example, I want to use only this one.

44
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.420
You can choose the color.

45
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.950
I want to choose some amber color like this one.

46
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.060
And the.

47
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.630
I want to just choose the radius to be five.

48
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.500
And a stroke with to be.

49
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.660
One.

50
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.960
And let's choose the transparent background.

51
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:46.180
And now you can just click here on the SVG and download it as an animated.

52
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.080
So when you click, it's going to download you.

53
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.930
You need to click on free download and download.

54
00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:01.510
This is going to gives you the file and this file is going to go inside the public folder next to the

55
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.740
Fabricant ICO and we can just change the name of this file to a spinner.

56
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.860
Dot SVG.

57
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.070
Let's close this one.

58
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.840
And now, instead of just loading here, I'm going to.

59
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.820
Use that file.

60
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.790
So I'm just going to delete this loading and add an image tag.

61
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.390
And the source for this one would be a spinner.

62
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.760
Dot SVG because this is inside the public folder.

63
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.860
You don't need to add any address, just the address.

64
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.520
It should be just a spinner that is SVG for the alternative tag.

65
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.130
Alternative text.

66
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.110
We just say loading.

67
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.260
If this image is not loaded, you see loading inside the page.

68
00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:04.370
And let's bring this one to the center by just changing the display to flex.

69
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.520
And we just use just the file content center to bring it to the center.

70
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:19.140
And let's change the size of the spinner to be 96.

71
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.920
So let's test this one in our website now.

72
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.730
So now if we go to the.

73
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.100
About page.

74
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.250
So wait, we should save this one and wait a little bit until this one compiled.

75
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.640
So now if you go to trading, we see a spanner here.

76
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.020
We go to the about we see the spanner in the middle.

77
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.580
We can also use this spanner in somewhere else.

78
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.990
For example, in the final version, I use it for the image as well.

79
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.700
So if you refresh the page.

80
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.890
We should see that some, for example, we search for something.

81
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.850
For example, I just searched for Wolf.

82
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.890
When.

83
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.340
You search.

84
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.530
I think now it's not working.

85
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.060
So I'm going to show you later how to do it.

86
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.420
We're going to use the spinner for the images as well when the image is not loaded.

87
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.000
We're going to see the spinner.

88
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:42.100
So that was it for the adding the loading effect in our website, which is which was very easy.

89
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:52.010
In comparison with the reactor reactor, you have to create a user effect and use the user state, create

90
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.060
a piece of state called loading and add it.

91
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.560
That's a lot of work.

92
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:04.430
But in the next years, 13, all these things is going to be handled simply by just creating a file

93
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.500
called Loading that Gsx.

94
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:21.920
So let's add this one to GitHub by clicking on this plus sign and we just say add loading effects or

95
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:29.600
the message I'm going to commit and push this one to GitHub and let's go to GitHub and we go back to

96
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.840
the commit section and we refresh the page.

97
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.760
Now we have a new commit called add loading effect.

98
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:49.470
Which has this file, this spinner, that SVG in the public folder and we have created a loading the

99
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:58.290
jar file inside the app directory, which is a server side component with just an image tag with the

100
00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:05.100
source of a spinner dot SVG and with the alternative text of loading here.

101
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:11.790
So that was it for the loading section in this next section where you're going to create these cards.

102
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.130
And make these beautiful cards.

103
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:23.020
So instead of just seeing these titles, we are going to create the cards and see all the information,

104
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.180
including the image.

105
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.490
The description, the title.

106
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:34.100
And we get these information like the release date and the number of votes.

107
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:41.050
So see you on the next section for creating the cart components.
