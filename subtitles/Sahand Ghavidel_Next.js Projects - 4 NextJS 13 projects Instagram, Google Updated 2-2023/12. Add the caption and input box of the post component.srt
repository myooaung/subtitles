1
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:13,510
All right, in the last section, we have completed the buttons section in this section, we're going

2
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:19,780
to start with the command and also the input comments section.

3
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:31,720
If I zoom a little bit here and withdraw, the things we need in the comments section is very easy with

4
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,140
just for this input section.

5
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,940
We have three parts.

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,340
First one is the.

7
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:50,160
This icon, the happy icon, then we have the input, which goes all the way to the end.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,600
And finally, we have a button that's just saying post.

9
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:05,750
The button is in the disable mode, but when we write down, it goes to them and working mode.

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:15,700
We're not going to cover in this video about this because later when we are really adding the comment

11
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:26,330
functionality using the database and be connected, we connect our website to Firebase database and

12
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,720
we're going to implement all these features.

13
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,000
But for now, we just make the

14
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,780
user interface.

15
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,560
So let's go back to.

16
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:40,550
Our.

17
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:48,270
Visual studio code, and we keep open the our website on the right side here at the bottom.

18
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:55,520
We will add another section and we call it post comments.

19
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,500
Under this.

20
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:08,900
First, we add a paragraph, and inside this paragraph, we just add.

21
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,090
Spam just adding the user name.

22
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:24,910
So adding the username and the caption, so the user being will be inside a spare.

23
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,660
So we just say spent.

24
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,890
And inside this span, we have her use of.

25
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,570
So we should see something now, first refresh the page.

26
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:55,030
Yeah, we've got the user and after the username, we add the caption.

27
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:58,920
All right.

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,040
So here this is different.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,980
So let's style it a little bit.

30
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:15,460
So in the top class, a top paragraph, you add a class name, which does add some padding.

31
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,650
But just saying P five.

32
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:32,580
And we just in case someone drives too much, we just, uh, truncated.

33
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:42,000
So if the comments is more than one lie, it's going to be truncated like the one we did here.

34
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,370
In fact, you.

35
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,660
So that's it for the paragraph, for the username we want it to be.

36
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,980
So we aren't font pulled.

37
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,660
And we added marching to the right to add some space.

38
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,860
To the right side.

39
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,910
And, uh, for the caption, that's fine.

40
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,120
So that looks OK.

41
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,920
So let's go to the next part, which is the.

42
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,570
Which is the input box.

43
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,100
So we add a comment here with, just say, post.

44
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:28,580
And.

45
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,180
Box.

46
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,170
For the for this part, we need an.

47
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:45,290
This happy icon, so we import another icon from the.

48
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:52,910
Hero icons outline, and with just the name would be emoji.

49
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,310
Happy.

50
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,250
I've come.

51
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,110
And we just had it inside form here, which is first we make a form.

52
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,540
Inside the forum at this emoji icon.

53
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,020
It should be a huge icon now, but we're going to need a salad.

54
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:25,170
So let's just first, we finish the ports and then we have an input.

55
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,440
And the.

56
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,700
The tide would be class, and we have a placeholder for this input.

57
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:46,340
Just saying, for example, into your comment.

58
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,870
And just add some dots.

59
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,070
So we have it here.

60
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,440
And after that, we have a button.

61
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:08,780
Just saying posts, so we just at the bottom and side of the button, we just like post.

62
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,340
All right, now, it's time to style it.

63
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,620
So first, we establish form, we make it flat.

64
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:24,710
Let's first decrease the size of the icon so we can see it clear what we are doing.

65
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,790
Just switch and make it.

66
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,770
They're high seven.

67
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,480
The track here.

68
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:44,290
So by by using Flex, we bring everything next to each other.

69
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,130
Inside the phone.

70
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,430
And then.

71
00:06:52,560 --> 00:07:00,100
These two are next to each other, but before the emoji icon, we're going to use something, uh.

72
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,340
This one should be fine.

73
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,720
Let's mate, make the item center.

74
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:18,330
And then we have that paragraph, sorry, we have a padding of four.

75
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,130
You don't see any change or just refresh the page.

76
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,450
Oh, I'm I'm putting this one into action.

77
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,080
Yeah.

78
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,530
It's silly.

79
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:43,140
Yeah, the class name now, everything next to each other and.

80
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,870
That's fine.

81
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,180
And, Moji, we have here.

82
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,320
Let's style the.

83
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,160
The input section.

84
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,440
So we just had a class name.

85
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,690
And, uh, we just remove the border.

86
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:15,850
We don't in the border for this one as we have the placeholder, then we use the our favorite one Flex

87
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:16,270
one.

88
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,260
That push this post to the right side and has some space.

89
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:29,120
So now we can see that the airport is occupying all this space between two.

90
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,860
Then let's remove it, remove the this blue line as well, so make it more beautiful.

91
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,430
So just say focus ring zero.

92
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,260
All right.

93
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,830
Then let's Dolly Parton make it blue.

94
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,610
So the four blue collar was just ticks blue.

95
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,220
Four hundred.

96
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,350
Then let's make it bold as well.

97
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,960
We just found both.

98
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:17,690
All right.

99
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,730
Looks fine.

100
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:26,310
And we are going to add the disability, disable functionality and later when we're at the.

101
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:36,820
If that database to our websites, so that was it for this part, so everything looks fine.

102
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:45,740
And let's see in the next section, we're going to go to the right side.

103
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:52,220
And first, we're going to make this responsive because now our our web site.

104
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,110
It's covering all the.

105
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,480
Space in the.

106
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:07,860
In the in the page, but you want this to be like a smaller and we have a when we have something at

107
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,510
the right.

108
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:18,850
So now if you've checked the final version first, it's just the one column and we don't see the right

109
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,010
side of the feet section.

110
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:29,860
But after the medium size hits in the we have this one at the right.

111
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:44,920
So let's first, we push everything to get her just to get at and get commenced with the message of.

112
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:52,660
So we did two things to we at the.

113
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,090
Caption.

114
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,790
And in truth.

115
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:09,540
Box of the post components.

116
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:16,660
Let's push it to get up and review the code.

117
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,350
So we just refresh the page.

118
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,530
And we checked the last comment.

119
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,190
You can click here directly to the last one.

120
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:38,480
So then the last one to add the caption and input box of the post component, we added an emoji happy

121
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,170
icon.

122
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:43,550
And in the post comment, we added a paragraph.

123
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:50,620
And inside the paragraph, we had a span that shows the user name and the caption outside the span.

124
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:57,620
In the post section, we added a form that covers an emoji icon.

125
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,080
And input.

126
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,780
And finally, we have the button.

127
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,350
So in the next section, we're going to start first.

128
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,270
Make this fun responsive.

129
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,820
So see in the next section.
