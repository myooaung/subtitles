WEBVTT
1
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:07.740
All right.

2
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:16.420
In the last section we have completed with installing Firebase and also nix off.

3
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.700
We registered on Firebase website, and we got our client I.D. and client secret of Google.

4
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:33.880
And also we got all the configuration data, including API keys and etc from Firebase website.

5
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:45.610
We initialize the Firebase using a trick that prevents us from doing more than one application.

6
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.390
In this section, we're going to create the signing page, so if you look at the final version of the

7
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.710
project here.

8
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.200
And if you sign out using this button or here.

9
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:15.150
We can see that if you click on Sign In, we go to a web page with the you are off sign in and we get

10
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.270
this beautiful signing page, which includes.

11
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.810
An image, a logo and the signing button.

12
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:32.570
And also, if you decrease the size of the page, you can see that in medium size and lower, that image

13
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.980
is hidden.

14
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.030
All right.

15
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.740
So let's go.

16
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.880
Firstly, we need to define the this.

17
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.550
We need to go to.

18
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.200
A mix of decades that we created this one.

19
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.090
And at the end, we need to add the pages.

20
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.880
So here we add a pages.

21
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:10.420
And inside it, curly braces, a set of curly braces was just a sign in page is equal to.

22
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.720
Off.

23
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.050
A slash sign that you need to add a horror slash at the beginning to.

24
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:32.780
So in this tutorial, we want to create the sign in page and just be be careful about that because we

25
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:42.320
created Nick's 30th Insight API off, but this one is inside the page directly.

26
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.460
We create.

27
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.040
We create an off folder instead of inside the API.

28
00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:01.580
And inside this folder, we create and new file called sign-In that Jesus.

29
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.680
So this is completely different from the other one.

30
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.490
The path is different, pages off and sign in here.

31
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.760
We need to create the REAC component.

32
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.290
So we just need to use our FC to create a react functional component.

33
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.170
And.

34
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.800
We just we don't need to import react, but we need to import a few things.

35
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:41.020
The first one is where we need to import get providers.

36
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:51.900
From kids from the next of kids, plural, I dare.

37
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.090
And signing.

38
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.700
These are from next.

39
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.630
Off forward slash react.

40
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:21.090
We're going to use this import to get all the providers that we defined here.

41
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.610
Index of the JSE have one provider, Google provider.

42
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:34.460
But if we have more than one Google more than one provider, we get all of them.

43
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.900
Using this built-in function of the Knicks or.

44
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.770
So here we use a.

45
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.650
Server side rendering method to get the information from the Knicks off.

46
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.860
So here we just try to export.

47
00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:58.570
Async.

48
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.420
Anything function and a function we want to create is get server.

49
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.750
Side props.

50
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:28.650
Make sure to be a camel case, this is actually create inside as the server or any server, we have

51
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.320
lack of diversity.

52
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.590
We are going to deploy.

53
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:39.240
We're going to get the information when this the user click on this and comes to this.

54
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.650
Website.

55
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:50.650
So the the good things and the benefits of this is they are web sites will be very fast because we're

56
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.850
using the servers that are using very high speed computers.

57
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.280
So we just say contacts, we get the context here.

58
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:13.100
And actually, we don't need that context, but we just we import it, and then we just say cost providers,

59
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.690
we could all the providers using a weight.

60
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.460
Because we want to get the provide us and then load the page, so.

61
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:34.060
We use to get providers that we already created, and we are the importer.

62
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.940
And we're going to return.

63
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:49.180
The props, the props there, the returning is providers that function that we created.

64
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:51.400
All right.

65
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.020
So in order to pass this, Prof.

66
00:06:54.030 --> 00:07:02.490
So first, the Salon.com, this is the server the server is running, get the providers and the fastest

67
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:13.260
providers to the props that we have here to the can't function the component.

68
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.440
Functional components, so we get here.

69
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:23.400
The providers, so it's very fast because we are using a very good service.

70
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.540
So this is this method is faster than using use of fix.

71
00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:36.510
So because use effects is going to render inside the browser of the person who is visiting our site.

72
00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:44.370
So let's run the server and we check that are getting something on.

73
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.790
So NPR and around there and we go to our website.

74
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:58.950
And we go to off forward slash sign it.

75
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.400
You just make it fun saying.

76
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.990
Sign in page.

77
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.160
So that is correct, you are getting sign in page.

78
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:33.590
So, no, no, we instead of making the website completely from scratch, we already created the header

79
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.450
before and localhost three thousand.

80
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:43.120
We already have the header so we can use the header component.

81
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.370
We just need to import the health component here.

82
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.140
We just say import.

83
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:51.860
Header.

84
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.580
From.

85
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.880
Because it's two level down, we need to just.

86
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.310
Do.

87
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:07.220
Two times back and we two components and head.

88
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:18.630
All right, so here instead of this there, we just make it empty fragments, and here we just create

89
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.220
the header.

90
00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.880
What happened here?

91
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.790
Yeah, just this first.

92
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.580
And add the hitter here.

93
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.760
Let's reload the page.

94
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:49.900
Yeah, now we're getting the header inside the localhost three thousand or signing.

95
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:58.270
And after this header, we're going to have that image that I I showed you here.

96
00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.380
This image?

97
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:08.290
So we just create a death inside this there.

98
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.570
We had an image tag.

99
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:18.970
And we're going to search for an image for Instagram and Google.

100
00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:27.280
We go to images and we choose the tools to be the image to be transparent.

101
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.890
And the image I'm looking for is this image from the super viral death count that AEW.

102
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.460
So I copy this image.

103
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.970
Address Cookie Image Link.

104
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.520
And we go to a signing page and paste it here.

105
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.250
So just check.

106
00:10:55.610 --> 00:11:03.980
Yeah, we got this image, and after this image, the all would be Instagram.

107
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.390
Hamish?

108
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:12.310
OK.

109
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:17.270
After this image, we have another dear.

110
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:26.660
And inside this, there we have, we are going to look through the.

111
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.890
And we're going to look through all the providers that we're getting from here.

112
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:40.300
So we open a curly braces and we just say objects.

113
00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:56.740
And the object has the values and inside the values you getting the poor white earth and we want to

114
00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:05.170
map through these providers and we get each provider one by one, actually because we only have one

115
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:05.890
provider.

116
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.660
We don't need to map through it.

117
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.710
But just in case later, you want to add more providers.

118
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:16.040
Were you going to make this like this?

119
00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.170
So later you can add Facebook, GitHub and et cetera.

120
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.540
So we just say provider.

121
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.790
And we return.

122
00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:30.270
And they've.

123
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.690
And in scientists there.

124
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.980
We are going to have the image.

125
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.420
That image is just the Instagram image.

126
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.210
Let's search for an image.

127
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:54.810
Uh, in the in the search, we got this.

128
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.970
This image looks fine or.

129
00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:00.360
And others.

130
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.300
Yeah, I think this image is fine from.

131
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.260
So the digital that's come.

132
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:19.440
Yeah, it's it's transparent, too, so we just copy the link and paste it here.

133
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.310
Let's check our website.

134
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.370
Yeah, we're getting the logo as well, it's huge.

135
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.330
We're going to.

136
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.290
Uh.

137
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.910
The style it's so just so let's finish them all first.

138
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:47.210
So after this image, we have a paragraph saying just this is this app.

139
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.640
It's created.

140
00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.610
For learning.

141
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.870
Purposes.

142
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:14.280
The reason I added this one, because maybe an original Instagram counts and see your web site, they're

143
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:21.600
not going to claim about, you're copying their website to this, you're just at this one for educational

144
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:27.510
purposes that is necessary sometimes happens, they claim, and.

145
00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.160
You need to pay a lot of money.

146
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:40.330
So or they just shut down your Web site, so bear that in mind to always protect yourself from these

147
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:40.690
things.

148
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:46.120
And after this paragraph, we need to add a button.

149
00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.490
Inside a button with just a sign in.

150
00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.490
Just a sign in.

151
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:12.890
And then the signing with and the provider name, because we want to add the provider, that's name.

152
00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:15.150
OK.

153
00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:22.390
And also because it's a map, we need to add a key as well.

154
00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:22.950
So.

155
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:36.340
In scientist, if we need to add a key that is unique and we can use the provider that name, it's unique

156
00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.030
tanks because it can be, Google can be.

157
00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:47.490
Any other websites like Facebook, but it's always unique to provide it.

158
00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.460
OK, let's style this.

159
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.860
It's stylist.

160
00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.330
Let's first make it small.

161
00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:03.510
We can see the changes in the styles, so in the top level.

162
00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:05.440
Uh.

163
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:08.840
For this image here.

164
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:21.830
So in this debate that is after the header, we make it flex to bring everything next to each other.

165
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:27.860
And we use Justify Center.

166
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:30.170
And.

167
00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:38.180
To make everything center and use is Space X.

168
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:44.430
Seven to add a space between the and the at the margin top of twenty.

169
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:56.230
All right, for the image, we add a class name, you didn't see any change, but soon we're going to

170
00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:01.630
see because we need to change some other things as well.

171
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.510
So first, in this small

172
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.390
size like mobile size, I want it to be hidden.

173
00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:20.470
And then I want it to be object cover so it doesn't squish like it is that it does not stretch.

174
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.600
And then I want to rotate it a little bit.

175
00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.020
It could take six, which means six degree rotate.

176
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.850
I think if you increase the size, we can see.

177
00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:38.880
Yeah.

178
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:47.960
Still, because it doesn't have any dimension, you can see it.

179
00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.210
So let's add more, thanks to.

180
00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.900
In the medium size and above, we want it to be in line.

181
00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.690
In Inland Flex.

182
00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:12.590
And after medium size and above, we want to wait for it to be 48.

183
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.170
Now, if we increase the size, probably we should see the image.

184
00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:24.590
Let's wait.

185
00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:26.210
Yeah.

186
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.730
Now you can see the image in this side.

187
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:39.450
That's because this image is so big, push it this one to the other side, let's install this one first.

188
00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:45.670
So let's style this Instagram logo, so here.

189
00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:54.560
We just add a class name and they're worth less.

190
00:18:54.670 --> 00:19:02.110
First, the decrease the size, we just see we we decrease the width to be thirty two.

191
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:08.920
Now that's smaller, you can see better.

192
00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:19.060
And let's bring them to the right side, analysts keep continue here and the objects.

193
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:21.660
Cover as well.

194
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:27.550
For the.

195
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:33.100
For the top level, let's uh.

196
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:38.840
I mean, here in the diff above, let's make it.

197
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.920
Flex.

198
00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.230
And we make the flex direction, Colin.

199
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:59.150
And for bringing that, bring him in to the center, we use items set.

200
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.280
Yeah, that's, uh, looks fine.

201
00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:10.450
Let's stall this paragraph.

202
00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:15.010
And this button as well for the for the paragraph.

203
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:19.650
The class here would be.

204
00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:25.310
It's very simple, we just need to at the Texas mall.

205
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.360
And then we make it italic.

206
00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:36.940
And finally, we have the margin y of 10.

207
00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.490
Let me refresh.

208
00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:39.970
I don't know.

209
00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:44.260
Why crashing?

210
00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:50.350
So we made a tally and we at some margin, why at the top and bottom?

211
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.120
And also, let's make the takes center.

212
00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:04.590
All right, after this, we start with a starting off the bottom.

213
00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.640
We want to make it like our final version.

214
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:15.710
To have a background of rent and also with a housing effect.

215
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.870
So let's add the classes.

216
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:26.610
For the background, we just need to arrive, e.g. 400.

217
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:29.060
Read.

218
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.400
And let's make it rounded.

219
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:46.430
And we just want a light around it to be large, which is eight pixels.

220
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.810
Then let's add some padding.

221
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:57.010
So you push it between two and three and we make the text to be white.

222
00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:03.290
So it can be easily visible and.

223
00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:11.840
Yes.

224
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:12.680
Looks fine.

225
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:25.340
And, uh, finally, for the hovering effect, we want that background instead of to be read 400 demanded

226
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:31.550
to be read a little bit more of five hundred.

227
00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:37.990
So now we get more.

228
00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.610
And that's fine, everything's fine.

229
00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:49.050
We just want when we click on this one, we go to the Google sign in patient.

230
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:53.720
I can't stop Google, I show you before.

231
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.600
So in the button, we added on click.

232
00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:10.540
And inside the enclave, we're going to have a function that is going to call this signing from next

233
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:17.260
off, this signing actually automatically opens death off site for us, so we just say sign in.

234
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:28.950
And with the we just need to add the provider ID, we just say sign signing, provided that I.D. because

235
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:33.600
we want to tell them to which provider we want to open.

236
00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.090
Which is Will in our case.

237
00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:45.530
And after we finish with the Google Witch website, we want to come back is here, we just say to call

238
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:45.950
back.

239
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:47.810
You are a.

240
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:51.150
Would be.

241
00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.130
Forward slash.

242
00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:03.300
Now, if you click on signing with Google, we should go to Google.

243
00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:12.050
But the reason we are getting the error because we didn't specify that you are out or we want to use

244
00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:17.880
or sign in here, it's just us that redirect you are.

245
00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:19.210
Is this one?

246
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:25.140
But we haven't actually defined it inside the Google console.

247
00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:34.590
If you remember for adding the client, either client secretly came to cloud that Google and we went

248
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:39.780
to console and we went to credentials and we choose it all off to.

249
00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:48.930
And if you come back, I show you when we can't, we choose the installation for and inside the credentials

250
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.950
we use.

251
00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:51.960
We added this one.

252
00:24:53.470 --> 00:25:02.560
And here we need to add the authorized origin and also the redirect you are that we are direct, you

253
00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.850
are already Google gives us, so we copy this on.

254
00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.510
And we pasted here.

255
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:16.690
Let's first at this time.

256
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:25.310
So, Ed, you must first consider a screen.

257
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.810
So let's click on this button.

258
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:36.380
And, uh, just say.

259
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.510
OK, we just chose this fight and create.

260
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.650
And here.

261
00:25:55.570 --> 00:26:01.030
You know, the app name is in Persian for.

262
00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.320
And the email is my email.

263
00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.510
We don't need any logo.

264
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:13.830
And also, this email will be my.

265
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.430
Check.

266
00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:28.270
So we say this for.

267
00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:32.740
And we go back to credentials.

268
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:44.210
Here we ed now we can add our local hosts so that we need to add the local hosts three to their.

269
00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:51.760
Recovery this fine.

270
00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.040
Because we're using 3000 as the origin.

271
00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:05.530
And then four callbacks we we copied this callback that Google already told us to use.

272
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:12.180
So we save this now.

273
00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:22.540
It should work when we sign it, so we go back to our own website, which is a local three 3000, and

274
00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:23.680
we go to sign in.

275
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.170
We click on signing with Google.

276
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:37.680
And now they say it's it's works, and it's the Google search, which accounts you want to continue

277
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.090
as I just say this one.

278
00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:50.160
And after this, it's going to redirect us to the other callback URL that we gave them, which is the

279
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:50.840
home page.

280
00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:54.330
We didn't get any.

281
00:27:55.390 --> 00:28:01.300
And data yet because we want to show the image here, we get the username.

282
00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.540
These things, we're going to do the next video.

283
00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.410
So we're going to make this fun.

284
00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:15.820
We get decision first, and then based on decision, we're going to show different things on the header

285
00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:22.000
on the mirror for fall and also we're going to add here the image.

286
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:29.740
So see in the next section for getting the session area of before this, he forgets.

287
00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:40.720
We just have everything to get how quickly we just say command and the message would be.

288
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:42.580
Uh.

289
00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.990
Complete this sign.

290
00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.040
And page.

291
00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:56.980
And we push it to.

292
00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:58.880
Get her.

293
00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.210
So let's check our kids, huh?

294
00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:07.780
We go back and refresh the page.

295
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:10.390
Now we're getting a new comment.

296
00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:16.750
And as you can see in the next hour, 30 as we added the page.

297
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:27.330
And here we imported jet providers signing from a of react how we imported the hitter.

298
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:29.100
So we added the hitter here.

299
00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:37.610
And we see an image of Instagram to the left side, and we've looked through the providers here.

300
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:52.100
And here we create a button that when we click on the button, we went inside the Google Sign In page

301
00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:56.160
and also at the end, we created a server side.

302
00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:03.300
Functionality, so we get the providers before the person even see the page.

303
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:08.880
They already got to provide this week, which makes the website faster.

304
00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:18.900
So in the next section, we are going to create the get the session first and also we're going to dynamically

305
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:22.200
change this header and the other sections.

306
00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.330
So see in the next section.
