00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.510
All right.

2
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:19.800
In the last section, we have added the ability to send our comment to the fire store.

3
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.590
And also we cut the number of likes here.

4
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.410
And also we have redirected the person to the post particular page.

5
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.090
Let's test it again, for example, here and another post, for example.

6
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.980
Another comment I just say amazing and we print press on reply.

7
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.110
So we're going to be redirected to a page called posts for a slash to post ID.

8
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.570
So let's create this page.

9
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.530
And so we won't get any for or for error.

10
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.060
So we go back to Visual Studio code and inside pages.

11
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.630
And sorry pages.

12
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.630
And we create a folder and we call it posts.

13
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.650
And inside the post we're going to create a file called an IED.

14
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.380
But inside a bracket, the reason we're doing we're doing that this is a convention for next year.

15
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:33.890
So it means that we have a parameter inside the page called ID and we can later get the parameter from

16
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.430
the URL using the rather user outer of the next.

17
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.910
Yes.

18
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.830
So let's do it now.

19
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.880
So we have created the page and just make our C to create a react functional component.

20
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.590
And here we just changed this font to post.

21
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.620
Or we can call it post page, whatever.

22
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.250
So we have here the let's.

23
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.490
Now check our browser.

24
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.680
Now we can see that.

25
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.520
Let's refresh the page.

26
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.020
Now we can see that we are inside this one.

27
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.370
We are getting post.

28
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.210
Also we can get this post idea as well.

29
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.520
So there is a way to do it.

30
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.920
It's very simple.

31
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.620
We just need we don't need to react anymore.

32
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.780
We just need to import use the router.

33
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.400
From.

34
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.660
Next forward slash router.

35
00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.120
Then we are going to initialize router here.

36
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.830
Just the const router.

37
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.980
It calls to use throughout.

38
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.240
Then.

39
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:31.830
Now we can get the idea just from a we can structure this and we can get around to that query.

40
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:43.280
So we only have one query here in our page, and this is just the I.D. So we're getting it here and

41
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.680
we can just show it here as well.

42
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.440
We just see it.

43
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.990
So if you check now, refresh the page.

44
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.990
Uh.

45
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.460
Let's see now.

46
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.170
We stopped the server, so we started again.

47
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.760
So now we are getting the idea.

48
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.690
Let's try it in another post.

49
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:20.670
So we go back to the home page and we put the comment inside another post and we will see that if you're

50
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.980
getting do I get it?

51
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.690
Not for example, we post we put the comment here, we just say Nice the reply.

52
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:41.070
Now we are getting that post I.D. so we can use this post I.D. to get the information from the Post

53
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.720
and show it inside this page.

54
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.100
This page is completely similar to the.

55
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.170
Actually index.

56
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.980
Dexter Yes.

57
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.280
But the only difference was just showing this post not to all the posts.

58
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.650
So inside the index, that's the homepage.

59
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:10.180
So we have the sidebar, we have the widgets here, and also we have all the ports.

60
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:19.390
So the and the other page for the Post, it has just that post.

61
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.640
For example, we only have this post.

62
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.530
So we get rid of all the other post.

63
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.100
So we just have one post and also we don't need this inputs.

64
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.080
So it get rid of that one too.

65
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:42.940
And the other things we can do is just change this hall and we add a button.

66
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:49.420
So when we click on the button, we just go to the homepage.

67
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.500
That's it.

68
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:58.080
So, uh, we can easily copy the index that.

69
00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.790
Yes.

70
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.810
And just change it a little bit and make the the idea that.

71
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.350
Yes.

72
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.870
Okay.

73
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.020
So let's do that.

74
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.840
Let's go back to index searches.

75
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.350
And we.

76
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.160
A copy everything using contour a choose everything contrasty.

77
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.270
And then we come back here and we paste it here.

78
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.820
So let's change everything.

79
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.810
We change the name of this to post firstly.

80
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.280
The title would be The Post.

81
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:38.230
Uh.

82
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.620
That particular post name.

83
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:52.460
We haven't get the information off the post yet, but so we can use user for later to get it.

84
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:58.250
But just for now, I just say post page.

85
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.100
Then we have this sidebar.

86
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.090
That is fine.

87
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.870
We keep it.

88
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.400
We or we can adjust the feed section.

89
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.730
I get rid of the feed section because we have complete we have to completely change the feed section.

90
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.400
We just need to post we don't need to all the posts.

91
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:24.190
So I delete the feed section we, we deleted from here as well.

92
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.240
Yeah.

93
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:30.140
Okay.

94
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.820
Let's see what we have here.

95
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.820
Uh.

96
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.980
Let's refresh the page.

97
00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.500
Okay.

98
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.650
What's the error comment?

99
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:53.330
So we have to change the address address of these things before next years was here.

100
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:59.880
But ideology is inside a folder so we have to go another folder and down.

101
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.070
So we add another folder.

102
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.470
Going back.

103
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:05.600
Back.

104
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.550
So we should get rid of that there now.

105
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.180
Now we go to the page, for example.

106
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.670
We just add a comment here.

107
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:18.880
In reply.

108
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.490
Are going to be redirected to this page.

109
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.880
So it looks.

110
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:27.000
Uh.

111
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:27.610
Yeah.

112
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.800
Looks different.

113
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.690
So let's see what we have.

114
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.330
And because we completely remove the fifth section.

115
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.480
So that section came here at the beginning.

116
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:43.840
So.

117
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:52.760
Let's replace the feed section now with the one post.

118
00:08:54.070 --> 00:09:05.500
So we just go to Component Hostess and we just add the one post here just to post.

119
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:07.710
Okay.

120
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:10.900
The imported.

121
00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.330
We can put it like this.

122
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:23.260
So this is going to be posts.

123
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.030
Okay.

124
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.260
We should get some air now.

125
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.020
I'll be here to complete this yet.

126
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:38.390
Okay.

127
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.990
Post.

128
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.290
We need to send the post data and I'd.

129
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.420
Let's instead of doing this pause.

130
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:50.320
Sorry about that.

131
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.560
I delete this one hour just from the feed.

132
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.660
That's, uh.

133
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.020
Geez, I just get that, uh, this.

134
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.100
I just get everything.

135
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.860
And then we deleted unnecessary parts.

136
00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.940
So we go here inside the fit.

137
00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.150
I delete this and, uh.

138
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.320
Instead of home.

139
00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:15.520
Uh.

140
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:24.300
So we're just just captive for this one with the latest icon.

141
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.940
We don't need input.

142
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.430
We don't need any animation.

143
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.940
So I remove all of them.

144
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.640
And we just want.

145
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:42.810
And you just get rid of the post section for now.

146
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.440
And then let's check what we have now.

147
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.450
It's to refresh the page because I already deleted this.

148
00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.020
That's fine.

149
00:10:55.230 --> 00:11:02.040
So now it's looks okay when we added the feed section, but it's empty.

150
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.920
There'll be going to fill this one with one post.

151
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:14.460
So first let's complete this section to add the back icon and fix it.

152
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.380
The icon I want to add is it's called.

153
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.490
Arrow.

154
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.000
Arrow left the icon.

155
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.950
So after the.

156
00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.180
Just change this home to treat.

157
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.020
Okay.

158
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.710
And, uh, that's fine.

159
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.450
Just above this.

160
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:42.540
It's too.

161
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.220
It's at another deer.

162
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:51.490
And inside the deer, we we just import the arrow.

163
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:53.420
Left.

164
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:54.470
I can't.

165
00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.540
So we're getting this suggestion here.

166
00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.340
So we ought to import it.

167
00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.280
Let's check the browser.

168
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.920
We cannot see a we just give it height and width.

169
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:11.990
Just say hi.

170
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.290
A five.

171
00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:17.270
Now we can see it.

172
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:26.970
But I just wanted to add the hover effect to just say hover effect.

173
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.720
The class that we have created before.

174
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:36.670
I see it now or we just add this one to here.

175
00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.760
And now we can see it.

176
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.450
Very nice.

177
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:43.130
And then.

178
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.450
Uh.

179
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.690
The other things I want to do is just, uh.

180
00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.580
I want this tweet to be there in the line of this.

181
00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.060
So.

182
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.970
Here we can add item center.

183
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:09.800
Okay.

184
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.360
And let's add some space between them.

185
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.420
So here we can just say space.

186
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.180
X, for example.

187
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:23.700
Two.

188
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:26.530
Okay.

189
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:28.980
So that's fine for this one.

190
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:30.940
Let's create the.

191
00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.960
Let's when we click on this one, I want to come back to the homepage.

192
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:40.130
So we need to add a router here.

193
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:44.270
So we need to import first.

194
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.640
Use the outer.

195
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:57.500
From next forest slash router.

196
00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:01.160
We just need to initialize it here.

197
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:08.210
We just say contest router and use router.

198
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.380
It's we should call it.

199
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:17.840
And here we just add on click on this folder.

200
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:27.720
Just say on click and this and click is going to just.

201
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.550
Say router.

202
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:32.480
Dot.

203
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.210
Push because we want to push it to the homepage.

204
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:37.830
Okay.

205
00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:39.280
I.

206
00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.300
So no click.

207
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.190
Here we go.

208
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.770
But we should go back to the home page.

209
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:54.220
Uh, let's add another comment or example here.

210
00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:56.890
Just say nice bird.

211
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:02.510
Okay.

212
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.210
We came to that pitch.

213
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:11.660
Now we want to see exactly that page that we have clicked and we want we know that's followed by just

214
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.830
checking the URL.

215
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.500
So which post we want to show.

216
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.590
So we just need to go to post that.

217
00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:28.070
Yes, we want to bring the post not just here, but we need to pass some props to that.

218
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.800
Okay.

219
00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.430
Poster Jesus gifts the props like this.

220
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.750
Uh, here.

221
00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.530
I think you're at the top.

222
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:43.970
We are getting to post data like this.

223
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:48.770
So we need to put past the post data and the.

224
00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:51.680
Here.

225
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.430
The idea of the post was inside this.

226
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.920
But we cannot do it for there.

227
00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.010
We need to pass the idea separately.

228
00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:08.090
So we need to modify this component in a way that gets the I.D. separately.

229
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:09.920
Okay.

230
00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:16.910
So we.

231
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.660
We just need to.

232
00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.620
Inside the I.D..

233
00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:24.150
Uh.

234
00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:31.440
So here, just, uh.

235
00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:37.670
Uh.

236
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:44.850
We need to just before the budgets.

237
00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.650
Or inside this fit, actually inside this fear.

238
00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.490
After this year, we can add the.

239
00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:58.590
Host.

240
00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.210
We need to import it.

241
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.040
So we need to copy this.

242
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:09.010
Okay.

243
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.220
We need to pass some data to it.

244
00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:15.100
We need to pass the.

245
00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.390
The idea.

246
00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.810
And also we need to pass the.

247
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.160
Just post itself.

248
00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:37.870
So the ideas coming from this user after we can get it.

249
00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.990
So here we just can't say.

250
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.520
I.D. is equal to router.

251
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.430
Dot.

252
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:50.550
Query.

253
00:17:54.570 --> 00:18:01.590
So after this view, we need to use, use and use effects to get.

254
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.750
So we create a function here.

255
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.950
Uh, let me fix this.

256
00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.290
With this just.

257
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.470
And we have a dependency.

258
00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:32.020
The dependencies, just the DP and IDI.

259
00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.310
And here we can directly.

260
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.940
Return on a snapshot.

261
00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.290
So we want to get one post.

262
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:56.740
So on snapshot from fire store, then, uh, this is going to get a document.

263
00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.780
And the document is from D.b.

264
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:08.080
The name of the collection Shanice posts.

265
00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:16.690
Then we go inside the document and we just want to get the document with the ID.

266
00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:21.130
This idea that it's coming from the outer.

267
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.740
Okay.

268
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:29.930
No, we want to save this one to a state called Post.

269
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:35.960
So here we can create a user state.

270
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:40.490
Now we call it post, set post.

271
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.270
And this is going to be equal.

272
00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:46.990
To use.

273
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:49.640
As states.

274
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.120
Just.

275
00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:00.580
Okay.

276
00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.900
And the initial value is just an null.

277
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.680
Or we can just keep it empty.

278
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:17.370
Okay, uh, now we can.

279
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:22.320
After a snapshot, get on a snapshot, we get a snap shot.

280
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.330
Uh.

281
00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:32.890
Just, uh, after this I.D., we get this snapshot and.

282
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:38.520
This is going to set post.

283
00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:40.390
To.

284
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.800
Snapshots.

285
00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:51.530
Remember when we using the document we now need to add the docs gets.

286
00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:53.450
We are already inside the document.

287
00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:55.400
So.

288
00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:02.610
No, we we are setting there post in equal to a snapshot.

289
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.470
Now we can pass the post.

290
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.690
Inside here.

291
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.710
So the.

292
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:16.240
The idea is the idea and the post is equal to post.

293
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:26.510
But remember I said, because this poster Jesus is just getting the post.

294
00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:35.140
Uh, here, you're just getting to post, not the I.D., so we're going to get an error because this

295
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:43.600
post that it is different from the death one because we are sending it before from feta cheese and feta

296
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.450
cheese just passing the post.

297
00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.470
And, uh.

298
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.910
We were not passing the IED before.

299
00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.070
No, we can add this one here.

300
00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:06.920
We'll just say it is equal to post that I.D. So we have the I.D. pass the I.D. here.

301
00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:12.700
And then inside posts such as.

302
00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.370
We get that idea and also we are getting that idea.

303
00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:23.200
And then instead of just inside here, we just say post I.D., we just say ID.

304
00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.380
So anyway, we have posted it.

305
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:27.880
Just the name remove the post.

306
00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.320
You just get the idea.

307
00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.270
Okay.

308
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.420
Here is fine.

309
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:39.010
Here and here.

310
00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.380
This on.

311
00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:50.060
This is same as before, but we're just changing the name.

312
00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:52.730
I think that is fine.

313
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:54.140
Now, here.

314
00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:56.960
That society.

315
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:01.150
Mm.

316
00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:04.340
That's a different idea.

317
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.890
This is a user I.D., so it's.

318
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.330
It's inside that data.

319
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:11.550
Okay.

320
00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:12.030
Now.

321
00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:15.440
Let's just start the server.

322
00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:21.250
And, uh, they open it inside a browser.

323
00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:26.920
See if they get the error.

324
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.610
We can fix it.

325
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:28.840
Just search first.

326
00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.830
We checked that.

327
00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.020
What sort of error we get.

328
00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.250
We can fix it.

329
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:38.930
So it's still initializing and know.

330
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.400
It's going to work.

331
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:43.180
Just wait.

332
00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:45.620
Jack.

333
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:50.240
Okay.

334
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.480
Now, this is the homepage.

335
00:23:55.010 --> 00:24:00.620
So it should work because now post this and post that Jesus is different but still working.

336
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.790
So that's good news.

337
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:10.040
And we need to sign in first to be able to add a comment.

338
00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:20.310
So for example, here I add a comment or just say hello world.

339
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:27.830
And we press reply, we're going to redirect to the new page.

340
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:29.160
So we are getting on air.

341
00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.740
So let's just see.

342
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:35.520
A post is already.

343
00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.540
It may be created post two times.

344
00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.780
Let's see where this, uh.

345
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:45.200
Inside that?

346
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.830
Yes.

347
00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.980
So I created the post two times.

348
00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.080
Uh.

349
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:04.870
Yeah.

350
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:05.830
Okay, fine.

351
00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.030
Yes.

352
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.090
Okay, I.

353
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.120
Additional order.

354
00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:30.470
Yeah.

355
00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:31.600
Probably this.

356
00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:38.730
Yeah, we already made the component with the name post, so we changed this font to post page.

357
00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.710
So let's check.

358
00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.430
Now we refresh the page.

359
00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.720
Now we're getting another error.

360
00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:00.230
So we imported post, but they said the module is not fond.

361
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:06.340
Okay.

362
00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.390
Let's check.

363
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:17.840
So we imported posts from components posts.

364
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.020
Uh.

365
00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.060
That's fresh.

366
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.060
Let's come back and try it again.

367
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.400
Let's start, etc. I think some problem here.

368
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.220
It shouldn't get ever inside the homepage, actually.

369
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:08.480
Okay.

370
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.210
Let's try it again.

371
00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:12.680
Here, try.

372
00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:14.210
Just a nice.

373
00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:17.940
Yeah.

374
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:19.490
We're getting the same error.

375
00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.570
Let me pause the video and check my cellphone to let you know.

376
00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.750
Yeah, that death was actually an error.

377
00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:29.360
Oh, I thought this is a post.

378
00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.760
Yeah, the error is line eight.

379
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.200
I don't know why it's imported from this vertical.

380
00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.330
The location should be from React.

381
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:40.700
So I did that.

382
00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.880
Yes, it was effect.

383
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:44.570
It's coming from React.

384
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:46.700
Okay.

385
00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.800
There was a weird error.

386
00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:54.520
Let's see the next one uses.

387
00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.630
This is not defined.

388
00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.090
We just import uses state to.

389
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:04.710
Okay.

390
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:05.760
Let's see.

391
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:10.260
DB is not the five.

392
00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:12.870
So let's import everything dark.

393
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:17.220
The imported TB is from here.

394
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.800
Okay.

395
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:21.900
Let's see.

396
00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.440
That's a period, Sarah.

397
00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:28.990
Okay.

398
00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:36.350
Now we got the error inside post that just now sometimes happens because we didn't protect ourselves.

399
00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:44.980
Sometimes this component renders before the other components, so it still the post is not initialized.

400
00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:47.500
So we need to protect ourself.

401
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.700
You just go to post that.

402
00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:49.210
Yes.

403
00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:52.450
And just.

404
00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.390
Like this, we add a question mark.

405
00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:00.240
Everywhere we have post.

406
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:07.320
Hmm.

407
00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.880
So when the post is not defined.

408
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:13.930
We don't get any error.

409
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.040
So that is fine.

410
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:19.620
So let's check.

411
00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.530
Let's refresh the page.

412
00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:24.740
Okay.

413
00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.650
We are getting it.

414
00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:27.200
Got it.

415
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:29.150
That is correct.

416
00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:31.250
Finally.

417
00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:34.680
Okay.

418
00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:41.400
Now, in the homepage we tried with this post, for example, the bird just said, Wow.

419
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:44.710
Reply.

420
00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.160
We should go to the page now.

421
00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.710
We have the post here.

422
00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:52.020
Uh.

423
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:57.550
Let's try this like functionality that's still working.

424
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:05.140
Let's see, we can still put a comment or just say something else like amazing.

425
00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:15.870
Yeah we have three comets are still we are redirecting and we redirected to a weird page so we should

426
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:17.100
fix this one.

427
00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:20.930
Uh.

428
00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.030
Why is it two times posts?

429
00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:26.570
So we just going to post that?

430
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:27.410
Yes.

431
00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.510
When we press on the chat icon.

432
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:36.050
And that was.

433
00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.510
Now it should be in the model.

434
00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.510
Uh, comment model.

435
00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:44.600
And.

436
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:50.980
Now if he forgot to add a forest at the beginning.

437
00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:54.400
So each time he's adding that at the end.

438
00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:58.340
So let's try it again.

439
00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:00.680
So we come back to Homepage.

440
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.800
And now we go to.

441
00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:12.590
A post like this by just putting a comment, a random comment.

442
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:16.280
So we're going to there and now we just put another comment.

443
00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.700
Should a stay in this same patient?

444
00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:21.080
Yes, same page.

445
00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.870
But we have four comments.

446
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:26.690
We add another one should be five and we can like it as far.

447
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:30.040
And the other problem is you.

448
00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:31.190
Yeah.

449
00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:35.670
Let's go inside the post with this user.

450
00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:37.940
I want to see that we can delete it or not.

451
00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.110
So, uh.

452
00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.060
For example.

453
00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:45.170
This one.

454
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.410
I just write something here and then go inside that one.

455
00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.800
Oh, yeah, we can delete it.

456
00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:52.770
We have the icon.

457
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.000
Let's try to delete it.

458
00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.670
Just say yes.

459
00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.770
Okay, now we're getting an error.

460
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:02.060
So when we delete, we want to

461
00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.610
redirect the person back to the homepage.

462
00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.310
Okay.

463
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:11.570
Let's go to.

464
00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:17.230
When we deleted its inside poster and.

465
00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:20.380
Uh.

466
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:25.410
So we set post I.D..

467
00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.110
We open it?

468
00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:31.250
And that is a chat.

469
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:31.970
I'm sorry.

470
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:32.800
In the trash.

471
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:35.190
I can't we going to delete post.

472
00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.640
So let's go to this function.

473
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:48.070
So this is going to delete the posts, but we want to redirect the person after that.

474
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:51.680
After confirmation to the homepage.

475
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.210
So here we just, uh.

476
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:59.140
Let's see, we have the router or not.

477
00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:03.540
So we don't have a router here.

478
00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.780
Just to be in import

479
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:14.890
use the outer.

480
00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:24.530
This is coming from next router.

481
00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:27.280
Then we need to initialize it.

482
00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:32.650
Just a router is equal to use router.

483
00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.890
Then after deleting.

484
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:41.180
Here.

485
00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.540
After deleting the post.

486
00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.060
And then.

487
00:33:50.440 --> 00:34:00.310
We're going to redirect the person using round two to push and push the person to the homepage.

488
00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.390
Okay, let's try it again.

489
00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:05.680
We go to homepage.

490
00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:10.250
Yeah.

491
00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:18.350
Actually the post was deleted, but we didn't redirect it, so we don't have any posts with this person

492
00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.480
so we could make a post here.

493
00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.430
Just say hello.

494
00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:27.950
We go to the Post page by just putting a comment.

495
00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.640
Then inside here.

496
00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.110
Let's try deleting it.

497
00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.110
So he went to the homepage, but still.

498
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:38.920
Am.

499
00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:42.770
Because we don't have that data.

500
00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:43.890
It's deleted.

501
00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.730
In post that genius.

502
00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:52.430
We are getting an error, so we need to just protect this data as well.

503
00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:54.160
So we go to posteriors.

504
00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:56.410
Uh.

505
00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:02.910
Look after the data, we add a question mark to.

506
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:15.150
Instead of this, we could just see if the post exist and then do these things that it was possible

507
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:15.430
to.

508
00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:17.430
But we already done it this way.

509
00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:22.800
It's very hard to change, so we just need to add the question marks.

510
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.550
Okay.

511
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.340
That should be fine.

512
00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:32.740
Let's try it again.

513
00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:43.780
Let's create a comment post and a comment.

514
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.150
And then inside the post deleted.

515
00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:50.450
Okay.

516
00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:54.800
We came back to the homepage now.

517
00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:58.030
So that's working.

518
00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:05.590
So in the next section, I want to get the comments.

519
00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:16.730
Firstly using use effect and also I want to add added one by one here and on top of each other using

520
00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.380
a map method.

521
00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:26.990
And also we want to create a component called comment that yes, and we create a separate components

522
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:28.010
for each comment.

523
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:34.100
And also later we re going to add the like and comment functionality for the comments as well.

524
00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:38.570
So let's add this one to the top.

525
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.790
We just take it at all people.

526
00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:47.820
We create a message and the message would be

527
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:51.390
create.

528
00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:56.330
Posts page.

529
00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.670
That should be fine.

530
00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:05.550
First page and we push it to get up.

531
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.450
So let's see.

532
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:13.860
We refresh the page to see the last comment.

533
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:16.700
The last one is create post page.

534
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:25.680
So inside the comments model that yes, we fixed this one by adding a forest slash here.

535
00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:28.650
Inside the fetus.

536
00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:30.370
We added the idea as well.

537
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:39.260
We passed the idea separately before we were adding it inside a post, but in order to don't get the

538
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:41.640
error, we just did it like this.

539
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:50.540
Then inside the post that year we got the idea that we're passing from feed and also from the idea that

540
00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:51.320
genius.

541
00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.380
And we updated all of them.

542
00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.800
We deleted the post.

543
00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:58.190
I just got the idea.

544
00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:00.710
So that was for the post that.

545
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:01.340
Yes.

546
00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:07.190
And also we added question mark after posts and data to not get an error.

547
00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:10.030
And, uh, that's.

548
00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:11.710
That was it for the poster?

549
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:12.520
Just for.

550
00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.630
I need a chance.

551
00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:19.530
We copied the index tags completely and brought it here.

552
00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:27.730
But we we change it a little bit and we, we added a use effect here to get the post.

553
00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:30.340
We got the idea using the router.

554
00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:35.300
Then everything was similar except for the feed section.

555
00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:44.240
We added the arrow left icon which goes to the homepage and we added the post component here.

556
00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:46.450
Everything was similar.

557
00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:50.940
That was very easy actually, but we got a lot of error.

558
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:57.910
So yeah, but it's actually it's good to for you to know all the errors.

559
00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.820
So later maybe you get the similar error.

560
00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:01.210
Error.

561
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:02.470
Okay.

562
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:08.380
In the next section, we're going to get the comments from the database and we're going to show them

563
00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:12.640
inside the eye ID that and page.

564
00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:14.470
So see in the next section.
