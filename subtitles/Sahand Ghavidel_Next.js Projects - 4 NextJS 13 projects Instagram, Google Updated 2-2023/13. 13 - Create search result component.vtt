WEBVTT
1
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:07.840
All right.

2
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.050
In the last section, we have handled the errors related to our web searching.

3
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:20.110
And in the net in this section, we're going to complete the Web results.

4
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.040
So now we are getting an error saying no result find.

5
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:33.490
But if you search something that is okay, for example, the word hello, we get the results, but we

6
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.010
are just getting the title of the page.

7
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.920
We want to get the results like the one in the final version.

8
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.160
Very neat and clean.

9
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.470
First thing first, we want to get the the number of results here, the how many results we get the

10
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.490
second.

11
00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:01.990
And then we're going to get each item separately using a map loop and we're going to style them using

12
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.430
table CSS.

13
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.370
So one of the.

14
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.910
Let's go back to Visual City code.

15
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.220
First.

16
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:21.350
I want to get these kind of results, like about numbers, the these kind of URLs, title description,

17
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.670
these things, and then we're going to style it using Taylor CSS.

18
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.450
So first thing first, we need to create another component for this result section.

19
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.210
So I'm going to open the Explorer section.

20
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.540
Let's create a component called, for example, Web.

21
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.880
Search.

22
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.520
Results.

23
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.580
36.

24
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.620
So we create this sound.

25
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.090
We just use RFC to create a React functional component.

26
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.700
And then we're going to add this one.

27
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.480
Inside the.

28
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.950
Web page such as x, this page.

29
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.820
And instead of just mapping it here, I'm going to pass the data as a props to that component.

30
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.900
And then we're going to use that data inside here.

31
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.960
So I'm not going to do anything here.

32
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.380
So I'm going to first delete this.

33
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.230
Map here and the H one tag.

34
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.030
So here we just the.

35
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.500
We just say, Well.

36
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.460
Search.

37
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.560
The result.

38
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.930
It's coming from the components folder.

39
00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.850
We're going to import it as well.

40
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.680
Now we need to just pass the data.

41
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.260
We can just pass the results.

42
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.980
But I want to pass the data because I have I need some information about the number of pages, the time

43
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.660
and etc., which is existed in this data.

44
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.720
So I'm going to copy this data.

45
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.890
Come here.

46
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.400
I'm going to pass it with the name results.

47
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.200
So we're going to pass this data.

48
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:42.730
Now we can just go to Web search results and get that data here as a props.

49
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.790
So we just get it results with the structure it and put it here.

50
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.460
Now we can just use it inside our this page.

51
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:08.710
So instead of just writing down the search result, I'm going to change this one to a div, just an

52
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.460
empty day.

53
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.590
We're going to put a paragraph inside the paragraph.

54
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.930
We're going to just say about.

55
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:27.160
And then here we just as you get the information, the suggestion from GitHub copilot.

56
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.680
We want to get the results.

57
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:38.840
That information, the search information dot format, the total result is just say results and then

58
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.410
we get this results that search information and then that formatted search time.

59
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.110
And then we just say seconds, but we need to just protect this one tool.

60
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.300
Sometimes the result is not existed.

61
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.910
So I'm going to add some question mark here.

62
00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.510
This is similar to you.

63
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:06.860
Just say if there is if, for example, like here, we just say if the result is true or existed and

64
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.790
then do this one.

65
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.960
So instead of that, you can just add a question mark here, which means the same things if existed

66
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.400
and then show it.

67
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.680
So for this one, we can do it as well.

68
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.380
So we get a protection.

69
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.930
We don't get an error if the results.

70
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.770
Is not existed.

71
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.040
So let's see what we can see.

72
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.840
Here is refresh the page.

73
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:44.170
So, okay, now we are getting about 4 million results and 0.20 7 seconds.

74
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.830
We got the results like this after that.

75
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.310
So we can style this one first and then we keep continue doing.

76
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.660
So I'm going to just add some class name here.

77
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.350
We just changed the text to be GRE 600.

78
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.890
We changed the text to be a small and finally we did.

79
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:20.770
I want to add some margin at a bottom of five and margin at a top of three.

80
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:29.410
So this is going to style this font like this a smaller but I want them to be here in the larger screen.

81
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.920
But in the mobile screen, I want it to be different.

82
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:40.660
So I'm going to add some style at the top div, which is going to cover both of these results and the

83
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.380
other results.

84
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.010
So I'm going to just style them like that.

85
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.850
So I want to just first say the width to be full 100%.

86
00:06:52.240 --> 00:07:00.970
I bring them everything to the center using Amex Auto in the mobile screen mix of the sorry, not a

87
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.990
max auto.

88
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:08.080
This is going to bring them in the center when you use Flex.

89
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.900
Uh,

90
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.990
when you have a max width, this is going to work.

91
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.580
But for now, you don't see it.

92
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:31.790
So now we have a padding in the x axis of three and also padding at the bottom of 24.

93
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:41.700
The reason I have added this padding bottom 24 is for this footer, because the footer has 25 more.

94
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.340
Less than 24.

95
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:44.700
Here.

96
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:51.960
So we we're going to prevent everything to go under this footer because the footer position is absolute.

97
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.170
This is going to be on top of everything else.

98
00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:02.180
So now we want to style it after the small size.

99
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.930
I want to add some padding in the left.

100
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:07.370
Of.

101
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.570
5%.

102
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.790
In the medium size.

103
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:24.720
I want to have some padding in the left of 14%.

104
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:37.590
And finally, for the large, we have a padding of 52, which is exactly like this two buttons.

105
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:49.350
So if we refresh the page, we see that it's just here next to this tab in this smaller screen.

106
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.420
This is the medium size we have.

107
00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.900
As you can see, we have different space.

108
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.750
Now we have this much.

109
00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.810
In a medium size.

110
00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:03.890
We have this much in the mobile size, they are more connected.

111
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.970
Okay, so in the mobile size.

112
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:17.850
We just have some padding in the excess excess of three in the small size and above we have 5%, which

113
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.080
is around here.

114
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:27.090
After the medium size we have here and then in the large and above, we just set it to be here.

115
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.670
So that is enough for a styling here.

116
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:39.510
And then we're going to keep continue make the map results.

117
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.360
So we're going to show the other result.

118
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:47.970
So after this paragraph, we're going to create that map loop.

119
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:57.090
We're going to say if the result that items that map we want to get each result, if you remember inside

120
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.750
the results, we have items which includes all the information.

121
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.560
Now inside this one.

122
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.340
So let me.

123
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.210
We're going to have a div.

124
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.490
So let's.

125
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.440
We're going to have a div and this div.

126
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:29.850
We need to have a key first because when you use map, you need to add the key and the key is going

127
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.040
to be a unique things.

128
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:38.610
And because the most unique things that we have here in the result is the.

129
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:45.710
For example, result that title you can use or you can use the result that.

130
00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:54.580
For example link anything can like this can be unique and then.

131
00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.570
Inside this step.

132
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.050
We're going to have another dip.

133
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.790
Then we have to link tech.

134
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:15.770
So I'm going to bring the link tag from next.

135
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.310
This is coming from next forward slash link.

136
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:30.670
So the first link tag is going to have a h ref.

137
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.050
Going to result that link.

138
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.810
And inside this, we're going to see the result.

139
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.980
That, uh, formatted your app.

140
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.520
So the URL should be capital

141
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:13.370
formatted.

142
00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.800
Let's see what we are getting here.

143
00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.160
Let's refresh the page.

144
00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:20.950
We are getting an error.

145
00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.930
I think I put some extra.

146
00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:26.560
Okay.

147
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:28.760
This here.

148
00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.460
We missed the parentheses.

149
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:33.890
Sorry.

150
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.850
Let's see.

151
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:41.480
This one is for this one this far.

152
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.720
Like we missed the parenthesis.

153
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.260
Another parenthesis we need.

154
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.120
Okay, so now let's see.

155
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:59.050
Okay, Now we are getting the URL formatted URL.

156
00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:03.290
As you can see in the final version we have formatted URL.

157
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.640
Then we have the title.

158
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.560
Then we have some kind of description.

159
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.350
So the formatted URL.

160
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:17.130
If you for example, search children cease.

161
00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:25.040
The first website should be children dot com, as you can see.

162
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.620
So that is correct.

163
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:33.420
And then when we click on it, we are going to go to that website.

164
00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.940
CSS dot com.

165
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.500
So that is correct.

166
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.970
The next thing we want to add is another link tag.

167
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.890
This one is going to go the same way, same place.

168
00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.960
So the trip is going to be results.

169
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.460
Third link.

170
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:18.010
But inside this one, we're going to have the instead of formatted URL, we're going to have the title.

171
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:26.500
So I'm going to just write the result, that title.

172
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:34.660
So let's see, we get a title title to this to refresh the page.

173
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.380
Okay, we got this song.

174
00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.790
We got the title.

175
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:42.430
That is fine.

176
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.150
Let's just style this one before going to the next section.

177
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:55.480
Or let's add the other section too, which is the last part, which is the result of HTML snippets.

178
00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.180
So after this link we're going to have.

179
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:12.180
So now, after not after that link, after this tape, we're going to have this result that a snippet

180
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:20.520
or we can just get the HTML snippet because I want to get this kind of boldness, too, because they

181
00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.090
give us HTML.

182
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.750
We need to parse it to show here.

183
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:28.480
Otherwise we we just get a weird result.

184
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.380
I'm going to show you first how to get the results.

185
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.560
So here we're going to have a paragraph.

186
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:43.110
And inside this paragraph, we're going to get the result.

187
00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:50.810
Dot h HTML is Nippert.

188
00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.350
Okay, so let's see what we get.

189
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.450
As you can see, we don't we cannot see that.

190
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:03.860
Okay.

191
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.990
We are now getting some results.

192
00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.670
We haven't completed this style, and don't worry about this one.

193
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.680
We cannot fix that on.

194
00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:25.270
So as you can see, we are getting some HTML tags like boldness and CSS or something like that.

195
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:27.460
So we don't want to show it like this.

196
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:29.530
We want to parse this one.

197
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:36.430
We're going to use a package called HTML React parcel to fix this one.

198
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.960
So we need to install a package.

199
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:56.190
Here, let it stop the server and we need to install a package called HTML dash react dash parser.

200
00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:00.460
Okay.

201
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:06.860
And if you want to know what that is, you can search this one I show you here.

202
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.920
This is a champion package for HTML react parcel.

203
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:16.640
And let's see what they show us here.

204
00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.960
So it has an option.

205
00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.560
For example, if you have a paragraph tag.

206
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:25.750
Hello, world.

207
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:29.150
If you if you want to parse it.

208
00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.480
Or if you want a show like this, you just say pass.

209
00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.080
If you want to do the opposite, you do passer.

210
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:38.880
So.

211
00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:48.150
I mean, sure, if you can see an example with us.

212
00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:55.280
Okay.

213
00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.280
I'm going to show you inside.

214
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.230
So there are a few things you need to get.

215
00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.410
Let me see that.

216
00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.750
And if they have partial example.

217
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:23.690
It's like they don't have, but it's okay.

218
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:25.760
So I'm going to show you how to use it.

219
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:33.230
So we install this package first thing first, and then let's just start the server again.

220
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.410
First we install it, we press enter.

221
00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.700
This is going to install this package.

222
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:48.920
And what we do here, instead of just directly showing the result, we're going to use this parser.

223
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.660
So I'm going to import

224
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.890
parcel capital.

225
00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:03.520
This is coming from HTML React parcel and this is going to wrap the resource.

226
00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.180
So I'm going to put it here like this.

227
00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.350
So now let's.

228
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.630
It stopped the server again using NPM run diff.

229
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:21.350
And then we checked that if we fix this boldness like that, instead of showing the check, we're going

230
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:25.370
to see this text to be pulled instead.

231
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.480
So now let's refresh the page.

232
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:35.180
I think a server is already started and let's see.

233
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:35.930
Yeah.

234
00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.850
Because you just wait for a second.

235
00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:51.720
Now we can see the word till the CSS is bold in some cases instead of just showing the bold.

236
00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.240
All right.

237
00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.990
So I think we have now everything.

238
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:57.490
Let's stall them.

239
00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.670
This is kind of messy now.

240
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:02.640
Uh.

241
00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:10.210
Let's start then we start from the results here.

242
00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.120
We got the result the first day.

243
00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.110
We just add a margin.

244
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:30.770
Add a bottle of eight and then I want to set the max width to be x l.

245
00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:38.230
And the diff that is covering both of the links.

246
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:39.850
I want to make it group.

247
00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:46.870
Because when I hover over any of them, I want to see a underline inside one of them.

248
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:52.480
So I'll show you how to do it inside the first link.

249
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.300
Let's add some styling.

250
00:20:55.300 --> 00:21:05.980
I want to make it to be as small takes a small and in case there is a very long URL, I want to truncate

251
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:06.460
it.

252
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.150
So I don't want to show it in two lines.

253
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.800
TRUNCATE is going to add dot, dot, dot.

254
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:19.270
If the the the line is too long and it's neat.

255
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.510
It's needed to be in the second line.

256
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:27.100
This is going to remove the second line and add dot, dot, dot at the beginning.

257
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:40.870
And then here in the second link, we just say if we hover over it, but we hover over this diff which

258
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.370
would be made a group.

259
00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:48.040
So we just say instead of just hover, we just say group dash hover.

260
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:57.490
So when we hover over both of these links inside this div, we want to add underline for this.

261
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:06.910
And then we want to add the change, the color of the underline to be a blue.

262
00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:15.010
So we just say decoration to be blue 800, for example.

263
00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:20.170
And then let's see what we have done.

264
00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:30.040
So now when we hover even over this link here, we see the underlined here, event here.

265
00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.840
It doesn't matter if we put it here or we put it on the link.

266
00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:38.630
We see the underline.

267
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.980
Then for the.

268
00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:50.770
This paragraph here.

269
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:56.090
Let's sell this one.

270
00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:59.480
Let's make the text to be ex large.

271
00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.200
Then we're going to truncate this one to.

272
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:11.160
And also we want to set the font weight to be medium.

273
00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:20.550
We changed the color of the text to be blue.

274
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:22.500
800.

275
00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.990
Okay, so let's see what.

276
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.540
Okay, let's refresh the page.

277
00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:37.780
Now.

278
00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.880
You can see the text here is blue.

279
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:44.740
And this is doesn't look right.

280
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.120
So let me check.

281
00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:47.920
So.

282
00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:55.090
Okay.

283
00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.110
Let's see.

284
00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.050
All right.

285
00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:08.850
So, yeah, this.

286
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.390
This is styling.

287
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:14.870
Was not for this paragraph.

288
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.460
This was for the.

289
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.510
This link, this second link.

290
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:23.240
So I'm going to add this one at the end of here.

291
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:29.360
So it takes large truncate font, medium and text to be blue.

292
00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:35.360
So this is for this one actually for the description.

293
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.670
We don't want to make a truncate, actually.

294
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:46.700
So for this paragraph, which is covering here, we just change the text to be gray 600.

295
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.140
So now we have this one here.

296
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.990
But these things actually are next to each other.

297
00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.480
I want them to be on top of each other.

298
00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:01.940
So I'm going to go to this div, which we made it group.

299
00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:09.620
I want to change the display to flex that this is going to bring them next to each other, but we change

300
00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.590
the flex to be column.

301
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:14.030
And.

302
00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.230
Let's see.

303
00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.790
Let's refresh the page.

304
00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:23.950
So now they are on top of each other.

305
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:36.480
So the styling for this one is now completed.

306
00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:45.250
So even we go here on the top of the link, we see the underline, we get the truncate and also we we

307
00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.260
are getting this one right too.

308
00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:51.760
But the problem is this footer is kind of messy.

309
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.750
Let me check that.

310
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:55.180
What what's the problem of the footer?

311
00:25:55.180 --> 00:26:04.600
We go to footer the G6 and this one is absolute burden zero.

312
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:08.520
That is fine.

313
00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.570
And then.

314
00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:15.070
I.

315
00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:23.700
I feel we sit this one to be a screen size and doesn't push this one down.

316
00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:28.020
So I'm going to I think in this page.

317
00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:41.740
But somewhere around here, I think this one, maybe it's around the layout.

318
00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:51.300
So let me pause the video.

319
00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.410
I'm going to fix this one and come back.

320
00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.060
All right.

321
00:26:55.060 --> 00:27:04.510
I'll find the problem because this footer is absolute it should be absolute relative to something which

322
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:06.880
should be the body of the screen.

323
00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:16.240
So we need to go to the root layout inside the app directory, the root layout.

324
00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:24.970
And we just this body section we need to add make this position to be relative.

325
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:38.300
And also we want to set the minimum size of the screen and minimum size of the height to be a screen.

326
00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:46.670
So now if we go here and then we refresh the page, the.

327
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:51.260
Okay.

328
00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:54.800
And let's refresh the page.

329
00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:00.910
So as you can see, the.

330
00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:04.760
The footer is at the end.

331
00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:08.390
We are getting some error related to the results.

332
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:08.870
I'm going to.

333
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.400
Let's see.

334
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.940
What's the problem?

335
00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:29.170
Okay, let's refresh the page.

336
00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:44.810
Let me console.log the error and see the problem.

337
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:52.580
So we go to Web page.

338
00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.500
So here, when we throw an error.

339
00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:04.320
Let's first console.log the response.

340
00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:08.590
So now it checks.

341
00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.620
Okay, the response is null.

342
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.650
And let's see, what's the problem?

343
00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:23.300
The problem was too many requests.

344
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.200
Okay.

345
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:34.530
Uh, probably when we are saving too much time, saving a lot, we're going to request from Google a

346
00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:36.180
lot of time.

347
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:38.190
And this Google is.

348
00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:46.440
Just, uh, banned me for a few seconds, So I'm going to pause the video, come back when this problem

349
00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.160
is solved.

350
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:53.050
And let's add some weighting here as well.

351
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.690
So when we actually.

352
00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.580
So I'm going to put some weighting here.

353
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:16.530
So we just added a weight here which is going to have a new promise and we're going to resolve it after,

354
00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:18.960
for example, 5 seconds.

355
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:23.610
So this is going to prevent to fetch the data every time we save.

356
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.890
So we make it ten, 10 seconds.

357
00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:35.340
So this is going to I recommend you do that because each time you save you instead of fetching, you're

358
00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.490
going to wait 10 seconds and then fetch.

359
00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:41.400
So when you finish a styling, you're going to fetch it.

360
00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:45.330
Otherwise you're going to exhaust your API key.

361
00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.540
Let's see that if already fixed or we need to wait more.

362
00:30:52.380 --> 00:31:01.590
So now we need to wait actually 10 seconds until we get the we we get the result or not, we still getting

363
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:02.400
the same error.

364
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:07.500
I'm going to pause the video and I'll be back when this parent is finished.

365
00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:10.020
All right.

366
00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.310
So now we are getting the results.

367
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:14.910
I just played it a few minutes.

368
00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:20.460
As you can see now, the footer is at the end because we have added that.

369
00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.770
Inside the layout.

370
00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:32.150
We have added this relative and min height screen at the body section, so we have fixed this problem

371
00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:32.940
as well.

372
00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.410
So that was it for getting the result for the website.

373
00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:44.990
So the web results in the next section, we're going to fix these images and get the results like the

374
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:54.320
one in the final version, which shows like the images of the place.

375
00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.330
So now let's add this one to GitHub.

376
00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:07.040
I'm going to use Contour shift G to open the source control, and let's just create a message for that

377
00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:11.450
one, which is going to be create search results component.

378
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.790
All right, So now we can just commit and push.

379
00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:31.920
Let's go to our GitHub and we refresh this page.

380
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:35.430
Now, we should see the.

381
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.760
Let's refresh the page.

382
00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.170
We still cannot see.

383
00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:51.180
Now we have 14 commits, and the last one is create search result component, which we have installed

384
00:32:51.180 --> 00:33:02.190
a package called HTML React parcel to parse the HTML, which is coming from the Google API, for example,

385
00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:04.080
the boldness and other things.

386
00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:12.300
And then inside the layout at JSX, we have fixed the problem of the footer to be not at the end of

387
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:15.870
the page by changing its position to be relative.

388
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:22.650
And we set the mean height to be the size of the screen, which is 100% of the report height.

389
00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:31.290
Then we have added, we have imported the web search result inside the page that JSX.

390
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:39.130
And also I have added some delay here, which is going to resolve a promise after 10 seconds.

391
00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.340
So I'm going to keep this one in order.

392
00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.480
We don't get an error.

393
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.950
I highly recommend you do it.

394
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:51.060
Otherwise, Google is going to just band you for a few minutes.

395
00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.220
So this is going to solve that one.

396
00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:58.320
And you don't do any too much request.

397
00:33:59.040 --> 00:33:59.970
And then.

398
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:10.940
We just deleted this red map here and instead we just passed the data as a props to this component that

399
00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:13.490
we have created with search results.

400
00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:17.900
So the web search results is going to be like this.

401
00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:25.730
We have import a link and the parcel and we just show the number of.

402
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:29.790
The results and the seconds here at the beginning.

403
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:41.460
Then we just map through the items and for each item we have shown the formatted URL, the title, and

404
00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.970
also the HTML snippets.

405
00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:50.670
And also we have a style them, make them responsive for different size of this screen.

406
00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.070
So that was it for creation.

407
00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:53.660
This part.

408
00:34:53.670 --> 00:35:01.180
Sorry about the some problem with the footer and the Google API.

409
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:06.630
Actually I, I keep this always the problems in the videos.

410
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:12.660
So if you encounter the same problem, you know that how to fix it.

411
00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.370
I think that is very good.

412
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:22.420
Okay, so in the next section, we're going to work on the image part of the search results.

413
00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:24.640
So see in the next section.
