1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:13,430
All right, in the last section, we have finished with the story section, as you can see here.

2
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:22,010
He made a scrollable and also we removed the scroll bar using Tailwind the scrollbar plugin.

3
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:31,730
In this section, we're going to start with the post sections of the feed that yes, if you look at

4
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:37,130
the final version of the project and if you zoom out a little bit.

5
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,550
Let me draw for you the.

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,370
Things to be neat, uh.

7
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:52,840
All right.

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,290
So now we have a post here.

9
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,880
Which has the header at the top.

10
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:12,140
With the profile and the username, and the other side is the horizontal dots icon.

11
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,020
At a bottom we have.

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,190
The buttons.

13
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,970
Which is which includes the heart button, the comment, and also the save button.

14
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:26,950
Then we have the.

15
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,720
Uh, comment section.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,450
Here.

17
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:47,470
And which shows all the comments, and also we have the the input for putting the comments, so I think

18
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,430
I ran out of the colors.

19
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,070
It's fine.

20
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,010
You can see it here.

21
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,090
All right.

22
00:01:52,090 --> 00:02:00,460
So let's go to let's go back to our feet, which is let's create a component called.

23
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,620
Posts, Duchess.

24
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,490
And we use our sea to create react functional components.

25
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,460
And inside this post, we're going to have all the post.

26
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,630
And first, we need to create some data and then look through it.

27
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,040
I showed them in the post.

28
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:31,420
So let's bring this post inside the FT's Jeff imported here.

29
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,330
Using control space, we can all imported.

30
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,640
You can see it now at the top.

31
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,730
Inside the posts that U.S. posts that Duchess.

32
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,650
First, we need to create some data.

33
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:59,030
At the end, we are going to use databases like fireworks we're using inside this.

34
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,750
Inside here.

35
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,030
But now.

36
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:17,220
We just need to make some dummy data that we can use to create our UI and design it using Kelvin CSF.

37
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:24,270
And later, when we create our database, we can fetch the data, the fish, the data from the database

38
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:30,540
and just replace this dummy data with the real data.

39
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,800
So let's create some dummy datasets using.

40
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:47,610
I just created a constant call post, which is an array, but inside the array we have a couple of objects.

41
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,850
So the first one has the just say idea is one.

42
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,140
This is all just the made up information later.

43
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,150
As I said, we're going to get them real data from the database.

44
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:15,230
So we just create a username, for example, my, uh, Instagram I.D. code.

45
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,750
It's a hand and the user image.

46
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:33,600
I just use the same image I use for the header and the header, that genius I use, uh.

47
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,640
At the end, I use this on.

48
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:49,940
Data from the Skillshare, my profile so pasted here, we don't forget the comma at the end of each.

49
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,440
One and.

50
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:02,480
We have an image so you can see the final version, we have image and profile image.

51
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,890
So we have to bear in mind, have all of them.

52
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,660
So the image, we just get an image from a.

53
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,580
Website, for example, we can get from the.

54
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,590
Unsplash, that's come.

55
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,480
There are plenty of free images we can choose from.

56
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,860
Let's just add some.

57
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,500
And like any sort of image, would be fine.

58
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,680
This is fine.

59
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,600
Just copy the link.

60
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,050
We go back to Visual Studio code and we pasted you.

61
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,480
And in other things we have.

62
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:06,620
Is this caption section, so the caption also this is the comment that the owner of the post puts.

63
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,780
You can see here this picture.

64
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,140
So we have the.

65
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,960
Caption.

66
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,060
So.

67
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,500
We just say tanks or you.

68
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,360
Oh, yeah, it's just a

69
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,270
nice picture.

70
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,100
All right.

71
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:57,370
And then let's make this, uh, we copy this one using all chief.

72
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:03,710
Error, Don, I make you make it, too, so we can design it better.

73
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,480
So the second one, the username, I use my other username.

74
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,310
And the powerful image can be the same.

75
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,390
That's fine.

76
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,370
The image, which was another image from unsplash.com.

77
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,740
Let's just choose this one.

78
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,200
It replaced it.

79
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,320
And just say new.

80
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,280
New picture from my city.

81
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,820
All right, so now we have the all the data.

82
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,460
Also, don't forget to come out here as well, so we separate them from each other.

83
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:07,730
So now we have to use her to post inside our dummy posts.

84
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:16,640
And here we can look through it and show them inside and component.

85
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:24,650
So inside the return, we look through the posts using map function.

86
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,390
That gives us each post separately.

87
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,800
And we can return it.

88
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:45,180
With the new component, let's create a component, we call it post that, yes, we use RF C to create

89
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:51,520
the React functional component and here, uh.

90
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,070
We just put it inside here post.

91
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:05,300
We imported auto imported from post and first, the first things we need is just the key.

92
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:17,730
The post that it will be the key, so here we can say key calls, post that ID.

93
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,420
After that, we have.

94
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,270
The idea itself that is post-up, I'd.

95
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,710
You have username.

96
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:44,040
You just say user name equals the post, that username, as you can see the top nine, it suggests to

97
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,760
me very nicely and I don't need to try too much.

98
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,960
I highly recommend.

99
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:57,630
No, the first time you create the project maybe doesn't suggest you too much, but based on your coding.

100
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:09,850
And this API extension is going to suggest you for your for your next projects, you can code less and

101
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,380
less so.

102
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,490
We have user image.

103
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,170
Which is equal to post that.

104
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,380
User image.

105
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,970
Then we have IMT.

106
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,360
That's his image, the post image.

107
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,100
And finally, we have the caption which is post the caption.

108
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:47,690
All right, now, we pass the props through this component and we can get them here as a props, but

109
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,720
they can distract distracted.

110
00:10:52,160 --> 00:11:02,290
Uh, distracted and like here, we just first we just say, uh, yeah, we can get all of them.

111
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,290
It's just the image, we get the user image.

112
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,790
I think it was user, I am G.

113
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:13,620
Yeah.

114
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,530
And let me see, use it.

115
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,300
I here.

116
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,070
We have captioned, we have user name

117
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,700
and uh.

118
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,110
The idea that's that's you just get the idea as well.

119
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:34,800
All right.

120
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,200
So here inside this return, we can just return.

121
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,420
Anything we like.

122
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,840
Let's just see the username first.

123
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,820
We see that it's working or not, so username.

124
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,910
Let's check our.

125
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,020
Yeah, we can.

126
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,240
We're getting the both the user names.

127
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,710
So it's working perfectly in the next section.

128
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,840
We're going to start with the.

129
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,910
If you check the final version.

130
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,200
We start with the header.

131
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,020
Header off the post, I mean, the profile image and also this icon.

132
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,030
So see you in the next.

133
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,180
First, let's uh, we all.

134
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,070
I always forget this.

135
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:35,490
Put this one in the gift shop, so we just take it AB and just get comments.

136
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:41,050
And this one is great.

137
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,370
Posts.

138
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,500
And post component.

139
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,280
And make.

140
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,500
Some dummy data.

141
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,130
This push it to the guitar.

142
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,090
And we check.

143
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,360
I think I close to get how so?

144
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,370
Let's go inside to my top.

145
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,170
All right.

146
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,080
In the repositories.

147
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,920
Instead, version four.

148
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:49,930
We have now nine comments, and the last one is create post and post components and make some dummy

149
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,380
data.

150
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,500
As you can see, we just created posters inside the feed that, yes, we had posted post component.

151
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:10,180
We created post as and we just show the username and in posts such as, we created some dummy data.

152
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,110
A post with two objects.

153
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:26,350
And we just returned it and look through the post using map function, and we passed all the information

154
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,990
as a props to the post component.

155
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:37,120
In the next section, as I mentioned, we going to create the header part of the post, so see in the

156
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,840
next section.
