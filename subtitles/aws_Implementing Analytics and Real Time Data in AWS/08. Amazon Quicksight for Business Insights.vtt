00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.690
[Autogenerated] now that we have an understanding

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:08.440
of AWS Elastic search offering, Let's move on to Amazon quicksight.

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.340
Now Quick Sight isn't Business analytics service that works with our data.

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.970
And by leveraging our data, it allows us to build visualizations we can,

5
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.780
perform ad hoc analysis of the data sets and,

6
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.570
in the end,

7
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.190
we can get business insights to see where we can improve and what

8
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.340
we're doing well on what's cool about it is it can automatically

9
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.500
discover a W S data sources if you want it to.

10
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.640
Or you can configure your own that push data to quicksight for the

11
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.420
analysis capabilities now to accomplish its work efficiently.

12
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.550
It uses spice and spice allows for a responsive

13
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.040
performance in massive scaling abilities.

14
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.580
And for those who are not familiar with spice Spices just as in memory engine

15
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.320
for storing data so you can see the acronym at the bottom.

16
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.840
It stands for superfast parallel in memory calculation engine.

17
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.800
So since stuff is stored in memory,

18
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.720
it allows the underlying compute to pull it out quicker and

19
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.730
perform some type of data analytic that we want.

20
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:28.000
Now let's in here and move into the AWS console, and we'll start looking at enabling and then configuring Amazon quicksight
