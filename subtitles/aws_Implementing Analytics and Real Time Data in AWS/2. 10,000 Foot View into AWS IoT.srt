1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,810
[Autogenerated] Okay, let's dive into a W s I o t Now I o t If I scroll down,

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,860
which stands for Internet of things you could see

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,740
there's several services that make it up.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,610
Now all of these services that you see essentially play hand in

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,210
hand and work with each other to solve your i o t.

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,270
Needs now for this clip.

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,540
It's going to be high level, and I just want to dive in to I o t core.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,500
Now this is the main page in service that you use to monitor

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,740
and set up most of your I o T infrastructure.

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,250
You can see we can monitor our connections and messages that

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,220
error published you can onboard new devices,

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,340
which we'll talk about here in a minute.

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,890
You can manage existing i o T.

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,240
Devices.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,000
You can manage your green grass deployments and green

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,970
grass is a service that a W s created,

17
00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:00,360
which allows us to process our data that's generated locally.

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,860
But the cool thing is, we can still use several A.

19
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,500
W s services to complete that processing.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,810
So, for example, we might have a lambda running locally on our raspberry pi,

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,620
which is taking advantage of sage maker for some machine

22
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,310
learning computation that we normally couldn't do locally on

23
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,770
the machine due to resource constraints.

24
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,360
Green grass is a very cool technology,

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,000
and I really recommend that you check it out.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,210
Now.

27
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:29,770
Moving on,

28
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,850
you can see we have secure so we can go ahead and look at

29
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,840
certificates that are created to establish a connection.

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,840
And these Certs work hand in hand with a protocol called M Q T T.

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,520
Now M Q.

32
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,000
T T is an industry standard for Internet of Things communications,

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,320
so it allows our devices to communicate with R A W s I.

34
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,940
O T services.

35
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,680
We have our defend, which allows us to audit and monitor activities.

36
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,070
We can act so these error where we define what are called

37
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,040
rules and we'll talk about these in a minute,

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,950
and then we have test so we can test on our gateways by publishing

39
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,340
and subscribing to topics as you can see here.

40
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:12,550
Now,

41
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,720
I'm not gonna walk through any of this because I have a course that dives in

42
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,640
at an extremely detailed level on setting this all up.

43
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,030
And it's also available in Pluralsight.

44
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,870
And I'll show you that here at the end of this clip.

45
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,140
Now,

46
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,000
I do want to talk about really quickly the primary

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,340
components that make up an I o t architecture er,

48
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,440
And to do that, I'm going to use this graph here.

49
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,940
Now, in this graph, we have several I ot things.

50
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:45,080
Now I ot things are all of these here and these error i o t devices.

51
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,260
So things error any thing,

52
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,840
any physical item or resource that sends data to the cloud.

53
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,220
So this could be things like an i o t button.

54
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,890
What you see here and these error even available on the Amazon

55
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,470
store to allow you to place one click ordering by pressing a

56
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,380
physical button that you have in your house,

57
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,610
it might be a car censor.

58
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,940
It could be an Amazon echo running some type of request that you ask it to.

59
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,060
It could be a raspberry pi that we're running a lambda locally on and then

60
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,880
leveraging sage maker like we were talking about in a W s.

61
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,620
It could be a factory sensor where you're monitoring

62
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,800
inventory or status of machinery.

63
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,840
It could even be a smart thermostat like a nest or Aneka to be.

64
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,040
Now, all of these devices communicate with a W S I O T.

65
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,410
Primarily through what are known as topics.

66
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:41,630
Now,

67
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:47,070
a topic is similar to an SNS topic in that it allows

68
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,940
devices or things to publish to the topic.

69
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,640
And then the topic has rules.

70
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,240
That error subscribe to it on the back end.

71
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,840
And these rules, which are in this act section over here on the left,

72
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,150
allow us to take actions based on the messages that come in from R I ot

73
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:11,100
things so an example might be our factory sending in some type of

74
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,100
sensor data for inventory that triggers an I.

75
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,220
O.

76
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,470
T.

77
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,190
Rule that updates inventory in a dynamo DB table.

78
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:23,730
Now the cool thing about this is that we can actually bypass topics

79
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:28,840
and invoke I o t rules directly from R I ot things.

80
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,770
So what this allows us to do is two primary things.

81
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,430
It allows us to bypass a hop through that topic and

82
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,320
just directly invoke our rule.

83
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,230
And it also helps us avoid any unnecessary API actions and

84
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,080
calls that may occur if we send to that topic.

85
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,960
And that's because you have several rules subscribed to a topic So if

86
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,340
you're avoiding all of those other rules that don't necessarily match

87
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,990
up to the request your device is making,

88
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,170
you could invoke that,

89
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,560
ruled directly and then maybe invoke a lambda function like we see here.

90
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,860
So an example from this graph might be this smart thermostat that

91
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,840
is maybe reporting a extremely high temperature.

92
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,180
And we want to take an action.

93
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,630
So that device sends a message using M Q T T Protocol.

94
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:25,640
It hits this rule and activates an action which may be hits a lambda.

95
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,290
And when that Lambda is invoked,

96
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,030
it sends a message back to our device that tells it to

97
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,940
turn it down to a few less degrees.

98
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,660
And that's just one example.

99
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:41,010
Now all of these devices use what are called device shadows.

100
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:46,910
Now, device shadows are what manage our connections and the state of our devices.

101
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,320
So these device shadows are extremely important to the

102
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,540
functioning of R I O t architectures.

103
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,740
Now that's gonna go ahead.

104
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,040
Let's wrap up here.

105
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,940
I just wanted to give you a high level overview of how a W s I o t works.

106
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,130
Now, if you're interested in diving in a little bit deeper.

107
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:11,160
I would suggest you go ahead and take my connecting I O T devices and A W

108
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,270
s with Amazon Greengrass course here at Pluralsight.

109
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,640
And you can see that here now with that,

110
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:25,000
let's go ahead and in this clip here and we'll pick up with a module review in the next one.
