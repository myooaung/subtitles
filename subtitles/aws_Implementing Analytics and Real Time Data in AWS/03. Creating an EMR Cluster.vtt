00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.790
[Autogenerated] All right, let's start talking about elastic map.

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.540
Reduce within Amazon.

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.340
So I'm at the EMR dashboard screen,

4
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.540
and what I want to do is I want to create a cluster.

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.050
So this config screen is where we define our cluster settings.

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.570
And if you remember, a cluster is made up of several nodes,

7
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.220
including a master node,

8
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.130
and then either task or data nodes that perform certain functions.

9
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.940
So we'll call this Pluralsight.

10
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.740
I'm not going to enable logging,

11
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.780
but you see that you can and you can specify S3 we can do

12
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.040
launch mode as cluster or step execution.

13
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.040
So it's elects steps via program selection that we choose,

14
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.080
and it executes the steps how we configure them.

15
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.380
So I'll go and do cluster and you can see we can choose RMR release.

16
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.660
So there's tons of five dot versions we can choose 6.0,

17
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.360
if we want let me do that.

18
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.920
And depending on this release version,

19
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.800
that's what's going to determine our applications that we can have PRI

20
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.940
configured so you can see there's core Hadoop H base,

21
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.760
presto and Spark,

22
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.050
and these error all different frameworks and tool sets that you

23
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.340
can use to perform analytics on big data.

24
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.390
Now, if we wanted to,

25
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.430
we could do a W s glue data catalog for our table

26
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.020
metadata that lives within our EMR cluster.

27
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.550
I'm not going to do that here, but it's just a option to remember now.

28
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.040
The next thing we have to do is we have to choose error hardware.

29
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.900
Now it's important to realize from an experience point of view not all of

30
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.470
these instances types are available in specific regions.

31
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.960
So when you're creating your cluster,

32
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.250
you may get some failures due to your instantiation.

33
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.340
I've ran into this before, so I just wanted to point that out.

34
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.860
I'll go ahead, leave the number of instances to three.

35
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.970
You can see we have one master in two core and then you choose a keep error.

36
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.830
So I'll choose my keep error here.

37
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.740
We can define permissions either custom or default.

38
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.720
I'll click on create cluster and there you go.

39
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.240
That's how easy it is to create your cluster.

40
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.240
Now you can see our master and core are provisioning.

41
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.490
And if we wanted to, we can add to this and expand it.

42
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.240
So we have some task nodes as well.

43
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.150
Now what's cool here is they provide different actions and

44
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.340
steps logging so you can see what's going on.

45
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.590
And, for instance, this step here is showing how we set up Hadoop debugging.

46
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.360
Now, I'm not going to go into too much depth on this service.

47
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.160
I just wanted to show you how easy it is to create an E M R

48
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.440
cluster and then start performing data.

49
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.690
Now I have another course on Pluralsight with a deep

50
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.530
dive about elastic map produce,

51
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.060
and it's called handling and analyzing data with AWS elastic map produce.

52
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.000
So if you want to get a little bit deeper into the weeds, is far as E M r.

53
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.820
I suggest you take that course and really study what I teach you in

54
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.130
there that's going to go ahead and do it for this clip.

55
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.880
I just wanted to show you once again how you can create a

56
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.740
cluster and specify different settings.

57
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.000
I'm gonna go ahead and terminate this and we'll go ahead and wrap up and then move on
