00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,350
[Autogenerated] Alright.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,440
Congratulations.

3
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,440
You've made it through the final module of this Pluralsight course

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,580
before we move on to our course review and next steps.

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,340
Let's have a quick module review here.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,290
Now we reviewed the offerings of a W S I O.

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,240
T.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,930
And one of the services that we looked at was I o t green grass.

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,120
So we looked at how we can use green grass both in

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,940
a W s and on personal devices.

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,870
And with this, we discussed i o t device Shadows.

12
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:36,790
So we looked at how we can securely communicate with our devices

13
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,080
and configure them via these device shadows.

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,100
Now let's go ahead and move on to a course wrap up so we can have a final

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,540
review of everything that we learn from a high level.

16
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,460
Within this course we explore,

17
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,940
the different Ken is is stream offerings that AWS has,

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,070
which included Kenneth's data streams, video streams,

19
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,340
Data analytics And then we looked at data firehose.

20
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,500
We saw how we can Leverage Analytics services within a W s.

21
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:17,200
So things like e m r red shift elastic search in quicksight and we talked

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,290
about how you can tie all of them together We then looked at integrating s and

23
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,440
S and sqs for pub sub architectures within a W s.

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,190
So we looked at configuring different topics and topic policies as

25
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,570
well as different sqs cues like Standard and Fife.

26
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,290
Oh,

27
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,540
that subscribed to SNS topics and then have different

28
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,180
consumers on the back end like a lambda,

29
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,440
for example.

30
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,950
And then we just finished up by gaining a general

31
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,740
understanding of the A W S i o t offerings.

32
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,780
So we looked at all of the different I o t offerings the A W S

33
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,900
has and talked about him at a high level.

34
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,310
So that's going to do it for this course on implementing

35
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,140
analytics in real time data in a W S.

36
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,020
I want to sincerely thank you for taking the time

37
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,980
to take this Pluralsight course,

38
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,580
and I recommend you start looking at the other courses

39
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,740
that make up this solutions architect, professional path.

40
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,980
There are eight solid courses that make up this entire path,

41
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,380
and this is just the seventh out of eight.

42
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:34,000
So once again, thank you very much for taking this course, and I hope to teach you again soon.
