00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,570
[Autogenerated] Okay, so we just wrapped up data firehose.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,140
And let's talk about Ken is is data analytics.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,910
Data Analytics is another can is is stream that's

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,830
available to us and it allows us to do real time

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,120
processing and analysis of streams using SQL.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,610
So a structured query language.

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,540
Now, since we're able to perform SQL code against these streams,

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,900
this allows us to create time series analytics,

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,120
real time dashboards and real time metrics so it allows

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,240
for some very powerful processing.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,000
Is far as applications go due to its use of SQL to perform

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,220
analytic actions on the streams data now,

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:51,040
Data analytics also output to fire hose lambda and other data streams.

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,860
So these error destinations similar to how data firehose had

15
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,740
destinations that it could output data to.

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:02,700
And the nice thing about this is if you output your data to a data firehose,

17
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,730
let's say you can go ahead and dump that data through fire hose into

18
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,840
maybe Splunk-ES any type of analytic processing you need,

19
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,730
and it's all done in basically real time,

20
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,340
which is pretty awesome.

21
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,280
So with the general overview of Data Analytics understood,

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:27,000
let's move into the console and start looking at these data analytic streams for SQL applications
