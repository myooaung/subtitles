00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.310
[Autogenerated] All right, let's dive into our final module.

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.830
And in this module, we're going to start looking at implementing a W S I O T.

3
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.640
Which is short for Internet of things.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.540
This is going to be a fairly quick module relative to the others.

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.180
We're just gonna go ahead and go over the General A W

6
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.740
S I o t offerings that we can use.

7
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.440
So we'll look at things like I o t green grass, for example.

8
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.740
Now, what are a W S i o t services?

9
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.000
Well, first of all,

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.840
they allow for secure bi directional communication between internet devices

11
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.580
and a ws cloud so we can collect and store telemetry data from multiple

12
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.740
devices for analysis and store that data in a W s.

13
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.720
Now, the power of the I.

14
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.930
O T services is that it allows users to control I o T

15
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.640
devices from their own personal phones, tablets and smart home devices.

16
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.680
So it allows us to securely connect and talk with a W S

17
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.320
from things like sensors and warehouses,

18
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.590
or maybe your own phone.

19
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.840
That's passing data for a GPS tracking for, let's say, a jog around the park.

20
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.040
There's many different use cases that internet of things consol of.

21
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:31.000
And with that, let's actually start diving into the i O. T offerings from within the AWS console.
