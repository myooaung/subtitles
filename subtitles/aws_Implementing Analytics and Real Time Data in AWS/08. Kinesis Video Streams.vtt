00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.840
[Autogenerated] All right, welcome back.

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.480
So we just got done.

3
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.360
Looking at Ken is is data Analytics in the console,

4
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.140
and this clip is going to start diving into video streams.

5
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.610
Now,

6
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.640
Chinese video streams is another fully managed service and allows

7
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.440
us to stream live video from devices to a W s.

8
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.150
And what's cool about it is it includes real time streaming,

9
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.470
not just data storage.

10
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.400
So what this means is we can use this service to watch video streams

11
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.640
in real time as their received into the cloud.

12
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.670
It's pretty neat.

13
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.520
And in addition to this,

14
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.190
it allows us to capture massive amounts of data from

15
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.530
millions of sources around the world.

16
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.620
And these include smartphones,

17
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.840
security cameras or maybe even drones that people are piloting.

18
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.400
It has a lot of flexibility for the producers that

19
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.040
can put data into the streams.

20
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.000
Now, even though it does video data,

21
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.440
it also allows us to send non video time serialized data.

22
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.820
So a good example of this would be audio data.

23
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.190
That's obviously not video data,

24
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.210
but we can send that through video streams for data

25
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.040
that needs to be time serialized,

26
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.040
and obviously audio data needs to be time serialized,

27
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.960
So it's flexible in the aspect that it doesn't just do video.

28
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.440
You can also send non video.

29
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.660
Now,

30
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.130
the last point we have here is it condole ra ble store media

31
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.040
data for a specified retention period.

32
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.630
So this is similar to data streams and data firehose where it could

33
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.800
store our records in our data for specific retention period that we

34
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.240
set and we'll take a look at those in the console when we start

35
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.440
playing around with video streams.

36
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.610
Now, let's go ahead.

37
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.580
We'll end here and we'll pick back up in the console where we'll

38
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.000
start looking at video streams within A W. S.
