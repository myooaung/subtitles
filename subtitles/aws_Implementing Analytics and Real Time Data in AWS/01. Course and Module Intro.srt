[Autogenerated] welcome to this course on implementing

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,040
analytics in real time data in a W s.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,520
My name is Andrew Estes,

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,820
and I am an enterprise cloud architect for CSG

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,640
International as well as founder of Quick to Cloud.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,010
This first module in this course is going to

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,040
discuss streaming data within a W s.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,700
Now, before we dive into this specific module,

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,400
let's just have a quick course overview on what we're

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,640
expecting to learn throughout this course.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,680
Now the first thing we want to do is we want to understand the

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,440
different use cases for different to nested streams.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,790
Then we'll move on to using data analytic services within a W s.

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:48,740
And these include E M R Red Shift, elastic search and then even quicksight.

15
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,600
And we'll see how these all play well together to

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,240
make up analytic architectures.

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,440
After that, we're gonna move on to implementing application integration services.

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,770
In these services are things like simple notification

19
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,190
service s and S and simple que services sqs.

20
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:11,300
So we'll look at implementing both and then we'll in the course by

21
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,000
reviewing internet of things also known as I O.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,780
T.

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,670
And the different services that AWS offers around I o t.

24
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,300
We'll go ahead and move on to our first module and in this module,

25
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,880
we're going to learn how and when to use can,

26
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,540
is, is.

27
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,110
And this is going to include data, streams,

28
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,640
data, firehose, data analytics and video streams.

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,520
So we'll have an overview of each of those.

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,340
And then we'll go into the console afterwards and get some hands on experience.

31
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:53,000
Let's go ahead and in this clip here and we'll pick back up in the next clip. Discussing Ken is is data streams.
