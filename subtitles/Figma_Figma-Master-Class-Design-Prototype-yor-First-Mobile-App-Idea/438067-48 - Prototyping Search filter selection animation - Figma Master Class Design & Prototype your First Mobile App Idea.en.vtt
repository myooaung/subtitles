X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.270
Now we're going toe replicate this screen and we're going toe that next state,

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.980
which is going to be selection stage.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:19.170
So I'm going toe use the zoom toe 90% to my liking.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.260
This one looks good.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:27.840
Now I'm going toe click and hold my art and option key to drag it and replicate this screen

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.240
over here.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.400
So this is going to be over such to and here we are going to have some selection states

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.750
over here.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.570
So once someone taps all here,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.550
there will be a search item over here.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.490
So this is going what we're going to do in this screen?

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.860
One thing we have forgotten what here is that we need to change this such recipe and we're

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.550
going to use a door here,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:59.360
search duh or select select options.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.260
Let's call this now one,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.340
someone click on it.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.220
So we are going to go to this value,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.970
died an option,

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.430
and we are going toe replicated this by command E.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.950
So we have another one,

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.190
and we are going to call it option.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.650
Let's call it option value.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.350
And let's call it option,

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.430
uh,

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.550
normal.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:39.810
And let's call this one option okay for the active state.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.550
We're going to use the color we had,

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.790
which is very sharp green,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.010
which is our primary color.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.770
This one zero e 5956 So this is a color scheme.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.920
We have already decided.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.070
These are our primary colors on the screen.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.810
One and I really love and enjoy this color.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.010
This is very nice,

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.220
girl.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.070
Okay,

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.320
so we have this selector state,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.850
but we also want an icon or help.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.100
And one more thing is same thing is going to be added overhead.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.930
So what we will do is we're going to bring the icon over here,

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.650
dragged I got over here and created one for ourselves.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.320
So first thing is,

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.550
we are going to need an ellipse over here,

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.000
which is hold shift.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.950
And I wanted Toby 16 by 16.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.930
Let's make 16 by 16 and it will be the same color.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:30.510
This one,

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.290
the screen,

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.850
and it will have a stroke off one pigs ill,

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.380
and it will be white.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.120
Okay,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.220
so I'm going to tell you why I future Dwight,

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.950
because it is going to separate it from this background over him.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.590
We can also have a bit bigger,

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.240
like 18 by 18.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.550
This is this is looking good.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.780
Okay,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.080
so we have this one,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.540
and this looks create.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.450
Now we just need to bring the I gone over here,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.950
so let's bring daikon.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.950
Okay,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:01.200
now,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.720
here are the icons we have already selected.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.370
There are two icons that have the checked like this.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.070
You can see this one and this one.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.210
So I'm going to go with this one.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.160
I'm going to drag it into my sigma and we're going toe quickly Change few off the things or

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.460
here.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.080
For example.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.160
We just need this check.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.410
Mark,

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.950
we don't need these lines are here,

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.170
so I just need this one.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.120
So I'm going to drag outside off this group,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.790
and I'm going to move it inside this,

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.060
like this,

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.140
We're going to use a white color.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.410
Excuse this'll one,

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.680
and you get a bit more white.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.510
Let's add this white color toe more white,

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.170
excluded,

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.950
more light.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.390
Zoom in by using command plus keys,

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.500
and we're going to slack this and we're going to make it a bit smaller because it is very,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.530
very large.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.850
Take over here.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.430
So we I think we need just,

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.460
um,

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.190
like this one.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.150
This is good.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.070
Okay,

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.650
this looks great.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.950
Excuse the border off the same color like this one.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.050
This more writer,

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.650
okay?

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.160
Border And this check box has should have the same color.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.320
Okay,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.240
so I think we have our selected steered.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:34.210
Now we're goingto group it together because we have things separately to work here and

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.650
there.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.770
So these are our two ellipses.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.330
This is Okay,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.950
So this is a small section.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.190
This is allergies.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.020
So this is die Pan di.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.740
Planned group option virgin.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.530
Okay,

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.220
so here we have the option active and option normal.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.490
So we are going to move our these two icons just above this active.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.110
We're not going to move it inside it because it will apply the same things over here.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.410
The settings over here.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:09.390
So we're going toe,

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.750
select all of these command G,

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.750
and this is going to be our option.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.510
Active student.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.490
So this is our option active.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.350
This is other option.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.850
Normal.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.800
So whenever someone clicks over here,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.690
or perhaps over here,

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.270
this is going toe Come forward.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.580
Okay,

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.390
Now we're going to add something.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.870
We're here,

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.410
and first thing we're going to do is we're going to hide this and we are going to make

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.900
another and it's so sorry rectangle over here.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.620
And we're going to use something same settings like this.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:53.050
Or maybe we can use just the text or here and call it value diet.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.870
And,

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:55.550
um,

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:01.640
we are going to add shift A that is going toe Adauto layer to it.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.260
We're going to use 12 and,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.350
um 11.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.680
And let's use,

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.330
uh,

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.450
36 over here at some particular,

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.290
which is going to be our blue color,

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.100
which we have already added.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.440
One.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.050
F.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:27.930
Four d 96 Now let's change the color off the text toe something white,

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.950
which is going to be a more vital here.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.270
Let's place it over here and see it because it fits.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.530
No,

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.650
it is a little bigger,

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.300
so we are going to have a little bit less.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.770
Then 10 is looking good.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:51.050
Let's zoom in and see if we have equal spaces a top and bottom something like this.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:57.650
Let's zoom out and see a bit more smaller.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:58.790
This one,

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:59.820
this one will work.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.430
Yes,

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.360
okay,

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.950
so online is the setting,

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.750
so we have one point value died over here,

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.910
which is already added,

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.760
and let's see if the same type sides.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.030
Okay,

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.790
so this is the same for I can't I think 11 but an action text.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.760
So this is 11 connection text.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.950
Okay,

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:19.850
so this is good.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.450
Make it in the middle.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.820
Okay,

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.350
So once this one is selected,

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:26.910
this one goes like this.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:27.780
And,

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.250
uh,

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.350
we're going to create an icon over here.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.290
Cross icon,

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.450
It's use this shift.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:44.650
Let's use a straight line and we are going to use minus 45 something like this,

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.700
and we are going toe have capped.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.590
Toby rounded.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.080
Ah,

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.770
a little bit bigger.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.610
Who is going to be the size?

00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:02.120
And we are going toe command the replicate this and we're going toe.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.550
Move it to 45 degrees like this.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.800
Let's just these do.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.840
Okay,

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.080
so I think this this looks this looks scored.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.670
We already have across.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:17.210
I call,

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.050
we're going toe.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:23.360
Group them together and call it cross or x.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.830
I got next.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.790
Move it over here looks a bit smaller,

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:36.850
so we are going to change its hide a bit.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:37.950
13.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:43.800
This looks better before that.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.350
Away from this that she was 14 or here.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.940
Shoes,

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:51.870
you know,

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:52.270
ahead.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.220
16.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:53.440
Okay,

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.950
so 16 is actually the size for this one.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.680
So I'm using height.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.350
Height is going to be 15.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:03.420
And let's say you 16 16 looks a bit bigger.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.500
15.5.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.050
So I'm going to use some size like this one,

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.150
and it must be,

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.010
Let's let's move it inside.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:12.950
This such by?

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:19.340
I think we cannot move it because it's actually on instance.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.370
So we either need to break this instance.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.550
We have to break it.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:30.450
So let's keep it like this and change the color big the same,

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.450
this same color.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.210
Okay,

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:37.950
so we have no this or maybe we can have this.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:39.650
I think this looks good.

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.290
Both of these actions are pretty separate.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:47.220
So we have a selection state ready to now.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:47.960
The trick is,

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.180
whenever you want toe any minute something in fig,

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:57.430
ma or any of the proto driving app bought off these states should be the same.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.460
So you can see or hear.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:09:59.790
Hear?

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:00.900
This is different.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.890
We have different options.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:03.200
Option,

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:03.480
option,

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:03.780
option,

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.170
option.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.000
And here we have.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.450
We have different things,

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.850
so it must be the same.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:14.060
So what I'm going to do is we're going to generate this by replicating this one.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.710
So I'm going to believe this.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:23.280
Replicate this one because we have we have We need all these active states to if we want to

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.740
any mid and we are going to in this state.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.750
So this is going to be search one search one.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.590
And in this state,

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:34.550
this polio,

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.840
let's naming,

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.630
should be the same.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.350
So if you have frame one that it must be framed one over here toe.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:48.680
So I'm going to move it down like this over here,

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.030
and it is going to be C 0%.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:57.450
So it is going to be the transparency should be 0%.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:58.180
Okay,

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.550
so we have hidden it over here,

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.950
and we are going toe.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.940
Use the search.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.020
Select option.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.240
Toby present.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:06.660
Over here,

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.050
it is going to be active similarly in this over here,

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.190
we have to hide something.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.650
Option active.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.690
It is going to be 0%.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.250
Let's first move it down.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.590
So I wanted to slide up like this.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:27.350
So I am going to move it down over here,

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.650
and I'm going to use 0%.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:34.000
So if you understand that,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.990
I have actually,

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.810
I'm trying to hide these states.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.370
And when we moved to this enemy toe.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:39.930
This one,

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.850
this active state,

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:45.990
we're going to just show them okay Similarly,

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.490
for this cross icon.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:56.550
We are going to move it over here like this on may be over here,

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.140
over here and move.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.950
Make it 0%.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:04.950
So whenever someone tries to click over here,

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.250
it is going to go into the state.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.040
So whenever someone tries toe,

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.000
pick our try to activate this.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.990
It is going to go into this state and every item is going to show itself slowly and

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.460
gradually.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.310
So this is actually the trick behind this.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:20.730
Similarly,

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.500
over here we are going toe.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.270
Show it.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.860
But we are going to use opacity over here.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:30.150
That's hided by using opacity like this.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.970
Okay,

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.170
so let's try to any made them and try to connect them.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.710
Let's go toe prototype and I am going toe.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.100
Go over here.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.710
And if someone OK,

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.680
so we're going to go over here.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:49.170
If someone tries to click on tap on this one,

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:53.450
it is going to go to this and we're going to use Smart Enemy.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.000
It is in out.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.850
No scrolling gets off that it's cold.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.210
Let's start this.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:08.690
Let's also connect some of the such bars over here to this such area.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.790
So we are going toe move to this one.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:12.720
Smart.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.380
Any mere.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:13.880
Ok,

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.390
so this one,

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.220
similarly,

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.700
this one similarly,

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.450
this one.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:21.910
Okay,

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.350
so all of the search bar there correctly to this one.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:29.000
Let's play our prototype and see what we have caught yet.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.070
Okay,

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:35.850
so here we have it is our animated meat menu.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:39.040
Then if we click on this such recipe,

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.200
it is going to you see,

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.180
this comes up like this.

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:47.550
We cannot go back right now because it is going back to this one we have toe.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:48.860
Okay.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.010
So once we have we are on this screen,

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.300
let me show you what we have done till now.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.750
So for click over here,

00:13:54.750 --> 00:14:03.590
see the any mission over here and let me connect this so we can repeat it again and again.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:05.010
Okay,

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:09.900
so here we have this cross and where's across?

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:10.950
Across.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:19.060
So this is really I don't like this in strict mom,

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:19.760
because my name.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.920
And then when I slept this I should be inside,

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.890
taken toe this layer over here.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:32.850
So this is a across icon and I am going to add um,

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:38.340
taps that 80 over here.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.000
So this is going to be my tab?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.580
Yeah,

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.850
for this cross icon.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.950
What is happening?

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:55.250
I want to have a tangle that is going to be the their opinion for this one.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:57.850
It's cross icon.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.160
Let's call it depth.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:00.750
Yeah,

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:06.650
I'm going to 0% opacity,

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:10.570
and it is going to go back.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:11.840
So in prototype,

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.690
I'm going toe.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:15.650
Move this and this is going to go back to this one.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:19.250
And let's play this again.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:22.980
No.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.550
You see the effect over here?

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:29.450
You see how this pal your diet slides in along with this one?

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:39.630
So this is how you create a nice looking an immediate prototype in fig.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:42.110
My hope you have learned enjoyed this lesson.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.520
Let's move on to the next lesson where we're going to show the search.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.460
Such reserves.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.590
I hope you have enjoyed this video,

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:52.060
and I know that these videos are very long,

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.380
but you have to keep watching to learn something new
