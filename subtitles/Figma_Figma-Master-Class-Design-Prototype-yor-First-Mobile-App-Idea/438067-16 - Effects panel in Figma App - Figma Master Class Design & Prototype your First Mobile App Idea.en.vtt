00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.810
in this video,

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.520
we're going to learn different effects off your design and how you can use thes thesis

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.540
effects panel on the right side whenever you're designing using figment.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.560
So four things we're going to create one is this very light Settle shadow around it,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.250
very small shadow around it.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.860
Then we have another one,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.480
which is going to be a very soft expended shadow.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.560
Then we have this three D effect,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.080
and we have this inset effect,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.630
the same thing I have done when I bought my first you a design course with photo shop,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.650
So I'm doing it in fig motto.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.720
So these are the four effects we're going to create.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.570
So first off,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.580
I'm going to remove all these defects from here to show you where I started,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.990
actually.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.550
So,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.040
um so here we have simple elements.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.930
Simple white.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.240
Now you can see one thing is common.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.870
I have a light colored background.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.120
This is very important.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.610
Whenever you are trying to have some shadow,

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.050
you have to have some colored light,

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.300
bill colored background.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.510
This is going to work a lot better now.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.560
The first thing we are going to do is we are going toe create this shadow over here,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.610
which is going to be a very you can see very expanded,

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.740
very blurred shadow.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.970
So press this passport and we have a simple drop shadow which looks likes this.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.590
This doesn't look very good,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.130
so we're going to improve it.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.220
So for the options were going toe,

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.100
get over here.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.010
So we have these options X value the movement off shadow in the right side.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.980
So it is going to move for try to press five over here.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.950
You can see it is moving in.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.360
Destruction value is top to bottom.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.700
So if you want to move to the bottom,

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.650
this is how you can do that.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.950
So increase the vie value to move the shadow at the bottom.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.990
If you want to,

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.510
you move the other side.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.070
You're going to use minus five like this and minus 15 like this.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.350
So that's cool back.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.230
Okay,

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.860
so blood is how much blurred it must be.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.770
So it is going to have some soft edges.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.970
So if you try to increase the blood value,

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.250
it is going toe become more softer.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.610
So the first setting we're going to do is I'm going to use X one.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.730
So I'm going to move a little bit or here that I'm going to use the blood 32.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.220
So I wanted to be very soft as shadow and the viral.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.150
You will be it.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.240
So I want to move it a bit down.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.540
So I want less shadow on the top.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.650
A bit more over here.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.420
Then I'm going to use 20%.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.520
I don't want it to be very,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.920
um hard shadows.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.200
So I want to make it soft.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.120
I'm reducing the opacity 20%.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.220
Now you can see it is looking great.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.620
Now,

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.690
the last thing you can do is we're going to change this color from black.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.220
So the same color off this background.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.650
So I'm going to click over here,

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.560
and I am going to move it around over here.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.510
Now you can see again when I have selected the color It went again 200%.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.770
So I'm going to use it to 30% Now.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.320
You can see this is looking really good.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.560
Soft shadow.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.580
I'm going to give you assignments to make something like this.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.100
Very nice.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.960
Very clean,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.710
very creative.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.080
You can see over here now,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.360
similarly for this one,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.950
we're going to use some other settings.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.760
So again we're going to go to drop shadow.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.270
You can see we have more options in a shadow layer,

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.470
Blurred background blur.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.700
But we're right now going with drop shadow and in a shadow is going to be next.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:48.220
So now we are going toe Jane the settings so x will be zero blood will before and the vie

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.930
value will be survival will be too.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.470
So we want it very close to our earlier and this is going to be 15%.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:05.990
And the killer we are going to use Lex use this color and I'm going to reduce its capacity

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.690
to 20% like this.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.320
So this this is a little bit different color for the from the background,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.390
a bit bluish.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.050
This is a bit greenish blue,

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.840
but it looked at it.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.790
It is looking create on the top off this background.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.260
So this is very soft.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.480
Close settle shadow.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.380
If you want toe change the color a bit.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.810
Want darker shadow?

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.540
You can go in this darker area.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.890
If you want some lighter shadow or light based effect,

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.230
you can go in this section.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.630
We're here.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.570
You can see If you look closely on the left,

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.220
you can see light,

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.100
dark,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.720
light,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.410
dark,

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.970
light,

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:42.590
dark.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.240
So I'm going to go with this one for him.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.240
Now,

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.390
we're going to go for this inside of inset effect.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.050
So clicking this and if we click on effects,

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.790
we want toe have to actually effects.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.130
One is going to be in a shadow.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.920
So once we use in a shadow,

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.470
you can see it already has an inside of insect effect not to.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.730
In Ha's this effect,

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.920
I'm going to zoom in to show you the difference.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.140
So this is actually your inside,

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.690
and,

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.050
uh,

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.710
it's called the effects.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.950
And I can use 20% over here,

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.120
and I'm going to increase it down a little bit.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.960
Excuse.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.600
Three north,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.750
down a bit up.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.570
And now I'm going to use another effect,

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.160
which is going to be my drop shadow.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.310
Now,

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.230
this drop shadow is not going to be dark over here.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.680
When something is breast,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.370
there will be a light shadow on this.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.670
Over here in this area,

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.950
light is going to fall on this bottom over here.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.880
Let me show you what I mean.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.100
So we are going to have a shadow blood.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.480
We're going to reduce the blur to zero because we don't want it to blur.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.200
Why is going to be fun?

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.080
We wanted to be just along with this lines.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.370
Or here let me zoom in a bit more.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.990
You can see this great line or here.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.710
No,

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.320
we don't want this to be great.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.600
We are going to use a white line over here Now.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.800
If you zoom in,

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.070
you can see there is a white line.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.350
Let's zoom out a bit.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.210
There is a white line or here.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.880
So let me show you.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.710
Let's increases capacity 200% because you cannot view it.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:28.510
Now you can see that we have a wide line over here which is going toe improve our inside

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.000
effect.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.590
So here we have a perfect in set button.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.950
We have used some off in a shadow.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:41.150
You can also use this four and we have one drop shadow,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.800
which is going to be a white light over here on this.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.180
A.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.380
So this is going to complete your insight effect now,

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.870
coming to this treaty effect treaty is very simple.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.830
Let's create an effect.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:53.460
Drop shadow.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.150
It will be and we're going to reduce the blur 20 Now you can see this becomes solid.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.160
No,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:05.020
we are going to use the same color at this button and we're going toe move to this darker

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.900
section or here.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.140
So let's use,

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.730
for example,

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:13.860
this one that is all that is all we need for a three D burden.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.530
You can see if you want to increase its ah,

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.400
treaty nous or its shadow,

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.620
you can increase for example,

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.400
go to six.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.850
You can see now it looks a bit more treaty.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:32.090
So this is how you use different effects when you try to be a different shadows on insects

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.450
effect when you are trying to use fig MMA.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:41.680
Now we're going to study the last two effects which are the slayer blur and background.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.910
If you click on their blood,

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:47.830
you can see this holier is actually blurred and you can change the blood citing for example

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.830
,

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.200
15 or something like that.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.650
So if you want to blur layer,

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.240
it will be something like this,

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.090
which is very easy,

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.850
very easy to understand the concept of this Lear blood.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.480
Now the last thing is,

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.340
we're going to study the background blood.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.030
Now,

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:01.630
for example,

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.980
I want this item and I want everything on top.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:05.260
If it,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:05.730
for example,

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:09.800
I have a rectangle over here and it is hiding this whole screen,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.340
for example.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.390
This is the whole screen,

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.660
so I'm going to add the effect of Bagram Blur.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.640
Now you can see nothing is blurred.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.010
So once you try toe,

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.460
reduce the opacity off your fill over here,

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:21.970
for example,

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.640
I want to be 50%.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:29.200
You can see the background behind this regular is actually blurred.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.110
So if you want to change the blood setting,

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.390
you can increase the blood.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.030
You can see now it is more blurred and,

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:36.650
um,

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.300
not visible,

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:38.850
actually.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.130
So if you try to use the white color,

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:41.590
our hair,

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:42.490
something like this,

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.970
you can see this is actually background blur.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:48.380
So if you try to put some text over here,

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.560
um,

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.020
I like it a lot.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.850
So it is actually going back.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.550
I wanted to be at the top of this background,

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.150
something like this.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.480
So you can see whenever I try to move this this is going toe,

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.650
have a blurred effect.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:06.790
This is going to if you try to move it or scroll it.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.300
It will have some effect like this.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.920
So this effect was first seen in IOS devices?

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.290
I guess so.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.690
This is actually how you can use background.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:20.540
Don't forget to reduce the opacity off your fill color over here because it is not going to

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.300
work without that.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.420
So if you have some setting like this,

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.600
it is not going to work.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:32.380
So try to use 80% 70% 50% or whatever looks good to you.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.430
So these are all the effects I have already showed you.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:42.240
If you have problems understanding these effects to ask me questions and I hope to see you

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.850
soon in the next lesson,

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:44.750
till then,

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.010
take your and by
