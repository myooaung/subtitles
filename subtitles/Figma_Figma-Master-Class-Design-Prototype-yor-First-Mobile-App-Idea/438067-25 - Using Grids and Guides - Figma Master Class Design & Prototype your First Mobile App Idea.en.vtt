00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.990
in this lesson before we dig in tow and start designing something I'm going toe get you

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.350
familiar with some of the concepts which we use a lot of time in designs in design,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.080
your design,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.350
Web design and a lot off designers and courses.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.590
I have seen that they actually miss this,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.200
which is very important,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.800
and that is actually layout grid.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.790
So you always have toe use layout grid whenever you are designing for a mobile screen.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.640
Oh,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.640
our website.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.510
So in this video,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.750
I'm going to explain to you how you can use this layout grade and how you can create

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.160
differently outs when you're designing for mobile and Web sites.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.960
Now,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.280
if you want to see how to create bootstrap grade,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.580
if you are a Web designer,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.560
then you can had to YouTube my channel and you can watch this video.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.450
Bootstrap for groups creation,

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.700
this is a detailed video eight minute video about how to create and Bush a four grade in

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.170
sigma.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.440
So let's get started and get how we can create different type of cribs.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.660
So there are actually two type of careers,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.500
so I'm going to show you one is actually this pig's ill greed.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.460
And 2nd 1 if I try to add over here,

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.270
you can see it is going to add under one.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.270
So default is big,

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.700
so great.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.340
So I'm going toe and 10 pigs ill is the box size,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.650
so you can see if we zoom in over here.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.980
This each box is 10 pigs ill by 10 pixels.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.510
So if we want to change something,

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.060
for example,

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.740
I warned the box going to be a big sell and I won't remove this.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.100
So this is called 88 exit Great.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.910
Which we use a lot of time in Android mobile development and even in our U.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:47.080
S.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.800
Designs.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.720
So if you're designing for iPhones or Android abs,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.900
I think this is a great kid grid.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.040
So if you want to change the color of the Great,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.700
for example,

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.950
I want it to be a bit in this great area,

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.000
something like that.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.020
You can change the color off the screen.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.470
So this is how you create Theis?

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.070
Uh,

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.160
it exhilarated.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.770
Now we're going toe goto another thing,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.380
which is called columns and rows.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.490
So if I'm designing for mobile labs,

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.160
I have to align my things in bigger columns.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.490
So they have us simple layout or follow some layout.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.910
So for alignment,

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.350
I'm going to add some columns so you can see I can add,

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.730
like any number of columns.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.210
But always try toe,

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.810
add the numbers which can be divided by two.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.490
So never add our numbers,

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.430
even use.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.770
Always use even numbers.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.300
So this is how you use the even numbers.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.350
So I'm actually using six right now on this design,

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.030
you can see I can see in the background because it is not.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.200
This is the opacity,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.530
actually.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.020
So if I try to harden it,

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.150
you can see I am unable to see what is behind.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.580
So it is better that I try to use it 10% something like this,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.750
so I can easily design and align my things around.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.770
What hit second is its type,

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.130
so you can either align it in the middle and you can specify the bridge off the columns.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.790
For example,

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.830
I want 80 pixel wide columns,

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.800
something like that.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.220
And Goodall is actually the distance between two columns.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.760
So this is the gutter.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.590
We can use 30 something like that,

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.890
or maybe 24.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.760
It depends on the screen size whatever screen you are trying to use.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.090
So if I try to use 12 over here,

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.380
you can see it is looking something like this.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.100
Now,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.220
you can also save your layout,

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.570
creates.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.520
You can see over here,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.150
here on the upgrade style so I can save it to 12 columns or something like that.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.150
Part of the name here,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.430
cause so something like this.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.450
So I have created agreed style and I can easily applied on any green.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.320
Similarly,

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.990
for example,

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.180
I'm going to create another art board E.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.910
And I'm going to use iPhone eight plus No,

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.900
I'm going to create a clear great and I'm going toe press plus and it created 10 pixel.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.270
I want toe wanted to be like 16 pigs are great,

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.970
for example.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.770
So I I can have a 16.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.960
Pigs are great like this.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.160
Now,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.150
if I try to place my button over here,

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.820
for example,

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.630
I can place my button.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.960
It is going to stick to these areas so you can see this is my butt,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.050
and I'm going to use the roundness off it,

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.170
and I'm going to use some color like this.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.770
And if I tried to align it in the middle.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.590
So right now it's in the middle.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.120
You can also have it to spend two specific boxes like this.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.900
So now you can see this is how actually you try to use the similarly for text.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.950
You can also align your text.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.270
Hello.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.250
And you can align your text to your grid like this.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.380
So these are actually my rules.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.770
So I'm trying to use this 80 hour here for my next.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.240
So this is actually the area I'm trying to use.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.220
So if I try to reduce the capacity 50% so you can see better.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.240
So this is actually the head area or the area it is going to cover.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.050
So if I try to move it over here,

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.690
So if I try to slack this one so you can see this is the boundary around it.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.440
You can also align it in the middle or a job.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.230
But I think it is going toe.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.760
Use this much space.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.570
So this is how you can use this,

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.710
and you can align your different icons on.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.540
Also,

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.860
you can add another grade.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.400
For example,

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.290
if I want to have some columns over here,

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.950
so you can see I can use four columns and I'm going to have them in the center.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.850
And that's your 60.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.350
Let's use more 75.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.140
That's use it.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.350
E.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.000
This looks a bit better for me,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.830
and I'm going to use 24.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.550
Greater size 20 is,

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.090
I think.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.600
Good.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.040
Now you can see I can align meetings with discreet.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.280
So let's like this.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.200
So I have no two grades.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.310
One is my basis Baseline grid or my cred at the back,

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.630
which is a pigs ill,

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.980
Great.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.820
Which is the job,

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:37.500
actually,

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.300
boxes and one is column grid.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.680
So one is,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.150
uh,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:48.240
16 pigs ill I can also use did over here something like that to have more options to align

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.490
thing.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.120
So whatever you are designing on a mobile app,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.940
try toe have something like this.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.280
It is going to guide you.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.950
You can easily align your elements on this along with these lines,

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:02.480
for example,

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.120
like this.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.300
Similarly,

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.200
you can also enable your rulers shift and are and you can,

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.220
uh,

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.050
drag and drop different guidelines over here.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.300
Toe a line things better.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.730
So whenever I try to create another little art board,

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:26.720
you can see this guideline is comin over here because I have drawn it without selecting my

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.680
art board.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.630
So whenever you want to have,

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:35.610
whenever you want to have something which is going toe act as a global guideline,

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.650
you can see see your hair.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.060
So if I tried to select this one right notice electric.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.900
So if I drop,

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.850
draw something on it.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.840
And if I try to create another art board,

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.590
for example,

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:48.420
like this one,

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.050
you can see there is no guideline over here.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.880
Even if I try to use the same art board I have used before.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:01.860
So you can see there is no guideline because I have selected and I have drawn this

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.070
guideline for this specific screen.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.930
Now,

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.970
if you want to have a global guideline,

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:08.840
for example,

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.800
I create another art board over here,

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.880
which is going to be iPhone Pro X.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.550
Let's create the same size Ivan eight plus.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.100
Now you can see these are the boat.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.650
Art boards are the same size,

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.050
but if I want to have and ah guideline that is going to be global,

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.180
you have tow selectee selected,

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.990
and if you try to drag and drop it on inside this area,

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.050
it is going to be present on this one.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:40.680
So what we have to do is we have to drag it and drop it in the middle area,

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.780
which is not the common area,

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.750
which is an empty space which is not the 80 off any art board or frame.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:53.790
So I'm going to drop it over hair and you can see it is present or in all the three art

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:54.230
boards.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:09:01.810
So this is how you actually use this global these global guidelines to align all your

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:02.350
elements.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:02.960
For example,

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.810
if I have maybe a bottom navigation so it will be aligned to this.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:09.640
So if I have a top navigation,

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:15.840
it will be in this section so you can divide your whole mobile app or your Web design

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.750
whatever you have,
