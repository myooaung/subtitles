00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.710
in this lesson.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.850
We're going to create this overly screen in fig MMA and where I'm going to show you how toe

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.590
pop up this overlay and hide it when someone submit reviews.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.090
So we're going to go back to where we left.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.870
This is the section where we left and now you're going to create an overlay screen or here

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.870
,

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.080
which is going to be a fight.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.210
So we are going toe,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.290
create a new frame and it will be our own size.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.000
It will be.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.820
It will be 328 pixel vied because we wanted inside this.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.870
So let me show you.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.150
So if I dragon you can see over here you can see it is going to be inside this container.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:56.050
So let's use 330 and the height will be 400 70.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.250
This is just and you can see estimation and we wanted to be rounded corners.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.250
So I'm going to use four over here.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.210
You can use increase more,

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.260
for example it,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.790
for example,

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.950
like this that is going to work as well.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.450
Also,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.480
if you want toe,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.530
add some shadow,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.450
it's up to you.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.450
But right now I'm going to use some text over here.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.550
Log in as,

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.850
um,

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.710
mud.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.280
Okay,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.750
so the killer we're going to use is going to win this one.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.420
So this is going to be a link color that I'm already logged in from top.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.580
I'm goingto have 30 from the left.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.910
I'm going to have 20 less.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.020
Keep it pointed.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.050
Something like this.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.650
Then moving down.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.990
We're going to have select rating,

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.150
so we will show the user some fading many over here.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.750
We're going to use the action button.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.240
And the color will be this dark,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.610
greenish black separating.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.890
And we're going to use the same,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.850
uh,

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.350
this Starwood here that she was the star.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.730
Let's based it over here.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.860
The star rating.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.760
And now,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.370
actually user warships Electric.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.400
So we're going to increase its size.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.290
There's lock it.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.250
Let's use skill over here.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.250
And I think this one is good.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:41.020
I think we also can increase the distance between them up it like this.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.120
So I'm going to select holding shift key,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.770
and I'm going to use this.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.650
Distribute horizontal spacing,

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.860
horizontal spacing.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.190
So this is this Looks better.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.320
We want to have some separation between them so users can easily manage to know that,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.950
though.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.050
Slack this reading.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.850
So let's have 14 between these.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.480
Excuse this again,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.950
and I am going to used right review,

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:29.660
and then we're going to have text box over here in this textbook.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.650
She was that is going to ride his or her review.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.790
There's a lying all of them on them on the left,

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.380
like this.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.150
Okay,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.780
so I'm going to reduce the height of this one because we also need a burden.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.450
Were here,

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.740
so I'm going to use again.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.040
Four exist.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.560
Excuse this or here.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.370
The worse.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.950
We're going to use reverse sightings over here.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.550
Let's add some stroke around.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.450
It is going to be this.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.350
It's used a lighter color like this one.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.430
This looks better.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.200
Now we need a but and we're going to go toe assets,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.750
and we're going to use over simple button over here,

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.950
and let's change size.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.110
Okay,

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.650
so we need to set this button in our,

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.930
um,

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.340
style guide and next see what is happening over here.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.470
This is in the middle.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.740
Uh,

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.060
hi.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.100
Out of word.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.240
And,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.420
um uh,

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.890
it is going to stay in the center and at the bottom.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.210
So let's see now,

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.690
jacket now in the design.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:53.650
Okay.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.680
So just just looking.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.950
Okay.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.150
So we just need to change the pardon color over here.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.000
We're going to go with our hopes.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.450
Uh,

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.470
so we're going to go with our solid color That is going to be about this bluish color.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.150
So I'm going to use this one this time.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.850
So I wanted to be closer to this.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.050
And we have We want to have some space at the bottom.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.320
You can also increase this frame hard.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.190
This is going to be our over lips.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.730
So let me show you what is happening over here.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.950
So this is you can see this is set to scale.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.350
We've wanted to be at the left and at the top.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:40.330
We don't want to Skill swelling going to move them it right now.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.750
And this looks crete.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.450
Now,

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.950
some vertical spacing.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.690
Okay,

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:47.460
so this is good.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.940
30.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.180
This is 21.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:58.850
This is going to be 20 tardy for D.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.240
So we have this,

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.850
uh,

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.150
designed.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.380
This is going to be our overlay.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:15.390
And this text is goingto be submit.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.250
Submit a review?

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.140
No,

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.110
on the screen.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.610
When someone tries to click on this ready to eat now,

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.450
Button.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.090
We're going to show them this overly.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.180
So once they have finished everything,

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.500
they have prepared the dish.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.050
We want them to leave some review over here.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.990
So to do that,

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.990
we're going to link this,

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.990
But until this early.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.150
So we're going to go to prototype and that soon out.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.060
And we're going to link this burden to this and on tap.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.730
We are not going toe Never get do.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.780
But we're going to use this open overly.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.430
So in this section or here,

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.790
this is going to be overly.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:58.650
This is overlay.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:05.660
We are trying toe use and there are options like center dob left.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.340
We're going to use it at bottom bottom center.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:15.190
Let's use this bottom center and we're going to use move in and it is going to move in from

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.350
the bottom like this.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:24.250
Next use 400 milliseconds and let's dust this out in our app.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.070
This is the burden.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.220
So if I have pressed ready to eat,

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.430
you can see or hear.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.490
This is going toe poor book like this,

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.550
but we need a background.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.070
So,

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:35.750
um,

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.330
on this selection,

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:37.810
we're here.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.750
So here is our injection this interaction.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:46.030
We want it to close when clicking outside.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.550
We're going toe also add behind overly.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.100
So I wanted to be 50% and let's see what happens now.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.010
So this is the actually effect.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.270
So if we click outside So now if we click on this button,

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.920
you can see this is how it pops how this is how it drops down.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.800
So also you can click,

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:11.350
You can use the submit button and you can link it back This main screen that thank you

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.250
Would something like that Or maybe start going something new,

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.930
something like that.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.950
So you can never get all you can navigate it back to this screen.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.250
It's up to you.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:25.050
So let's test it now.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:27.150
And if we click over here,

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.260
Okay.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:34.750
So you need to see that it is going toe.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.650
Go back.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.800
It is going to move out now,

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:43.660
and it will be It Will is in his outlets.

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:44.750
Use is out.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:56.050
So I'm not sure why it is giving me a jerk when it goes back.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:03.050
Smart and image met in years is in out,

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.360
move in,

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.650
move out actually,

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.550
so it is going to move out.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.410
I'm using move in.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.150
That is why it is doing this jerk.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.010
Okay,

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.950
that's that's that's squared.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.650
So it is moving out very swiftly.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.040
That is good.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:27.300
So I think this is going to end up our journey with this app.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.030
I have left few screens because I think that was a reparative work.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:34.310
I wanted to show you this overly How it goes out hose,

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.630
move.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:41.190
It moves in how we do the any mission off this selection over here value died.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.540
How?

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:47.250
We show these such results and all this different stuff.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.050
So I hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:54.510
If you have any suggestions any you want to learn anything from me,

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.660
you can always ask me.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.880
You can contact me.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.950
I'm open to questions.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.250
Don't forget to ask me questions.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.190
Whenever you are struck.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.680
I'm here for you.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.050
Let's move on and learn something new.
