WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.180
Now you can see we have created our force,

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.350
these major screens and this intro or log in screen.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.190
And we are in a position that we can add some prototyping over here.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.040
Now you can see all these four screens.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.730
They are 940 exile high.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.650
I have left some space at the bottom.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.060
So if you look at it over here So actually,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.940
I have left the space because this navigation and this background whole content is going to

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.490
move.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.420
So once we move this page up,

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.250
this is going to take its place over here.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.390
So it is going to be over here like this,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.310
so no,

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.750
you can see this is this.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.050
This is why I have left some space at the bottom.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.350
Okay,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.930
so now we're going toe link these screens,

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.050
and we're going to move to this prototype over here.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.250
And first thing is that this is going to be our main screen.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.480
So we are going toe grab it from here,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.180
and we're going to link it to this one so you can see this play button.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.400
This is this shows that this is going to be the first screen now We can also add some

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.760
something over here.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.270
For example,

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.950
group all these command G and let's call it Logan Group.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:37.810
And we can also link this to this one and on tap we're going to never get toe this mean

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.580
means and it is not going to be instant.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.880
We're going to use smart,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.520
animate,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.350
and we are going to use ease in and ease out for 400 milliseconds.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.520
So this is going to be the fact we're going to use similarly for this one.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.820
Okay,

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.650
so one thing they have to mention is that whenever you try to use any icon,

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.970
there will be a hit target area.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.540
For that I gon hit area means that we have to design something at the background,

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.740
which is going to be at the capable area that is accessible to the finger.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.190
So if you have a very small capable area or hit target,

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.790
your finger is not going toe touch this icon easily.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.580
So use a real keep on touching this,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.050
and it will not work.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.620
So what we're going to do is,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.850
um,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.350
let's go inside this group.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.460
Let's create a rectangle over here like this.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.990
I really hate this,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.550
um,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.090
functionality that I want one Simon in a group.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.750
It should create this rectangle inside that group rather than reading it at the top.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.650
So I am going to drag it to this arrow left and for the sect angle,

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.580
it is going to be,

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.480
uh,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.980
damp idea for this error left one.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.740
Just go to design and just Jack this Inject this clip content now,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.470
the step area is actually going toe be transparent.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.550
0% transparency,

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.440
because we are just going to use it for prototyping.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.130
So once we have the stab media and we want to,

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.720
you know,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.150
based it in all the other groups too.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.200
So I'm going to do the same for this one.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.250
So I am going to have a tab section over here.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.750
Tap it yet for this one,

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.170
Do and I'm going Teoh,

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.480
use some DeBlieux like this.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.320
Uh,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.220
let's use something like this and let's move it inside.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.350
This funnel This is also into court app.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.950
Yeah,

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.650
and let's change this clip content.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.490
I'm off this if you have it.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.100
So you have to check if there's a frame around your icon and you have this clip content

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.590
this is going to be a pain in your head.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.940
So,

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:16.850
um,

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.650
Tab area is going to be transparent,

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.550
so I'm going to change transparency to 0%.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.000
So we have funnel and arrow icons over here,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.620
and we're going to slack thes Kamar and see both off them.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.950
And we're going toe,

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.250
um,

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.760
Biest them or here like this.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.690
So let's,

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.900
like,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.730
board off them,

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.580
dilute them.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.720
And I am goingto hopes dislike this based time we're here,

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.870
they're going to be based in the place so less next to lead these in the seconds like this

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.140
command,

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.260
we your control v,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.850
to paste them similarly for this one.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.310
We are doing it because we haven't made these components.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.950
If we had made these components,

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.750
we just had to add in the component section.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:18.750
But I think these kind of others actually have going to work anyhow.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.710
So here we have them.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.850
Now we're going to link these sections back,

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.990
so we're going to go to prototype and open this and select the stab India and we are going

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.180
to link it back.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.140
Uh,

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.630
this is going to navigate to,

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.880
and we're not going to use smart animate,

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.350
but we're going to use,

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.380
um,

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.410
move out or it is going to be in destruction.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.570
So this screen is going to move like this,

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.260
and this is going to come back similarly for this one again,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.980
We're going to do the same thing.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.550
Settings that already the same.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:03.840
So we have linked bag and we have linked this log in tow.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.670
This D's for this main screen.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.350
Okay,

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.250
so let's test this one.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.990
Okay?

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.170
So we have the screen to stab it,

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.150
and you can see the effect Yum xyz come going up.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.730
This is actually smart.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:27.650
Any minute you can see moving out and emitting like that.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.390
Now,

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.370
the next thing we're going to do is we're going to add capable areas for all these.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:45.180
So what I have to do is I have to add ah adaptable area tab area in all of these.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.150
So we I think we should have created this from the start.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.120
But,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.920
um,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.520
this is how I wanted to show you that if you don't create the stab target,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.520
which a lot off actually,

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.350
and designers miss whenever the teach their classes.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.800
So this is going to be tap target.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.230
And,

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.850
um,

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.730
this is going to be 0% what this means.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:21.260
Then we have the same time it duplicated going to be four Sellards like this in the same.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:21.650
Yeah.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:26.670
Then we have Come on D on.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:31.550
We are going to go to deserts this section We're here.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:38.150
Then we again Come on d and do the same for this one over here.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:43.160
So these are the tap joggers for all these.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.550
So this is going to be used in our prototype.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.400
These are the hit target for fingers.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:55.180
So if your fingers if you have this step target very small fingers are going to miss this

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:55.790
Stargate,

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.060
and it will have some problems.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:06.130
So this is how I'm trying to show you how you are going to do the user experience or

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.850
improve the usability off the app?

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:08.980
No.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.750
I'm going to add all these tap targets in all these or here.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:29.820
Now,

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.670
I have created all the tap targets.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:32.950
Why?

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:40.040
I didn't make component because I have to move this whole over here and what they're So I

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:45.270
just wanted to show you how to create these tap targets and why they are necessary for

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:45.960
prototyping.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.550
So now we're going to move to this prototype section or here.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:56.640
And for this means this is going to be meals for the sellers.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.580
You can see now the staff target.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.890
We are going to move it to salads over here.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.090
And it is going to be,

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.020
uh,

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.140
smart any mere.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.160
And it is going to be easy in and out.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:15.450
So these are the same settings were going to use for every off every one of this.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.600
So this one is going to move,

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.870
so this deserves this.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:25.350
Healthy is going toe move to the last one handy.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.450
Next.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:31.130
Zoom out so you can easily see that similarly,

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:35.990
we have this Sellers Sorry means and it is going to go back to me years.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:41.060
Dessert hoops Dessert is goingto go to desert.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:45.400
Healthy is going to kowtow Healthy similarly all of peace.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.710
Now you can see I have linked them.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:56.720
Now let's test this out and see how this navigation menu actually works and looks and feels

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:02.560
like So let's get started and see what we can preferred.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.450
I've with Sigma.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.690
Let's give it some time to Lord,

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.810
it is taking a lot of time to lower the same it.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.650
So we're going to go ahead and see our prototype overhead.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:19.350
So some of the images are not loading,

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:29.290
but you can see the effect overhead right now for GMA is actually operating their service.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:33.750
That is why we are having this slow slowness in this,

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:34.310
um,

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.790
this animation and this prototype,

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:39.200
I hope you won't mind it,

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.970
but this is actually how we are going to create this,

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:44.560
uh,

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.850
section or here.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:47.910
Similarly,

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:56.840
we can click this and go back go or hair healthy their school from healthy two meals Desser

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:56.840
,

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.380
Sellards and means.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.040
So this is how you actually prototype and link your screens?

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:08.090
Make sure the positions off this text and everything is the same because you can see over

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.420
here.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.850
If I try to click over here,

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.880
it feels like it is moving.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:18.650
Some glitches are there in fig mass prototypes or don't need to be very too much because

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:25.080
you have to show your developers that this is how it will look like and there are standard

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.320
controls and programming that are going to facilitate this movement.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.980
So I hope you have enjoyed this upto up till this.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.020
I hope you have learned a lot about fig,

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:37.290
Mom,

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.940
we're going to create next screens in the next lessons.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.170
So let's move on to the next lesson.
