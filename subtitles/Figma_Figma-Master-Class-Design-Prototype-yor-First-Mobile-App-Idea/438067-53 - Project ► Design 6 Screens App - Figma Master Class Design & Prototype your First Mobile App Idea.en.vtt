00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
Now you have learned everything I have showed you how I designed this whole app.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.190
Now it is your time to create any app.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.340
You can clear the recipe app if you want,

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.200
or you can create any app your own idea.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.760
I'm not limiting you.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.690
So create an app with at least 6 to 7 screens.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.600
At least six screens that are going to transition.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.470
They have some transition effects.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.750
They have some movement effects,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.880
popping up effects.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.230
They have some overlays that goes out with some time eso create this.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.560
So I'm going to show you at least this log in screen.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.020
Then we have this Minsk in there.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.680
We have some transitions and then some screen with some movement toe another screen,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.070
which is a single object or single file or single record.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.050
Whatever you call it,

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.810
then we have the search builders something.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.260
I want you to create something like this.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.770
You can see this effect moving out,

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.510
moving in.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.320
So I want you to create some effect like this.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.680
Also,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.810
screens moving up.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:11.210
Record your findings are recipe found or your records phone whatever.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.050
Popping up one by one from Bordeaux and bottom.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.570
So this is the assignment I want from you.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.430
So start reading it now.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.810
At least six screens.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.430
If you want to increase the screens,

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.810
I am limiting the number of screens.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.450
I am giving you last numbers because I think that time should not be wasted.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.560
If you are creating,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.520
if you are,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.680
you can have.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.760
If you have a lot of time and you want to create like,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.650
10 screens,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.860
go ahead.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.920
I have no problem but six screens,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.710
at least so I can do different transitions.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.260
How you move from one scheme to another one and have you used the tap your target area,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.460
which is a very important user experience.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.850
Point on usability Point of view.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.250
A lot of designers that don't use that tap urban area,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.280
so it is going to miss hit most of the time.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.980
So this is your assignment.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.220
Create a full fledged AP 6 to 7 screens or 10 screens,

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.650
whatever you want to have,

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.180
and show me all the transitions,

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.000
how everything works around this app.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.230
I would love to see your ideas I'm reading for your assignment,

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.250
So start creating it now.
