00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.990
in this lesson,

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.450
we are going to learn on drag in traction.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.420
So if I select this one,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.780
you can see in this interaction we have on tap on drag.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.770
So this is going to be used a lot of time.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.700
And when you are designing or creating some interaction or prototype,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.950
so on drag is actually going toe in tracked when you try to drag some object.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.590
So for that,

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.850
we're going to create,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.020
uh,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.060
and rectangle here.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.660
So just think that this is an e mail.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.760
So you are using,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.540
actually,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.770
for example,

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.780
you're using Gmail,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.670
and this is an email over here.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.450
So there's a tax your hair.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:56.860
Let's put some text no shoes on this background to be like this.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.420
So here we have an email.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.750
Just think that this is an email I just received.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.150
Let's use over here to minutes ago.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:20.350
I assume that I have just received this email and this is my real let's like this and

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.150
command g to control a group.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.850
We're a group.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.840
Okay,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.660
so we have this squalid email.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.150
Okay,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.900
So just our email over here.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.480
Exchange your sculler to something else,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.150
shoot this one.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.620
Okay,

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.970
so we have received just an email and I want to drag it.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.900
And I want over here my controls,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.350
Toby delete or maybe moved to some folder or something like that.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.940
So I'm going to use to Elemental.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.890
Here's one is going to be this one,

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.400
so I This one is going to move like this.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.120
Okay,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.380
so let's copy this and placed it over here.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.300
Control C,

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.090
Command V.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.250
And here we have the same email over here.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.490
But over here,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.650
we want it to be dragged to this location.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.650
Drag to this location,

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.570
and we are going to use another.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.860
So we are going to create another 10 here,

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.980
84 height.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.550
Just combining with this like this,

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.160
and we're going to use some other color,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.710
like like this.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.050
And let's move this a little bit more.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.650
We're here.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.680
This Okay,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.280
So this is our drag state.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.150
If we want to add some,

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.780
you can see some icons,

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.600
lips at them,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.690
shift control,

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.250
backslash I pawn.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.050
I'm going to use material icons,

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.270
and it is going to appear or hair,

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.950
so I'm going to use delete.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.970
So here we have delete.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.230
Excuse this,

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.760
and we have still eat Let's make it inside.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.650
This helps.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.750
Let's drag it and use it over here.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.410
Yes.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.550
So let's What is the Here we have this list,

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.840
Mr Bean.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.260
Image dragged and normal,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.700
so I can easily see what is happening.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.430
I am I never to see what is happening over here.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.390
So here we have this factor.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.000
Let's move it over here with this rectangle.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.800
Let's delete just here.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.650
We have this specter above this rectangle change its color white.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.810
And next,

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.350
you some Dexter along with it.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.060
So these these are just few adjustment.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.270
I want toe tell you weigh and how we can use it.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:17.450
And what is actually the use case off this option so we can have more options over here.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.650
Let's just use keep this over here right now.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:30.280
Just dilute and select all of them.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.950
Come on,

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:31.610
G.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.740
And this is going to be our drag actions Escorted drag actions.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.150
Now,

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.560
if you want to use this,

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.150
we also want this group Toby over here,

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.210
and we're going to position it.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.750
Come on.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.250
See?

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.150
It is going to be over here,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.840
but it is going to be outside off this section or here.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.750
This is going to be over here outside off this frame.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.900
So now we are going to go to prototype.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.410
So we have bought these this email and drag actions.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.320
We have both these in both off these frames.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.790
Both of these are boards.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.740
Just a change off the position.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.290
So we have this drag state and this is actually normal state.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.800
Now,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.190
we're going to prototype this.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.080
First,

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.000
we're going to select this element over here email because our drag action is going to

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.130
happen on this leader.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:38.890
So we're going to link it to this over here drag state and on tap rather than on that we're

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.340
going to use on drag.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.620
So on drag,

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.170
it is going toe navigate toe this drag state,

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.010
and we're going to use smart anyway,

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.470
it and easier is out.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.840
That is,

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.620
I'm going to use.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.420
So let's use 4 50 milliseconds and let's see how this happens.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:02.920
Now you can see we have this email over here and we're going to perform over drag action

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.280
and you can see once I'm I have dragged.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.550
You can see this delete option or here.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.260
So we haven't created the drag back over here.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.570
So we're going to link that now.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.670
So now you're going to select I did this or this,

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.890
so we're going to select this one and,

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:22.510
um,

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.400
that's used on drag.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.650
And it will move toe,

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:34.760
never get to normal state and we're going to use the same settings overhead.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.990
So let's go back.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.860
And it's dragged this like this and this this and this.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.980
Similarly,

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.850
if you want to have this whole Dragnea,

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:55.240
you can also use this and you can also use the same action over here on drag.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.830
So if you missed this a year and you use this area,

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.670
same thing is going to happen.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:11.980
You can see So right now I think our this one is very close.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.450
The prototype.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.010
So this is actually the drag action.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:23.500
So you can also have one more screen where this actually is deleted.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.050
So once you've drag and then tap on this over here,

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.840
it is going toe.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.050
Remove this email and move all other emails up.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.540
So for this exercise,

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:40.910
I wanted to tell you how to use on drag action and how you can use that when you are trying

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:47.240
to create some prototype in fig MMA now Let's talk about simple scroll actions.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.690
Hearts under school and vertical school.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.380
You already have started vertical school.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.170
It is very easy.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.730
Your screen is length here than your normal screen.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.560
But what about horizontal school,

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.270
for example?

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.850
I have,

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.020
like,

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.750
three boxes were here,

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:08.670
and this is outside.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:14.450
So what I'm going to do is I want them to be screw allowable.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:18.750
So right now you can see this is outside off this whole frame.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.230
So how I can do that?

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:22.650
How I can scroll these,

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:23.320
For example,

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.600
I have this one over here like this.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.790
It is going out,

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.760
so I have to drag it inside this fame.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.410
So this is our normal over here,

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:34.780
and we have four different.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:42.430
You can see a four different frames over here for different rectangles or maybe images Or

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.390
maybe anything.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.350
Um,

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.390
you can think off.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:50.320
It could be your recipes or anything.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.030
So if we have four of these,

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.300
and I want them to be dragged herbal,

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.750
so whenever someone opens this app,

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.950
they can easily scroll them.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.200
So right now,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.200
if I go over here,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.460
you can see Let's,

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.150
um,

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:09.680
replay this and we have it over here,

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:09.910
right?

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.000
now you can see on the dissection is happening.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.230
So this is actually the drag tribe is over here,

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:20.810
but I want them to be screw level so very easy.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.210
I'm going toe select all of them.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.780
I'm going to use them inside a frame,

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.550
so I'm going to use frame selection.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.250
This is my friend.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:34.660
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to reduce the size off my friends a window sizes,

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.250
actually.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.810
What is 500?

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.670
I'm going to use 400 instead.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.250
So this is going to be my friend.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:47.720
And I'm going to use clip content like this like this.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.370
That's used Z over here like this.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:57.050
And I'm going to use 400 for the size like this.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:04.510
So this looks better now for any frame you can select providing options.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.620
So once you have selected this frame,

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.500
you can goto prototype over here.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.920
So this frame is selected.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.610
You can go over here No schooling,

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:17.680
and we want to have horizontal scrolling behavior for this overflow behavior.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.250
So this is actually going to happen over here,

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:26.220
so you can also set it to for this whole art board so you can have ours under scrolling

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.190
vertical and hours into schooling.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:29.360
It's up to you.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.080
So once this is set,

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.440
you can easily drag them like this.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.650
You can see really nice.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:38.450
Very easy.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:39.600
I mean,

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.740
I think I should explain it a little bit more.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.390
Let's use the window.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:44.670
Verdes,

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:44.990
Toby.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.450
300 hopes,

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:47.250
nor 30.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.930
I want the framework to be 300.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:53.190
Excuse this.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.120
So here we have the framework.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.450
It I'm going to move the frame.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:02.500
Um 60.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:12.650
This So I'm going to move the content inside the frame like I like this.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:13.880
Okay,

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.310
so frames actually of indoor,

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.050
it is going toe work as a window.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:20.430
And now when I try to use this,

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.380
you can see where Here.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.420
Very nice.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.430
Very nice drag and school over here.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:30.130
It's actually we left our one element over here,

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.650
which is our green.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:32.850
I was doing OK,

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:34.430
so it is very far away.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.980
That is why this is happening.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:44.550
So let's use all of them and you study up to have an equal of it and distances between them

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.550
.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.310
Let's like these.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.970
Okay,

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.760
so this is this is really cool.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.460
Very nice.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.200
Very nice.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:57.680
So this is actually how you can prototype and enable horizontal scrolling or vertical

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.800
schooling and use frames for school herbal elements like these.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:08.510
So I think this is going to help you a lot in your prototyping when he was using sigma

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.490
these air on the basics I have covered.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:16.370
I don't think you need more than this right now to create beautiful interactions.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.700
If you have any questions,

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:18.950
you can always ask me.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.950
See you in the next lesson.
