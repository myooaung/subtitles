00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.170
now in this lesson,

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.650
we're going to go into a bit more detail about this constraints over here.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.070
So country constraints are basically limitations.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.480
You can apply on a group or a component,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.850
So let me share with you how you can do that.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.790
So,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.450
for example,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.010
we have created these components in the previous lesson.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.660
And let's move toe there,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.150
master component over here.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.960
So master component is actually the one that you are going to change and apply these

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.030
constraints or here.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.380
So once you click on this icon to expand it,

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.940
you can see we will have constraints over here for each element over here.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.130
So,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.350
like this this ad over here,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.860
for example,

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.550
let me show you.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.440
Actually,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.130
if I try to expand it,

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.110
let's expand this and you can see how this is expanding.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.350
I don't want to extend that this button experiment like this.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.350
So this text is not in the middle.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.880
This is actually stretched,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.520
and this is really wrong.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.460
So let's go back.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.440
Controller Kamanzi And we want I'm actually develop clicking.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.200
So once you click,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.050
you're going to slack.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.150
This one you can idol press control or command toe directly slack this one,

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.980
so you don't have to double click or click twice or tries to go to this element.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:24.740
Just click.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.370
I hold your controller command key and kick over him.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.600
So now you can see we have sat over here scale and scale in both directions.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.950
So it is going to scale.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.770
We don't want it to be scaled.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.070
So we're going to fix it to the right over here,

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.250
right corner,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.110
and so the top.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.900
So it is going to be fixed over here.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.950
We don't want this button toe expand in destruction.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.860
We just wanted to be expanding in the horizontal direction,

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.870
nor the vertical one.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.990
So this is said so.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.550
If I tried toe expand it,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.340
you can see No,

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.950
it is.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.500
It is fixed in this corner that is scored.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.970
Now you can see this.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.440
This dollar noise not fixed.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.200
So we're going to fix this problem.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.310
So control or hold,

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.350
command your control and click over here,

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.250
and we're going to pin it on the left.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.950
And let's use this center.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.960
Uh,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.050
they're left and center.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.080
That is good.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.810
So you can also do the same life left and bottom or top.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:30.890
That would be good to.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.170
So you can also been it like this.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.770
So once we have said this,

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.990
you are going to see what is what is going to happen if we expanded.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.770
You can see the down or no is at the same point where it should be.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.760
And if I try to expand from here,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.150
you can see this is the behavior I want to have in this Spartan.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.890
Now the most difficult part of scaling or having constraints is for the background off

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:58.260
desperate.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.860
And so if you click on a slack despondent,

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.440
it is good.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.320
You can expand it in four directions,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.950
but we don't want to expand it in destruction.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.410
So right now I think it's not good.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.810
So what we are going to do is we're going to slack this background overhead.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.210
This is actually it is set to scale and scale.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.790
So this is the default behavior.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.000
What we want is actually we want scale in destruction.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.450
You can see you hear the annual it is contracting in the horizontal direction from left

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.990
right,

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.200
and this is the top to bottom skills.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.370
So we're going to select it toe Saturday top and in destruction we're going tohave skill.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.560
So let me show you how it is going to behave.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.350
So you have to dissect it because you are right now in this background,

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.780
so de selected and select this again this component.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.110
And if I try to,

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.810
you can see if I try to increase the height,

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.970
you can see it will stay the same.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.690
It is not going toe expand or scale and destruction.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.700
But if I try to expand it from here,

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.030
it is going to expand in destruction both off the sections.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.470
So this is the behavior I've wanted with my component.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.760
So this is how you can apply different constraints on your buttons on your different drop

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.560
down arrows,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.100
menus,

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.270
drop down menus.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.330
You're taxed,

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.650
their alignments and everything you can see over here.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.510
This is my abs,

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.860
which we're going to build at the end of this course,

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.820
and you can see if I go to style.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.230
Guys,

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.320
we have a lot of component Shal here,

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.450
so you can see I have these components over here where we have this icon and these icons

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.050
have been left and top.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.860
You can see similarly,

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.090
this one has been to left and top toe.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.430
Although I think it should be over here like this,

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.550
right and job anyhow.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.950
So this is how actually everything is working over here.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:51.410
Similarly,

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.610
if you go to this,

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.020
uh,

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.910
this one and if you click on this addle,

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.720
you can see it is right and top.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.750
So it is going to stick over here If I try Toe Jane the size that's change size of this one

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.750
.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.050
So you can see it is going to stay at the same area where I wanted to be,

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.990
So you can see it is going to be at the right top in the same position.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.790
So this is how actually you apply constraints.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:21.400
Similarly,

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.160
if you look at the search recipe,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.840
this is going to be the same.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.190
Like you can see over here.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.480
It should be over here,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.820
actually,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.850
right and top.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:36.450
So this is how you use constraint in your components and apply them to have better

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.750
expanding or better flexible components.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.020
I hope you have learned a lot in this lesson.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.960
Let's move on to the next lesson.
