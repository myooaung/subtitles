00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.830
in this video,

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.180
we're going to learn the differences between groups and frames and ventures.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.670
You should use frames instead of groups.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.850
Now,

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.290
if you look at it over here,

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.660
you can see this is a group.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.690
This is an illustration.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.150
So if I try to scale it,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.370
you can see it is going to scale the whole group Along with that,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.150
you can see when I click over here,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.810
there is a blue boundary around it.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.000
It is actually its bones.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.530
So this is actually the boundary off this.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.400
It also grows when you try toe scale any group.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.530
So this is a group off illustration.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.580
These are different factors.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.370
If I try to increase the size,

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.220
you can see the bones are actually moving.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.600
And if you look at it over here on the constraint size,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.580
it's a skill and ah,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.320
it is actually going to scale.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.440
It is a default.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.520
You can say constraints.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.150
Option off any group.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.800
So now if I try to select,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.950
for example,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:10.350
let's say right and let's say top now you can see what is happening over here.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.050
Every group have constrained according toe,

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.740
the nearest parent frame so you can see If you look at it over here in this whole hierarchy

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.630
on the left side,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.690
beer and frame for this group is actually our art board.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.730
Now let's see what happens if I try to increase the size often Art Board.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.310
You can see this constraint is actually working for this art board,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.820
so it is staying with the right and left off our board.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.720
Now let's see what happens when we never have said these constraints.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:55.650
So mostly whenever you try to import any graphic inside your phlegm a file or are bored,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.120
the same thing happens.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.610
For example,

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.590
if you have a group like this and it's an illustration now,

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.930
you can see if I try to increased elect,

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.740
zoom out and try to increase the size of this.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.740
You can see what is happening.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.750
The size off the illustration is actually getting bigger with this frame,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.930
so let's next.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.630
Let's see the size its size its size is 573 by 5 31 Now,

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.200
if I try to resize it,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.330
you can see now it is 80 98 806 Now,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.250
if you don't want this behavior and you don't want it to scale like this.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.690
Next.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.490
Go back to every wire.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.470
Okay,

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.100
so now if you want to a wide this behavior,

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.270
you want your icons to stay where they are.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.950
You have to use frames because frames are going toe.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.030
Let's let me show you.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.760
Actually.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.350
So here we have thes Let's frame it Right.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.600
Click and frame selection.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.750
Now you conceive.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.230
We have two frames over here.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.280
One is this illustration are sorry.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.660
This practice frame,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.750
this is actually the art board.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.690
And then we have another frame.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.530
Which is this frame?

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.520
One inside it.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.790
So let's call it options.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.420
Now you can see we have frame inside a frame.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.580
No.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.250
If we try to change the size of this practice frame,

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.920
you can see the size off this object.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.390
It wa 618 by 2 25 No,

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.850
If I tried toe again,

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:43.960
resize it.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.470
You can see.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.560
Let me make it bigger and show you what is the difference?

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.450
Size stays the same.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:57.810
So this is the behavior I need when I have elements inside a container and I want to go and

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.520
I want them to be to stay on the same area where they are and I don't want them to resize.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.100
Then you have toe Always use our frame.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.100
Otherwise you will have these problems that icons will keep on growing.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.810
For example,

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.280
let's,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.380
uh,

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.480
removed this frame.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.250
I am pressed controlled shift or command shift G toe on group this frame and now I'm going

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.970
to group them.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.380
Now you can see they are in a group.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.500
So let's call this group options.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.910
And if I try to now the size is the same.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.590
618 by 2 25 Now if I try to use the size,

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.780
you can see what is happening.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.170
These icons are going out and everything is messing up because I don't want them.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.640
Do you know scale?

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.400
If I try to click on this icon double click,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.420
you can see these are the constraints.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.490
So these are the constraints,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.190
scale and scale.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.980
So it is going toe get smaller and smaller.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.350
As I resize this so you can see Let me show,

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.930
you know.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.960
So these icons are you can see now there 44 wait our journey.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.980
They were like 72 pixels wide.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.300
Now you can see this is the behavior we don't want.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:16.050
So the basic difference between group and frame is that group is going to have constraint.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.340
Ledgett toe the parent frame.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:27.130
The parent frame will be mostly it's art board and for the frame we don't have such

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.740
problems.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.860
Frame is going toe.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.990
Act as an independent container or a window and everything be aligned according to that

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.030
second thing is that whenever we have a frame,

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.950
for example,

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:39.850
Yeah,

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.450
that's G,

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.010
I guess hopes we have frame,

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.990
friend selection all control and G.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.200
Okay,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.510
so we have this fame.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.950
There is another option which is clipped contents.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.670
If you want to create something,

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.890
it is going toe act as a window.

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.010
This frame is going to act as a window.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.650
So if you try toe extend,

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.990
for example this icon outside of this,

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:13.480
you can see now it is slipping outside because we have defined the Britain hide off the

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.050
frame.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.630
But if you try toe,

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.710
do something with this illustration,

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.180
for example,

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.810
this was a group and for example,

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.330
I have this vector or this arm and I try to extend it.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.320
You can see nothing is clipped and one more thing you can see If I try to click over here,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.890
the boundary is actually automatically adjusting.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.820
The bones are automatically adjusting.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.830
This is actually the feature off group.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.060
So if you have something like this you want,

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.470
you don't want to clip the content,

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.940
you can use this group.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.120
And if I go to this one now,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.130
you can see we have some icon over.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.800
Harris says resized to fit life.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.850
I try to click over here,

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:01.180
you can see now the size off the frame has been adjusted to the clip contract.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.450
So it is actually trying to find where is the boundary off this content?

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:12.910
So this is a feature off frames frames have a specific height and read everything outside

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.240
of them is going to be clipped.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.730
But groups,

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.340
they're not going to behave like that.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.450
They have nothing to clip.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.160
They will have auto boundary.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:28.410
They will increase the bones off your elements inside them according to their return high.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.740
So whenever you try to change the width and height,

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.450
it is going to change the boundary off this group.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:44.370
So this is actually how I try to suggest you that whenever you are designing your abs or

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:44.810
anything,

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:45.360
for example,

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.960
let me show you this over here.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.960
Okay.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:55.590
So you can see over here this stop one is actually you want to create a frame.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:56.280
For example,

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.290
I want to have a fixed return height for this front.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:05.090
And don't want these icons over here to change their position and change their size

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:10.570
whenever I try to increase the hardboard or here similarly for this bar over here.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.220
30 minutes,

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:11.940
four people,

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.550
1.5 kilocalories.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.800
You have to use a frame.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.210
If you try to use a group,

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:22.400
you try toe increase the height off this art board over here.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.620
It will mess up.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.250
These things will move out.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.340
And actually,

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:31.500
it happened once when I was trying to design in this exercises happened.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:31.960
Ah,

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.400
lot of times if I haven't converted them to frames,

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:42.700
So frames are actually going to have a specific boundary and the constraints are going toe

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.260
work inside this inside this area,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:45.970
for example,

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:51.800
I'm going toe use left and bottom for this one.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.290
Similarly,

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.050
for this one too left and boredom.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:55.720
Now,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.570
if you want to scale a frame,

00:08:58.570 --> 00:08:59.940
you have to click over here,

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.130
go to the scale,

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.050
tool and you try toe.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:08.650
Use that if you want to really scale the height and width off a frame.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:14.610
But for a group you can you don't need to use the scale.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:22.080
You can use the move to do and you can just dragon press your shift and hold your shift key

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.320
to scale like that.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.180
Now,

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:31.470
one more thing whenever you create ah component or here so components they are going to act

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.780
just like frames.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.630
Everything is going to have constraints on.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.520
Do you can see your here?

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:44.680
Now you can see whenever you are inside a frame or you are inside component the bones or

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.930
the constraints are going to work inside this boundary,

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.730
this frame boundary instead.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.530
If you look at this group,

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:58.840
if I try to select this top and let's say left these bones are these constraints,

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.760
boundaries are actually according to their parent frame,

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.270
you can see over here the parent frame is this practice frame and these constraints are

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.100
linking to door.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.080
So these lines,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.240
these dotted lines,

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.700
are showing that they are linked.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.830
So these these constraints are linked to the spirit frame.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.480
So when I click over here and I double click this one.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.500
If I try to use,

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.450
for example,

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.640
center and bottom,

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.850
it is going toe.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.260
Have constraints with this on this frame over here.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:30.770
Similarly,

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:31.420
for this one,

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.020
if I try to use left and job,

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.860
it is going toe stay the same.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:40.330
So this is actually the boundary because of this banana over here.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:45.400
So let's reduce the size of the banana by pressing shift.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.390
And now you can see the bone is the same.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:53.190
So we have to press this resize boundary again and this is our boundary.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.920
Now,

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.980
if I try to click over here,

00:10:54.980 --> 00:11:00.820
you can see it is these constraints are linked with this frame rather than the parent frame

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:00.820
,

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.180
which is practice for him.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:06.720
So I hope you have understood the differences between groups and frames,

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.130
and when you have to use one instead,

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:12.130
the other let's move on to the next lesson.
