00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.630
one of the coolest feature off Sigma is that you can collaborate with other designers,

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.620
live in any design.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.660
So if you are designing,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.220
for example,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.340
this file you can see you are seeing two courses over here.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.410
One is over here,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.530
which is just change showing the name off the other designer,

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.550
which is included in my team right now.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.740
You can see here says 40 months now if I go back toe team my team,

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.100
you can see this is my team than you.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.690
Exciting.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:32.930
And on the right side,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.270
you can see this is me.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.390
And this is actually my other eye.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.240
Mac and I have logged and using another account using this name,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.970
so I tried to change in him.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.400
So it is easier for you to see that someone else is trying to change this design.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.460
You can invite members by clicking on this in white members over here,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.350
But you have to come to this screen off your team,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.870
actually,

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.150
So this is my team.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.330
And if we go back,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.450
let me go back.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.760
And for example,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.650
you can see these are the change ings I am trying to do.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.870
No.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.620
If I try to change something on my I,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.010
Mac,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.120
or try to change the move,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.450
the cursor you can see.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.160
Now it is showing that the Fatma or the other designer is trying to change something.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.200
So if I try to hold this and try to drag it over here,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.950
you can see this is actually,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.150
uh,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.040
happening on my other Mac.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.810
So I'm not doing it on my PC.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.500
So if I try to do something like this And if I try to change the color,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.780
let me change some of the things over here so you can see that two designers can

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.710
simultaneously work on this design.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.230
So I am trying to move,

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.560
put my customers and trying to change,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.250
You can see.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.150
So this is me moving around and other box is moving around by another designer.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:01.120
So this is how you can actually work simultaneously on a single design and two or more than

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.250
two designers they can work simultaneously.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.370
So if you are working in a team,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.060
you can work on a single design,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.420
and you can speed up your project by having multiple designer working on the same thing.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.600
So if you have,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.370
for example,

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.070
already created style guards and your components.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:24.050
You can just add designers and they are going toe drag and drop those components and keep

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.320
on building projects in with a lot of speed.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.890
So this is a very cool feature Off Sigma collaboration with their designers.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.560
It is called live collaboration.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.210
A lot of other tools are also implementing it.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.720
I hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.310
If you have any questions or have any suggestions,

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.590
you can always ask me,

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.850
Let's move on to the next lesson.
