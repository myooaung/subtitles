00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
in this video,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.080
we're going to look at how to use place,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.350
image,

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.280
tool and Sigma and maybe few mortals.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.840
Now go over here and slack place,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.020
image or command ship ke or controlled ship care.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.650
And you can see I am going to select all these different images or here.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.950
So let's like this one.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:31.080
This one I'm pressing or holding Commander Control Key to have multiple selections.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.650
Looks like this one,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.400
this one.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.220
And let's select,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.060
um,

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:44.120
this one and I'm going to press on open so you can see now I have five images and just keep

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:55.060
on dragging like this wherever you want to place something like this and Sigma is actually

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.850
filling up everything by its own.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.750
I really love this feature.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.740
Just keep on dragging and that is all.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.780
So you can see this is how I can create on image colledge like this.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.330
This is really cool feature And one more thing.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.060
So this is how you can place images.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.720
And if you have something,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.590
for example,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.540
within a frame,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.190
for example,

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.740
I have a lips,

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.970
um,

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.780
different every dollars off different people and for example,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.250
I have like this And now if I want to place image.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.300
And,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.920
uh,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.450
let's select any of these again.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.770
Four one,

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.800
Duke 34 Really good.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.080
Really,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.920
really cool feature.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.090
So you can just drag and drop anything you want on.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.350
This is a really cool feature.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.730
So we're goingto go again by placing all here like this.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.950
1234 Okay,

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.870
so let's leave this one.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.930
Let's do it.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.250
This one registry this one and focus on this one.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.390
Now,

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.060
if you click on this or here,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.240
you can see on the right.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.560
We have Phil as image,

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.550
and it shows 100% so you can reduce the opacity over here.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.920
This is opacity.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.610
And if you click over here,

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.750
you can see we have different options.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.030
For example,

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.150
we can change the exposure or we can reduce exposure.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.550
We can increase the contrast,

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.880
and we can increase the saturation,

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.650
which is going to enhance our colors temperature.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.710
This is,

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.450
uh,

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.760
warm temperature.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.070
There's a school temperature.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.050
This is a bit controls off photograph E.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.190
So if you want toe go back,

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.320
you can go back,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.450
and it is going to click on this.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.650
0% are the normal settings like this.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.470
Let's make it a little bit bigger like this.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.150
So I use shift key and use this adult to expand it.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.160
Okay,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.570
so if you want to change the image,

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.230
you can again click over here and for examples like this image like this.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.470
And now you can see here we have Phil options.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.830
So these are the options which shows that how it is going to fill this object.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.380
So this is filled.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.090
It is going to fill the whole object.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.000
This is fit.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.500
And if you click on foot,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.320
you can see it is clipped inside,

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:47.470
and you can also you can see this is not because it is not a rounded picture or image.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.950
So it is not fitting inside it.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.380
So Okay,

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.430
so we're going to use Phil right now,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.260
and you can also use crop.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:05.350
So crop is going to help you change on the size off this.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.440
And you can also change the placement off this image.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.050
For example,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.150
this image we're here,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.850
and you can also change size off the image press and hold shift.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.640
And for example,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.690
I want toe have something like this.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.380
Okay,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.870
so you can also move the image around like this X close this and you can see here we have

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.240
the image where we wanted it.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.150
So again,

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.470
we're going to go to image.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.480
This is crop.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.620
So in crop you can drop the image.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.380
For example,

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:49.880
I want to have something over here like this and let's go out and you can see this is

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.200
actually cropping damage.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.750
So it is basically changing the frame off the image.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.030
And if you want to again goto crop,

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.180
this is actually the crop area.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.750
This blue section we're here.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.440
If you click this image behind you can see we have different adults.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.350
These are black.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.200
So if you want to change the size off the image behind this crop,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.700
you can do that by like this music like this.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.730
So this is a really good tool,

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.450
so you can also rotate it.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.250
But I think that's not going to help Over here.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.150
It is going to deform this image,

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.430
so that is all.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.910
So this is a really nice feature off this crop off the image.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.250
Then you can use style so tile is actually going toe.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.180
Help us style this image.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.040
So actually,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.550
I'm reducing the size of this image because we have to see the tile effect.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:59.100
So let's move it like this and X click over here.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.750
So this is how it is styling over image.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:09.150
So these are few options with image feels you can also hide the image feel you can also

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.800
move it.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.350
You can also add the image field from over here.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.530
Do so if you go to image,

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.790
it is going to tell you that Select an image.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.620
So you construct any image from here.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.200
And these are different options.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.430
How it is going to fit,

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.110
fill,

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:32.350
fit actually make Try to use 100% of the image and try to fitted inside this container.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.330
For example,

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:40.490
if we have a container off like this one and we want to fill it with an image so you can

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.560
click if you want to fill something with image,

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:50.270
you can click over here it's filled and you can click over here this and go to solid,

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.150
solid and move to image.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:59.090
So here we have it shows that try to choose an image over here so you can choose any image

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.090
,

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.760
for example,

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.890
like looks like this one.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.420
Okay,

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.360
so now you can see it is filled.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.420
And if I try to fret,

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.480
you can see it is trying to fit the whole image into this rectangle.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.980
Now it is leaving something on the right and the left.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.860
So if I tried to reduce the size Okay,

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.690
so this is a perfect fit.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.530
If I want to crop it,

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.770
you can see I can crop this container.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:30.490
And I can also move this image around like this.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:35.940
So I hope you haven't destroyed this image.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.650
Phil are placing your image and how you can use this place.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.060
Image tool within Sigma.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.470
I hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.150
Let's move on to the next lesson.
