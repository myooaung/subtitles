00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
now,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.510
the first thing we're going to do is we're going to convert this button toe component

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.570
because we are going to use this button with on Icon.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.480
So let's do that.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.530
So we're going to select this group.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.570
This is our Burton Facebook burden.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.340
And click this and this is going to be a component.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.610
This is master component.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.270
So we don't want Overwatch,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.160
Master component.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.610
Toby,

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.050
Inside this design,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.950
we want tohave over instances or here,

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.880
so command or control data duplicate so you can see we have another one.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.290
So select this master Component Control Command axe,

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.380
and we're going to move it to our style guide.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.880
So if you haven't created a frame over here,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.780
just press f or a and we're goingto get a frame and based it over here like this.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.820
So here we have our pretend.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.330
Now,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.940
let's get some settings over here.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.780
So this text I have double click to get it.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.820
It is going to be,

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.510
um,

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.560
stick toe this right side and at the bottom over here,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.950
or you can have it on the right and bottom.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.730
This is going to be another setting,

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.920
so it will always have the same space over here like this.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.890
Similarly,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.650
for this Facebook icon were going toe have setting off left and right.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:29.040
So it is going to maintain the same same left and bottom spacing if we try to increase it.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.750
So if we try to increase this burden,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.510
you can see if I try to increase it over here.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.650
The Facebook logo is sticking to this left.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.850
So this is going to be the behavior off this this button.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.340
So this is our component.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.910
If we want to change it later on,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.700
we can change it into our master component.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.940
So this is going to be our button with,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.170
um,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.350
button icon.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.080
Let's call it button with Icahn.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.050
So this is going to be our button with icon.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.050
Okay,

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.590
so let's get get back to the main design and let's leave it.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.670
Because actually,

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.350
I think we should also use the same component over here,

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.490
But right now we're going to leave it because it based a lot of time.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.270
So once you have created component,

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.510
just change the color and change logo over here.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.680
I call over here and you will have something like this.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.160
So let's dip.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.760
Replicate this and we're going toe press holding press our option key and along with I'm

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.290
going to press shift key to create another screen like this.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.540
Now I'm going toe delete this image over here at the background hopes.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.380
So this is going to be Let's rename this first.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.480
So it is going to be our means mean meals screen So this is going to be made means screen.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.790
So let's does this and open this one and we're going toe removed This ellipse this image

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.250
over here This is good.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.300
Let's,

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.110
um,

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:18.350
remove this mosque in lower here and let's come on shift in G ian group this and this is

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.950
going to be removed over here.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.730
This is going to be a big,

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.450
smaller and 30% opacity,

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.810
and we are going toe make it a bit smaller.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.750
I have locked this ex proportions.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.280
Let's make it 20 24 32.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.970
This one looks good.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.450
This is going to be over here somewhere.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:52.250
So this background is actually going to be this color e d.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.820
F.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.850
Three f four.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:02.080
So this is going to be our major background color that is going to be containing all over

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.010
screen So this is going to be our color.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.440
So you can see this is looking great on this background.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.220
If we want to increase the opacity,

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.610
let's use 40% over here like this.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.810
So this logo is going to be minimized over here on this screen.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.420
Let's leave it like this.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.120
We're going to bring over icons before that.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.570
We're going to remove these or here like this.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.800
So we have this empty space or here,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.110
we're going to bring our icons of back Adul.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.110
And here we have the filter icon than we have such bottle here.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.260
All these things are going to be over here,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.140
So let's get started.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.960
And this is our arrow left.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.060
This is actually 24 by 24 pixels,

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.800
so you can see what hair 24 is the size,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.870
and let's put it over here and align it like this.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.250
Then we have our dry cone or funnel icon over here.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.270
We're going to grab and drop it all here like this.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.600
This is also going to be 24 this is going to be aligned with discreet.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.870
So you can see this is the value off grid.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.950
We have this layout create four columns and were lining things according to that.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:16.800
Next move it in the middle.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.320
Written right on the left was it is a bit unbalanced.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.350
Design item more here.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.300
So once we have it,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:33.580
we're going to use a full weight over here to create our such bar.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.890
This is a going to be our search party is going to be 48 pixels high.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.620
And,

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.180
um,

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.190
it is going to be 300 39.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.900
This is sexually the forward and color is going to be white,

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.590
and we're going to use the same board radius four for this one.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.350
So now we're going toe a line.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.350
I think this one waas aligned over hair.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.750
This one was a bit up over here.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.400
The color for these icons.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:19.120
Let me first Heidi's color for these icons Waas,

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.180
medium green,

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.150
which is our,

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.450
uh let's use this color.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.750
43615 e.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.380
This is our medium green color.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.530
So let's add this color 12 a style guide.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.450
This is squad medium creamed.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.450
Oops.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.030
I think I have selecting all of them.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.000
So we are going to select one off them.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.370
Select this color hopes hopes.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:59.170
Now we're going to have a medium green so you can see sometimes everybody me except us.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.830
This is our medium green.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.770
This is,

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.300
um OK,

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.250
so this is our logo.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.050
This is our search bar Over here.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.710
We can also add a stroke effect around it.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.400
It is going to be,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.430
um,

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.510
local killers,

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:17.750
Lex use discolor.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:23.500
And we're going to lower the opacity to 15% like this,

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.400
so you can see we have very dim line.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:26.950
Or here,

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:31.080
let's zoom in and show you what this effect is actually doing.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.850
So you can see this is actually what is happening over here.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.310
So let's aligned this.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.260
Tow this lines over here like this,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.870
and this is going to be our such bar.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.790
Let's use some tax your hair.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.720
D um,

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:54.000
such ressie B hopes recipe like this.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.260
This is not going to be all caps,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.450
so it is going to be as it is typed.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:04.630
Are this case actually such recipe like this?

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.050
This is going to believe you big regular.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.030
16 pigs,

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:11.710
2%.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.500
So this is actually going to be our text.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.480
So,

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.170
um,

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:19.950
let's change the color toe something else because it is not going to be very,

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.510
um,

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.050
bright or here,

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.670
maybe something like this.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.730
So you can see I'm using the same color.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.050
Just changing some off the Hughes or things like that.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:35.650
We're just to my liking over here,

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.750
but it must be visible to the user.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.560
So we are going to create a textile.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:41.890
Now,

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:46.350
this is actually our real Bic 16.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.160
And with that,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.670
I'm going to use what is its purpose.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.550
So it is actually our,

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.440
um,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.210
button action next.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.640
So this is,

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.130
uh you can see it so I can easily memorize it.

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:09.760
That this is going to be taxed for buttons is the same text we have used over here for

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.310
these.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.450
These were here and also for this over here.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.100
So this is going to be our tax debts.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.310
Let's,

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:17.870
uh,

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:23.410
Jane this style and use as it is type.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:29.020
So this is going to be a bit better for me like this.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.310
Now we're going to add such icon over here.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:35.500
So get I was such icon is my search icon,

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.150
this one.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:40.970
So just crab and drag and drop it over here like this,

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.950
like this.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:51.650
Just change the color that this one.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:52.720
And,

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.850
um,

00:09:53.850 --> 00:10:03.470
excuse this one so we don't want all the colors to get the same attention.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.660
So we are going to use,

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.540
um,

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.750
you can say this is going to be up it.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.150
This color and discolor is the same.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:15.800
So let's change it to something else.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.040
Lets you the same color as this such bar.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:23.400
So I'm going to select and it's like the same color over here like this.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.450
I think we have selected the Hong color anyhow.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.650
So it's the Selectric from here.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.090
This is looking good.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.950
Let's add this color.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.530
Great green.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:44.450
Let's call it great green so that Zo Motor and see what is happening.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.150
Looking good.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:50.580
I can also make it a little bored.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.240
Bit more them or more grayish.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.710
Maybe like this.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:01.440
I'm liking this color better and let's call it great.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:09.760
I'm also going to use the same gray over here so that switch to discrete this is looking

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.240
better because it is blue,

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.320
green and green.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.830
Everything was looking green,

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.260
so I have made it like this.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.370
Now,

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:19.660
are such matters completed,

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.140
we can easily group them,

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:28.310
so we're going to select all of them and command and control G to group this such part and

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:32.050
why we're doing this Because we can easily create a component out off it.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:37.320
So this is going to be spaced out 13 pixels from here.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.130
So let's make it 14 15 16.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:41.700
And similarly,

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.430
we have this one.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.950
This is also 16 from this left side.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.890
So I'm using art option key to me in the distance,

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.050
as you can see or hear 16 on the left.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:51.000
Similarly,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.850
we have this one.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:57.330
You can open up this group and we have this vector inside it.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:02.450
We're going to delete it because we don't want tohave complicate a complicated icons.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:05.040
So I like it better like this.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.450
So this is our such icon.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:08.650
Let's call it icon.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.210
This is our search bar.

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:13.470
This is our background butts for such bar.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.940
And for this whole such bar,

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.750
we're going to create a component.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:21.450
So command or control R K Option K.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.280
And this is our component.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:23.880
Same thing.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.290
We're going to do command control de to replicate it,

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:32.430
and we're going toe cut this and move it into our style guide over here.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:33.850
So this is our such bar,

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:38.170
so you can see no we're building our style guide.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.340
So Oops.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.950
So once we have created this,

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:46.600
we're going to go back to main design and we're going to create this navigation or head.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.550
This is the navigation we're going to create.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.180
Now we're going toe,

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:55.250
have a text De and we're going to use Mees.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:59.810
The text will be It is not going to be Rubik.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:10.890
Let's detach this and we're going toe use young mine of and for 16 pigs is 5% and I'm going

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.620
to use the middle alignment.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:17.110
It is going to help when we align it and this is going to be vita next,

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:21.150
and the background behind it will be this.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.020
We're here,

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.890
So I'm going to use,

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:30.250
um 64 pixels wide and 32 pixels high.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:38.380
And let's use the border Kanakaredes to before you can see the meals is behind this

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:38.870
rectangle.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.580
So we're going to move it up and slack board off them.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.460
You move them in the middle like this,

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.980
so this feels bring up.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.100
So I'm moving town rectangle seems a bit smaller,

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.450
so I'm goingto make it a bit larger.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:56.530
All edge,

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.050
we is.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:13:59.950
Okay,

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:06.400
so we have this ready So let's change the color toe this Phil,

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.550
which is going to be our primary green color,

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.280
which is a sharper color for this one.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.640
So actually,

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:24.370
our primary green color is zero e 5956 So this is our primary queen color,

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.140
so you can see this is very sharp.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.390
This is very lively or live Lee,

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:30.310
whatever you call it,

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.650
this is a nice color.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:34.920
So we're going to group this together,

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:43.620
and we're going to move it over here less use our guidelines to align the murder control

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.060
shift four.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.810
And I think there was control.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.720
I'm not sure what was the shortcut for Mac,

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.550
but I will listed down.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:56.860
So here we have it like this.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:01.520
Now you can see this is our Mies group.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.410
Okay,

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.700
so this background is going to be moveable.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.140
So we are going toe,

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.070
remove it outside of this.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.320
So let's move it up.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:16.040
And this background is you can see this is outside of this group means So we have means

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.360
active,

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.440
stared in a come on d and this is going to be our inactive street.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.220
So at the bottom,

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:30.100
we will have inactive Stoute so inactive killer off the text will be,

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.060
uh,

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:32.550
this one.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.600
Okay,

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:41.290
this is actually our medium green color for 3615 So let me show you what I actually mean by

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:41.850
inactive.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:46.350
So let's hide this active and let's hide this background.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:49.680
You can see this is our inactive state.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.590
Now,

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.360
we are going to just to replicate this.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.250
We have this background overhead,

00:15:55.250 --> 00:16:00.360
active state next and neck if we're going to hide and,

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.250
um,

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.590
there's allowing them better.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.700
Oops.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.680
Okay,

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.600
so we are going to replicate it.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.590
Let's first use something like,

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:14.050
Oops.

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:19.390
So we're going to slack this meals and all option.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.450
Let's drag it like this.

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.890
Our distance off,

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:24.910
like 33.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:25.650
32.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:26.700
Oh,

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:27.250
here.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.490
And we're going toe press.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:29.910
Come on,

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:30.670
Control de.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.450
To replicate this like that,

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:38.590
so you can see it is actually using the same space on replicating it like that.

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.160
So first we're going to rename it.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:41.720
Now,

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:51.190
this is going to be Sellards and also for this inactive state.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.760
He started this one.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.330
So just time actually replacing the text,

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.060
then we're going to align them again.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:09.530
Way have created all these and were renamed them,

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:10.650
uh,

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:16.270
handy control or command are salad.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:17.160
Stream him.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.400
This is a shortcut key.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:26.350
Now we're going to move it outside of this canvas cause we want to have a good distance

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:26.980
between them.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:33.070
So now I'm going to use distribute horizontal spacing like this so we can have some menu

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.640
like this.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.920
Let's move it a bit.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.720
Over here it is looking too wide.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:42.060
So it's like this 40 years.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:45.950
So I'm going to have a distance of 40 between them.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:57.050
56 something like this.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:01.950
Let's move it a bit.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:09.710
Or here 26 26.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:14.160
And we actually want to my unit from here.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:26.050
123 123 and on three.

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:31.530
So they all have the distance off 30 six inside them.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:37.670
So now if we want to change the background simply we have to do is we have to hide the

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:44.720
active stewed than on the inactive state and move the background to this one like this.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.670
And like your salad,

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.550
we're going to use active state and hide the inactive state.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:56.160
So this is how we're going to move it and any midget around thes Ugarte idea.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.060
So in the next lesson,

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:02.690
we're going to prepare the rest of the thing because it is getting getting very long.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.000
I don't want this like just to be really boring,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.110
so let's move on to the next lesson and create the rest off the screen.
