00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.320
Now let's get into a bit more advanced use of these features.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.970
And we are going to create input over here.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.715
Make it a component.

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:23.560
We're going to add variance.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.265
So before we create more of these in vertex,

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.290
we are going to create a new property.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.145
We're here at NYU property and we're going to name it type.

00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:42.920
So we have type and this is property.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.260
This property is going to be the state.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.705
So these are actually,

00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:58.940
these are both actually are going to be type x.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.740
Add a new type to squint to be text input.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.915
And if we click one of them,

00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:13.710
this is going to be default state or normal state.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.190
And for this one it is going to be active.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.165
Now we are going to create more of these.

00:01:25.165 --> 00:01:27.715
Let's create this one, another one.

00:01:27.715 --> 00:01:32.155
And for the type we are going to use,

00:01:32.155 --> 00:01:34.900
let's create a new one over here.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.685
And we are going to use actually dropped on,

00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:41.770
let's call it dropdown.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.680
And then we have another one.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.990
Before we move into another one,

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.825
we are going to add a rectangle over here.

00:01:49.825 --> 00:01:53.125
Polygon actually, for the dropdown.

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:56.630
Lets move it like this.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.060
Let's rename it select.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.005
Now we can create another variant.

00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:14.060
Let's create another obedient.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.300
And I'm going to again use this one over here,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.310
copy it over here.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.609
And this one we're going to call select.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.610
Let's change the color to something else.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.760
Like this.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.575
Just to make the difference.

00:02:51.575 --> 00:02:54.800
Similarly for this one,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.979
I'm going to change the color to something like this.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.890
Okay, now I'm going to select this one and this one,

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.285
and this is going to be Type drop-down.

00:03:11.285 --> 00:03:14.165
Okay? And for these two,

00:03:14.165 --> 00:03:15.890
I am holding actually shift.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.935
We are going to use text input.

00:03:18.935 --> 00:03:23.525
Now for each one we have to set the, set the state.

00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:25.850
This one is going to be normal,

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.090
this one is going to be active.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.750
So now you can see we are actually using two different sets of states and type.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.610
So how we can use it,

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.715
just drag in, put text over here.

00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:42.800
And if we go on the right,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.220
you can see here we can change the state over here.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.750
Then we can also change the dropdown and type of this one.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.579
So this is actually that Vos usage where we can combine two different properties.

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.230
Now if you want to create variants from your already created components, so don't,

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.685
you don't want to create components and you already have few components,

00:04:04.685 --> 00:04:06.410
then it's very easy.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.260
Let's me, let me create component over here.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.540
But they must be dif, different components.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.670
For example, here we have components of different states.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.520
For example, we have this one.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.900
This one is active state,

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.280
let's call it active.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.875
And I'm going to create a component over here.

00:04:24.875 --> 00:04:26.584
And let's go to layers.

00:04:26.584 --> 00:04:28.820
And here we have another one.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:38.690
This is going to be, let's call it nav as backslash normal or normal.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:47.160
And nav backslash disabled.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.730
And if you want to create both of these and you'll want to create variants,

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.680
you have to just drag like this.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.060
And you can see on the right,

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.890
you can see combined as variance.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.050
Just click on it over here like that.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.910
And you will see already created disabled and normal properties, variants.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.820
And for the property we are going to just give the name navigation,

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.710
maybe something like that.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.990
And when you have to use it,

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.040
just drag and drop this now over here.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.390
And you can change its state like this and make sure, uh,

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.130
one more thing is that if you want to alter the shape or for example,

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.655
if I want to change the shape of the state, that's up to you.

00:05:31.655 --> 00:05:34.325
That is not a very big issue.

00:05:34.325 --> 00:05:36.950
You can change both of these states.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.540
So you can see your hair navigation,

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.270
normal navigation disabled is a bigger one.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.680
So it's up to you.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.035
You can change anything into any variant.

00:05:45.035 --> 00:05:47.660
So that is all about variance and its power in fig,

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.715
my hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

00:05:49.715 --> 00:05:52.160
I will see you soon in the next lesson.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.720
Till then, take care and bye.
