00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:11.415
Today we are going to see a very latest feature of sigma ab, which is community.

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:13.905
Now they have just released their community tab.

00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:16.170
You can see over here on the left,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.345
Community in bed beta.

00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:23.130
This is beta version for community and this is a great,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.770
really great initiative and really great feature for this fig my app.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.140
And you are really going to enjoy it.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.660
So if you click over here on community,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.590
you can see this is my Fichman profile.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.390
Handel says Fichman.com, S and N3C and the rate of asset and DC.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.975
And if you don't know how to set your public profile,

00:00:44.975 --> 00:00:49.459
this URL, you can go to this over here, your name.

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:51.920
Let me go back to the settings.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.455
So you have to go to the settings.

00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:56.255
And you can see in settings,

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:59.315
this is my name, email, password.

00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:03.035
And then we have another thing which is called public profile.

00:01:03.035 --> 00:01:07.805
Now you can see I have set my public profile handle at S and addressee.

00:01:07.805 --> 00:01:11.150
And if you want to set your public profile,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.435
try to choose the name that is specific to you or you use it a lot on different forums.

00:01:17.435 --> 00:01:20.930
Okay, so once you set your public profile,

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.220
so set your public profile,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.660
you can go to community.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.020
So I had to click twice on community to get over here.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.885
Something was messing up.

00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:31.385
Actually, it's in beta.

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:33.095
So that is the problem maybe.

00:01:33.095 --> 00:01:34.400
Okay, so here we have,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.570
if you look at top,

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.830
we have different categories,

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.140
UI kids, if you click on UI kits,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.765
you will have a lot of free UI kits.

00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:46.565
The people, different community members they are sharing with you or other members.

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:50.135
So that is a great initiative that different people have

00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:54.739
shared their resources and we can use them and bring them into our projects.

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:57.890
Similarly, you can see we have web design.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.100
So there are lot of tons of resources for icons, for illustration.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.840
So if you, for example,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.580
if you want to bring something in,

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.440
you can click over here.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.735
And we can like this.

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:13.280
For example, I like these,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.570
so I'm going to click on this,

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.880
like you can duplicate this.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.260
So if I click on duplicate,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.105
it is going to open up into my sigma tab as a new file.

00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:28.759
You can see now we have all the illustrations so we can use them into our projects.

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:33.230
This is really easy to use these illustrations.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.230
So going back to community,

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.280
let me show you there are few more things which I'm going to

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.120
show you that might be useful for you.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.680
One is this slit ID tags.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.930
So if you want to looking for something,

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.245
icons, icon set or something you can click over here.

00:02:51.245 --> 00:02:53.480
Similarly, we have illustrations.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.445
I will have wireframes and we have designed systems that are really helpful.

00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:02.750
So if you are trying to start some website or something like that,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.930
you have to use some design system.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.410
So to be able to use that,

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.150
there is a one feature,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.310
let me just use this one.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.930
And let's duplicate this.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.490
You can see 1.1 K 1100 people have already duplicate it.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.635
So I'm going to click on duplicate.

00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:25.384
And I'm going to open up in my FISMA.

00:03:25.384 --> 00:03:27.575
Let's see, it is taking some time.

00:03:27.575 --> 00:03:32.165
Ok, so here we have the material design styles you, I get.

00:03:32.165 --> 00:03:36.230
Now, if you go over here, over here,

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.070
you can see this is actually opened in my drafts.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.175
So this is actually my project which is draft.

00:03:43.175 --> 00:03:44.240
If I want to open it,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.010
I have to open it over here or move it to something else by clicking over here.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.030
Okay?

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.960
So now whenever in you have to share your material design,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.940
you have to go to assets.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.580
And you can see already there is a light version,

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.960
there are a lot of assets.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.855
So here, now you can click over here and you have to click on publish.

00:04:08.855 --> 00:04:11.599
To publish these styles.

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.925
You have to publish this style guide so you can use it in your designs.

00:04:16.925 --> 00:04:19.310
So I'm going to click on publish.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.985
Move to team to publish components.

00:04:22.985 --> 00:04:25.085
So let's move team.

00:04:25.085 --> 00:04:28.160
Let's move to my move.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.500
Let's move to sigma class.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.434
This is a project.

00:04:32.434 --> 00:04:37.905
So I'm going to say Material Design Lite.

00:04:37.905 --> 00:04:40.975
So I'm going to publish it now. Okay?

00:04:40.975 --> 00:04:42.715
Now once you have published these,

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:45.415
we have to go back to this sigma class.

00:04:45.415 --> 00:04:47.785
Okay, so right now in this project,

00:04:47.785 --> 00:04:49.270
it has been shared.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.270
So if I try to open up any file, for example,

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.205
this untitled over here,

00:04:54.205 --> 00:04:56.620
I can use these components.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.620
So let's delete this.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.380
Delete this. So if I go to assets,

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.690
you can see we have let me go to this one.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.470
Let's check this one so it is shared,

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.730
but I have to enable it.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.040
So I have used this library icon.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.705
So I have two nm alert.

00:05:16.705 --> 00:05:20.550
And you can see I have material design components over here.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.795
If I want to use any component like this,

00:05:23.795 --> 00:05:27.680
plus button or New File button or whatever you call it.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.469
I can drag and drop different lists.

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:33.125
I can drag and drop different cards.

00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:37.565
So I don't mean to create these by myself.

00:05:37.565 --> 00:05:39.155
This is a really good start.

00:05:39.155 --> 00:05:42.320
It is going to save tons of time for you.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.170
You don't have to create all these components.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.050
So this is the feature of communities.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.095
So community is actually really helpful.

00:05:51.095 --> 00:05:53.150
I'm going to put a love over here.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.595
And if I go back,

00:05:55.595 --> 00:05:59.615
you can see if I go back to my community over here,

00:05:59.615 --> 00:06:02.585
school back, what is the problem with this?

00:06:02.585 --> 00:06:08.660
Doesn't sometimes go back to sigma community anyhow.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:14.915
So if you go back to my profile over here and your profile is visible,

00:06:14.915 --> 00:06:17.610
Let's open this one.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:27.770
So you can see in this profile I have resources and like so if I click on likes,

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.630
you can see, so all the different resources I have juice or I have liked r over here.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.310
So you can see user profile,

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.425
sigma library, I have lived.

00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:39.215
Here. We have these two plugins.

00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:42.950
So this is how actually you use your community.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.150
So let's go back to community and we can click on plugins

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.320
to so we have to file tabs or hair files and plug-ins.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.965
So you can also explore different creators.

00:06:54.965 --> 00:06:57.410
For example, this person, this person,

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.820
or if you want to follow them,

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.250
you can follow them for new updates.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.890
So any new extensions or something like that.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.325
Similarly, I can click on design systems,

00:07:07.325 --> 00:07:09.215
for example, like this one,

00:07:09.215 --> 00:07:14.000
and I can use it in my designs,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.415
my websites or whatever.

00:07:16.415 --> 00:07:22.010
So this is a great feature to use.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.810
Get different resources, use them and tack

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:33.740
and say thank you and put some love to the resources or the creators of these resources.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.650
That is a really great feature,

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.095
a great addition to sigma.

00:07:39.095 --> 00:07:40.730
So I hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.130
If you have any questions you can always ask me.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.870
Let's move on to the next lesson.
