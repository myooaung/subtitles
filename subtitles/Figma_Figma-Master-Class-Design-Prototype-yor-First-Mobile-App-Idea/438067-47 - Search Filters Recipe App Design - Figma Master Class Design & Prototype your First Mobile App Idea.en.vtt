00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.610
Now,

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.620
in these few videos,

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.650
we're going to create these search fitter screens 123 and four.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.670
So,

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.040
actually,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.090
in this green we selected to off these selections,

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.810
so I'm going to stick with only one this one.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.790
I'm going to show you the technique,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.250
and you can apply it to as many.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.330
If it does,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.010
you want toe slacked over here.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.640
So we have Ah,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.540
this screen with the such reserves are shown than we have.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.500
Three screens were filters and advanced search options are so whenever someone clicks on

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.060
the search,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.550
this screens will appear.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.800
So let's get started and start designing these search filter screens.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.330
Now,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.840
we are going to go back to our actual file,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.160
and first thing we're always going to do is we're going to replicate this.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.750
So let's replicate this healthy and let's rename it toe.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.950
I feel they're all you can call it such one.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.550
So this is going to be our first such item.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.500
And,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.940
um okay,

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.550
so we can pick up a few things over here.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.320
For example,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.070
we don't need this over here,

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.450
So we're going to delete this than this one toe,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.150
and from these we're going We don't need these small recipes.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.610
We might need this heading tax over here,

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.750
so I'm going to keep it over here like that on.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.580
I think we don't need to use thes.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.260
Maybe we might need something like this,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.550
but right now,

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.580
I think it's matter that we deleted.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.250
Okay,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.650
so here we have one heading,

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.250
and let's turn our Lior grid on,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.290
and I'm going to align it on the left.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.050
That's keep the distance toe.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.890
Um,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.050
48 is good.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.130
Next.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.550
Enable our rulers.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.110
This is the job,

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.650
actually.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.040
So Okay,

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.980
so I think 40.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.910
It looks great.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.650
Let's hide everything.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.280
Shift on controlled shift four or control G,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.650
if you are on a Mac,

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.170
and here we have our Paul,

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.560
you're like So I think it should be aligned over here so people don't get a lot off

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.260
flickering or something like that.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.650
So I'm going toe go over here like this.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.920
Okay,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.050
so first we're going toe rename it to died land.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.100
So we have a diet plan.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.250
Options were here.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.950
No,

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.020
we're going to create different die plan options for that.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.680
We're going to use a technique that is going to help you Speed up your work and we're going

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.160
to start with text there.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.750
Over here.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.950
Cattle died.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.850
Let's use this and I'm going toe color it going to go local killers.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.770
And I'm going to use this white even f f Or you can use a bit more fighter over here like

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.150
this.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.700
No,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.860
the simplest technique is you are going toe.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.710
Add a frame shift,

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.890
plus a Now you can see here we have a frame,

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.930
so we are going to call it option.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.040
And once we ever did the frame,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.050
we can add the fill color over here,

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:39.500
and that is going to be it be nine e five.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.190
So this is going to be a great color,

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.260
so we don't think that it is active.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.900
So it is a normal state.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.480
So we're going to add some roundness to it.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.170
Let's act 1 to 6 and on the left and right biting.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.500
I'm goingto go with 16.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.120
Something like that.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.400
And top and bottom.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.270
I'm going to go over 12.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.910
Let's use 13 something like this.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.060
So this is looking great.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.030
We have a very nice box that is going to expand with our text.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.170
So if you remember we have used orderly out before.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.850
This is actually the orderly out drink.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.860
Now I'm going toe replicate this.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.130
We're not going to pound it into another container,

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.850
so let's replicated by are pressing art option key.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.290
And we're going to have another one,

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.050
which is buy new indict.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:47.850
Let's create another one all draw option drag to create a new one.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.350
I'm keeping distance off 12 over here between these two elements.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.980
So we have four options over here.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.650
Let's group them together.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.220
Come on,

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.750
G.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:07.280
So this is our died group over here,

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:16.750
so I'm going to move it inside this small section because we already have had this group.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.740
Okay,

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.610
so from here,

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.980
we have a lot of space,

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.970
so we don't want it to be too much.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:24.950
Okay,

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.180
so one more trick,

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.960
I'm going to show you,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.090
So let me show you control shift four.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.390
Okay,

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.160
so if you zoom in,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.360
you can see these are not aligned properly.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.390
And one more thing is,

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.300
if you have rounded corners like this oval shapes,

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.190
you have to keep them a bit more of a from the border,

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.500
are you?

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.010
If you want to keep them on the border like this,

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.670
Like this 15.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.650
Just going to be 12.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.400
This is going to be tried.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.850
Okay,

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.200
So I'm going to make this one a picked like this.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.380
Or maybe I'm going to move it inside a little bit because we have rounded corners over here

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.380
.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.660
It is going to look a bit different.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:10.730
Oh,

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:11.980
are you can see a bit.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:17.390
It is actually a visual problem that whenever you see something like this,

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.130
it is not.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.770
It will not look aligned.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.730
So this is a simple trick that if you have a lot of rounded items like this,

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.090
you have to move your text a bit on the right toe,

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.150
align it visually in the line.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.610
So controlled ship four.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.140
This is looking a bit better.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.250
Even you can move it.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.350
Two more pixels in this looks great.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.600
Died plan.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.760
Okay,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.180
so we have this group,

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.950
just we're going to replicate this group and create under group over here at the bottom.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.180
Okay,

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.500
so right now it's 54.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.460
I'm going toe,

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.430
move it more down 56 and rest.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.280
You already know.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.350
I'm just repeating the same stuff.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.750
What I have done over here.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:25.450
Okay,

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:26.520
so this looks good.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.950
Now we have to reduce the height of this art board.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.010
Wasit is a bit much.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.580
We don't need this much.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.350
So here we are.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:42.980
So this is the finish line for this screen.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:48.560
One more trick is over here because if you want to change the height are the distance

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.500
between these items you can slack this.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.850
Grab this and you can increase or decrease the distance between them.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:00.120
So this is 13.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.040
And if I I cannot do it from here,

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.240
I can use something from here.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:05.560
12.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.430
I wanted to be 12 and similarly over here.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.180
I wanted to be 12.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.190
So this is how you do it quickly.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:19.890
This is these are the few features that are that are really shining in Fig Meyer.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:23.730
So I hope you have enjoyed this lesson on next.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.210
We are going toe,

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:26.290
do the selection state,

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.640
and I'm going to tell you how we're going to do it in a prototype more in the next few.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.550
Let's and let's move on to the next lesson
