00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.240
In this video, we're going to talk about

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.815
the very latest and new feature of sigma, which is variance.

00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:15.120
And there are variants of different components like we create buttons,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.040
then they can be disabled returns,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.460
they can be primary buttons, Secondary buttons.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.210
There could be buttons that are having a loading bar

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.140
or they're loading and unloading state or prestige or overstates.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.490
So all these states,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.340
they had to had a system to create all this into just one component.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.040
So in this video we're going to learn just that.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.045
So let get started.

00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:43.040
Now you can see these are few variance.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.500
I'm going to show you the power of variance if you click over

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.370
here and if you want to switch to gray button or disabled,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.820
but, and you can see you just have to use this option over here,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.634
which is a new one variance.

00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:57.035
And then we have to switch to blue.

00:00:57.035 --> 00:00:59.690
So this is actually I created this myself.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.905
This is a custom made.

00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:02.750
Similarly, like you can see over here.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.610
Here we have a component.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.230
Are you hungry right now?

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.925
And we have two stairs checked.

00:01:07.925 --> 00:01:11.000
We can check it on and on and off.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.990
So we're going to create both of these in this tutorial.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.685
So let's get started.

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:18.710
Now we are going to start from scratch.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.030
So I'm going to press a for art board and I'm going to create an art.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.990
But over here, then we are going to have rectangle

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.385
over here or press are for rectangle to create a nice button.

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:35.345
And I will give it some roundness over here.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:40.670
We will give a primary color, just this blue.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.460
I'm going to press T for text.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.015
And this is going to be our primary button.

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:51.320
Are we?

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.630
Okay, so here we have the text.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.280
Let's color it white.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.975
So we have one button over here.

00:01:56.975 --> 00:01:58.265
Now the next step is,

00:01:58.265 --> 00:02:00.635
it is always going to work on a component.

00:02:00.635 --> 00:02:04.070
So we have to select both of them, create a component,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.270
and here we have a component,

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.295
let's call it but an slash pry Marie.

00:02:10.295 --> 00:02:15.440
Okay, so we have a button and let's create some more variance.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.420
So you can see once I click over here,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.950
there is a new option over here,

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.420
which is called variance.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.535
So you have to click on this plus,

00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:24.545
and there we have another variant.

00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:27.275
So let's customize this variant first.

00:02:27.275 --> 00:02:31.085
So we will have green button over here.

00:02:31.085 --> 00:02:34.340
Let's call it something like this.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.085
Let's make it something like this.

00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:43.520
Let's change the text color to black ups like this.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.735
So let's keep it simple and we have 2 million. So ahead.

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:51.080
So now if you click on the whole bounding box,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.700
so if you want to add a new variant,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.070
you can click over here in the plus sign and it will give

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.800
you as many variants that you want.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.330
I can have gray button over here like this.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:11.000
And this is going to be a bit darker grey like this.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.870
So we have right now three buttons in this frame.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.905
So if we click over here on the whole boundary of this,

00:03:18.905 --> 00:03:23.450
these three buttons, you can see that we have declared over here property.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.130
So property is actually it could be your type,

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.465
it could be your colors,

00:03:29.465 --> 00:03:32.689
it could be the type of the thing you are creating.

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.225
It is actually in hierarchy.

00:03:35.225 --> 00:03:36.860
It is going to be at the top.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.020
So one property can have multiple variance.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.400
I am going to repeat it again.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.205
This is a very, I'm very initial essential concept.

00:03:49.205 --> 00:03:52.880
One property can have multiple variants.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.590
For example, I can just call it primary.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.585
Lets call it button. Ok.

00:04:02.585 --> 00:04:07.775
So we have button over here and then if I click over here,

00:04:07.775 --> 00:04:11.315
I'm going to, this is basically the primary.

00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:20.089
This is, or we can call it primary, primary blue.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:22.325
And then I'm going to click on it.

00:04:22.325 --> 00:04:28.855
I'm going to rename the variant to primary green.

00:04:28.855 --> 00:04:36.640
And then I'm going to click over here and primary disabled.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.590
Ok, so let's call it gray.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.100
Okay, so we have completed this,

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.960
so how we can use it.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.730
So we have already created this.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.955
Let's move it outside of this frame.

00:04:51.955 --> 00:04:54.400
Now we are going to move to our assets.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.780
We are, we have this component over here and we're going to drag this button component.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.955
This is the one we just created.

00:05:00.955 --> 00:05:03.790
Okay, so now you can see on the right we have

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.450
this property name over here on the left this is button.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.715
And on the right we have the variance,

00:05:10.715 --> 00:05:13.100
primary blue, primary gray,

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.935
primary green, or whatever.

00:05:15.935 --> 00:05:18.875
You can even call them like primary,

00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:22.025
Hoover and maybe disabled.

00:05:22.025 --> 00:05:23.300
It's up to you, For example,

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.250
let's name this hovered.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.600
Then we have this one to be disabled.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.130
So now you can see we have three states over here,

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.840
homeward, primary and disable.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.690
I'm not sure why this is lining up like this.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.970
I think they should have the

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.235
same you can say the same order which we have created over here.

00:05:49.235 --> 00:05:54.815
Anyhow, still, we can switch to anyone we want, like this.

00:05:54.815 --> 00:06:03.035
Ok. Now let's come to the point where we have to create a small checkbox,

00:06:03.035 --> 00:06:04.895
which is a mobile checkbox.

00:06:04.895 --> 00:06:07.565
So I'm going to make it round.

00:06:07.565 --> 00:06:10.910
Let's use 320 k.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.130
So first we have to create different components.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.775
So now we are going to use an ellipse.

00:06:16.775 --> 00:06:23.960
Just 21 by 21 changed the color to white.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.870
Let's make it a little bit like this.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:34.670
Move it a bit more over here on this side and reduce the width of this one.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.935
Okay, So we have a little bit of arrangement over here.

00:06:39.935 --> 00:06:47.960
So let's create component by clicking over here or Alt Control key or Command Alt key.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.680
I'm not sure what is the shortcut on Mac anyhow,

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.465
so you can click over here.

00:06:53.465 --> 00:06:55.895
And here we have the component.

00:06:55.895 --> 00:06:57.140
Once we have the component,

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.685
we have to create its variance.

00:06:58.685 --> 00:07:00.635
I am going to click over here.

00:07:00.635 --> 00:07:02.330
And here we have another variant.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.375
Let's double-click and go inside this variant,

00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:07.790
change it's color to green.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.300
And let's move this over here.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.950
On this side like this.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.970
So this is going to be our another variant.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.650
So for the property,

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.590
I'm going to select overhead checked.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.070
And one thing you have to do is for when you click over here,

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.090
you have to describe its variant name.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.840
For that, we are going to use false.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.890
And for this one true.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.235
So this, this will create toggle over here.

00:07:46.235 --> 00:07:49.055
So now we have to use it.

00:07:49.055 --> 00:07:52.970
So let's move it over here. Go to assets.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.010
We have this component,

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.190
and let's click on it.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.440
And we have the check box over here.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.960
Really nice. Hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.750
I'm going to meet you in another lesson soon.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.190
Till then, take care and bye.
