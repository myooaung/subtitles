00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.690
in this really of we're going to talk about a very important concept,

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.110
which is called components.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.450
Now.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.800
Components are basically your design elements that you can reuse them.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.380
You can change some off the their properties,

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.780
and still you can use them.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:27.660
So let me share with you what is basically the concept so component can be group off any

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.600
design elements,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.940
your tax background,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.780
your Parton's,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.780
your guards,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.150
your you were designed headers or anything you have.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.730
So it is basically group off two or three elements,

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.480
for example.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.380
We are going to create a button over here,

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.050
and I'm going to use things Brugler over here.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.210
And once we have selected this here we have this around this corner roundness.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.420
So I'm going to use it over here.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.220
So we have a nice round but annoyed head.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.960
Now let's add next over here.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.050
So Presti and we are going to have some text like down Lord Don't know,

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.390
best escape and let's align it in the middle.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.100
A little bit up over here,

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.290
Jeanne,

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.470
the color white.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.650
So I am changing the physical er off the stacks over here right now.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.210
And let's add on ed over here.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.480
So I have already talked to some off the shocker keys.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.010
So I'm going to use control or command backslash toe,

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.930
get my search,

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.750
and I'm going toe dive icon.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.500
And here we have four awesome icons.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.630
So this is actually Blufgan.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.750
So I'm going toe die arrow.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.270
So you can see we have a lot of annals over here,

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.970
So I'm going to use No,

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.850
she was this one.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.250
So this is the air over here,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:06.350
and right now you can see we have this vector of ahead and change its with 22.5.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.680
Okay,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.860
so,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.150
no,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.030
it is looking good.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.930
That's changes color to white and let's make it a bit bigger.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.950
So I'm going to press this country in constrained proportion.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.380
So I'm going toe go with size,

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.480
like 36.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.110
Something like that.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.050
This looks great.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.950
Okay,

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.950
so we have some of the elements over here.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.370
Our I go on our dexter and our background.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.640
Now,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.780
you can also apply some effects.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.650
If you want some drop shirt over here,

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.850
you can have some drop shadow like this.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.920
So 8% blood x value the movement off this shadow.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.470
And here is the shadow on.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.950
Why would mean that it is going to go down from the rear at the bottom of the Lear.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.150
So here we have a very nice button.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.890
Now,

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:03.720
right now,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.120
we are going to group them.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.950
So let's group control or command G.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.070
But if you don't want to grope them,

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.660
that is good too.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.900
So just like all of the elements and we are going toe press command all K or control all K

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.390
for creating a component.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.290
So let's create a component.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.300
Now you can see as so nice have I have created this component.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.360
You can see the eye gone over here is totally changed.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:36.230
So this is as basically a master component Master component is actually our main design

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.520
element that is in its original form.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.490
So let's duplicate this one so you can press.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.350
Come on D.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.410
So now you can see I have a duplicate element at the top offered,

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.880
So I have dragged it over here.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.540
Now you can see the I gone off.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.690
The 2nd 1 component to is different,

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.350
although it is the same as component one.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.810
But now it is an instance.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.240
So this is you can see or hear on the right side of this called This is called instance.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.510
And if I click over here,

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.520
there's no instance.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.840
Over here it is.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.110
It is saying component.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.060
So if I click over here again,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.580
you can see we have this small panel area over here instead.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.550
Component one.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.800
So it is an instant instance off component one.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.190
So it is just like if you are a programmer,

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.050
this this is the concept off a parent and child In Javascript and Java,

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.340
you make different classes and the same properties.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.750
So it is just like a parent and child.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.050
So now you can see this child has all the properties office parents.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.440
But I think that is not good.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.950
So if I want to change,

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:41.860
for example,

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.170
the color like this one,

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.110
I can do that.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.680
Still,

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.550
you can see it is similar in everything like its father or experiment.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.720
So this is the concept off components.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.980
So we have this component.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.670
So once we complete create any component,

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.490
we cannot revert back.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.350
So this component is going to be available in this assets panel over here so you can see

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:10.050
this practice practice frame and we have this component of one so you can also rename it.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.670
For example,

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.240
I'm going toe rename it Bt and download.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.550
So I'm going to rename it BD en download.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.790
So now if we go toe assets,

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:23.910
you can see it.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.790
So shows pretty and download and I can drag and drop it and place it anywhere I born So you

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.890
can keep on creating a lot off different assets and components like this.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:40.280
But make sure you create them once you are finalized with their design because it will be

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.810
difficult.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.560
You have toe change the master component to get the change is done.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.390
What if you want to create a new company so I don't want this instance?

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.360
I want a new button similar like this one.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.440
But I wanted to be another component,

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.170
so I'm going to right click over here and I'm going toe Use this command Detach instance.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:08.490
So now you can see if I go to layers panel it is again off frame so you can see this frame

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.180
I got over here component toe So this is actually on group.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.410
If you click on on group,

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.730
it is going to get out off the group because we created the group in the first place.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.940
So once we have this,

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.590
I can change whatever I want to.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:24.480
For example,

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.390
I want different corners.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.960
So I have clicked over here,

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.810
and I'm going to use 16 over here and 16 or hair and,

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:35.420
uh,

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.750
zeal.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.070
And,

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.480
you know,

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.010
over here,

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.070
for example,

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.170
let's say I want a button like this one so I can create another component.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.450
And I think this is going to be and again master component.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.440
So make sure once you create a master component,

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:56.520
keep the copies on your design and use this master component and move it to some other page

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:56.520
.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.050
For example,

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.550
I'm going to create another bitch named Style guide.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.000
So once I go back to my page,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.200
I'm going toe get both off these.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.840
Let's create a copy.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.460
I am actually pressing and holding Arche and option key toe drag and create a copy.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.380
So I'm going toe flick pulled off them Control Command X,

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.650
and I'm going to go back in the style guide and district over here.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:28.780
So we have component component over here so you can rename them down Lord Flat or something

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.490
like that and,

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.110
um then we're going to go back.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:37.280
So once you have over here and you want something to have changed something,

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:37.950
for example,

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:44.560
I accidentally Jane the color toe this regular and I really don't like and I don't want it

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.060
to be ready.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.860
And I want to go back toe the way it was before.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.040
So I'm going to kick over here.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.350
This is God reset.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.940
Instance.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.360
Once I'm going to click over here,

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.440
you can see it says reset overrides.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.270
So I actually overheard in the color only.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:01.840
So if I want override,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.660
I can override tax too.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.150
So I'm going to type.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.580
I don't download now.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:14.800
So now if you click over here and click on this he said overrides.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.940
I'm going toe reset everything.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.060
So text is going to back the 1st 1 default.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.350
But an icon everything is reset toe the master component.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.030
Similarly,

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.210
if you want to address something or change something into the master component,

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.070
you can click over here,

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.210
go toe master component and it is going to go to another page.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:33.480
Well,

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:33.880
actually,

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.490
the master component is residing,

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:37.660
so also,

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.900
you can add some description over here.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.050
Whatever you want on bond.

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:43.930
That is all.

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:48.300
That is what the components are and the instances are and how you can go toe master

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:48.800
component,

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.450
how you can reset components.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.830
These are the 43 or four things how,

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:54.350
actually these components work.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:09:00.610
And we will talk about more of these components about this constraint in the next lesson

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.470
because I think I don't want it to be ready long.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.550
So that is all.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.050
If you have any questions to ask me,

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.630
let's move on to the next lesson.
