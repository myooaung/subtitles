00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880
in this video,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.400
we're going to create the next queen,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.950
which is going to be preparations.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.050
So we're going to replicate starting,

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.110
but replicate this replicating this one.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:21.450
So we're going to replicate this and we're going to move this toe over here.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.350
So this moving line is going to be moved over here.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:34.560
Exchange size toe 100 102.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.050
You said this one looks good.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.500
Let's change it,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.250
Sculler Toe this one.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.340
Oops.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.290
This darker one and said this is going to be into this state.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.050
So we have already Jane,

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.560
this.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.580
Now we are going to move in this area.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.250
Our here.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.950
So we are going to delete everything over here except the top one.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:14.810
And now we are going to call a rather than group one.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.200
We're going to call it operations steps.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.570
So this is our first step.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.750
So I'm going to call it step one,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.360
and we're going to,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.690
right?

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.580
Click and deed,

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.130
agit.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.080
Dejected.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.050
Instance.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.330
So step one way might need this line.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.900
That's dilute this treat.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.150
This I can do.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.850
I just needed this one.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.260
Okay,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.550
Now,

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.720
what we're going to do is we have way water rectangle over here.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.610
which is again going to be white color.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.660
These are our steps.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.290
So this is going to be white,

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.920
color white,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.550
white,

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.250
And it is going to be the bottom off this Step one.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.950
We're here in this group.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.850
This is actually a frame.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:24.430
So try to use frames when you want to have some more control over constraints,

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.720
these constraints.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.980
So this is going to be our actually taxed overhead inside it.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.730
So we want it to be detach.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.330
And we want to use a fix.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.690
Weird like this,

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:50.770
something like this.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.720
So we have this fixed width.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.100
This is going to be able paragraph hard ideas.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.830
What is this?

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.750
Estes.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.850
Step one.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.320
Okay,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.960
so we are not concerned with the height and ripped off this one.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.990
Exchange its heights,

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.410
uh,

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:23.630
to there's changing toe group because it is behaving very differently.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.140
Now we have the group sighs.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.750
That's move it over here.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:40.670
Force tried to fix everything you've warned,

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.920
then convert to frame because we frame is actually trying toe use its own height and Brits

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.490
so we don't need that.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.590
So this is going to be our paragraph.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.510
So now I'm going to use this.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.440
Okay,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.150
so this is going to be my 1st 1 So I'm going to use the roundness of four.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.210
Um,

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.850
okay.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.150
S four is looking good,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.500
and then we're going to use an icon over here.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.790
Before that,

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.250
we're going toe cleared on a tangle over here.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.990
And what we're going to do is this is going to be around,

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.550
too.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.750
This is going to be zero.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.650
This is going to before,

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.020
and this is going to be Oops.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.890
So sorry.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.410
This is going to be zero toe.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.010
So,

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.370
actually,

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.500
I try to create the same angles over here.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.710
So here we have two.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.790
Here we have four,

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.750
Which is again not equal to this,

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:47.720
uh,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.050
white or here.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.890
So now we're going to use our orange Calero here.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.540
Let's make a bit little bit off lighter color.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.650
So let's add it in corn light orange.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.250
And now you're going to have polygon,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.810
which is going to be our play button.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.600
Let's rotate it toe.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.690
90 degree.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.830
Oops.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.990
45 degree.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.970
What is happening?

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.460
Minus 90.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.950
Victory.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:28.750
Let's use one big selloff radius that she was this greenish color.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:29.880
Lex,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.950
reduce exercise too.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.850
16.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:35.640
Okay,

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.750
so this looks squared.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.160
So whenever some user clicks over here.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.620
He or she is going to see this step in a video.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.150
So video with Bob up and they will see this step.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:55.000
So this is almost complete now I think we should can convert it to frame.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.800
And we are going to let's remove this group.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.690
We are goingto UN group this.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.510
Now we have one background.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.430
When this we have rectangular polygon,

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.950
This is going to be a icon.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.140
Let's move it inside this frame.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.890
And this icon is going to be at the left,

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:14.750
in the bottom,

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.680
left in the bottle.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.750
This is going to be left and top.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.950
Okay,

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.540
The cyclone is going to be right in the bottom.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.190
This is going to be left in the top and that is all we need.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.480
Okay,

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.550
So one more thing is that we need to add attacks layer over here for the title.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.430
So for the title,

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.950
we're going to use step one,

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:49.350
take the egg out.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.900
So this is going to be our mean heading.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.350
And for that we are going to use,

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:05.540
um excuse the same fort die fierce and we are going to use the color which is going to be

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.640
our green green.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.750
Excuse this one.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.770
So this is going to be our sharper green color.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.630
So this is going to be step one if we want.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.210
We can also use this one.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.390
This is this is not going to be a problem for us.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.120
So let's use this that zoom out.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.350
And this is our main step.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.140
So now we're going to repeat this.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.050
We're going to group them together,

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.220
and we're going to repeat this.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:42.510
This is our steps Step and let's replicate this and move it down like this.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:47.050
We need to have a tea least 16.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.950
Let's make it 20.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.730
Come on,

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:52.220
de.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:52.740
Come on,

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.050
D.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:58.880
So right now I'm going to use just three steps that's used these three steps.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:05.280
No,

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.140
we're going to change its size.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:16.320
We can see this is going very well because it is a frame and we have already object of a

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.450
constrains over here.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.680
Similarly,

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.920
for this one will exchange size similarly again.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.370
We can slack this preparation step and we're going to move it like this.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.880
So these are our few steps.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.550
Let's move this break up over here.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.490
And this time we need something with,

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.350
um with an icon.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.750
This here,

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.520
Let's delete this.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:58.720
We don't hear 48 for the air in the distance between these for the icon,

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.350
we're going to change it.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:04.990
Select school layers.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:09.750
Icahn next seals this one.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:18.900
Okay,

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.770
so for this icon trick,

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:24.080
I have to show you that if you want to add an icon over here,

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.610
you cannot add an icon like this.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.550
You cannot drag and drop a Nikon,

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.000
for example.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:31.620
For example,

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.950
this one inside this it is not like that.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.750
It is not going to let you add.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.850
I attempts to your instance.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.730
So instead and going over here,

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:45.250
we're going to go to Sty Guide the burden Master component.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.650
We're going to add another icon.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.750
Let me show you the trick.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.050
So we're going to add on that icon over here.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.630
So we have our icon you can see.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:55.870
No,

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.550
it's inside this one.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.040
And,

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:00.850
um,

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.870
we're going to change its color too wide.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.990
She was this more white,

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.220
and we're going to hide it over here.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.950
So whenever we want to drag something,

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:15.420
let me show you how we're going to use it.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:20.970
So we have this button now and simply we're going to hide this icon and show the cycle.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.880
So this is all we need to do.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.750
So let me see if we can align it properly,

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.650
because it is not in the middle.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.230
Okay,

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.440
so now it's in the middle.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.450
Okay,

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:41.950
So that school backdoor mean design and exchange it do,

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:47.160
and I'm going to change its color two.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:47.470
Okay,

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:48.530
So one more thing,

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.640
we're going to add this BGN button,

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.270
and we're going to add it to our color styles.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:58.350
This is going to be a very green Grady int.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.430
Okay,

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.370
so we have no great.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:00.840
And over here,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.650
So once we have our ingredient,

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:04.920
we're going to slack this background,

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.650
and we're going to switch to big Radiant.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.050
That is all we need to do over here.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:12.570
So this is how we actually cleared this?

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.930
Let's try toe.

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.060
That's tried toe shoe,

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.050
our bottom navigation over here.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:21.990
Okay,

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:30.450
so let's make it a bit smaller like this.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.150
Also this background earlier?

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:40.650
No,

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:41.510
for this one,

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:49.050
we need to have a depth media that is going to be over here.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:52.970
Two areas,

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:53.450
actually.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:54.420
What?

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:54.600
This?

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.620
This one on checking.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.250
It's this one.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:12:03.450
So this is going to be prepped stab.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:08.650
And this is going to be ingredient.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.430
Yeah.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:17.250
So I'm going to just hide them by 0%.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:25.220
And now we're going to go toe prototype and simply were going toe use something like this.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.760
Drag and drop never get too smart.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.380
And he made.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.700
And from here,

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.650
we also need to baste both off these,

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:33.850
um,

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:37.550
Lears most of these layers over here too.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.970
Something like this.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:44.550
So let's move this over here.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:48.450
Excuse this one to go back.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:52.370
So now we're going to test our prototype.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.550
Let's see what we have done over here.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.150
Okay?

00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:00.850
This is looking good,

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:06.210
and we can go down and we can click over here,

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.110
and it will goto our review pop up,

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.150
which we're going to make in the next lesson.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.600
So we have ingredients and preparation.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.200
Now,

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.450
if you want to show the progression and move them up,

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:24.150
moving them up you want to show the any mission you have to do the same thing you have toe

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.170
select all these,

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:30.170
and thats group them control.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:30.550
Come on.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.850
G X called them steps.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.670
We're going toe.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:35.110
Come on,

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.690
See?

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.650
And we're going toe Base them over here.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.950
So here we have them like this.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:45.780
And inside this group,

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.410
we're going toe,

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.050
move them up in town,

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.550
Jayna positions.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.780
And now we're going to hide this.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.650
So you're going to use 0% for the opacity.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.750
Let's see what this happening over here.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:05.150
You can see when they come out like this,

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:12.870
you can also slow down the animation or here.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:18.950
So if you want to slow down the animation on the movement over here,

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:25.590
you can select this and we have 300 milliseconds we can use for 50 many seconds.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:26.660
Similarly,

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.460
for this one,

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:32.070
we can use 3 50 See,

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.250
what is the effect now?

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:37.450
You can see it looks better when we have,

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:38.530
uh,

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:39.730
these kind of settings.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:43.640
So these come very nicely like this.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:50.210
So this ends over this prototyping in all this,

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:55.220
I am going to create one more screen which is going to be overly and rest of the screens

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.650
and major app.

00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:00.780
You are going to design for me and show me what you have caught.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:05.270
So let's move on to the next lesson and where we're going toe design our over the screen,

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:09.650
and I'm going to show you how toe use this pop up overlay and fig MMA
