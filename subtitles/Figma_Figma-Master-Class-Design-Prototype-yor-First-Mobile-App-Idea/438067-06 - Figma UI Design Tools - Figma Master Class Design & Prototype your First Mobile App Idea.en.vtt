00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.860
this video is going to be about fig mottos.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.070
So let's get started and learn what are the tools over here and how we can use them.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.220
So first,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.010
we're going toe,

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.970
create a frame.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.450
This is our art board.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.750
So let's call it,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.140
um,

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.750
practice frame.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.290
Okay,

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.570
so we have this frame,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.820
and if you want to root,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.950
move it around.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.450
This is your selection tool or moved all.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.260
You can move it around over here.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.050
So whatever you draw,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.680
for example,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.270
I have drawn sec tangle over here.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.550
If I want to move it,

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.420
I'm going to use this move.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.860
Told this is actually the default will add a little lower here over here.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.570
So if you want to scale something by proportion,

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.380
you are going to select this gay or scale Dole.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.960
And now you can see you can scale it down or up whenever you are importing some icons

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.920
within Sigma AB.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.840
I think I preferred using scale dole because it is going to keep the proportion and not

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.420
going to mess up your icons over here.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.310
So make sure you use it when you are going to scale something in proportion like this.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.830
For example,

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.480
images or something like that,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.950
which you want toe scale in proportion.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:28.660
Now here we have again frame dual and slice to slice is I will go back to slice once I have

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.570
something over here.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.700
So we're going to first discuss thes shape.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.620
Does we have rectangle,

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.160
line,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.680
arrow,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.360
ellipse,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.980
poorly gone star and place image.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.490
So start by rectangle so we can place a rectangle here.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.660
Just click on that drag and leave over here.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.430
You can also see we have radius over here.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.950
So if you want oh,

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.150
select corner radius you can select dragged by over here.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.090
Or you can also put radius over here,

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.630
for example.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.390
I have put eight exists right now and you can change the color exchange the color over here

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.430
physical.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.670
That's fill it with the color.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.110
So here we have a nice big button And here again,

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.210
these same all these are actually options.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.950
Standard options at X Y positioning Britain High Tradition Gordon Radius.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.880
You can see if I try to change it over here it is going to change your head.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.470
You can also drag like this to change the corner radius.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.090
And again if we click over here we have independent corners.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.950
You can have different corner of AIDS 20 for example,

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.150
Like this or CEO like this.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.870
And you can also have one more option,

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.140
which is our US corner smoothing so you can have corner smoothing like this which you have

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.100
seen in a lot off a mac O R us.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.560
Our iPhone APS you can see over here.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.880
This is a good option.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.780
You can also add effects different effectual here.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.470
If you want to add drop shadow,

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.330
you can see we have different effects.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.560
We will go around these stroke effects,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.140
stroke and effects,

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.730
literal.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.730
Right now you need to worry about this.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.280
Feel colors you can see or hear.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.680
We again are going toe go deep into Phil and solid lenient all these greedy ints.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.260
But right now we are discussing this rectangle tool.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.370
So here we have the sect angle tool and,

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.050
um,

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.750
you can I have already showed you all the options we can have with this.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.760
So once we have the sec tangle Dole,

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.450
let's scared And another rectangular here like this one,

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.370
and it's overlap it like this.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.980
So this is how these leaders are arranged.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.150
So you can move them around.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.270
Okay,

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.670
so let's change your sculler toe something like this,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.910
something like this.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.130
So I'm going toe something like that anyhow,

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.620
So now I'm going to move back to slice tool.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:13.740
So if I want tohave an image or something on it is going to be we're here like this so I

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.560
can use the slice tool,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.700
and I can click on export,

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.590
and it's going to export Onley this slice.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.390
So whatever is inside this slice,

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.220
I'm going to export it,

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.250
and I'm going toe.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.860
Um,

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.750
let's save it on the desktop.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.960
Let me show you what it means.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.930
School.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.860
It is ups.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.070
So here we have sliced so you can see this is slice.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.830
So this is,

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.400
uh,

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.180
abortion I wanted here.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.110
So this is the function off slice tool.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.930
It is not very handy,

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.590
But sometimes in web design,

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.160
you can use something like this.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.650
Let's delete this slice over here.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.550
Okay?

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.020
Now,

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.250
let's delete these two.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.350
Then we have lying to you can drag your line like this,

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.380
and you can changed your thickness toe.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.150
Five.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.870
It is going to the center,

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.490
inside or outside.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.630
So these are different settings with new center and let's,

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.350
uh,

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.960
make it 50.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.950
But this exchange its direction and breath shift holding breast shift,

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.500
tohave it in different street angles like this.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.160
So if you want it to be straight in some angle,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.370
you're going toe hold and press shift like this.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.110
So we have this and let's move to this ad.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.330
Vast strokes you.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.190
We can have different round corners.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.460
You can see what hair around,

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.870
cap a square gap,

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:53.930
and then we have lying.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.210
Adel's and then we have triangle arrows.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.350
So all these different options and we have Dash and Gap.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.980
So,

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:02.460
uh,

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.890
do come on.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:05.250
What?

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.110
So this is Actually,

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.540
1st 1 is dash and second is gap.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.940
So let's we have to coma.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.070
Let's see we if we have,

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.560
we want to increase the gap.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.400
So I have used 25 for the gap.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.850
You can see there's a lot of gap between these dishes.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.410
Metal is actually the angle over here.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.650
This is joint Angle Middle is actually very sharp angle.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.230
And if you want to have around angle over here,

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.110
so this is actually the line,

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.000
and it has a lot of different options.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.750
Let's civilities and go back toe Simple line.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.190
Okay.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.070
So you can also save this style and you,

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.860
Congar styles and adequate style for the stroke.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.440
And you can reuse it right now we are going toe.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.440
Discuss on adoptions That related line.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.750
Toe.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.340
So,

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.060
Lyinto,

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.270
this is our line tool.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.460
You can change the color,

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.800
whatever you want to.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.500
For example,

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.550
like this one,

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.030
I normally use it in links.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.810
For example,

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:20.880
if I have a tax or here on this is a link something like this.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.020
So you can use lines for separators or anything.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.540
Similarly,

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.350
we have total It is again a very nice tool.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.760
And you can see right now if you draw a row on the far screen,

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.180
it is going to be very small.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.550
So rather than using one,

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.550
you can use four.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.690
So this is a thickness.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.570
So if you try to reduce the thickness,

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.220
it is going to be something like this.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.300
So if you want a bigger animal,

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.670
you can use more thickness like this.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.910
So I think around four or three is good.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:54.650
Good looking.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.750
You've been changed at all.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:01.090
Anywhere you want to like this again.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.720
If you want to go with advanced options you can always go over here.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.480
Triangle Arrow Oh,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.760
are lying at all.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.550
Oh,

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.850
are none Something like that.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:15.030
It is a game going toe disappear everything around ah,

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:25.720
square lying at all on Not so you can see it is converted to say simple line and there is

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.160
no arrow on one end.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:35.220
So this is very strange for me because I wanted to go back to the interstate and now it is

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:35.850
a line.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:42.310
So we're going to create another Arrojo here like this and not Sam the thickness like this

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.310
.

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:44.250
So this is our arable.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.680
So options are almost the same,

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.970
like this line tool,

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.640
and that is all.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.240
You can change the direction whenever you want.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:53.570
Oh,

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:54.650
this is the arable.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:09:00.230
Then we're going to go toe ellipse elections basically circle.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:04.240
So if you want to get it in a proportion,

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.250
hold your shift and it is going to be perfectly around like this.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.150
So I'm right now holding and pressing shift key.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.670
So this is my lips,

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.330
and you can see if I click over here.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:23.680
It shows arc so you can click over here and keep dragging like this and you can create a

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.260
chart.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.250
You can see we're here.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.780
Graph or chart.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:27.760
Similarly,

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.230
you can also change this to create a graph a circle,

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.850
A graph.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.830
So this is very easy in fig.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.320
Miley loved this feature.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.650
This is really,

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:39.850
really interesting.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:47.140
So get going here on arc and keep on moving like this so you can change the start also.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.750
So if you want to have something like over here like this,

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.760
you can have something like this.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.470
They're sculler it like this.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.350
This is really cool feature.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:03.130
And also this ratio it is going toe Change it like this.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:04.650
These options are also we're here.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.030
So this is the angle.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.750
Start angle minus 90.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.590
Uh,

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.420
this is,

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.420
uh this is also the probation,

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.030
I think,

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.650
and this is the tech necessary issue.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:22.900
So I'm going to go back to something like this.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.650
Yeah,

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.050
and let's use 100 corners over here.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:36.430
And this is how you create a very nice circa graph using just eloped stool.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.580
So this is a lip stool.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.550
This is really great.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:40.680
Really powerful.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.250
I really love it.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:45.750
You can see over here you can create a lot of things.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.000
For example,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.720
like this one,

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.270
huh?

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.100
Any hot This is my omelet.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.150
Okay,

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.690
so we have polygon.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:58.290
A polygon is again going to have different corners.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.850
You can increase the corners.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:04.890
10 56 Whatever you want,

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.560
eggs are gone up gone whatever you want appeared.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.750
And you can also change the corner radius over here.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.940
You can change the count from here.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.750
These are really good controls.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.650
I haven't seen these controls in any design toe.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:20.610
This is really cool.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:27.130
Sigma have a lot of features that I think other design tools are lacking on.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:31.460
Maybe they will have in one or two years and Sigma has a dried Now,

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:36.210
uh then we have startled this is going toe.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.050
Create a star holding shift key.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.290
You can have a star off.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.550
Four gardeners,

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:43.060
three corners.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.400
This is a ninja tool and,

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:46.950
uh,

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.730
five corners,

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.020
six corners.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.720
So I'm going to stick with five corners and this is going to be,

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.060
I think,

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.350
the angle of the corners.

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:58.130
So let's increase it.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:03.530
So this is going to be a very nice star for my daughters.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:11.000
I think they're going to love these this star because it has some you can see on.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.850
You can also change the radius or here like that.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.250
So this is a really nice being started.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.980
My doctors are really going to love it anyhow,

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.530
so this is actually the angle,

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.070
like you can see where Here.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:25.390
This is called a car.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:26.380
This is a ratio.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:35.080
So this is actually how you can make a big you can see fat fact style or a slim star

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.810
whatever you want.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:37.160
No,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.740
it looks like a starfish.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.780
So this is a great tool.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.460
So this is a star.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.630
You can create them.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.640
So about a place image,

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.910
we're going to look at place image in the next lesson because it has a lot of options.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.790
So let's move on to the next lesson to discuss,

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:53.070
place,

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:54.820
image and fume or figment toads.
