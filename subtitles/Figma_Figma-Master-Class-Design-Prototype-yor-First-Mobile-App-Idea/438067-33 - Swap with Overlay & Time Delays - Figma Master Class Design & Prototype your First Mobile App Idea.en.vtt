00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
in this video,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.130
we're going to learn a few more things we can do while prototyping in fig MMA.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.500
So we're going to go ahead and learn a few more things,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.230
like,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.140
even see or hear.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.950
Here we have.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.540
Um it's like this one,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.170
this interaction and you can see we are using swept with.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.220
So we're going to study strapped with and how you can do that.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.580
Also,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.440
we're going to learn DeLay,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.330
for example.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.630
Um,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.900
if we have over here,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.670
if we go to these interactions,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.200
so there we have interactions,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.860
and then we have any mission.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.470
So inside this interaction panel,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.050
we're going toe study.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.670
Few more things s so we can get better at prototyping.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.580
So here we have it.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.970
Set it on tab.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.630
We're also going to study drag and also after dilly all these,

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.190
for example,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.670
vile hovering while pressing he game pad thes might not be needed most of the time.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.980
So right now we're going to skip them.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.910
Maybe in the future,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.510
I'm going to create more lessons about these options.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.350
The's are different interactions while holding some object while pressing it.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.140
Maybe you are trying to create a game with the keep key.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.890
Ah,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.170
and entering key and changing something.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.320
Mouse center,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.100
most leaves.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.640
Touchdown.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.510
So these these might be mostly needed in games,

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.070
basically.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.290
So here we are.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.560
So let's get started.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.070
First,

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.900
I'm going to delete these already mean interactions.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.500
So there are many ways you can goto this prototype more do we are inside it.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.750
You can press delete and is going to delete this interaction.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.980
Similarly,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:46.740
for this one,

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.040
I'm going to press delete,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.430
or you can go over here and select none.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.590
This is another way.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.680
So sometimes maybe the stigma is not working for you.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.150
And you are unfamiliar.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.500
How?

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.150
Toe remove this interaction between these two elements.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.850
You can do that.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.920
Okay.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.220
So swept with so first we're going to do is we have already have this.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:09.660
Uh,

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.660
you can say this is actually our overly We have opened an overlay over here.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.350
So whenever you are inside and overly,

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.240
and you want to switch to another navigation,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.090
for example,

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.140
some navigation,

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.610
for example,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.240
like this one.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.150
So we are inside these settings and we want to go inside the settings and and this is the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.010
setting screens.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.550
So this is actually left navigation toe named it.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.770
It is just a duplicate of this.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.060
So,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.650
um,

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.350
what we will do is I'm going to show you how it will work in a few seconds.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.200
So first,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.270
we're going to slack this layer or here,

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.500
and we are going to create an interaction.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.050
So we're going to move toe this screen on tap,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.860
and we're going to use that.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.150
The navigator we're going to use swept navigate is actually going to remove this frame.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.980
And it is going toe goto this frame so everything what we left behind will be,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.180
You know,

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.120
um will be gone.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.240
So this is another problem.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.360
So swept bid is mostly going toe work.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.950
When you are in an overly moored you already have an overly on your ab.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.700
I'm going to show you one more example.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.960
So first we have this,

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.660
and it will go over there.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.610
And similarly,

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.060
when we prestes cross overhead,

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.150
it is going to go back to this screen,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.630
the screen,

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.840
and we're going to use on tap slapped with,

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.660
and it is going to be left navigation.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.650
This one and we're going to use dissolve.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.870
He's in,

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:48.680
or he's out.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.920
You can use any of them for 50.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.360
I'm using preserves Scroll position.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.860
So it is Sometimes when we have a very long screen.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.180
Right now we don't have it.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.650
But if someone is have ah scrolling and embattled vertical scrolling and they have schooled

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.770
it is going toe Stay on the same position it will going to.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.650
,

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.060
It is going to preserve that scroll positions.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.310
If you have school down,

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.010
it will be.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.010
When you cook,

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.620
come back.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.240
It will be at the same position.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.050
So right now I objected just for you can see fun.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.550
We really don't need it because our left navigation is small.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.880
It is not scroll able.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.190
So let's play this.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.310
This is our prototype.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.360
Even see your hair.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.380
Here we have it.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.850
Let's play this and we go to the skip.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.500
And here we have our navigation.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.490
So just,

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.400
for instance,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.080
think that this is the navigation?

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.970
No,

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.740
if we want to go to settings and I don't want to hide all these screens behind behind.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:58.420
So I'm going to select over here and you can see this whole frame the stop frame.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:04.280
It's swept with another friend where I can change my settings and then I can go back.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:13.470
So this is actually the use case or scenario off using a strap with function on fig MMA in

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.990
fig MMA.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.330
So this is all about swept with.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.780
Now,

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.660
let me show you one more example.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.900
Here we have our fig Mahfoud at which we're going to design in this lesson.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.090
And you can see I have designed a very simple overlay feedback.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.350
So once you have submitted this,

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.880
uh,

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.750
this your review about a dish or any recipe over here.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.040
So whenever you submit this after submitting this,

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.850
it will show you a feedback message,

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.950
and this is going to be that feedback message.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:55.920
So what we're going to do is just move to the prototype and this is actually our overly you

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.330
can see,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.050
this screen is going toe.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.610
Get this overly so if I show you,

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.250
actually,

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:11.310
so we're going to go quickly to that screen where we have this over here.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.760
So if I go back over here,

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.090
we have completely this ready to eat now.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.380
So when we click over here,

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.660
it shows an overly which we already have discussed.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.050
So this isn't overly.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.010
And if you try to click over here If you try to click over here,

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.900
nothing is happening because we haven't link it with the next game.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.980
So I want is that I want to slap this screen with another one which is going to be Thank

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.050
you for submitting your review.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.560
So let's go back and do that now.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.440
So once someone click over here,

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.110
I'm going to go to the screen.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:52.840
I'm goingto select on Tab slapped with this'll Screen swept with the screen I wanted to

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.710
dissolve You can also use smart animator moving I'm goingto slacked Smart,

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.130
animate This time is in is out and that is all I need right now.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.770
So I'm going to go back over here now.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.070
If I tried to press this,

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.810
you can see we have this and it disappears after sometimes.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.750
So this is I'm going to tell you in a second.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.260
Okay,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:20.070
so once you click this over here,

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.830
this is our frame only feedback.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.940
What I have did is I have selected the interaction after delay.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.560
So after one sacking,

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.710
it is going to disappear.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:36.350
It is just like a feedback message that pops up and automatically disappears after some

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.670
time.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:40.940
So we're going toe increase increases time to 2000 millisecond,

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.280
which is equal to two seconds.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.150
So over here,

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.900
we're going toe slack this close,

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.500
overly.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.610
So rather than go back or scrap it,

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.620
we're going to use close.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.230
Overly.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:55.870
This is all we need.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.860
So these are toward trees.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.280
Things we have learned in this lesson one is that once you are in an overly mood,

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.840
you want to slap it with another screen you have to use slap with.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.200
Here we have this rapid attraction.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.650
So where it is,

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.550
let me pick this one.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.600
So here we have on tap,

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.450
its rapid.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:17.400
Okay,

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.430
so now I'm going to use these in.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:21.270
And,

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.710
uh,

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:22.410
oops,

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:27.150
I'm going to use dissolved is always actually better for this one because it is going toe.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.380
Um,

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.550
let's like this school position.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:36.220
It is going to be better because we don't want things to any made up and down.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:41.480
We just want the screen toe appear and disappear after two seconds.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.660
So actually,

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.570
I have whenever you want to use this time,

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.020
delay toe clothes and overlay,

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:55.750
you have tow slack this frame and go to interaction and use after delay in this interaction

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.650
and used time over here and close the overly.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.800
Now we're going to see this.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.110
And if we click over here,

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.590
submit overly Summit review over living dough.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.540
And if we click over here,

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.090
you can see thank you.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.420
And it is going to disappear after two seconds.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.770
So this is the interaction we wanted,

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:20.650
and we have created it using slap ID and time delay.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.390
So I hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.770
If you have any questions,

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:29.500
are you want to ask me anything about prototyping In fig MMA,

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.180
you can always ask me,

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.290
Let's move on to the next lesson.
