00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.810
in this lesson.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.440
We're going toe deep dive into mawr about the interface off Sigma and what we can do We're

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.960
here Different panels,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.720
different layers asserts frames things like that.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.280
So let's get started now You can see I created this team.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.380
This is my team than you.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.910
Exciting You can see over here.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.440
If you want to create a new project,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:33.420
you can click over here New project and I'm going to name it Food De And these are

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.630
different sharing settings.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.460
Everyone that land you excited can address.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.110
For example,

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.000
if I invite one more team member,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.600
they can addict this file.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.230
So I'm going to click on a dead create project so you can see your hair I have already

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.890
created You can add the description over here Yams,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.050
app for us,

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.350
things like that.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.420
So now you can see my file.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.330
So if we go back to fig hma recent files,

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.600
you can see this is my app So I'm going toe double click and open it and it will take some

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.750
time because it is stored on cloud.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.980
So here is my yum zap You can see over here and on the right.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.550
You can see,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.570
we have never to open up a file.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.160
We have designed prototype and could So these are the three things three panels you're

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.150
going to see on our hair on this side,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.750
we have layers and assets.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.860
So layers are basically our all these frames.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.810
And inside these frames,

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.250
we have different objects,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.440
so you can see it.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.750
We're here also.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.590
You can see we're here.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.360
We have pages.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.000
So inside pages,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.140
we have wire frames,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.650
yams,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.170
app and style guy in components.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.150
So these are the three bitches I have created within this project.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.760
And you can see within this file and you can add new pages if you want to.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.050
You can add new bitch.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.950
And,

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.690
um,

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.550
let's delete this right click delete.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.630
So this is yams are these are the wire frame.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.030
This is style guide component.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.490
So these are three pages,

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.510
then we have these assets.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.600
So assets are basically of a component.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.860
So if you create a component,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.890
you can use them again and again.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.920
We will get back components in the next few lessons so you can see right now we have a lot

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.880
of different components.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.650
So if a drag component I can easily drag and drop it anywhere inside my project.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.770
Similarly,

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.190
this shows you you click on this arrow,

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.570
it is going to show you pages again and sometimes it is hidden.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.300
So if you have something like this and don't find where are my babies?

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.550
You are going to click over here.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.340
Then we have on the right.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.350
We have a few local styles thes air.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.970
The textiles I have created.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.850
These are few color styles I have created.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.650
You can use them again and again.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.390
And this is the court panel.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.310
This is prototype and this is design.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.430
So in prototype,

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.200
you were going to prototype your app like this one.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.830
You can see what?

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.780
Here They're a lot off different flows that it is going to flow from one to another one.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.050
We can also,

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.740
if you click outside off over here,

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.760
you can see we have device options.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.220
You can click on iPhone pro,

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.760
uh,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.520
Max iPhone 11.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.460
All these different devices you want to show your prototype in.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.840
And what is the moral?

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.450
You're going to use the background color for it?

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.740
Um,

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.030
starting frame.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.730
We're going to start from logging.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.670
So these are the options than we have on design.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.680
We have local styles,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.560
background color.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.070
We have already discussed eso.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.370
These are different things You're going to get in court.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.520
Gord is actually showing what is the cord on this item?

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.790
So if we click over here,

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.890
you can see this is a CS escort for webs,

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.600
Website's R us and right for Apple Devices.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.220
This is Android Court for this object I have selected on the left.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.590
You can see this is the icon.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.650
This this'll icon is going to represent frames.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.400
So whenever you have frames,

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.130
you are going to see this icon over here and everything inside it over here.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.790
So this is actually ah components.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.790
So it has this diamond shape.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.400
So all diamond shapes are components than we have this these These are different groups.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.450
You can see we're here.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.110
You can open them up.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.290
You can also open these components.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.150
We're going to get back to components later on.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.820
But this is how this is a shape for examples.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.080
All these icons that show that this is this type off layer like you can see profiling

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.060
settings is a text.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.250
Leah.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.550
So it has to you were here.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.270
So these are different settings.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.800
For example,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.730
like this logo.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:58.380
It is a factor.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.100
So it has a vector logo over here.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.200
Eso all these different things.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.590
So if we click on image,

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.270
let's see,

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.030
here is the image icon so you can see this is your image you can instantly find where your

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.730
file is.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:12.470
Your images,

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.850
your your text is so you can recognize them by these small icons on the left.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.470
Now,

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.240
if you want to move this project toe another project,

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.730
for example,

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.080
right now it is in jobs.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.330
I want to move it.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.240
You're going to click over here,

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.440
move to project,

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.350
and I'm going to move it to foodie app.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:41.790
So now you can see it has been moved to foodie app and now it's so say's foodie ab slash

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:42.750
thumbs up.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.950
Okay.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.140
Similarly,

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.320
you can show version history What wasa version history?

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.850
How I edited all this fire you can see over here.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:59.100
And these are this is a version history off my previous 30 days I can switch back to anyone

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.100
.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.120
So if I click over here,

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.150
it is going to Swiss back toe on the last one.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.750
So let's Let's not try it.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.190
You can also hide version history,

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.180
published styles and components export.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.530
These designs duplicate this project.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.190
Rename or delete,

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.510
mostly we have to rename.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.890
So you click over here.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.050
Uh,

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.550
I can bring him to yams.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.660
Recipes,

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:30.310
recipe Be at something like that.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.850
So you can see this is how you're going to rename.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:33.770
Okay,

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.450
so that is some off.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.930
The familiarity with this interferes.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.770
Let's move on to the next lesson where we're going toe dive into these tools and see what

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.950
are these tools and how we can use them.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.180
So let's move on to the next lesson.
