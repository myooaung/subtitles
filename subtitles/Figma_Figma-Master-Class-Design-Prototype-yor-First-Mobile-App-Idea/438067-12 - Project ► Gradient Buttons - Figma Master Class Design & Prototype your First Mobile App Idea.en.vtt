00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Now you have learned all about radiance,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.630
Phil colors Everything.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:10.920
Now is the time for your assignment on your assignment is that you have to create a linear

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.350
burden.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.550
Lini Ingredient Burden Like this I have created and always mention your name that Grady in

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.080
Britain by Sarah by Julius or Whatever your name is,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.920
because it's easier for me to,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.960
you know,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.200
feedback.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.950
Give feedback so it's easier for me to give feedback.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.770
So Gedeon Britain's create two buttons with any colors you like.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.410
They must have some colors that the text is visible on them.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.000
So don't try toe create a burden.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.430
The were the text is difficult to read.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.550
So this is your next assignment.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.450
Brilliant burdens by you.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.480
So I'm looking forward to seeing this assignment.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.030
You can see this on the screen,

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.240
right?

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.520
Noise?

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.570
I there is no explanation needed,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.960
so make sure you create them and I'm reading for your assignment.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.450
So start reading now.
