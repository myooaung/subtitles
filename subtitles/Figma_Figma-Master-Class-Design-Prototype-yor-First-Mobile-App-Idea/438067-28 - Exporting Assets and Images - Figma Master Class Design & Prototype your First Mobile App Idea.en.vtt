00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.930
in this lesson,

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.840
we're going to talk about exporting your images and assets.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.390
Now,

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.630
this is very important.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.590
If you are designing for an android app or and I s app,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.250
there are different settings or different export options for both the design systems.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.520
So,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.260
for example,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.980
like you can see,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.730
this is my android app and it has been designed for an android device.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.380
So whenever you are exporting your images,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.940
for example,

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.920
your ministrations,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.180
they are your images for example,

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.690
your PNG images or any buttons or anything you have to export it into different sizes.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.240
So there are different android devices there are They use different sizes to support that

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.000
app.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.890
So let me show you a quick article Over here.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.120
You can see this is a quick article on medium dealing with diversity and these are

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.980
different.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.170
Pockets are deep EI buckets.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.800
I called the resolution buckets for android devices.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.850
I have a full fledge separate course on android device and designing.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.890
But Google material,

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:23.660
where I have discussed all these just you have to remember that 0.75 acts 75% 1 next 1.523

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.170
and four.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.600
These are the things you have to export for.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.950
Let me show you.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.010
If you moved to Fig MMA,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.280
for example this bottom bar you have to export.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.640
So I have selected this bottom bar for example,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.810
this one And if you go over here,

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.150
you can see there is an export option.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.530
So if you want,

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.940
remove some export option.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.850
You have toe klik minus.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.510
And if you want to add,

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.950
you have to add ahead.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.480
And this is actually the size it shows.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:59.630
It shows one X one next means the same 100% 150% 200% 300% 400%.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.370
So I'm going to select 400% because I actually wanted toe have all these sizes.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.420
So these are the export options for an android device.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.100
You can see we're here at the bottom.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.890
It says export boredom bars.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.950
It is a name off this group.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.550
So von x,

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:27.520
100% 100% 304 101 150% and 75% which is going to be smaller than the size we have designed

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.520
.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.610
We have designed in 100%.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.960
So these are the export options you can also change the file type of our hair PNG is going

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.400
to be You can say it is going to be transparent at the background.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.590
If you go to this preview,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.090
you can see the background is transparent for these three buttons Oh are moving Britain's

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.150
or whatever you call them.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.800
If I goto jpg,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.930
it is going to have a white bag now.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.380
Actually,

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.010
it is showing me this preview but it is going to have a white background.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.450
All others are Let me remove all others.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:16.100
Next remove all these And now if I shift o jpg still,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.790
it is showing me the wrong preview anyhow,

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.260
So the J P G or J Big image is going to have a white background.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.260
I guess so that's exported.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.650
I'm going to press export and I'm going to go to desktop and let's see if it is how it has

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.180
white background or not.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.590
So you can see or hear it has,

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.500
like background.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.690
It has white background.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.880
You can see if I drag it into fig Mauer here.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.390
You can see if I zoom in and it has a white background.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.050
Okay,

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.110
so this is goingto happen.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.700
I already told you that J.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.960
Peg image is going to have a white background.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.420
So anything you want to export and you,

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.260
for example,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.270
most of the images in a website,

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.290
for example,

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.820
this image you might be using Jay big image,

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.280
because a very big image a very big background image.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.120
You have to use something like this.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.910
For example,

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.450
in my this yum Zab on this log in screen.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.250
If I zoom into this log in screen,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.650
um,

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:26.630
this slogan screen you can see we have,

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.220
ah,

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.200
background overhead,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.650
this image background.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.300
If I have to export this image background at the back,

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.650
you can see it's is,

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.000
um all these I went toe group them together.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.440
So this is my whole background.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.350
You can see So this is going to be my background.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.770
So I am going toe press overhead,

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:50.450
export.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:56.840
And I'm going to use a jpg because Jeb is going to give me the smallest size for this whole

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.550
background.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:04.860
So this is going to help you whenever you are exporting for websites or anything that is

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.600
very large,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.530
very large image.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.290
You have to use J peg image rather than PNG.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.620
PNG must be used for,

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.350
for example,

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.050
these icons or maybe thes buttons or something like that.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.010
Mostly,

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.110
these icons are going to be an SPD for make,

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.950
so I'm going to go to that now.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:31.570
So you have learned that when you have to export for for android devices,

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.090
you have to add different densities of different sizes.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.680
For example,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.440
two x three x four x,

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.680
the's different sizes so far and IOS device.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.470
If you're designing for an IOS device,

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:53.610
let me show you over here so we only need one x 100% 200% and 300%.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:59.000
So these are the three actually sizes which are used by IOS devices.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.240
So if you're designing for IOS devices,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.170
you have to export your assets into these three sides.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.350
So let's go back.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.420
Tofig MMA and we are,

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.140
for example,

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.060
I'm going to select this screen If I want o export this whole screen,

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:20.660
I'm going to export PNG and I'm going to export into these three sizes one next to X entry

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.890
X.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:27.340
You can see the preview on if I export over here it is going toe export three different

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.890
files.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.880
So I'm going to see what we're here in the desktop and ah,

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:40.740
here we have thes three files so you can see this suffix is actually the file name which is

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:49.390
added 101 Add two x forces the name off the file and then the suffix is actually going to

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:55.950
show you that it is the percent age or this is the density or this is ah,

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.280
you could scale off that image.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.430
So these are two different things.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:05.970
You have tow use in your mobile labs for numbers you were designing Similarly,

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.330
for IOS,

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.040
you can see this is actually iris screen.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.420
You have to use thes three so far are us for our U.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.740
S.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.640
T sizes one x two x three x For Android.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.210
We have actually four or five sizes.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:28.930
One next 1.5 x two x three x four X point sound five x or 75% So these are all the

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.750
different sizes you have to export.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.470
BND is going to have transparent background.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.910
Jeopardy is not going to have transparent background.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.980
SPD is for illustrations,

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:42.230
for example like this illustration SPD scalable vector graphic.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.260
I mostly used my icons and my illustrations.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.050
I know me export them in excess SVG file form it.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.110
Pdf is a basically document.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:56.870
If you are designing a document and you want to export or you want to show your designs

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.000
into a pdf file,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.950
you have to use the speedy of to export.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.200
Similarly,

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:10.340
once you have set all the export options for all your different different screens,

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.150
you can go over here toe sorry or here not over here,

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.760
but in this menu.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:22.630
And you can use file export so you can export all the different illustrations and

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.170
everything.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:30.050
If you select everything over here that was select everything and then I can go to export.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:35.660
And these are all the different assets I'm going to export 11 SX.

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:42.300
So if you have a very big you can say project and you want to export all the assets at once

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:42.300
,

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:48.490
you have to select all the hardboard and use this export options option in the file menu

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.020
and click on exporters.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.870
It is going to export all different resolutions.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:09:01.190
So that is all about exporting your assets for your android devices for your ah,

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:02.680
I use devices,

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.440
apple devices and for your websites to.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.170
So I hope you have learned something created in this lesson.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.270
If you have any questions,

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.820
always ask me.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.000
Keep on moving and keep on designing.
