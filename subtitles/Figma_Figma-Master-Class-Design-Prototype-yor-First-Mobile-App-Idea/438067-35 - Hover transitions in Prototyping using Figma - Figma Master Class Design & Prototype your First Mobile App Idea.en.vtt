00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.620
In this lesson, we're going to see one of another feature of prototyping in sigma,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.075
which is while hovering.

00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:13.845
So this is another trigger.

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:17.010
Basically we have to animate something or moved to

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.235
another screen when you are hovering something.

00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:23.250
So let me show you how actually I have used it.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.130
So now you can see this is my design.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.100
I actually designed this website recently,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.130
right now in development phase.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.780
Now if you look over here,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.105
you can see when I hover over this link,

00:00:36.105 --> 00:00:38.175
it fades to blue color,

00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:42.190
which is actually my whole overstate for my web design.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.200
So whenever I hover over this,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.730
you can see over here.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.475
So you can see the color has changed.

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:50.840
So this is actually,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.625
I made this prototype to show my developer, my web developer,

00:00:55.625 --> 00:01:03.065
that how you are going to apply this whole effect over this navigation.

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:05.345
Similarly, you can see over here,

00:01:05.345 --> 00:01:07.850
same I have did for these buttons over here,

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.750
call a double six similarly, the bottom one.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.295
So this is how I showed him or explained

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:20.900
to my developer that this is how you are going to use this,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.285
these colors over these buttons.

00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:27.440
So today I'm going to show you how you can easily create this.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.540
This is a simple exercise.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.955
You can see over here.

00:01:31.955 --> 00:01:35.210
And this is very, very, really easy.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.115
So there is just to things you don't need to do a lot of things.

00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:43.205
Now, let me show you,

00:01:43.205 --> 00:01:45.635
let me rearrange these for you.

00:01:45.635 --> 00:01:49.670
Okay, so this is going to be our default screen,

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.485
or the first one.

00:01:51.485 --> 00:01:57.305
So this is going to be our first one where we have all the states,

00:01:57.305 --> 00:02:00.935
all the buttons in normal state.

00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:04.565
Normal state means that they are going to be

00:02:04.565 --> 00:02:09.650
in just simple way that there is no hover animation, nothing.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.995
So this is going to be default state or normal state.

00:02:12.995 --> 00:02:15.950
Then when someone hovers over this button.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.990
Now for each homework,

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.415
for this one and this one,

00:02:19.415 --> 00:02:22.505
I am going to have two different screens.

00:02:22.505 --> 00:02:24.155
So you can see here,

00:02:24.155 --> 00:02:28.565
let's call it over button

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:35.300
and let's call this or link.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.740
So what I actually did, let's delete these.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.900
So you have created, for example,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.420
you have created this screen or here, let me zoom in.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.590
So sim one symbol but on one simple link with grey color

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.850
and make sure you have a touch target or heat area around it.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.605
So what I did is I just drew a rectangle. Let me show you.

00:03:00.605 --> 00:03:03.935
So I just drew a rectangle over here,

00:03:03.935 --> 00:03:09.770
made it 0%, and move it inside this try now,

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.870
at the bottom of this try now.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.770
Now the text is that the top and we have a hidden layer behind this.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.215
So this is what we are going to use.

00:03:18.215 --> 00:03:20.900
To prototype or link our prototypes.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.350
So this is just a simple bot and 24 pixel is a roundness and this is the size and width.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.850
This is just a shape.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.485
That's all we need.

00:03:30.485 --> 00:03:34.889
Now, let's, let's make it a bit smaller.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.170
That's great.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.110
Okay, so now we have our default state ready.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.095
Now I am going to replicate this by pressing holding and pressing

00:03:45.095 --> 00:03:48.575
art option D And just dragging it like this.

00:03:48.575 --> 00:03:52.145
And then we are going to drag it like this.

00:03:52.145 --> 00:03:55.160
So this is going to be our default.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.620
This is going to be our hoover button state.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.775
And this is going to be our Over link state.

00:04:04.775 --> 00:04:11.675
Okay, so what we are going to do just we are going to change the color.

00:04:11.675 --> 00:04:15.095
Let's use something over here.

00:04:15.095 --> 00:04:19.595
And I'm going to go here like this.

00:04:19.595 --> 00:04:22.070
Use this.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.220
Okay, so you can see in this state I haven't changed

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.310
anything for this because if I try to change it,

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.000
when someone hovers over, both are going to change.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.170
Now, Let's prepare the second one.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.075
So here on this hyperlink,

00:04:38.075 --> 00:04:40.160
nothing is going to happen to this button.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:48.020
But this link is actually going to change its color from this grey to the scrape black.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.990
Okay, that is all we need.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.850
So now we are going to move to this prototype and we are going to link these.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.105
First. We are going to link this one to this one.

00:04:59.105 --> 00:05:02.210
And on our interaction rather than onClick,

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.005
We are going to press this vile hovering.

00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:09.020
So all these while hovering, while pressing,

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.080
these are almost the same mouse enter mouse leaves.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.800
These are almost the same like hoovering.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.810
But they have some other options like maybe you want to animate something.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.330
These are for those key and gamepad is actually the key you pressed, for example,

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.265
four or five or six,

00:05:28.265 --> 00:05:32.225
or P, o you any key on your keyboard.

00:05:32.225 --> 00:05:35.090
Right now we don't need to go into that.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.865
So vile hovering we are going to select while hovering.

00:05:37.865 --> 00:05:41.885
And for the animation I'm going to use,

00:05:41.885 --> 00:05:44.690
let's use dissolved first.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:50.225
So I'm going to use ease in and out 300 milliseconds.

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:52.715
And then for this one,

00:05:52.715 --> 00:05:54.020
I am going to move,

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.305
link it to this one,

00:05:55.305 --> 00:05:58.910
the same, same settings over here.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.660
Now let's see how it actually ends up.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.850
So now you can see really cool.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.230
So whenever i over this,

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.340
you can see how it actually animates and fades to that color.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.380
Really great, really great.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.195
Similarly for this one.

00:06:14.195 --> 00:06:17.220
Oops, what is happening over here?

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.240
Let's see, what is the problem.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.840
Dissolve is in, out o,

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.350
so it is not onClick,

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.230
We have to select on while hoovering.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.615
Similarly for this one.

00:06:35.615 --> 00:06:38.330
Oh, very nice, very nice,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.465
really, really cool effect.

00:06:41.465 --> 00:06:48.605
Okay, so now you have learned how to use this vile hovering in prototype using sigma.

00:06:48.605 --> 00:06:54.335
I hope yet that you can use these affects in your FISMA prototypes.

00:06:54.335 --> 00:06:59.480
You can use them in your web design prototypes like I did over here in

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:05.060
this prototype to show my developer that this is how the whole effect is going to work.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.370
So I hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.245
See you soon in another lesson.

00:07:09.245 --> 00:07:11.670
Till then, take care and bye.
