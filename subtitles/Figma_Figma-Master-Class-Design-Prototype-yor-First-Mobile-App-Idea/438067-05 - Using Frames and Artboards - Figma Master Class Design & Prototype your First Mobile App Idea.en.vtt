00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
Now in this our first lesson,

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.410
we are going toe,

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.670
create a new frame or art board,

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.970
and we're going to manipulate it and see what we can do with it.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.050
So let's get Stockett now.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.210
I'm going to move to my practice project and I'm going to create a new file and it is going

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.980
to be untitled by defiled,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.150
so it will take some time to Lord or here like that.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.350
So now we have this blank canvas.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.230
If you want to change the background color,

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.560
let's use like this one,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.960
and you can see here we have layers,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.180
assets and pages.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.560
If you you can see by the file their Hizb age one.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.530
And if we click over here is going to show me more pages so you can add more bitches over

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.940
here like this.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.150
Right now I'm in page one,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.500
and the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going toe slack.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.200
This frame do not click over here because we have slicing over here,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.620
another tool hidden.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.520
So click on frame and you can draw your own frame,

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.120
for example,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.020
like this one.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:16.510
So this is actually the victors 3 42 by 5 80 And if we again click on frame or press F key

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.380
on the keyboard,

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.210
it is going to show us phone different options or design different sizes and frames and art

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.100
boards for iPhone.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.130
Then we have.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.910
And right over here,

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:29.340
for example,

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.160
if we click on it,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.700
this is android standard size.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.330
And if we want to create more are more screens.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.920
Over here,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.740
we're going toe your frame and let's create a tablet frame over here.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.420
So tablet many so you can see this difference between the sizes and that's cleared another

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.470
one and again,

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.050
F and I am going to go toe gas stop,

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.190
and I'm going to design a website.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.050
So I'm going to click over here on a desktop.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.480
So this this is how you can create multiple different frames or art boards.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.600
You can double click over here on the top,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.990
and it is going to show we're here,

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.570
for example,

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.320
that stop art board.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.130
You can rename them or you can,

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.970
um,

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.850
domestic Or here,

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.170
uh,

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.550
this is Android.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.850
Our lord.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.580
Make sure you always rename them,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.770
because sometimes there are multiple or many art boards,

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.750
and you forget what waas the art board you were working on what it does.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.650
So I bared are book.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.090
So you can see here we have three different art boards and if we click over here,

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.660
you can see we have different options on the right.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.820
This is our design dab.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.550
We are right knowing designed tab.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.800
And on the left we have pages and within page one,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.340
we have three art books.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.220
So if we click on place to this is empty,

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.450
we don't have anything over here on.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.240
If we click outside off anyone,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.840
anything,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.980
this is our file.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:14.590
So let's rename it toe Let's call it frames and art books.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.990
So this is how you can create different artworks.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.580
Now,

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.230
if you want to create something for which is not listed in the frames over here,

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.680
so it is not listed.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.650
For example,

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.800
we have this apple watch.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.050
We want to create something for Motorola G watch or something like that.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.020
So we are going to go head to this material design material or are you re sources slash

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.560
devices Now,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.140
over here,

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.190
you can see we have platforms.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.940
We have screen dimension aspect ratios can hide in DP's.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.950
So this is what you are going to use.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:50.850
So,

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.320
uh,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.230
in the platform,

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.150
if we click over here,

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.250
you can see this is windows.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.380
This is was X on.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.990
This is Mac.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.190
This is Apple watch.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.670
You can see or hear 38.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.830
42 women.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.630
Then if we go toe here so you can see this is LG G watch.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:16.670
So it is 1 87 by 1 97 and then we have 2 13 by 2 30 So if we If I'm designing for something

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.390
like that for a watch that is not elicit over here,

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.100
for example,

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:29.100
like you can see Moto 3 60 I can use these sizes to 41 by 2 44 So I'm going to go back and

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.550
I'm going to kick over here.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.470
Onda set of it to 42 by 2 44 Something like that.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:50.850
So it waas 2 40 one bite of 44 to 41 by 2 44 2 41 by 2 40 foot.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:05:01.100
So you can see now this is your art board for this blue LD watch or Motorola watch so you

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:07.620
can use this one toe design something So this is how you create different sizes and frames

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.850
and art boards for your design work.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.210
So if you click on or here you can see,

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.260
we have different options.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.680
This is the X value,

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.110
which is?

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.910
It shows that it is what it is away from over here.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.780
If you move over here like this,

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.040
you can see X and Y values are changing.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.810
We know what on.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.450
We're not concerned about accent values off this art border frame.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.990
We're mostly concerned about this weight and height.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.740
You can also lock the constraints.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.350
So now it is going toe grow in proportion.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.520
Okay,

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.550
so 4 50 for example,

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.550
If I your 600 is going to go like this,

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.850
it is goingto grow in proportion.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.690
Let's school back.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:59.470
Come on and or control Z So these are options for tradition.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.160
I think we don't need to read this anyhow.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.560
Still,

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.180
we can use these are corner radius If you want toe use corner radio.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.330
This is clip content.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.720
So whatever you are going toe have over here,

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.330
for example,

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.310
this you can see now it is clipping my content.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.510
So I have drawn a rectangle on this and it shows Haftar attended.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.530
And if I click over here and remove this,

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.600
you can see I can see beyond this art boards right now,

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.380
it is not clipping my content.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.050
So this is about clip content.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.990
This is very important and I think that is all.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.400
We don't need toe very much about it.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.990
If you want Want to align these art boards?

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:49.350
You are goingto press shift or hold your ship key and click and select all these art boards

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:50.890
by selecting their names.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:51.530
And you,

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.900
Can you stop a line like this?

00:06:53.900 --> 00:07:00.860
You can also use the study up they are going to use have some space about around it.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.200
So if you have selected more objects you can see more than two objects you can see we have

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.500
this spacing options multiple option Um,

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.240
in fig Ma,

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.650
this is a really cool feature.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.050
You can adjust the space,

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.130
for example.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.930
I want to have something like 80 pixels gap between them.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.650
So this is how you can have that.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.370
So this is all about frames and our board,

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:26.660
how you can arrange them,

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.730
how you can manage them.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.880
What is this clip content and what it does?

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.450
I think you haven't assured this.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.370
Let's move on to the next lesson and dig more into figment
