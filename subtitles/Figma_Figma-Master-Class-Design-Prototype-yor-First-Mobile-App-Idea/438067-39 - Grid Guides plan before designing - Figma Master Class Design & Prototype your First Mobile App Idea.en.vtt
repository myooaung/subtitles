00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.610
now,

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.150
in this video,

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.980
we're going toe get started.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.230
And before that,

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.000
we're going toe handle our grades and they are great and we're going to have some

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.390
guidelines so we can easily define them before we get started and align our major elements

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.390
,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.610
like our top navigation or bottom navigation according to those guidelines.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.750
So what I'm going to do is I have a team than you excited.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.460
Then I have a project in him figment class,

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.660
and I'm going to click on new file.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.950
You can also click in drafts on this new file,

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.450
and you can create a new file.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.510
So once you create a new file,

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.980
it is going to be untitled.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:52.850
So we're going to rename it and let's rename it to free GMA food app.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.420
So here we have.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.200
Let's change the background color,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.050
so I'm going to go with a darker background because it's easier toe view things over here.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.410
So here we have it.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.150
First thing I would like you to create over here is your vile frames,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.120
so you can create your wire frames on paper,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.480
pen and pencil and just take the screen short and get them over here.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.630
That is all you don't need to draw your You can say wire frames in fig MMA.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.330
If you want to draw your wife rooms over here,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.610
tax up to you now I will create three pages.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.220
One is going to be wire frames.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.770
Second is going to be our design.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.230
Um,

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.000
next scholars are us.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.900
Yeah,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.960
or let's call it men design.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.230
And then we can have another page called Styx Guide.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.550
Where we were,

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.270
all our components will be,

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.850
So this is going to be on a structure.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.720
Now we're going to go to main design,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.420
and the first thing we're going to do is we're going to press A or F G to go to this art

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.550
boards or frames.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.800
So on the right,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.620
we have iPhone 11 pro Max 11 pro.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.900
I'm going to go with 11 pro,

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.930
and here we have our art board now,

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.110
before going on,

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.260
because each frame is going to have the same settings as the next one.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.320
So we're going to define our layout grade over here.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.950
So let's press this plus icon over here,

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.470
and we are going to go toe columns and we're going to use four columns over here.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.600
Let's center,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.100
Align Aid And our each column will be almost 70 bigs wide,

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.900
and God will be 20.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.200
So this is going to be our columns and settings for our layout grade.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.750
So once we have defined overtly out grade,

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.110
we're going to move to the next step,

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.220
which is going to be our guidelines.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:04.170
So make sure you have ruler over here on top and on the left so you can see on the right

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.310
this menu we have rulers turned on.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.350
So make sure you have learnt rulers turned on you can press shift in our to turn them on.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.950
So once you have done them and you can see done off and on,

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.460
So once they're on,

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.550
we're going to drag a ruler over here,

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:29.180
and we're going to place the 1st 1 on 24 pixels over here,

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.260
and then we're going to drag and drop the next one at 72 pixels over here.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.430
So this is going to be for the alignment of our icons.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:45.010
Our icons are going to be touching this 80 over here that this is going to be our such bar

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.680
over here.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.300
And if we go down here will be our at 1 50 Big Oezil's.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.800
We're here.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.820
You can see on the left.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.150
If I go over here on the left,

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:06.680
you can see the value is 1 50 So we're going to leave it like this and let's drag the last

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.450
one which is going to be over here.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.250
So if you are unsure that how you can you are going to drag these.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.470
You can create your own element.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.890
So here,

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:18.410
for example,

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.420
I'm going tohave Height off 60 pigs is for the bottom navigation.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:30.460
So I'm going toe create a box over here off 60 pixels just for temporary,

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.590
just temporary box and I'm going to align this.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.490
So you have seen that I have clicked outside toe,

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.480
make it universal guideline.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.210
So we have three guidelines at the top.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.250
Similarly,

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:52.760
you can do the same over here so you can create an asset off your rectangle off 24 pixel

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.150
size and we're going to align it at the top.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.550
And if you don't know how toe make exact 24 pixels.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.070
Just create these elements like this temporary elements,

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.800
and we're going to drag and drop it like this.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.250
It is going to snap over here.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.540
This is really good,

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.560
because we have to be something.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.610
We have something like this.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.030
So let's create now,

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.300
make it side 72 you can see it is snapping correctly.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.990
We have it on 72.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.940
Then we're going to be on 1 50 That s cord.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.330
We have it on 1 50 So our main guidelines are complete.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.820
Let's,

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.590
um,

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.210
make sure that these are actually global guidelines.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:44.090
So I'm going toe klik outside and drag and drop it over here like this,

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:52.650
that I'm going to make it 1 50 Click outside drag and drop it over here like this.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.090
So I think we have to over here.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.550
So let's remove it and create a new one.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.650
Let's drag it and drop it over here.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:11.650
So this is how we're going to lay out our main interface and how we're going to get started

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.650
.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.120
This is going to be our canvas.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.450
So once we were going to complete for screen,

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.980
we're just going to replicate this one.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:25.400
So click on this press Artur Option key and we're going to duplicate it like this so you

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:32.950
can also hold your shift key to all can shift key to have it aligned in in the same way in

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.050
the same line,

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.640
which just exactly where your first frame is.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.850
So this is how you actually do it.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.250
So this is our this is going to be our first screen.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.590
And once we have this,

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.250
let's rename it toe,

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.820
um,

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.110
in draw or something like this.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.590
And let's Delia Rex used this rectangle.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.640
We had one rectangle over here,

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.570
so let's draw a rectangle for the background.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.070
To be this full size over here like this,

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:14.150
express one to zoom into the fit and we have this background.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.050
Let's call it PG or background.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.300
Now we're going to drag our image inside it,

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:26.130
and we're going toe place inside this container and move it around where we warned the

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:26.740
image to be
