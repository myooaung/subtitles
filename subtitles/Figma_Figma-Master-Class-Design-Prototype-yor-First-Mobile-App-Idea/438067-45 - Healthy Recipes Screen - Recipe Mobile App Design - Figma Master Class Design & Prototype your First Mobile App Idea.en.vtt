00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
So now I'm creating,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:06.750
actually,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.930
the last off this four screens,

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.000
which is healthy now here is a tricky part.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.910
That is why I have actually stopped over here and started recording.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.350
Now you can see over here we have this background.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.190
So if we try to move it over here now,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.880
actually healthy is going to move inside the screen rather than over here.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.020
So,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.550
uh,

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.960
when we have to do something like this,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.850
we have to actually move this whole navigation.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.710
So let's use this school,

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.850
move them outside.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:52.950
So we have this whole navigation with the background.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:53.330
Come on,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.850
G,

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.750
this is other top they have.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.290
Okay,

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:05.490
So what we have to do is we have toe move this actually on the left.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.490
So this is actually going to move like this,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.810
So means is going to go out.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.750
And now we are going toe change the stats.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.790
So this is going to be inactive.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.570
This background is going to move toe healthy.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.650
And,

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.150
uh,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.650
now it will be a pit outside of healthy,

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.480
and the rich will be.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.830
I think this is good and,

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.730
uh well,

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.540
is healthy.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.170
Okay,

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.750
So active state inactive is going to be hidden and,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.550
um,

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.390
next move it in the middle.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.090
Hopes.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.140
So we actually want to move this background the middle of this.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.400
Okay,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.400
so this looks good.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.020
We have moved everything over here,

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.260
and this is going to be like this.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.370
The rest is the same.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.290
I am going to replace all the images and I will meet you in the next lesson where we will

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.170
we will be actually animating these and actually trying toe prototype this section We're

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.450
here.
