00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,970
One of the best things you can do as a content creator is make it a habit to consume lots of content.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,400
Renowned author Stephen King has a great book called On Writing a Memoir of the Craft.

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,280
In it, he discusses how important it is for aspiring writers to dedicate time to reading.

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,450
He writes, The real importance of reading is that it creates an ease and intimacy with the process

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,070
of writing.

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,340
One comes to the country of the writer with one's papers and identification.

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,630
Pretty much in order.

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,390
Constant reading will pull you into a place, a mindset, if you like, the phrase where you can write

9
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,520
eagerly and without self-consciousness.

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,340
It also offers you a constantly growing knowledge of what has been done and what hasn't, what is trite

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,490
and what is fresh, what works and what just lies there, dying or dead on the page.

12
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,530
The more you read, the less apt you are to make a fool of yourself with your pen or word processor.

13
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,920
Consuming content is also great for ideas synthesis.

14
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,830
You see, there's really no such thing as an original idea.

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,240
This is kind of a weird concept to think about, but it's true.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,080
What we call new ideas are simply new combinations of existing elements.

17
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,340
When you immerse yourself in those existing elements, you can really get your creative juices flowing

18
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,500
and encourage the ideation process.

19
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,230
Now, when I say you should consume lots of content, I don't just mean content that's relevant to your

20
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,710
niche.

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,200
You should definitely be reading other blogs in your space, but also take the time to read books,

22
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,120
science, poetry, history, even social media posts.

23
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:43,480
You'd be surprised how two seemingly unrelated concepts can suddenly click and form an incredible idea.

24
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,370
And often this happens when you least expect it.

25
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,790
There's a concept known as unconscious creativity when you're working on a problem and then you stop

26
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,830
and do something else.

27
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:58,750
Your unconscious mind keeps working in the background until suddenly you have that light bulb moment

28
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:04,180
in the shower or in your car or in some other situation where you're not actively trying to come up

29
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,990
with ideas.

30
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:11,350
So consume lots of content, immerse yourself in all those existing elements, and then step back and

31
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,930
let unconscious creativity work its magic.
