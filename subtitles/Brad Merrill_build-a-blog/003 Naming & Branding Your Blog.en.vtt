00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.070

Let's talk for a moment about branding, the first question many people have is whether you should use



2

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.090

your own name or create a separate brand name for your blog.



3

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.030

That really depends on your preference.



4

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.200

Your personal name is more open ended and can always evolve with you.



5

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.050

But a separate brand is better suited for building a sellable asset or something that's going to be



6

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.520

larger than yourself.



7

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.350

If you think there's a chance you'll ever part with your blog, or if you think it may grow to the point



8

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.900

where you have other contributors, it's probably best to create a separate brand.



9

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.970

That way, it's less dependent on you as an individual.



10

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.170

Naming is hard and it's probably my least favorite part of starting a new project.



11

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.830

You obviously want to come up with something you're happy with because you're going to be stuck with



12

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.670

it for a while.



13

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.720

But keep in mind, the name really doesn't matter all that much.



14

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.830

Your content is what really matters.



15

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.950

Everything else is secondary.



16

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.140

With that said, I do want to share some tips for coming up with a good name for your blog.



17

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.770

You can start by making a list of random words related to your topic or niche and then run those words



18

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.230

through thesaurus, dotcom to get some synonyms, throw in some adjectives or other words that you just



19

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.330

kind of like and play around with different combinations.



20

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.320

You can also take a look at other blogs in your niche, see what patterns you notice and draw some inspiration



21

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.820

from them.



22

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.230

If you're really stuck, you can try using one of the many name generators out there on the web.



23

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.290

Worldwide, Dotcom is probably my favorite example.



24

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.810

You just set a few parameters for the kind of names you're looking for and it'll give you a ton of ideas.



25

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.180

And by the way, your blog's name doesn't necessarily have to have any inherent meaning.



26

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.060

For example, what was a Twitter before Twitter?



27

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.360

What was a Google before Google?



28

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.550

It's up to you to create meaning around your brand.



29

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.390

As you're brainstorming ideas, you'll want to check to see whether your favorites are available as



30

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.920

domain names, and we'll actually do that together in the next section, but something to think about



31

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.050

ahead of time when it comes to domains.



32

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.000

I recommend going with a dot com, if possible, just because people still tend to trust it the most.



33

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.950

But I'll also say the extension matters less today than ever before.



34

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.010

So if you come up with a name that you really like that's not available as a dot com, that's OK.



35

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.000

Again, it's up to you to build a meaningful and recognizable brand.



36

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.880

Once you've decided on a name, you'll probably want a logo to represent your brand visually.



37

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.860

I typically design my logos myself, but I've also had great results working with 99 designs where for



38

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.260

a couple hundred bucks you can hold a design contest where dozens of designers all compete to create



39

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.710

a winning logo for you.



40

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.640

You can also use services like up work and fiber for design, but you have to watch out for low quality



41

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.620

designs and trademark infringement.



42

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.190

99 designs guarantees all of its designs to be unique and trademark.



43

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.760

So to me, that's worth the extra money.



44

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.100

If you don't personally have design skills and you're not ready to invest money into a logo, you could



45

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.770

also try a service like Cannava, which offers a number of free logo templates that you can customize



46

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.550

for your brand.
