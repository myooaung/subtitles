In the past, a major focus of SVO was this concept of keyword density, which is the percentage of

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:12,570
times a key word or phrase appears on a Web page compared to the total number of words on that page.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,590
Search engines use keyword density as a ranking signal to determine how relevant a page is to a particular

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,240
search term.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,130
If a keyword appears a bunch of times on a page, it would make sense to rank that page higher for that

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,090
keyword, right?

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:33,450
Unfortunately, the spammy marketers of the world figured out how that worked and started keyword stuffing

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:40,230
basically over optimizing their pages by including the same keyword or related keywords over and over

9
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,030
and over as many times as they could.

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,830
And the result was a bunch of pages ranking that weren't actually useful.

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,500
They just happened to have keywords littered all over the page with no regard for the quality of the

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,110
content.

13
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,220
Google's response came in 2011 with an algorithm update called Pande, which was intended to reduce

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:05,310
the rank of low quality sites and content farms while increasing the rank of higher quality sites that

15
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,350
are more useful to the end user.

16
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,250
One of the effects of the panda update is that keyword density is no longer a linear ranking signal.

17
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,990
So if your keyword density is too low, that tells Google that your page probably isn't relevant.

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,970
But it can also be too high.

19
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,600
And if it's too high, that tells Google you're probably a spammer.

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,750
Just stuffing your page with keywords.

21
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,360
Today, the ideal keyword density is somewhere between zero point five percent and 2.5 percent.

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,350
But rather than stressing about keyword density, just focus on creating a great resource and work keywords

23
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,160
into your content.

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,920
Naturally, if you use WordPress, you can enter your focus keyword into the host section in the Post

25
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,540
editor and it'll let you know if your content is over or under optimized.
