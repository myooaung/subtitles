00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.520

We live in a world based on systems where everything has to be scalable and everybody's obsessed with



2

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.260

the idea of passive income, but the fact is selling services and doing unscalable things could potentially



3

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.410

be the quickest route to profitability for your blog.



4

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.210

The reason is simple.



5

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.700

Client service businesses have very little overhead and generally require no upfront investment.



6

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.210

You basically just say you're in business, land your first client and start working and building a



7

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.090

service business on top of a blog is a really smart move because your blog showcases your expertise



8

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.970

and proves that you're the right person for the job.



9

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.050

You can offer one on one coaching, consulting, graphic design, photography or any other service that



10

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.820

you have the skills to provide.



11

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.990

By the way, a lot of people who offer services are afraid of giving away too much with their content.



12

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.770

They don't want to reveal their secret sauce or whatever because they figure people will just do it



13

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.520

themselves.



14

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.770

I say don't worry about that.



15

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.110

Give away everything, you know, for the DIY crowd, and plenty of people will still be willing to



16

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.650

hire you to do it for them or to hold their hand through the process.



17

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.050

Ultimately, the more free information you put out there, the more leverage and credibility you have.
