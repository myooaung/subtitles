1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,780
Let's talk about the mindset of a successful blogger.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:09,690
What does that look like and how can you set yourself up for success by getting into the right mindset?

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,040
One of the most important pieces of advice I can offer you if you plan on starting a blog or really

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,160
any new endeavor is to know your why.

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,030
It sounds a little cliche, but it matters.

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:29,180
Think about the overarching vision you have for your life and your career and determine how this project

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,140
fits into that long term vision.

8
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,740
What's your endgame?

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,490
Why do you want to embark on this journey?

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,390
For example, maybe you're really passionate about a topic and you want to share that passion with an

11
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,020
audience.

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,240
Maybe you want to start a business that allows you to live with a little more freedom and flexibility

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,250
in your lifestyle, or, hey, maybe you just want to earn more money, which is perfectly legitimate.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,910
If that's something that truly drives you, whatever your motivation, keep it in mind to keep you moving

15
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,480
forward, even when things get difficult.

16
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:07,190
Whenever you run into an obstacle, you can give yourself a boost by thinking back to the reason you

17
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,700
started in the first place.

18
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:16,790
Now, motivation is important, but to me what's more important is compounding that internal motivation.

19
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,130
With a healthy dose of discipline, you're not going to be super motivated all the time.

20
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,240
That's just reality.

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,420
Motivation often comes in waves.

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,020
One day you're super excited and just ready to take on the world.

23
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,510
The next day you feel like you're not making any progress and you just want to stay in bed.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,900
That's normal.

25
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,990
The solution, again, is discipline.

26
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:46,820
Commit to working on your blog and making tangible progress toward your goals every single day, even

27
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,890
when you don't feel particularly motivated.

28
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:56,660
This commitment, this habitual progress, is truly what separates world class performers from the rest.

29
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,060
Stephen King famously said amateurs sit and wait for inspiration.

30
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,580
The rest of us just get up and go to work.

31
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:11,700
If you're just getting started, this mindset stuff might feel a little off the wall, a little tangential,

32
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:17,070
but the fact is most blogs fizzle out long before they've had a chance to prosper.

33
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,080
There's a lot of competition out there and the odds are fundamentally stacked against you.

34
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,810
But when you're working with the right mindset, it's much easier to make everything else fall into

35
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,300
place.

36
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,520
No blogger has ever failed Midde keystroke.

37
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,960
Let me say that again.

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,810
No blogger has ever failed.

39
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,720
Midde keystroke failure comes when you stop executing.

40
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,910
Look, you may not have as much traffic as you want or as much influence as you want, or as much revenue

41
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,480
as you want.

42
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,080
But those things can always be improved.

43
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,000
You only fail if you give up and quit.

44
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:00,300
So if you can start with a strong sense of internal motivation and follow through with discipline and

45
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,260
habit in your execution, you will be unstoppable.

46
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,040
While we're on the topic of mindset, I should also mention that if money is one of your motivations,

47
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:16,310
your blog is going to be a business and it deserves to be treated like one with any new business.

48
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,860
They're going to be ups and downs and plenty of setbacks, and it's going to take a good deal of time

49
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,180
and effort to grow.

50
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,780
So make sure you're prepared when you start a blog.

51
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,540
What you're really doing is building a media company and a media company needs a business model.

52
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,930
In most cases, your blog is not the product.

53
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:42,290
What you're actually selling, what you're charging money for is some other product or service, ad

54
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,600
space consulting services, a book, a course or a physical product of some kind.

55
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,310
When you look at it from that perspective, a blog isn't all that different from any other business.

56
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,910
On a related note, it's helpful to think of your revenue model not as monetizing your blog, but as

57
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:04,970
providing a valuable product or service that improves the lives of your customers or clients.

58
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,040
It's a subtle distinction, but it makes all the difference in growing your business because it shifts

59
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,800
your focus from lining your own pockets to providing something of value that people are actually willing

60
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,580
to pay for.

61
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,330
We'll discuss specific business models in more detail later in the course.

62
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:26,710
The last mindset thing I want to cover is for those of you who don't consider yourselves good writers,

63
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,100
this is a mental block that keeps a lot of people from getting started.

64
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,310
Look, maybe you're not the best writer.

65
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,810
Maybe you suck, but so did every other writer when they first started.

66
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:43,690
The only way to get better at anything is to consistently practice and work on mastering your craft.

67
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,630
Ask any well-known blogger and they'll likely tell you that they're embarrassed by their earliest blog

68
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,110
posts.

69
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,480
In a few years you will be, too.

70
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,430
And that's OK.

71
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,380
Again, the best way to improve your writing is to write.

72
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,840
We'll talk more on that later.

73
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,840
But for now, just understand that you don't have to be a Pulitzer Prize winner to build a successful

74
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,410
blog.
