00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,880
Once again, unconscious creativity can play a big role in the ideation process, but you're not always

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,850
going to have an epiphany in the shower or on your drive home.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,810
Sometimes you need to actively extract those ideas from your mind.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,680
One way to do that is by conducting what's called a brain dump.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,880
Here's how it works.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,420
Set a timer for three to five minutes to create a sense of urgency, then just start jotting down content

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,720
ideas as quickly as possible.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,030
You can use sticky notes or a whiteboard or a notebook.

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:30,840
Doesn't matter.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,690
Just come up with as many ideas as you can and get them all written down without filtering your thoughts

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,170
at all.

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,660
This is about quantity, not quality.

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,210
So don't worry about how good or bad your ideas are.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,230
Just get them out of your head and worry about refining them later when the time is up.

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:54,420
Sort through your ideas, decide which ones could work and look for any emerging patterns or combinations

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,200
that could work.

17
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,660
You may find that more ideas come to your mind during this process, so be sure to record those as well.

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,630
At the end of the process, you should have a solid list of ideas that could potentially fit into your

19
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,590
content strategy.
