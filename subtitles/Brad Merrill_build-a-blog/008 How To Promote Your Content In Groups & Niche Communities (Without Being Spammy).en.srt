1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:07,590
We keep coming back to niche communities like forums, Subrata, Facebook groups, these are all important

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,560
places for you as a content creator to be.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,040
On one hand, it's a great way to get to know your audience, which can help you to create better content.

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:23,280
But these places can also serve as distribution channels if you approach them carefully and respect

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,220
their rules.

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:31,380
Nobody likes the shameless self promoter who shows up and starts promoting their own stuff without establishing

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,330
a reputation or adding anything of value to the community.

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:42,100
So make sure you know the rules of any community you join and focus on becoming an active member.

9
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:49,350
First, you can find forums pretty simply by Googling something like your topic, plus forums.

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,500
If you end up joining a forum site, one of the simplest ways to promote what you have to offer without

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,710
being obtrusive is by including a link in your signature or your profile, and then just focusing on

12
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:08,610
providing so much value natively on the community itself that people start proactively seeking out your

13
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,060
content to find a Subrata relevant to your industry.

14
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:17,880
You can go to Reddit dotcom slash credits, enter the topic you're interested in, and it'll give you

15
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,990
some suggestions.

16
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,800
The same rules apply on Reddit, possibly even more so.

17
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,320
You never want to be seen as a spammer.

18
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,520
Reddit is not kind to people who just constantly self promote.

19
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:35,070
They have this thing called a shadow band, which is basically a way of banning people from the community

20
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,550
without telling them that they've been banned.

21
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,610
So if moderators notice that all you do is promote your own stuff, they can shadow ban you and on your

22
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,290
end you'll still be posting things and using Reddit as normal.

23
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,690
But nobody else will see your posts.

24
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,760
You don't want that to happen.

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:00,660
So keep yourself promotional posts few and far between and again, always focus on providing value to

26
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,320
the community natively without trying to draw people out.

27
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,980
It's counterintuitive, but when people know you and trust you, your occasional self promotional posts

28
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:15,990
are going to carry a lot more weight and people are going to see them as valuable rather than spammy.

29
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,210
When it comes to groups on Facebook and LinkedIn, the same principles apply.

30
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,100
There's really not much more to say.

31
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,920
Just make sure you know the rules of the community, participate in conversations, provide value and

32
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,020
keep self promotion to a minimum.

33
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,040
As a bonus tip here, another way to approach niche communities for the purpose of content promotion

34
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,620
is by creating a community of your own.

35
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,830
Start your own forum, start your own Facebook group, get some people on board and work on cultivating

36
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:52,740
a positive, valuable community where you're interacting with your audience, where your audience is

37
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:58,830
interacting with each other, and then you'll have a platform that you control where you can share content

38
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,460
freely.
