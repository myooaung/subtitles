00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.510

The way your site is displayed and organized is extremely important to your CEO, if you're using WordPress,



2

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.780

your theme is the backbone of your site, and it's often the determining factor of whether your site



3

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.310

delivers a positive or negative user experience.



4

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.900

And on top of that, it's important that your site is structured in a way that makes sense to search



5

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.570

engines, a way that gives them as much context as possible.



6

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.790

So what are some important considerations when it comes to your theme and template settings?



7

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.220

First and foremost is responsive design.



8

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.430

We talked about this earlier.



9

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.710

A responsive design is one that automatically adapts to the smaller screen of a smartphone or tablet.



10

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.280

Now, I'm sure you understand the utility of a mobile friendly design in this world where everybody's



11

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.810

using a smartphone all the time.



12

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.170

But how does that relate to SEO in 2016?



13

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.790

Google began using mobile friendliness as a ranking signal for its mobile search results, meaning responsive



14

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:07.680

sites will now typically outrank nonresponsive sites on mobile, which is where 60 percent of all searches



15

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.190

happen.



16

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.760

The good news is that responsive design has become a standard, so almost any modern theme you install



17

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.400

on WordPress will be responsive.



18

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.470

Still, it's worth double checking.



19

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.570

Before you install a new theme, take a look at the mobile version and make sure it adapts properly



20

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.360

and offers a pleasant user experience.



21

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.540

If you're using an older theme, that's not responsive.



22

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.700

It's time for an upgrade if you care about your SEO.



23

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.730

This is absolutely mandatory.



24

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.310

Next, I want to talk about breadcrumbs, which I recommend adding to your site if you can.



25

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.990

So what are breadcrumbs?



26

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.690

Well, there are a set of links that look like this.



27

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.900

They usually show a link to the home page, a link to the Post's main category and the title of the



28

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.470

post.



29

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.260

The practical use case here is pretty simple.



30

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.530

They help the user get back to where they came from or explore other parts of your site.



31

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.670

They're called breadcrumbs because they work just like an actual trail of breadcrumbs that you would



32

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.320

drop and use to find your way back to your starting point.



33

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.260

You've probably seen breadcrumbs on some pretty high profile sites, and they're even baked into the



34

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.910

Windows operating system.



35

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.980

They don't take up much space.



36

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.650

They can help users navigate around your site.



37

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.820

And as an added benefit, they are extremely search engine friendly.



38

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.680

They help search engines better understand the structure of your site and how it's organized.



39

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.160

And Google will actually show your breadcrumb trail in the search results in place of your full your



40

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.610

URL.



41

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.820

As of now, the breadcrumbs themselves are not clickable in the search results, but it's still a great



42

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.390

opportunity to customize your search snippet just a little bit more.



43

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.510

So I recommend taking advantage of it with many themes.



44

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.910

Enabling breadcrumbs is as easy as flipping a switch in the theme customizer, but in some cases you'll



45

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.010

need a third party plugin or you'll need to decode them yourself if you feel they're worth the time.



46

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.790

Now, let's talk headings, a common way to organize content on a page is with headings, right?



47

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.410

You have a big block of text and you can divide that text using subheadings.



48

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.530

In addition to helping readers skim your content to get a quick overview headings, tell search engines



49

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.640

about the content of your page and how it's organized.



50

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.470

So it's important that you use the right headings for the right purposes.



51

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.540

There are several different types of headings in HTML.



52

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.500

You have heading one, heading two, heading three, heading for and so on, each functioning as a subheading



53

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.380

of its parent.



54

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.930

These are abbreviated in the actual HTML tags as one, two, three, four and so on.



55

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:44.950

It goes up to six.



56

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.990

Each one is interpreted by search engines to be the title of a page.



57

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.360

So the only H1 text on your posts and pages should be the title itself.



58

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.760

The name of your site can be formatted as each one on the homepage, but nowhere else.



59

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.250

If you're using WordPress, you shouldn't have to worry too much about your template files because theme's



60

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.020

generally handle this correctly.



61

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.810

However, when you're creating content, it's important not to shoot yourself in the foot by using the



62

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.760

wrong headings.



63

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.970

So let's talk about that.



64

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.250

I'm in the WordPress Post editor here.



65

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.500

I've added a heading block and as you can see, I have this menu here as well as in the sidebar where



66

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.780

I can choose one of the many heading options.



67

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.480

So even though there is an option to use heading one, I almost never want to do that because again,



68

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.690

the only one text I want on the page is my title, and that's automatically included by my theme.



69

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.780

Whenever you need to divide your post into multiple sections, always use heading to the same goes for



70

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.440

dividing an individual section into multiple subsections.



71

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.130

You can have multiple H three sections under a single H to multiple each force under an H three and



72

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.670

so on.



73

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.900

In most cases, though, all you'll need is H2 as a bonus tip, including keywords in your headings



74

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.900

in a natural way, not a spammy way can give you a little bit of a boost because it's one more signal



75

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.890

that your page is indeed relevant to that particular keyword.
