00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.500

When you're ready to start building an email list, you'll need an email marketing service to collect



2

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.090

email addresses and deliver your messages.



3

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.540

There are a lot of different solutions out there.



4

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.290

You've got convert Kit MailChimp, a Weber get response, Infusionsoft and so many others.



5

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.580

Any of these are fine.



6

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.200

And you can feel free to do your own research to determine which service will work best for you.



7

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.120

And the beautiful thing about email marketing is that you can switch email service providers at any



8

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.450

time and take your list with you again.



9

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.870

It's the only communication channel that you actually own.



10

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.430

As far as my recommendation, convert kit is extremely powerful and robust, but also intuitive to set



11

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.420

up and use, and that's what I usually suggest for new creators these days.



12

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.820

It's priced based on the size of your list, starting at twenty nine dollars a month for up to a thousand



13

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.750

subscribers.



14

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.220

If you're not comfortable paying for an email marketing platform just yet, but you still want to start



15

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.670

building a list, MailChimp gets an honorable mention here for their forever free plan, which is completely



16

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.970

free for up to 2000 subscribers.



17

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.710

There are a number of limitations, so it's not a permanent solution, but it's better than nothing.



18

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.450

And I always recommend it for new projects that don't yet have a budget for monthly services.



19

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.580

Again, you're welcome to do your own research, but in any case, you'll definitely want to get signed



20

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.900

up with an email marketing service as soon as possible.
