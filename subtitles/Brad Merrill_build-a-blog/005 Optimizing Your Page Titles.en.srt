1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,180
The first thing you'll want to do with the Yoast CEO plugin is optimize your page titles, page titles,

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,250
determine what you see in your browser tab when you visit your site, and they also dictate how your

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,130
site appears in the search results.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,850
The page title is the first line for each result.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,860
So it's your chance to make a great first impression.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,240
In just a moment, we'll use your to go ahead and configure our page titles.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,930
But first, what does a good page title look like?

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,050
Well, first, it goes without saying that every title should be descriptive and enticing to encourage

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,000
people to click through next.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,470
The keywords you want to rank for should appear early in your page titles.

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,030
This is for two reasons.

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,900
First, search engines give more ranking weight to the early words.

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,850
And second, when people quickly skim through the search results, they're going to see the early words

14
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,500
first.

15
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,490
So if your keywords appear early in your page titles, you're going to be more likely to rank highly

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,280
and people are going to be more likely to click through to your site.

17
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,750
It's also a good idea to include your site name in your titles for the sake of brand recognition, but

18
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,220
you'll want that to appear at the end.

19
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,360
So to summarize, good titles are descriptive and enticing.

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,940
Contain your target keyword, preferably at the beginning, and contain your brand name, preferably

21
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,540
at the end.

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,800
So to configure your global title settings, click search appearance under the menu in WordPress.

23
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,130
The first setting here is your title separator.

24
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,960
This is simply a separator symbol that appears between different elements of your title, like your

25
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,690
post title in your site name.

26
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,530
This is totally arbitrary.

27
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,150
Just pick the one you like the best.

28
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,170
Below that you can set the title for your home page by default.

29
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,150
It's just the name of your site, followed by a page number, which only appears if you're on page two

30
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:54,810
or three or whatever of your blog, you can customize this using a number of variables or by simply

31
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,880
typing in a custom title of your own.

32
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,690
Next click over to the content types tab.

33
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,580
On this page, you can set the default title template for your posts and pages.

34
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,700
Yost's default arrangement contains these elements.

35
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,950
The title of your post, a page number, which again only appears if you're on at least page two of

36
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,220
your comment section in this case, then we have our separate symbol and then the site title.

37
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,090
Visually, this would typically translate to something like this.

38
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,540
Given that your post titles will likely contain your target keywords, this is a perfect configuration.

39
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,240
It meets all of our requirements for a good title.

40
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,130
If your title structure doesn't look like this, I'd recommend changing it so it does.

41
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,250
You can then use the tabs at the top of this page to adjust your titles for media attachments, taxonomies

42
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:50,250
such as your categories and tags and archive pages, making sure to follow the same principles for each

43
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:50,880
of those.

44
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,290
Yoast also allows you to set a custom title for an individual post or page overwriting the default template.

45
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,140
This is a great way to optimize for a specific keyword and ensure your search snippet looks exactly

46
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,250
the way you want without editing the actual name of your post or page.

47
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,100
After you install the Yoast plug in, a new Yoast SEO panel becomes available on the Post editor.

48
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,330
This panel gives you an idea of how your page will appear in the search results.

49
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:25,080
You can click edit snippet to customize your page title using variables, plaintext or combination of

50
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,530
the two.

51
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,830
This colored bar under the title field indicates whether your page title is too long to be fully displayed

52
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,920
shorter than recommended or just write.

53
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,410
Ideally, you want this bar to be green.

54
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,180
It's always a good idea to examine your snippet preview before publishing a post.

55
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,560
If your title isn't optimized for the keyword you're targeting, it's easy to customize it.
