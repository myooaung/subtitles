00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.360

In this section, we're going to focus on writing and we're going to explore a variety of methods and



2

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.630

principles to help you write more effectively.



3

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.750

Now, before we get into this, I do want to reiterate that you don't have to be a Pulitzer Prize winner



4

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.950

to be a successful blogger.



5

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.420

I think you'll find that you'll improve organically without a lot of focused effort just by continually



6

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.050

writing and publishing content day in and day out.



7

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.910

But I also don't want to discount the importance of effective writing.



8

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.960

So let's talk a little bit about that.



9

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.810

As you can imagine, writing is going to be the basis of most of the content you create for your blog.



10

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.850

Now, of course, you're not limited to the format of a traditional written blog post.



11

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.490

And we'll actually talk about some other formats later.



12

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.670

But even things like audio and video will often require some writing ahead of time.



13

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.870

Now, writing is a great way to communicate ideas, but it comes with a certain handicap when compared



14

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.620

with in-person verbal communication, you've probably heard that body language accounts for a significant



15

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.160

portion of human interaction, facial expressions, posture, eye contact gestures.



16

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.400

When you're speaking, all of these things can either support or negate the words you're actually saying.



17

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:27.780

We use body language, often unconsciously, to connect with people, to gauge character and trustworthiness,



18

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.810

to understand how someone is feeling and so on.



19

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.090

What you say is arguably less important than how you say it.



20

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.790

But when it comes to writing and publishing content on the Web, many of those qualities are lost.



21

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.670

There's no body language.



22

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.010

There's no tone of voice.



23

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.530

You're totally reliant on the words themselves, which makes effective writing that much more important.



24

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.460

You want to be able to build trust, share ideas, educate people and persuade people all without relying



25

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.300

on the help of body language.



26

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.550

Beyond that, you have to remember the nature of the world we live in today.



27

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.560

At any given moment, there are thousands of people and companies competing for your audiences attention.



28

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.360

Why should someone spend five minutes reading your content when they could be doing literally anything



29

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.770

else?



30

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.510

The world of web content is more crowded than ever before, and it's only getting more competitive.



31

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.360

Some people see that as a bad thing, like the surplus of content is driving down the value of content



32

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.990

itself.



33

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:38.130

But the reality is, as the volume of content on the web increases, so too do the rewards for those



34

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.520

who create truly valuable content.



35

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.360

That's what you're going for.



36

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.300

You want your content to be the needle in the haystack, the diamond among thousands of ordinary rocks.



37

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.150

Effective writing can help you achieve that.
