00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.670

One of the great things about the Internet is that it places what is essentially the collective knowledge



2

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.020

of the world at our fingertips.



3

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.870

That's a key part of what people use the web for when they're not connecting with other people.



4

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.970

They're searching for information.



5

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.820

So naturally, it makes sense that you as a content creator could be a source of that information.



6

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.990

Some of my most popular posts have been data oriented articles with facts and figures surrounding a



7

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.050

particular topic.



8

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.250

Search engines love this stuff.



9

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.200

So if you can compile some relevant statistics from various sources and present it in a way that's valuable



10

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.490

to your audience, you should be able to drive a good amount of long term traffic.



11

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.350

Now, of course, you want to give credit where it's due and cite all of your sources so people know



12

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.760

where you're getting your information.



13

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.080

If you want to take facts and statistics to the next level, you can publish original research by conducting



14

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.290

your own studies and surveys and sharing the results.



15

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.850

You can become a credible and authoritative source for research in your industry.



16

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.530

Something to keep in mind, though, if you're publishing original research, it's important to do it



17

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.490

scientifically.



18

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.250

Make sure you include your hypothesis or research.



19

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.430

Question the purpose of the study, the specific details of your methodology, your sample size and



20

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.940

so on.



21

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.580

You want to be as transparent as possible.



22

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.410

Then, of course, you'll report the results of the study and share your interpretations and possible



23

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.390

implications of your findings.
