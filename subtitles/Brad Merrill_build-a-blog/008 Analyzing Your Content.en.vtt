When you're creating a post or page, you want to make sure everything from the title to the slug to



2

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.820

the content itself is optimized to rank for the keyword you're targeting, Yoast makes it really easy



3

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.280

to do this when you're editing a post or page and you know the keyword you're trying to rank for, you



4

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.040

can enter it as your focus keyword in the Yoast echo box right below the snippet preview.



5

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.230

Once you've done that, Yoast analyzes your content, looking at everything from your titles and meta



6

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.800

descriptions to the keyword density of your content itself.



7

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.350

If your content isn't fully optimized for any reason, it'll give you some specific instructions to



8

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.010

get you there.



9

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.230

For example, if your keyword doesn't appear early enough in the content or if your images don't have



10

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.880

all tags, or if you could use some more internal links, it'll tell you that here.



11

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.750

And as you fix each of these things, the analysis will update in real time.



12

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.090

So you know exactly what you still have to do.



13

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.010

In the next few lectures, we'll take a look at some of the factors Yoast analyses and how you can make



14

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.170

sure everything is properly optimized.
