00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,970
If you want to inspire trust in your audience, your writing should be free of errors and your spelling

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,070
and grammar should be impeccable.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,720
Now, look, nobody's perfect.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,060
We all make mistakes.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,520
And one of the beautiful things about the Internet is that you can usually go back and fix your mistakes

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,610
even after you've published your content.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,140
But the fact of the matter is, people judge you based on your ability to communicate properly.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,850
And if your post is littered with grammatical errors, you're going to face judgment and it's going

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:35,020
to be harder to establish that trust because you're showing a lack of attention to detail.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,790
For example, if I'm reading a blog post about taxes written by a leading accountant and tax expert,

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,540
but throughout the post they're using your instead of your, that's going to cause me to think whether

12
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:54,390
consciously or unconsciously, how can I trust this person to give me tax advice when they can't even

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,740
handle basic grammar?

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,890
And I don't say that to be a jerk.

15
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,520
I know some people struggle with that stuff, but it's just the cold, honest truth.

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,850
People will judge you for your spelling and grammar errors.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,730
So you need to take steps to ensure that those errors don't happen first and foremost, if you haven't

18
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,220
already.

19
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:19,530
I would strongly urge you to invest the necessary time to learn and master all the grammatical rules

20
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,300
of whatever language you're writing in.

21
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,500
That's important.

22
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,380
Educating yourself is one of the most effective things you can do and that education is going to continue

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,190
to pay off for years to come.

24
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:36,600
Second, and this is especially important if you know you're prone to errors in your writing, have

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,930
an editor proofread your content before you publish it.

26
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:45,450
If you can catch errors in-house before they ever reach your audience, you can have confidence that

27
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,810
everything you publish is high quality and error free.

28
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:55,170
Finally, please take advantage of the technology you have at your disposal to improve your writing.

29
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,120
Your standard spell check is great for typos and some basic grammatical errors.

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,850
But if you really want a comprehensive safety net, I recommend you check out grammar, which gives

31
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:12,840
you real time context based feedback on the mechanics usage, grammar and spelling in your writing.

32
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,460
It's basically like having an editor looking over your shoulder at all times, which is really helpful.

33
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:24,360
So with all of that in mind, hopefully you see why error free writing is so important and what you

34
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,470
can do to ensure your writing against those pesky grammar mistakes.
