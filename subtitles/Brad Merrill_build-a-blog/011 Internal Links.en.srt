00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,400
Whenever you're writing a post, it's a good idea to include relevant internal links to other pages

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,280
on your site that'll help your users dig deeper into your content, and it'll also help search engines

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,610
understand the relevance of certain pages, the value of those pages and the relationships between different

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,210
pages.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,870
As we discussed, search engines crawl websites by following links when you link from one place to another

6
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:25,350
post.

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,830
That's a way of signaling that those pages are related.

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,740
When it comes to internal linking, you should prioritize the content that you consider to be most important.

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,650
Most likely, you'll have a handful of posts that drive a significant portion of your traffic, the

10
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,910
kind of core resources that your site has to offer.

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,280
You'll want to link to those whenever you have the opportunity.

12
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,880
Now, it should always be relevant.

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:54,720
Don't just add random links all over the place, but whenever you feel it would make sense to link to

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,530
one of your most important posts, you should do so.

15
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,540
This passes link value onto those pages, and the more you do that, the more clear it'll be to the

16
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:09,510
search engines that those pages represent your most valuable content, which will help them rank more

17
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,160
highly when you add internal links.

18
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,000
What should the anchor text be if you're not familiar?

19
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,650
Anchor text is the clickable text that's actually displayed to your visitors.

20
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,440
In the old days of the common advice was to optimize your anchor text by using keywords.

21
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:31,050
Basically, if you linked to a post enough times using the same keyword as the anchor text, that post

22
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,910
would start ranking for that keyword.

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,820
But today, search engines are a little bit smarter and pay more attention to the context of the surrounding

24
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,220
content than to the anchor text itself.

25
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,250
On top of that, over optimizing by always linking with the same keyword can actually have a negative

26
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,470
impact because Google considers that to be a little spammy, just like the keyword stuffing tactic we

27
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,480
talked about earlier.

28
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,140
So these days, the main thing to think about is whether the anchor text looks natural in your copy

29
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,990
and provides an actual benefit to the end user.

30
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:07,260
It's OK to use keywords, but don't go overboard and use the same anchor text every time you link to

31
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:07,800
a post.
