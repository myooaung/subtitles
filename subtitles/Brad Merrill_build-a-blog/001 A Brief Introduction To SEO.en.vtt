00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.040

In this section, we're going to cover a topic that's essential to understand if you want to be able



2

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.920

to drive a consistent stream of free traffic to your website every single day.



3

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.440

And that is SEO, which is shorthand for search engine optimization.



4

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.130

Most websites rely on search engines like Google as a primary driver of traffic.



5

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.030

And as I'm sure you know from firsthand experience, if not as a publisher than as a user.



6

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.230

The difference between appearing on page one and page two can mean the difference between hundreds of



7

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.290

thousands or even millions of impressions, page views and potential leads and sales.



8

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.540

And it's even competitive on page one.



9

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.260

A study by Karateka found that the number one result on Google gets a whopping thirty two point five



10

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.360

percent of the traffic, with the second result getting seventeen point six percent.



11

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.090

And it just declines from there.



12

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.430

When you get down to the tenth result, you're only looking at two point four percent of the traffic



13

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.290

for that particular search term.



14

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.380

So it's easy to see why search engine optimization or SEO is such a hot topic.



15

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.930

If you want to maximize your exposure in the search results, you need to make sure your site is following



16

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.750

all the best practices that Google and other search engines have come to expect.



17

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.780

Now, whenever I talk about SEO, I like to preface my advice with the fact that there are a ton of



18

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.140

shady SEO tactics out there, but I'm not a fan of those and we're not going to cover them in this course.



19

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.370

You see my philosophy, not just an SEO, but in all of marketing is one of long term value.



20

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.400

I think you'll gain a lot more by playing the long game and focusing on the quality of your content



21

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.100

than by employing spammy short term tactics that may come back to haunt you in the future.



22

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.710

Let me give you an example.



23

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.840

Years ago, sleazy marketers realized they could get a lot of back links, which are kind of the currency



24

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.740

of SEO by going to thousands of random blogs and leaving incoherent comments with links back to their



25

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.440

sites that actually worked for a while.



26

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.670

But eventually Google got wise and penalized all of them.



27

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.000

Well, at the time, I was the editor of a popular tech blog that had been absolutely ravaged by these



28

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.200

spammy comments.



29

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.500

And I started getting emails from companies begging me, even offering money in some cases to remove



30

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.250

the spam comments their old CEO agency had left on their behalf because those links were now negatively



31

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.110

impacting their search rankings.



32

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.690

Please don't make that mistake.



33

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.180

SEO is a long term game.



34

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.780

You can get plenty of back links by earning them over time and doing other kinds of legitimate promotion.



35

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.790

If you feel the need to game the system, you're content probably isn't good enough, so you should



36

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.950

focus on fixing that first.



37

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.930

What we are going to cover in this section is on Site SEO that is optimizing your site's code and content



38

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.920

to maximize your visibility on Google and other search engines.



39

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.560

There are a wide variety of factors that influence your search rankings and you can't control all of



40

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.830

them.



41

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.770

But it's important to optimize the things you can control to put yourself in a position to succeed.



42

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.500

That's what this section of the course is about.
