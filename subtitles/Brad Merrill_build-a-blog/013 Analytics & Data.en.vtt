As your blog grows, you're going to need a way to monitor your traffic and other key performance indicators,



2

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.490

Google Analytics is kind of the industry standard for this, and I encourage you to install it on day



3

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:11.870

one.



4

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.830

It's pretty straightforward to set up.



5

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.650

Just go to analytics dot Google dot com, sign in with your Google account and create a new analytics



6

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.850

account for your blog.



7

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.220

It'll give you a snippet of code to copy and paste and you'll want to make sure it's included on every



8

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.390

page of your site.



9

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.030

Some WordPress themes have a special field and the theme customizer where you can enter this, but you



10

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.310

can also do it with a plug in like Google Analytics by Monster Insights, which automatically adds the



11

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.560

tracking code to every page of your site and displays some of your traffic stats right within the WordPress



12

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.160

Dashboard.



13

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.980

I'm also a big fan of Jetpack, which is a plug in that provides a bunch of WordPress dotcom features



14

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.630

to self hosted users.



15

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.570

One of those features is a real time stat tracking interface that's simpler than Google Analytics and



16

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.690

great for getting a quick overview of your site's performance.



17

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.680

Jetpack also has a lot of other useful features, so it's worth checking out.
