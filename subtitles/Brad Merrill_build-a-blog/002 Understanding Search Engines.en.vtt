00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.940

If you want your content to rank highly in search engines, it helps to look at things from their perspective



2

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.000

and understand what they're actually looking for, what exactly to search engines want, and how can



3

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.960

you leverage that to your advantage.



4

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.060

The main goal of every search engine is to serve its users by delivering the most relevant, high quality



5

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.460

results for any given search query.



6

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.290

This single statement covers the two most important aspects of SEO relevance and quality.



7

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.620

For example, if someone goes to Google and searches how to build a website, Google's job is to return



8

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.850

a list of high quality pages that explain how to build a website.



9

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.300

It doesn't want to show you a page explaining how to cook an egg.



10

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.460

That wouldn't be relevant, but it also doesn't want to show you a page about building a website.



11

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.850

That's not actually helpful because while it may be relevant, that wouldn't be considered high quality.



12

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.120

The system isn't perfect, but the goals are always the same relevance and quality.



13

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.140

Before you worry about title tags or meta descriptions or any of the more technical aspects of SEO,



14

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.750

you need to make sure the content of your site is relevant to your target audience and better than what



15

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.480

your competitors have to offer.



16

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.150

And by the way, quality isn't just about your content.



17

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.710

Your website itself also has to provide a positive user experience.



18

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.140

For example, it should be mobile friendly, it should load as quickly as possible, and it shouldn't



19

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.700

be littered with obtrusive ads.



20

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.890

More on that later.



21

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.770

But for now, keep these two words in mind.



22

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.120

Whenever you think about SEO relevance and quality, now that you understand the primary goal of a search



23

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.330

engine, let's take a look at how it accomplishes that goal.



24

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.170

So first, search engines create an index of the Web using a special program called a Web Crawler,



25

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.350

which is basically a robot that automatically browses the Web and records information about the pages



26

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.280

it visits.



27

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.660

Every time it visits a page, it scans the content, makes a copy of the page, ads the yuan to an index,



28

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.670

and then follows all the links on the page and repeats the same process for each one.



29

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.370

Scan the content, make a copy index.



30

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.520

The yuan will follow the links.



31

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.970

Repeat this gives the search engine a massive index of pages that it can then use to help its users



32

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.380

find things on the web.



33

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.480

But with so many index pages, how does it determine which results to show?



34

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.900

Well, it uses a special algorithm that looks at various signals to determine which pages are worth



35

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.820

ranking for a particular keyword.



36

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.170

In Google's case, that algorithm is called page rank.



37

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.330

So to give you an example, links are an extremely important ranking signal for page rank.



38

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.310

The more links that point to a page, the more useful it appears to the algorithm.



39

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.150

And that makes sense if a lot of people think a page is worth linking to.



40

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.320

It's probably also something Google will want to show in its search results.



41

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.900

But it's not just about the number of links.



42

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.640

In fact, that matters a lot less than it used to today.



43

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.590

Quality is far more important than quantity.



44

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.310

So one link from a reputable authority site will give you more of a boost than several links from smaller



45

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.000

websites.



46

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.750

Page rank also looks at other signals like when and how often the pages updated whether the domain is



47

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.790

considered trustworthy, as well as a number of technical factors which will cover shortly.
