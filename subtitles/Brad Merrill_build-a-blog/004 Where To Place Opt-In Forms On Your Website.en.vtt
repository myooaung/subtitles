00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.420

Where exactly should you place your Opt-In forms and lead magnet offers in order to capture as many



2

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.890

emails as possible?



3

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.060

Let's take a look.



4

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.830

If your blog has a sidebar, you should try to utilize that space wisely.



5

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.350

The very first thing in your sidebar, in most cases should be an opt in form.



6

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.810

This is something that's going to be visible on every page, at least for your desktop visitors and



7

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.270

people expect to see an opt in form there.



8

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.260

So if they're looking for it, that'll probably be the first place they check.



9

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:38.340

A lot of bloggers failed to capture leads at the end of their posts, and they're missing a huge opportunity



10

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.610

there.



11

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.370

If somebody reads all the way to the end of your post, they're clearly engaged with your content.



12

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.100

So that's a perfect place to ask them to join your list by offering some kind of free resource.



13

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.560

In exchange, you can also include an opt in form right within your post content itself.



14

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.040

Again, you've already got the readers attention, so why not throw in a relevant offer and get them



15

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.110

on your list and the longer your content, the more opt in forms you can get away with.



16

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.610

I would only include one if your post is in the 500 to 1000 word range, but if you've got a monster



17

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.220

post with three or four thousand words, you can feel justified with two or three opt in offers within



18

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.950

the content itself for best results.



19

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.020

Your offer should always be a natural extension of the surrounding content.



20

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.750

In other words, trying to offer something that's relevant to that post in particular.



21

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.540

Here's an easy one.



22

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.120

If you have a core lead magnet that you want to promote to your entire audience, your navigation bar



23

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.590

is prime real estate to do just that.



24

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.510

Use an enticing label and link to a landing page where people can opt in and pick up your freebie.



25

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.120

And finally, don't neglect the about page.



26

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.200

You're about page is where people go to learn who you are and what you do.



27

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.270

If they're interested enough to do that, they may be interested enough to sign up for your list.



28

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.290

So make sure you have at least one opt in form on your about page.
