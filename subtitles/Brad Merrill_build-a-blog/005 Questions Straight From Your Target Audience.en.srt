00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,130
Quora is one of my favorite sites on the Web.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:09,240
It's a Q&amp;A service where people ask and answer questions on thousands of different topics and the questions

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,760
get answered by real people with real experience.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,690
I don't know if you remember Yahoo's Q&amp;A site, Yahoo!

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,770
Answers, but, man, it was an absolute disaster, wasn't it?

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,350
The questions were bad, the answers were bad, and there wasn't really a system in place to keep the

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,480
community positive and helpful.

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,130
That's not the case with Quora.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,950
They've managed to create an incredible community where you have everyone from car mechanics to astrophysicists

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,050
answering questions about their expertise.

11
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,050
And if you consider yourself a curious person, it is a joy to use.

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:47,070
With that in mind, Quora can also be an asset for your content creation efforts because it allows you

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,880
to see what questions people are asking about your industry.

14
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:56,250
So you go to Quora, dotcom, enter a topic and then browse popular questions and answers about that

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:56,850
topic.

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,460
If you click topic A Q, you'll see a curated list of the most common questions people have on that

17
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:02,960
topic.

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,320
You can also browse related topics and do the same with each of those.

19
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,230
Just like Buzz.

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,230
This is a great way to explore the psyche of your ideal reader.

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,910
You can see exactly what questions they're asking, what problems they're experiencing, even what words

22
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,600
they're using.

23
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,390
And aside from just knowing your audience, you can also use Quora questions as a direct starting point

24
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,440
for new content.

25
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,390
If a lot of people are asking a particular question and you have the expertise to provide a helpful

26
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,400
answer, there's your piece of content.
