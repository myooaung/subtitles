Another way to find ideas and inspiration and to get to know your potential audience better is by exploring



2

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.960

the places where they hang out online.



3

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.660

That is, groups and communities focused on your topic or your industry.



4

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.380

Reddit is a great example of this.



5

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.300

If you're not familiar with Reddit, it's a message board website divided into various boards or communities



6

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.050

called Subordinate's, which are each focused on a particular topic.



7

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.550

Reddit is huge and there's a sub Reddit for just about any topic you could think of.



8

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.880

I always say that if there are at least four people in the world interested in a topic, there's probably



9

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.960

a sub Reddit for it.



10

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.970

So see if you can find a couple of active subjects that are relevant to your audience and take a look



11

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.450

around.



12

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.560

I recommend browsing through the top posts and changing the sorting to all time for best results.



13

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.540

Look at the links people are sharing, read the text posts, pay attention to any recurring questions



14

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.400

or themes and consider how you might be able to apply that information to your content strategy.



15

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.950

Again, Reddit is a great place to do this, but you're going to want to dive deeper, look for other



16

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.500

forums and communities focused on your topic, dig through the archives and see what conversations are



17

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.000

happening.



18

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.020

You can also look into Facebook and LinkedIn groups, which are becoming more relevant in the age of



19

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.910

social media.



20

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.720

Public groups are searchable, so find some relevant groups and do the same thing.



21

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.420

Watch for any recurring questions and conversation topics and you should come away with some solid content



22

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.180

ideas straight from the people you hope to serve.



23

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.730

And finally, you'll, of course, want to follow the major blogs and publications in your industry



24

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.290

as well as your competitors.



25

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.880

Read their content, maybe use Buzz Sumo to find the top performing content.



26

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.740

And then here's the kicker.



27

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.230

Pay attention to what people are saying.



28

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.400

Read the comments, see how people are responding on social media.



29

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.620

What questions or problems are they still facing and how can you be part of the solution?



30

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.150

That's the goal, after all, providing value in solving people's problems.
