00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,760
WordPress is an extremely powerful content management system, and one of the reasons for that is how

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:12,630
easy it is to customize your site and build something truly unique that's made possible by themes.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,560
WordPress themes take the data and content from WordPress and display it in a way that looks nice and

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,930
hopefully meets your individual needs.

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,870
WordPress needs a theme to function properly.

6
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:30,660
So you'll notice that when you first install WordPress, a default theme is already installed and activated

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,170
for you.

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,050
The default theme gets an overhaul about once a year, and as you'd expect, it's compatible with most

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,450
of the things you'd want to do with a WordPress site.

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,040
But if you want to give your site a more unique look, you can also install a third party theme.

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,580
There are a few ways to get a WordPress theme.

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,100
You can get a free one from the WordPress repository.

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,310
You can buy one from a third party seller or marketplace.

14
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,620
Or if you really want to go crazy, you could create your own or hire a designer to create one for you.

15
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,140
But in most cases, you should be able to find a WordPress theme that looks and feels exactly how you

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,240
want just by doing a little searching.

17
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,240
So the easiest and cheapest way to get a WordPress theme is by installing a free one from the theme

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,770
repository on WordPress dawg.

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,610
There are thousands to choose from and just because they're free doesn't necessarily mean they're inferior

20
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,800
to premium themes.

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,060
Some are definitely better than others.

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,890
But there's a nice rating system that should help you identify which themes are good and which ones

23
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,700
aren't so good.

24
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,520
You can actually access the theme repository directly through your own WordPress dashboard.

25
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,740
Just head over to the theme section under appearance and click add new.

26
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,830
There are themes for just about anything.

27
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,860
So whatever you're looking for, you're bound to find something you like.

28
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,590
At the top of this page, you can choose to view featured themes, the most popular themes or the latest

29
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,420
themes, and then you can filter that list by layout, features and subject.

30
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,880
When you see a theme that piques your interest, you can click on it to see a more detailed description

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,900
and a rough preview.

32
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,910
If you like it, you can click install to add it to your site and then you can activate it right away

33
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:16,230
or go back to the main themes page inside WordPress and click live preview next to that theme that you

34
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,620
just installed to see what your actual site will look like.

35
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,540
With that theme, you can then customize some settings using this panel on the left side.

36
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,960
And when you're satisfied, click, activate and publish.

37
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:34,640
In addition to the free themes from WordPress, dawg, there's a whole world of premium themes that

38
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,460
you can buy from third party sellers and marketplaces.

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,670
Like I said, there's nothing inherently wrong with free themes.

40
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:47,540
But premium themes as a whole do tend to offer more advanced functionality and higher quality design

41
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,500
than free themes.

42
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,190
And the purchase price usually includes support and documentation.

43
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,960
So if anything goes wrong or if you need help getting set up, you've got a lifeline there to help you

44
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,210
out.

45
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,130
So if you have a little money to invest, a premium WordPress theme can be a great investment.

46
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,870
There are a ton of places to buy WordPress themes.

47
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,910
If you do a Google search for WordPress themes, you'll be looking at theme after theme on site after

48
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,190
site for hours.

49
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,830
Personally, one of my favorite places to buy themes is Theme Forest Dot Net, which is a huge marketplace

50
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,200
of independent developers selling their themes in one central location.

51
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,630
The prices are pretty reasonable, anywhere from 20 to 70 U.S. dollars, which is nothing compared to

52
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,950
what you'd have to pay a designer to create a comparable design for you.

53
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,050
So wherever you end up, whether it's theme forest or some other vendor, the process looks pretty much

54
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,640
the same.

55
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:45,080
Just find a theme like purchase it and then you'll be able to download it as a zip file.

56
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,270
So I'm going to go over to the downloads page and my theme forest account and download one of the themes

57
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,830
I've purchased in the past.

58
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:58,130
It gives me the option to download all the files and documentation or just the install WordPress file.

59
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,470
Usually I prefer to just get the installer file because it's super easy to upload to WordPress.

60
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,050
In fact, I'll show you what that looks like right now.

61
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:12,410
If you log in to WordPress and go to the themes page under appearance and then click add new, you'll

62
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,530
see the same page we saw earlier when we were looking at three themes.

63
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,780
But this time we're going to click the upload theme button right at the top and you can add that zip

64
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,990
file right there and it'll install just like that.

65
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,680
So those are the two main ways to install a WordPress theme.

66
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,830
Now, choosing a theme is the hard part, and that always ends up being a huge time suck for me when

67
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,940
I launch a new project.

68
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,070
So I'll leave that part up to you.
