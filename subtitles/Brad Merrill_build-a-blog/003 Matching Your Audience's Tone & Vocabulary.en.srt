00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,530
In this lecture, I want to offer a quick tip about your words themselves.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,440
It's obviously important that you inspire trust in your audience, and one of the best ways to do that

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,370
is with your tone and your vocabulary.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,990
Doing this properly comes down to knowing your audience and understanding what they're looking for.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,910
So with your tone, you generally want to match the attitude of your reader.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:29,850
You don't want to be perceived as too academic, for example, or on the other side of the spectrum,

7
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,870
too juvenile.

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,030
You have to strike a balance between being conversational and being informative.

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,280
And what that balance looks like is going to vary from one topic or audience to another.

10
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,860
But the best general advice I can give you here is to be human and authentic.

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,720
You're not writing an encyclopedia.

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,010
The same principles apply to your vocabulary.

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,690
It's always a good idea to use the same words and phrases that your audience uses to describe their

14
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,340
problems and pain points.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,800
That's a great way to form a connection and show that you truly understand them, right?

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,770
Because when someone lands on your site and sees their problem explained exactly the way they describe

17
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,710
it, they know right away that you're going to be able to help them.

18
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,320
And that also comes with a more technical benefit when it comes to SEO or search engine optimization.

19
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,930
If you use the words and phrases your target audience is searching for, they're going to be more likely

20
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,440
to find your content when they typed those keywords into Google.

21
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,990
If you're unsure about any of this, as far as what words to use or how to best communicate with your

22
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,090
reader, remember, you can always use the techniques and resources we covered for generating content

23
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,920
ideas to also better understand your target audience.
