00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,540
become the industry standard for WordPress.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,250
So it's literally the first plug in I install on every new site.

Add new search for Yoast SEO and install the plugin.

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,920
Once it's installed, you'll see a new SEO option in the main WordPress menu.

12
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,430
This is where you'll manage all the various SEO options that iOS provides.
