One of my favorite tools for generating ideas and inspiration for new content is Buzz Zummo, this service



2

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.920

allows you to see the most popular content on any topic or from any competitor based on social shares



3

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.940

and back links.



4

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.080

So you would open up Buzz zummo dotcom into a topic related to your industry.



5

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.710

This can be broad or specific, and what you get is a list of popular headlines from around the web.



6

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.390

These are all pieces of content about the topic you entered that performed particularly well.



7

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.430

You can click each headline to open up the original post, but there's also a wealth of data right here



8

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.570

on the results page.



9

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.850

Under each title you can see the author, the source and the type of content, whether it's a list or



10

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.730

a how to article or something else.



11

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.390

Then on the right side, there's an overview of the number of times the post was shared on each of the



12

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.830

major social media platforms, including the total number of shares on the far right.



13

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.050

In the middle column, you can view the back links for each result, see who shared it on Twitter or



14

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.040

share it yourself.



15

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.350

And if these results don't quite meet your needs, there are plenty of filtering options over here.



16

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.240

On the left, for example, you can narrow the results down to content published in the last 24 hours,



17

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.020

the past week, the past month, year, two years, five years, or a specific range of your choosing.



18

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.960

Then if you want to see a wider variety of sources, you can use this checkbox to limit your results



19

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.970

to one link per domain.



20

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.510

And you can also filter by content type language, country, word count and specific domains.



21

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.880

You can sort the results however you want, and you can use any of these search operators to run a more



22

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.050

advanced search.



23

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.360

And you're not limited to searching topics.



24

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.160

You can also enter a competitors domain name to see what content is performing well.



25

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.610

For them, using bazooms can be a great way to understand the mindset of your target audience and see



26

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.530

what types of content they're consuming.



27

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.930

It's also an opportunity to see where your competitors may be lacking, for example, topics they're



28

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.830

not covering or areas where you may be able to create something better.
