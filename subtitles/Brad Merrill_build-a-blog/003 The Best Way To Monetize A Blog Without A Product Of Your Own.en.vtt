00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.150

Affiliate marketing is quite possibly the best way to monetize a blog that doesn't have an existing



2

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.360

business model with the proper disclosure and transparency, affiliate marketing can be an honest,



3

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:19.380

lucrative way to simultaneously provide value to your audience and build a business around your content.



4

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.860

The idea is, instead of creating your own product, you promote somebody else's product and earn a



5

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.570

commission when members of your audience buy it.



6

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.150

Simple enough, right?



7

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.850

To get started, you would find a reputable product or service that appeals to your target audience,



8

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.180

maybe even one you've written about in the past.



9

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.730

See if it has an affiliate program and if it does sign up, you'll be given a unique you are called



10

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.990

an affiliate link or a referral link that you can then share on your blog.



11

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.180

Whenever you mention that particular product.



12

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.200

When people click that link, they're tracked as a member of your audience.



13

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.540

And if they end up buying, you get paid.



14

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.390

And often affiliate programs will give you some kind of discount code to offer your readers.



15

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.530

So it ends up being a win win when everybody's happy, which is why it's one of my favorite business



16

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.010

models.



17

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.370

Now, of course, it sounds simple in theory, but lots of people experiment with affiliate marketing



18

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.840

and never end up making a single dollar.



19

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.080

So the question is, how do you actually make it work?



20

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.560

Well, if you've been paying attention in this course, you already have a significant advantage because



21

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.060

you understand that your success depends on the value you can deliver to your audience.



22

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.760

My favorite way to implement affiliate marketing as a business model is this.



23

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.210

Find out which of the tools or services that you use in your industry, have affiliate programs and



24

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.170

sign up for those.



25

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.550

Then as you're writing new content, particularly tutorials and how to guides, recommend the necessary



26

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.850

tools and products along the way, just like you would anyway, but link to them using your affiliate



27

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.180

link.



28

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.520

That way, when people follow your tutorial and purchase those products, you get paid.



29

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.220

Let me give you an example.



30

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.690

Let's say you're teaching people how to do something.



31

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.020

For example, how to build a website.



32

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.220

One service you could promote as an affiliate is Web hosting, because that's something people need



33

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.010

in order to accomplish the task you're teaching.



34

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.140

So as part of your tutorial on how to build a website, you would give your Web hosting recommendation



35

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.490

using your affiliate link.



36

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.920

So whenever people click through and buy from that particular Web hosting company, you get a commission.



37

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.970

You can include affiliate links in tutorials, product reviews, comparisons, lists, really any type



38

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.990

of content where it fits in and provides some benefit to the reader.



39

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.810

When you create content that's inherently valuable on its own and include affiliate links, naturally



40

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.090

within that content, there's a good chance that content will start bringing in regular search traffic



41

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.040

and as a result, you'll start to see recurring affiliate income.



42

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.700

Now, before you start signing up for every affiliate program and covering your blog with affiliate



43

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.060

links.



44

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.290

It's important that you approach affiliate marketing ethically.



45

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.250

Remember, we want this arrangement to be net positive for everyone involved.



46

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.570

What that means is you need to choose your affiliate products carefully.



47

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.330

Anything you promote to your audience should be something you genuinely use and endorse yourself.



48

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.850

If you only choose products based on the potential payout, you're going to let your audience down and



49

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.300

they're going to remember that you didn't have their best interest at heart.



50

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.550

On the other hand, if you only recommend products that are reputable and that actually improve people's



51

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.770

lives, they're going to remember that as well.



52

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.110

And your future recommendations will carry that much more weight.



53

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.340

Another thing to consider is that affiliate marketers have an obligation, both ethically and legally,



54

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.500

to disclose their affiliate relationships alongside their endorsements.



55

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.130

In other words, your audience needs to know that you earn a commission if they buy.



56

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.220

So be sure to include that as well.



57

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.920

On a technical note, I highly recommend installing a WordPress plugin called Thirsty Affiliates, it



58

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.080

allows you to manage your affiliate links dynamically and easily, insert them into your content as



59

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.960

you're writing a post.



60

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.480

So now you have at least a basic understanding of how affiliate marketing works, and I definitely recommend



61

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.500

experimenting with it.



62

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.820

The barrier to entry is low, but the potential rewards are high.
