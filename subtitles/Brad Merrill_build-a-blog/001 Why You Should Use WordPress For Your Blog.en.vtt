00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.460

When you set out to start a new blog, there's no shortage of options to use for your content management



2

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.870

system, that is the platform you use to build your Web site and actually publish content.



3

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.030

I'm going to be straightforward here and say there's really no contest.



4

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.530

WordPress is the best choice for the vast majority of bloggers.



5

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.620

I've been using WordPress for many years.



6

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:28.740

My businesses rely on it and I really believe it's the single best solution for building a blog or Web



7

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.070

site.



8

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.340

In today's world, it's free to use its extensible with a world of free themes and plug ins, and it



9

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.070

doesn't require a lot of technical knowledge to get started.



10

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.820

If you can use a computer, you can build a website with WordPress.



11

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.110

WordPress is the most popular content management system in the world, and it powers more than 32 percent



12

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.750

of all sites on the Web.



13

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.790

Just to give you some examples, here are some people and brands you've probably heard of whose websites



14

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.070

and blogs are powered by WordPress.



15

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.720

So we've got TechCrunch, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, TED, the NFL, Mashable, The New York



16

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.550

Times, the next Web, PlayStation, Fortune, Mercedes Benz, Coca-Cola, Harvard Business Review,



17

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.480

Beyonce, Usain Bolt, Snoop Dogg, Katy Perry and many, many others.



18

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.870

As you can see, you'll be in great company if you choose WordPress for your blog.



19

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.130

Now, I should clarify that I'm talking about the self hosted version of WordPress from WordPress,



20

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.690

dawg, not WordPress, dot com WordPress, Digg and WordPress, dotcom are different things.



21

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.910

And I know that's pretty confusing.



22

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.430

So let's just take a moment to clear up the difference.



23

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.110

So WordPress dot com is a fully hosted service that you can sign up for to build a blog or Web site



24

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.530

without having to manage the underlying technology yourself.



25

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.980

WordPress, dawg, is where you can download the free WordPress software and install it on your own



26

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.850

Web server.



27

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.900

I really like this explanation from the Daily Post blog on WordPress Dotcom having a blog or website



28

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.680

here on WordPress.



29

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.920

Dotcom is a bit like renting an apartment in a complex.



30

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.800

You don't have to worry about the pipes freezing in winter.



31

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.180

You don't have to mow the backyard and you don't have to fix the dishwasher if it breaks.



32

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.460

All of that is your landlord's job.



33

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.280

But on the other hand, you can't install skylights, knock down a wall to combine two rooms or rent



34

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.770

out your spare bedroom without the landlord's permission.



35

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.950

Similarly, here at WordPress Dotcom, we support your site and we take care of all the updates, the



36

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.540

backups and the security.



37

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.970

But since all of our users share this platform, we don't permit you to use plug ins since they can



38

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.210

introduce security risks or outside themes.



39

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.310

And there are a few terms of service that we require our bloggers to follow to keep WordPress dotcom



40

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.360

nice for everybody.



41

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.220

When you move to a self posted WordPress site, it's like buying your own house.



42

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.220

You can knock down the walls or build an extension.



43

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.670

You can rent out your garage for practice space to a local band.



44

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.680

You can keep a lion in the backyard.



45

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.380

But if your heat goes out in the middle of winter, you have to fix it or hire someone who can.



46

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.650

If you sell those, you can install all the plug ins you want.



47

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.240

But if one of them breaks your site, you have to figure out how to fix it.



48

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.950

Luckily, WordPress Dawg has a great support forum with many knowledgeable and helpful volunteers.



49

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.070

You're also responsible for performing routine updates and backing up your content, but the only rules



50

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.510

you're bound by are your own.



51

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.120

My recommendation and what we'll focus on in this course is self hosted WordPress.



52

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.580

It's better suited for serious blogs for a variety of reasons, one of which being that most of the



53

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.020

business models we cover later are incompatible with WordPress dotcom.



54

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.480

We're going to spend a lot of time in this section covering the process of installing and setting up



55

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.170

WordPress.



56

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.850

But if you decide to go with another platform, don't worry, there's a lot more to this course than



57

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.630

just WordPress.



58

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.400

So feel free to skip ahead.
