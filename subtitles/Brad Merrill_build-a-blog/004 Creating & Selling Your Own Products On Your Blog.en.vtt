00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.510

A more difficult but potentially more lucrative way to monetize a blog is by selling a product of your



2

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:06.820

own.



3

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.020

This could be a physical product or a digital product.



4

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.120

If you have an existing business selling physical products and you're building a blog to market them,



5

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.360

then you're good to go.



6

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.940

That's a really smart strategy.



7

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.790

And some of the biggest companies in the world are now using content marketing to their advantage.



8

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.720

So you are in very good company.



9

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.150

If you're just a blogger looking to create a revenue stream, digital information products may be a



10

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.870

good choice.



11

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.840

The Internet has disrupted a lot of industries and education is one of them were no longer totally reliant



12

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.040

on colleges and universities to learn new skills, professional or otherwise.



13

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.550

There's a huge growing industry of specialized online education and you're taking an online course right



14

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.760

now.



15

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.620

So you know exactly what I'm talking about.



16

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.620

If you have knowledge or expertise that other people want to attain, you can be part of this revolution.



17

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.530

It's never been easier to self publish an e-book on the Amazon Kindle store or even a physical book



18

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.090

with something like Create Space.



19

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.920

Same thing with video courses.



20

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.560

If you have the chops and if you're willing to put in the work, your courses can find a home on platforms



21

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.640

like Udemy or Skillshare, or you can even sell them on your own website.



22

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.270

Using a WordPress plugin like Course Press or a hosting platform like Teachable Information Products



23

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.230

offer an incredible opportunity to build a business around your blog.



24

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.480

You just have to be willing to put in the time and effort that's required to create something people



25

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.800

are willing to pay for.



26

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.100

Depending on your industry and your skill set, there are other digital products you could offer as



27

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.280

well, including software as a service, mobile apps, website, templates, WordPress, themes, things



28

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.770

of that nature, whatever it is, just make sure it's something that your audience actually wants and



29

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.160

that add some kind of value to their lives.



30

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.290

No amount of marketing can fix a bad product, so make sure you create something you're proud of.



31

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.130

Once you have a product, this course has already provided the blueprint for getting it into people's



32

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.590

hands.



33

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.010

It's all about creating epic content, getting people to opt into your list with valuable lead magnets,



34

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.030

sending them free exclusive content that's mind blowing really good.



35

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.250

And then eventually asking for the sale, using all the free value you've given them as leverage.



36

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.300

It's not an easy process, but it is a simple process and it works.
