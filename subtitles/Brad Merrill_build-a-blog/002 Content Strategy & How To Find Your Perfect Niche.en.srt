1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,180
Often when people want to start a blog, they start doing all kinds of research on Web hosting and content

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,780
management systems and themes and plug ins and all of the technology without taking time to think about

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,900
a content strategy.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,890
Don't worry, we will cover all that stuff.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,430
But it's important to remember that technology is just a tool.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,170
It's not the destination.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,200
You're number one concern when you start a blog should be your content because that's what people want

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,580
from you.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,100
Nobody's going to read your blog just because you have a cool WordPress.

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,140
The design is important.

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,460
Yes, but your content has to come first.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,180
The first part of developing a content strategy is choosing a niche.

13
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:47,490
In other words, committing to a specific topic or a specific audience that you want to serve.

14
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,350
Now, this can be scary.

15
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,070
A lot of people, as they're starting out, kind of want to appeal to everyone.

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,580
But the fact is, focusing on a specific topic will allow you to position yourself as an expert and

17
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,600
grow a lot more quickly than if you tried to be everything for everyone.

18
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,060
When you choose a topic, you'll want to find something that's just specific enough for you to carve

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,610
out an audience for yourself, but broad enough that a large enough audience actually exists.

20
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,990
And more importantly, you want something that you're going to be able to write about on a consistent

21
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:19,710
basis.

22
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,880
So ideally, it'll be something you're knowledgeable or passionate about.

23
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,790
So, for example, the first blog that I had real success with covered technology, with a specific

24
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,400
focus on innovation and startup companies.

25
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,480
I've always liked technology and I've always had entrepreneurial tendencies.

26
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,340
So it was a really natural fit.

27
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,170
It's not always that easy, though.

28
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,420
A lot of people just don't know where to begin.

29
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,470
And that's OK.

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,750
We're going to go over a couple of approaches that you can use to find your perfect niche.

31
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,670
First of all, start with things you're interested in or passionate about.

32
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,160
So when I say that you may have one or two things that pop into your mind right away, which is great,

33
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,650
but you may be totally blanking, which is fine as well, if that's the case, there are some really

34
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,920
effective ways to uncover what it is you're passionate about.

35
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,910
And the first one is following the money.

36
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,770
If you do a lot of online shopping, say on Amazon, for example, go to your order history and take

37
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,570
a look at the kinds of things you're buying on a regular basis, recreational things.

38
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,750
Often these will point to a particular interest of yours that could translate to a blogging niche.

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,740
If you like to read, take a look at the books you own.

40
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,520
You may notice some patterns there.

41
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,400
If you watch a lot of videos on YouTube, same thing.

42
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,130
Go into your YouTube history and look at what types of videos you're watching.

43
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,510
You can also learn a lot by paying attention to how you spend your time, specifically your free time

44
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,870
when you don't have any set obligations.

45
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,350
What do you do for fun?

46
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,270
Maybe you take photos, maybe you play video games, maybe you go out to concerts.

47
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,060
All of these things could work as potential.

48
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,140
Blogging, Nicias.

49
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,510
Once you've got some interests and passions in mind, it's also a good idea to take inventory of your

50
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,640
current skills and expertise.

51
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,980
Things you're already good at or knowledgeable about are excellent candidates for blogging.

52
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,170
Nicias, because these are the areas where you can provide additional value where the average person

53
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:17,860
cannot.

54
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:24,580
So think about your professional background, your education, any certifications you have, your hobbies,

55
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,050
your experiences, and try to hone in on your unique skills.

56
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,080
One of them may end up being your perfect niche.

57
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,920
If you don't want to commit to a single topic, you can get similar results by committing to a particular

58
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,400
audience with a particular worldview.

59
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:47,560
So instead of writing about one singular topic, you can write about a variety of topics that matter

60
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,350
to people who share a certain mindset or worldview.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,650
For example, Maria Popova writes an excellent blog called Brain Pickings.

62
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:02,110
And what she does is she reads books lots and lots of books.

63
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:07,720
And on her blog, she shares insights and things she's learned from reading those books, often drawing

64
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,610
parallels between different authors and different time periods, things like that.

65
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:19,300
The topic of each post is unique, but she fundamentally appeals to curious, creative people who tend

66
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,810
to be lifelong learners.

67
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,200
That's her niche.

68
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,150
It's just based on an audience instead of a topic.

69
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,650
So it's up to you.

70
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,430
Choose a topic, choose a worldview, or choose nothing at all.

71
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:36,850
But understand that a more specific focus will allow you to grow more quickly and ultimately monetize

72
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,990
more effectively.

73
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,420
Once you've settled on a niche, it's time to think about the types of content you'll be creating and

74
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,050
what people will gain from it.

75
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:54,050
Most content serves one of four main purposes entertainment, education, persuasion or conversion.

76
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,500
Entertainment is obviously meant to entertain people.

77
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,270
Educational content explains or teaches the reader something persuasive.

78
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:08,300
Content makes arguments for a particular position or viewpoint, and conversion entices people to buy

79
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,730
or take some other action.

80
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:17,030
You can apply those purposes to various content formats like lists, how to guides, news articles,

81
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:22,310
reviews, thought and opinion pieces, interviews, case studies and so on.

82
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,330
Later in the course will dive a lot deeper into content strategy.

83
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:31,700
But I wanted to get you thinking about it right out of the gate because content strategy is a lot more

84
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,070
important than what WordPress theme you use.

85
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:42,190
Ultimately, the most important question to answer is this how and to whom will you provide value?

86
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:47,050
Who is your audience and what will your content do to improve their lives?
