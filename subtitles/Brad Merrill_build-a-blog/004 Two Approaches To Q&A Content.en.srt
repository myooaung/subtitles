1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,030
Another great type of content is Q&amp;A, questions and answers are always a good starting point, and

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,790
it's another straightforward way to provide value.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,030
Your audience has questions and you have answers as far as what questions to answer.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,550
We kind of talked about that in the ideas section.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,020
There are so many places to get to know your audience and see what questions they're asking.

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,470
One of my favorites again is Quora.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,690
There's just so much information on that site, not just in the answers themselves, but in the wealth

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,590
of public data.

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,600
You can find on a topic page the most frequently asked questions, how many people are following each

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,980
question and so on.

11
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,460
There are a couple of ways to approach Q&amp;A content.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,340
You can write a long list style post answering a bunch of related questions in one place where you can

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,930
write a single post answering a single question in detail.

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,110
Neither of these approaches is necessarily superior.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,420
They each have their strengths.

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:03,000
So, for example, if I were to write a post listing, say, the top 15 questions asked by new content

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,620
marketers, that could be really valuable for people who fall into that demographic and it's going to

18
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,120
be really shareable.

19
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,450
But if I write a post answering just one question and using the question itself as my headline, that

20
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,810
gives me the opportunity to rank on Google and other search engines.

21
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,030
When people search for that question, when it comes to actually writing your answer, make sure you

22
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:30,810
do some research and see what's already out there and determine how you can dive deeper or offer more

23
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,380
value than the competition.

24
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:38,460
For example, if a question is really popular on Quora, Quora is almost certainly going to outrank

25
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,810
you when people search for that question just because it's such a popular, authoritative site.

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,690
But you can still stand a fighting chance by creating something that's better and more valuable than

27
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,400
any of the answers on Quora and then promoting it accordingly.
