1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,160
So let's say you've got an email list and you've got some strategies in place to get more people signed

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,350
up.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,900
What do you do next?

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:13,170
A pretty common mistake is thinking of your list as a group of people you email when you have something

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:13,750
to sell.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,960
That's a mindset you'll want to avoid as much as possible.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,450
Now, don't get me wrong.

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:24,690
When you do have something to sell, your email list can and should be your number one sales driver.

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,550
But that only works if you've spent time nurturing it.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:35,240
You have to continually bring value to the people on your list with no expectation of return.

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,860
These are your VIPs.

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,340
They like your content.

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,130
They've asked you to send them more stuff and it's up to you to start building a relationship with them.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,840
And good relationships are based on trust.

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,440
So what does this mean?

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,110
It means you have to spend a significant amount of time giving before you ever ask for anything.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,620
Gary Vaynerchuk has a great book called Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook, which applies a boxing metaphor

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,730
to the marketing world.

19
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:08,310
Basically, jab, jab, jab, right hook means give, give, give, then ask.

20
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:15,390
So you want to give people as much free value as possible before you ever ask for their money or their

21
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,370
time or anything else.

22
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,800
It's also worth considering that our inboxes are more crowded than ever before.

23
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:29,570
Remember when you first started using email, you probably opened and read every single message, right?

24
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:30,780
I know I did.

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,870
But today I delete well over 75 percent of my emails without even opening them.

26
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,780
And I actually did an email cleanse recently where I unsubscribed from hundreds of newsletters that

27
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,610
weren't bringing value to my life.

28
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,760
They were just noise.

29
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:52,890
However, I did stay subscribed to a small handful of lists that always provide disproportionate value.

30
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,420
That should be your goal.

31
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,140
You have to earn your place in your subscribers inboxes.

32
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,620
Specifically, here are a few ideas for what you could send your email list to continually provide value

33
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,820
and build trust.

34
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,850
First, we have the welcome email, which is the autoresponder message that triggers as soon as someone

35
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,500
confirms their email address.

36
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,310
This is probably where you'll include whatever free resource you promised them.

37
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,680
But it's also a good time to introduce yourself and set the expectations for the relationship.

38
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:28,320
So go over what you'll be sending them and when and how often they can expect to hear from you.

39
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,850
Exclusive content.

40
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:37,020
Again, the people on your list deserve to be treated like VIPs, so offer them some exclusive content

41
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,880
that you don't publish on the web.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,540
It's OK to promote new blog posts and stuff like that to your list.

43
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,850
But if that's all you do, where's the added value?

44
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,980
What's the incentive to join your list rather than just visiting your site?

45
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,920
Have you ever found yourself in a conversation with someone who only talks about themselves?

46
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,160
Not much of a conversation, right?

47
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,310
Well, the same concept applies to your email list.

48
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,010
Invite people to hit the reply button and share their thoughts and feedback.

49
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:11,780
You can even add a dedicated auto responder message asking people to tell you about themselves and their

50
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,590
challenges.

51
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:18,530
Make it clear that you actually read the responses and you'll start getting real direct feedback from

52
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,090
your audience that you can use to tailor future content to them.

53
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:29,350
Unexpected freebees, one of the best ways to build rapport with your subscribers is by sending them

54
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,540
an unexpected gift from time to time, it can be something that you would normally use as a lead magnet

55
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,390
or even something more extensive if you want to go deeper.

56
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,850
Either way, it's an amazing way to deliver value and remind people why they signed up in the first

57
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,300
place.

58
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:49,750
Again, nurturing your list really comes down to providing massive free value to earn your keep.

59
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:55,510
Once you've built up a solid relationship with your subscribers through lots of free value, selling

60
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:01,120
is a breeze people buy from those they trust, and the law of reciprocity tells us they'll be more than

61
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,640
willing to give back when the time comes.
