00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,190
If your site has a comment section, you know, the people who take the time to leave comments are some

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,020
of your most engaged visitors.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,590
So what if you could turn them into email subscribers?

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,070
There are a couple of ways to do this.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,010
One way is to redirect people to a thank you page right after they leave a comment.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,150
And on that page, you could offer some kind of free resource if they opt in.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,970
If you use WordPress, you can use the comment redirect plug in, which automatically redirects first

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,850
time commenters to a page of your choice.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And it's nice because it's only first time commenters, so you won't be constantly harassing people

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,410
who comment regularly.

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,890
Another method is to add a checkbox to the comment form itself, where commenters can choose to join

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,080
your list right as they post their comments.

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,990
Again, if you use WordPress, there are plenty of plugins that do this, including MailChimp for WordPress

14
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,760
and newsletter sign up.
