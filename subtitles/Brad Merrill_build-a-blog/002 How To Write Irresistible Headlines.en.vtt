00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.880

One of the most important parts of a good blog post is an effective headline.



2

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.820

The headline is Your Chance to nail the first impression.



3

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.640

When people come across your content on social media or in the Google search results, it's going to



4

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.600

be one of two things.



5

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.920

They're either going to click through and visit your website or they're going to keep scrolling.



6

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.550

The key variable here is the headline, because at this stage that's the only information they have.



7

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.230

So it needs to be good.



8

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.100

When you're working on a piece of content, I recommend starting with a working title, just something



9

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.790

simple, to identify what you're working on and guide the general idea of the post, then once you're



10

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.200

finished with the content itself, come back to the headline and refine it.



11

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.720

Sometimes you may find that you ended up taking a slightly different approach than you originally intended.



12

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.400

So it's usually smart to write the final headline after you've written the main content.



13

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.660

And when it comes to that final headline, you want to take it pretty seriously.



14

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.290

Don't just type out the first thing that comes to your mind and click publish.



15

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.970

Remember, the headline is your one chance to grab people's attention.



16

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.120

So make sure you're spending enough time on it.



17

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.830

I'd say five minutes at the very least.



18

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.760

What I like to do is come up with a list of potential headlines, at least five, sometimes 10 or more,



19

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.420

and then narrow them down until I have the perfect title.



20

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.080

So with that process in mind, what elements do you need to have in that perfect title?



21

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.940

First of all, you want something unique.



22

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.550

If your headline looks exactly the same as all the other content on your topic, what reason does your



23

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.240

audience have to think you have any unique value to offer them?



24

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.960

Show a little personality and don't be afraid to be different.



25

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.380

A good example of this that kind of takes it to the extreme is the hilarious viral video that put Dollar



26

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.740

Shave Club on the map, Dollar Shave Club Dotcom.



27

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.840

Our blades are great.



28

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.670

Yes, it's edgy.



29

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.840

Yes, they took a little bit of a risk dropping an F bomb and an official ad.



30

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.130

But here's the thing.



31

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.300

It worked.



32

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.180

It got people's attention and it showed people right off the bat that Dollar Shave Club wasn't just



33

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.670

another Rasor brand like Beke or Gillette.



34

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.800

Now, my advising you to be intentionally edgy and square in your headlines all the time.



35

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.540

Absolutely not.



36

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.020

All I'm suggesting here is that you allow your blog to have a personality and a unique, authentic style,



37

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.290

whatever that happens to look like for you next.



38

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.510

A good headline is specific.



39

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.840

You want to be extremely clear about what you have to offer.



40

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.690

So if I was writing a post about how to grow a business with content marketing, a bad headline would



41

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.730

be something super general like content marketing or even how to grow your business.



42

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:53.450

Instead, I'd want to be really specific and say, for example, how I increased my company's sales



43

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.450

by 50 percent using content marketing.



44

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.730

That way, the reader knows exactly what to expect, and if they're interested in what I have to offer,



45

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:02.740

they'll click through.



46

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.300

You don't have to appeal to everyone, just the people who are actually going to get something out of



47

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.990

your post.



48

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.710

And along the same lines, you want your headline to be useful, it should convey a clear benefit to



49

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.440

the reader in the example I just gave you, how I increased my company's sales by 50 percent using content



50

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.010

marketing.



51

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.670

It's extremely clear what the reader is going to learn.



52

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.100

Same thing with the Dollar Shave Club video.



53

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.840

Our blades are great if you're looking for a great razor blade.



54

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.120

Well, there you go.



55

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.780

So to summarize, when you're writing headlines, make sure to always offer something unique, make



56

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.930

it specific and make it useful.



57

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.490

Come up with a list of potential headlines for every post you write and narrow down the list to the



58

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.120

best one.



59

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.810

You may also want to run in by a couple of friends to get a fresh perspective.



60

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.050

In any case, always remember that your headline is your chance to make or break the first impression.



61

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.630

So be sure to give it the attention it deserves.
