00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,760
In this lecture, we're going to cover one of the most effective ways to significantly grow your audience

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:12,690
pretty much overnight, and I know that's a big promise, but this method really delivers if you execute

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,450
it properly.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,880
So what are we talking about here?

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,940
We're talking about giveaways.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,480
Giveaways generate a ton of buzz because everybody wants free stuff.

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:23,900
Right.

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,880
But like I said, if you want to use a giveaway to actually grow your business, you have to be very

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,000
strategic in your execution.

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,240
Let me explain.

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,810
First and foremost, you have to choose a relevant product.

12
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,460
This is the most important part, and it's where most brands fail.

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,190
You see, you can give away just about anything of value and you're going to get a lot of traffic and

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,120
a lot of entries.

15
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,370
But at the end of the day, if your product isn't relevant to your business, you're just going to get

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,580
a bunch of targeted traffic and an audience of people who have no interest in your content and will

17
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,370
never buy from you all the brands giving away iPads and stuff like that.

18
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,180
That is a terrible strategy because think about who wants a free iPad.

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,190
Everybody wants a free iPad.

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,690
Unless your business is actually focused on electronics or Apple products, giving away an iPad is not

21
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:19,800
going to help you.

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,250
A good product for a giveaway is one that's highly desired, but appeal specifically to your target

23
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,000
audience.

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,020
Often this may be your own product, right?

25
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,460
Because what better way to attract people who are interested in your product than by giving away your

26
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,060
product?

27
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,300
But it could be something else entirely.

28
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,670
The idea is to give away something that's extremely valuable to your target market, but may not be

29
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,630
valuable to a random person you meet on the street in terms of actually conducting the giveaway.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,640
There are two plug ins that I highly recommend.

31
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,950
Gleam and King Sumo.

32
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,620
They're both excellent and they allow you to collect emails for your list while also tackling one of

33
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,870
the big problems with viral giveaways.

34
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,130
Nobody wants to share a giveaway because the more people who enter, the lower their chances of winning

35
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:11,760
become.

36
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,650
And that makes perfect sense.

37
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,590
People tend to act in their own self-interest.

38
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:23,370
But these plug ins actually incentivize sharing by giving people additional entries for referring their

39
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:23,940
friends.

40
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,310
So, for example, you get one entry right away and then if you share on Facebook, you get a second

41
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,560
entry, a third for sharing on Twitter.

42
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,140
And then if you refer X number of people, you get X number of additional entries.

43
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,990
This is a much better system than the traditional one entry per person approach because it incentivizes

44
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,700
sharing and makes your giveaway go viral with very little promotion on your part.

45
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,740
With that said, you do still want to do some promotion to kind of get the ball rolling.

46
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,810
A good place to start is by reaching out to friends and contacts, telling them about the giveaway and

47
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,700
asking them to enter and share.

48
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,180
Promote it to your existing email list.

49
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,950
Again, they're already engaged with your brand.

50
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,810
They'll appreciate the opportunity to win a free product and they're likely to share it with their friends.

51
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,670
If you've put the right incentives in place, then of course you'll want to promote it to the rest of

52
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,750
your website visitors.

53
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,640
Most likely you're going to use a blog post as the main entry page, but make sure you're pushing people

54
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,190
in that direction from other areas of your site.

55
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,170
For example, you could use something like the Halo Bar, which adds a simple header bar to the top

56
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,790
of your site where you can say, hey, we're giving away this product, click here to enter.

57
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:38,970
And of course, you can also submit your giveaway to some relevant Subrata Facebook groups and so on.

58
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,800
And by the time you've done all of this, your giveaway should be gaining steam through people sharing

59
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,850
it, and you should start to see an influx of highly targeted traffic.

60
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:54,090
Once again, if you select a relevant product, incentivize sharing and do a little bit of promotion

61
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:54,900
ahead of time.

62
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,660
A giveaway is one of the most effective strategies you can deploy for fast growth.
