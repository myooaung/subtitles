How to guides and tutorials are a cornerstone of blogging and one of the most straightforward ways to



2

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.470

provide value by teaching people how to do something, in my experience, tutorials are the single best



3

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.270

way to drive sustainable long term traffic with a single piece of content.



4

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.490

So how do you write a good tutorial?



5

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.160

Well, you want to start by clearly stating the objective.



6

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.310

Every tutorial should have a specific goal or outcome, and you want to make sure that's established



7

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.760

right out of the gate in both your headline and your introduction.



8

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.400

Tutorials can be long or short.



9

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.410

It really just depends on the complexity of the task and how long it takes to walk the reader through



10

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.590

it.



11

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.410

Typically, I recommend formatting each of your steps as subheadings with more information under each



12

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.710

one.



13

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.020

That's especially true if you're writing a longer tutorial with a lot of steps.



14

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.580

Now, when you're teaching someone to do something, it's very important that you're clear and concise.



15

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.300

You want to make the process as easy as possible for the reader.



16

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.430

So be sure to spell everything out, making no assumptions about the reader's current knowledge, but



17

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.890

at the same time, be careful not to go overboard with unnecessary details that may overwhelm them.



18

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.480

Use your best judgment and try to strike a good balance next.



19

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.360

Almost every tutorial would benefit from the use of visuals like photos, screenshots or videos.



20

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.670

A tutorial with visual elements is much easier to follow than a giant wall of text.



21

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.520

Before you publish your tutorial, follow the steps yourself to make sure you covered everything and



22

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.960

maybe even have a friend or somebody else run through it as well to give you feedback.



23

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.230

This is especially helpful if the person who's helping you doesn't have a lot of experience doing with



24

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.890

the tutorial is explaining because then you can gauge whether you explained everything clearly.



25

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.660

And finally, if you have a comment section, make sure to monitor your comments, answer questions,



26

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.450

offer support and update the tutorial if you notice any recurring questions or problems.
