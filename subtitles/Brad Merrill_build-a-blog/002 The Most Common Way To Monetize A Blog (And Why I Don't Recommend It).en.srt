1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,160
I wanted to start with advertising because it's probably the most popular revenue model in the blogging

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,250
world, but that doesn't mean it's the best.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,530
In fact, it's really not.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,350
Things have changed a lot over the years.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,820
And the fact is advertising does not pay as well as it used to.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,590
And in almost all cases, it negatively impacts the user experience.

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,620
And by its very nature, it sends people away from your site, which is not a desirable outcome.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,370
With that said, I know advertising is just about the only option for some topics like news, politics,

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,510
celebrities, things like that, and it can generate revenue for you.

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,840
So I want to share some advice.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,710
There are two categories of advertising for bloggers, direct and indirect.

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,280
Direct advertising is where you sell placement directly to a company, and indirect advertising is where

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,360
you use a middleman like Google Ad Sense or some other ad network.

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,210
Indirect advertising is a lot easier to set up because you basically just sign up with an ad network,

15
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,700
copy some code onto your site and forget about it.

16
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,730
Direct advertising is more difficult, but it has the potential to bring in a lot more money.

17
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,790
If you want to use an ad network, Google ad sense is the popular option and it'll likely be your best

18
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,090
bet.

19
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,760
It doesn't hurt to experiment with other platforms, though.

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:27,060
I've also had great results from adversity and media dot net, which are both display networks similar

21
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,930
to ad sense.

22
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:35,070
You can also look into content recommendation, a.k.a. native ad networks like Rev Content and Outbrain.

23
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,060
Direct ad sales can be a lot more profitable because you're working with brands directly, with no middleman

24
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,420
to make it work.

25
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,230
The first thing you'll want to do is put together a comprehensive advertising page on your site where

26
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:54,580
interested companies can see your traffic stats, sponsorship options and how to contact you.

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,800
However, unless you have a lot of traffic and I mean a lot of traffic, most of your sales won't come

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,420
from people reaching out to you.

29
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:09,150
You'll have to put on your hussle hat and start cold calling or cold emailing businesses whose target

30
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,140
market matches your audience.

31
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,800
This is where you have to stop thinking about advertising as a way to monetize your blog and start thinking

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,550
about it as you helping a company to reach its marketing goals.

33
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,350
If you can make that mindset shift, you'll have a lot more success in the world of advertising and

34
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,190
sponsorships.

35
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,730
If sales isn't your thing, you might think about working with a commission based sales manager to sell

36
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:38,700
your ad inventory, but I highly recommend doing it yourself at least a few times so you can learn what

37
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,390
works and what doesn't and who your ideal sponsors are.

38
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:49,020
Like I said, traditional advertising would not be part of my approach today, but given the right audience

39
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,050
and the right niche, it can still be profitable.
