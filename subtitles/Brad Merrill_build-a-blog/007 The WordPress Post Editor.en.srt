00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,910
Let's take a look at the WordPress content editor now, as we saw, the page editor and the Post editor

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,740
are almost exactly the same, but we're going to dive into the Post editor here because there are a

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,560
few extra settings for posts that you should be aware of.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,730
So first of all, you have your post title, we'll go ahead and enter that and then we'll jump straight

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,890
down into the main post content.

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:31,220
We compose content in WordPress using these things called Bloks, a blog is basically just a small section

7
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,210
of content in your post is going to be made up of a series of blogs.

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,420
Once you get used to this, it's really intuitive.

9
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:44,150
So if I were to just start typing here, that creates a paragraph blog for me and you'll notice that

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:48,920
when you move your mouse over a paragraph block, you get these formatting options that you're probably

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,180
used to from using any other word processor.

12
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,070
So if I press enter, that creates a new block for me.

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,550
And if I just keep typing in this new block, it's just treated as another paragraph.

14
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,440
So again, it's just like any other word processor.

15
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:08,600
But if I want to add some other content element, an image or a heading or something like that, I can

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,360
click this plus sign to see a list of options.

17
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:12,920
Let's go ahead and add a heading.

18
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:19,120
As you can see, the sidebar over here changes to give you specific options, depending on which type

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,350
of block you're working on.

20
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:27,130
So we'll go ahead and add a subheading formatted as heading to and then press enter to jump down to

21
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,460
the next block, which again defaults to a standard paragraph.

22
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:36,010
And you'll notice that you can also use these buttons over here to choose from your most commonly used

23
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,470
blocks without having to browse through that menu.

24
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,870
One of the nice things about blocks is that you can rearrange them really easily if you want to.

25
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,850
So say I wanted to move this heading up.

26
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,390
All I have to do is use these options over on the left side of the block.

27
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,940
You can use the arrows or you can drag and drop.

28
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,590
Editing with blocks is a new experience for some people, but I think you'll find again that it's really

29
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,990
intuitive and easy to learn and once you're used to it, it just makes so much sense and it makes creating

30
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,500
content really easy.

31
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:11,420
So if we click out of our blocks, you'll see that the sidebar switches over to the document tab.

32
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,790
These are your main settings for this particular post.

33
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,050
They're pretty self-explanatory, but we'll run through them real quick here.

34
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:25,100
So this ability determines whether your post is public, private or password protected.

35
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,590
Most of the time, obviously, you're going to want to leave that public.

36
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,490
Under publish, you can choose to publish your post immediately or schedule for the future or backdate

37
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,220
it so that it appears to have been published in the past.

38
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,380
If you choose to stick the post to the front page, it will always appear on top, even when new posts

39
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,550
have been published after it.

40
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,020
Pending review is generally used for multi author sites where a particular post needs to be reviewed

41
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,710
by an editor.

42
00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:00,300
Below that, you can specify categories as well as tags, every post has to have a category, but not

43
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,010
every post has to have tags.

44
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,500
If you don't specify a category, it'll just go into the default category, which is uncategorized.

45
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,470
Next, you'll choose your featured image, which is basically just a thumbnail for your post, and it

46
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,010
may also appear at the top of your post, depending on what theme you use.

47
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,600
Under excerpt, you can write a custom post excerpt that will show up with this post on your home page

48
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,240
and archives instead of it just pulling out the first few sentences under discussion, you can choose

49
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,980
whether you want to allow comments on this post appear at the top.

50
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,950
You can preview your posts so you can see exactly what it'll look like on your site.

51
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,250
You can save a draft if you want to come back and finish the post later or if you're ready to go, you

52
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:47,280
can go ahead and click, publish, confirm your settings and publish the post.

53
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,600
So that is the Post editor, obviously one of the core parts of the WordPress interface.

54
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,690
So hopefully now you'll feel pretty comfortable using it.
