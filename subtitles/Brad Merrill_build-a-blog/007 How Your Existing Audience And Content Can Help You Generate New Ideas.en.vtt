I mentioned that you should be following the responses to other blogs and publications in your industry,



2

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.220

and it goes without saying that you should also be monitoring your own comments and social media mentions



3

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.950

religiously looking for repeat questions and other trends that you could potentially use for future



4

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.530

content.



5

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.070

You can also just ask your audience what they want from you by prompting them to leave a comment or



6

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.910

having them fill out a survey or even interviewing readers one on one.



7

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.480

Nobody knows your audience better than your audience.



8

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.640

So ask them about their problems, their struggles, their questions, even their reading habits.



9

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.040

If you want to get a closer look into their mind and understand what types of content they like to consume.



10

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.890

You can also learn a lot from your past content, take your most successful content and build on it



11

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.190

with supplemental material and use the content that didn't do so well as a learning experience.



12

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.960

And of course, you always want to monitor the analytics for your content, not just the traffic, but



13

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.640

also the demographics of your audience and the key words people are using to find your site.



14

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.920

I've often found myself ranking for a keyword that I hadn't even considered, and that gives me a better



15

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.670

perspective of what my audience is looking for specifically, which leads to better future content.



16

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.350

So be careful not to overlook your existing audience and your existing content when it comes to generating



17

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.160

new ideas.
