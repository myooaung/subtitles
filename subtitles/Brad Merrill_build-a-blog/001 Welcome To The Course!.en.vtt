00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.120

Hey, guys, Brad Merrill here, thank you so much for joining me.



2

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.950

Before we get started, I just want to take a quick second to introduce myself.



3

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.910

First and foremost, I am an entrepreneur.



4

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.870

I build businesses.



5

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.800

I've been building things on the Web for over a decade now.



6

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.950

And one of those things was a large tech blog that served well over half a million readers and paid



7

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.560

my bills with it.



8

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.730

I built relationships with a number of influential entrepreneurs and innovators, appeared regularly



9

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.340

on Techmeme and earned links from high profile sites and publications such as The Wall Street Journal,



10

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.180

Krunch Base, Wikipedia and many others.



11

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.660

What I hope to give you in this course is an all inclusive and up to date guide detailing what I've



12

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.530

learned over the years about what it takes to build a successful blog.



13

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.600

Thousands of students have already used this course to start blogging, and I've heard a ton of great



14

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.540

feedback, including from people who have left prestigious jobs at companies like Google to pursue their



15

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.340

blogging dreams full time.



16

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.710

As of this recording, this is the highest rated blogging course on you to me, and you are taking the



17

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.740

latest and greatest version of the course, updated and expanded to cover things in more depth using



18

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.290

all the student feedback and suggestions that I've gotten over the last couple of years.



19

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.190

So what specifically are you going to learn from this course?



20

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.430

Well, here are some of the things we'll cover.



21

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.590

We'll start with the absolute basics and focus on building a solid foundation for success.



22

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.550

We'll talk about the mindset of a successful blogger, everything from motivation to discipline to confidence.



23

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.530

We'll take an introductory look at the importance of good content and you'll learn how to find your



24

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.760

perfect niche and start brainstorming ideas for the name of your blog.



25

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.120

After that will dive into the technology you'll need to build your site domains, hosting WordPress



26

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.700

themes, plug ins, security backups.



27

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.920

As far as the technical stuff goes, even if you're an absolute beginner, I've got you covered.



28

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.110

Then we'll get into what's really important, which is your content itself, we'll talk about some really



29

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.960

effective ways to come up with new ideas for your blog, including some of my favorite tools and resources



30

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.790

that I use for inspiration.



31

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.060

After that, I'll give you some quick, actionable tips to improve your writing and make sure that everything



32

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.700

you publish on your blog is top notch.



33

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.320

Then we'll talk about the various types of content you can create for your blog.



34

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.260

And I'll actually give you more than a dozen specific content ideas that you can steal and apply to



35

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.960

your topic.



36

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.430

We'll also look at some different content formats that you can experiment with, like podcasting, video,



37

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.550

infographics, and then you'll learn how to create what seems like an infinite stream of fresh content



38

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.680

simply by repurposing what you've already created.



39

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.810

Once you're comfortable with content creation, you need to know how to reach an audience.



40

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.190

We'll take an in-depth look at SEO or search engine optimization, and then you'll learn a number of



41

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.050

proven strategies to proactively get your content in front of people.



42

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.610

Toward the end of the course, we'll talk about building an email list, which, even in the age of



43

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:19.020

social media, is still the most effective way to generate traffic and revenue on demand.



44

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.830

So we'll talk about the importance of having an email list, how to get people to sign up and what to



45

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.890

actually send people once they're on your list.



46

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.310

Finally, we'll talk about how to turn your blog into a revenue generating asset, a blog is not a business



47

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.880

on its own.



48

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.240

You have to implement some kind of revenue model on top of it, like selling a product, offering services,



49

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.900

selling advertising will go into detail on all the different options you have.



50

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.650

We're going to go deep with this course.



51

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.650

By the end of it, you should be well on your way to building a successful blog with an audience and



52

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:55.220

revenue.



53

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.230

Now, before I go any further, just to be clear, I don't want anyone to get the idea that building



54

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.930

a blog or building a business is easy.



55

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.760

Like you just take this course and at the end you're suddenly a successful blogger.



56

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.600

Obviously, it doesn't work like that.



57

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.880

It takes time and it takes work.



58

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.090

I tried to design this course as a complete blueprint with all the information you'll need, but it's



59

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.210

up to you to take action and put in the work.



60

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.230

My success comes from many, many long hours and plenty of failure and trial and error along the way.



61

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.730

I'm hoping to give you a little bit of an edge with this course, but building a business of any kind



62

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.990

takes work.



63

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.630

And I want to make sure you understand that from the start.



64

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.880

So why would you want to do this, what exactly did you get out of building a blog?



65

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.210

Well, there are several common motivations.



66

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.520

The first is to build a business.



67

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.190

A blog can be the center of a low overhead location, independent, lucrative business.



68

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.430

There's never been a better time to do this.



69

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:01.730

We are living in the digital age, my friends, and that means it's cheaper and more feasible than ever



70

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.580

for you or anyone to start a business.



71

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.170

If you're willing to put in the work, you can absolutely do it.



72

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.870

You just have to make it happen.



73

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.380

The second motivation is to grow an existing business content marketing.



74

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.340

Have you heard that term?



75

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.490

It's one of the best ways to drive your business forward.



76

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.940

And a blog is a tried and true format.



77

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.530

Many of the world's biggest companies and brands are now using digital content to market their products



78

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.270

and services.



79

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.220

So you'll be in great company if you do the same.



80

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.870

You can also use a blog to showcase your expertise if you want to position yourself as a thought leader



81

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.290

or an expert, blogging is an excellent way to do it.



82

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.180

I know people who've used their blogs as leverage to land jobs and others who have used them to launch



83

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.700

careers in public speaking.



84

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.440

And if you have aspirations to maybe publish a book one day, a blog is a great place to start.



85

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.860

Another motivation is building relationships.



86

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.200

Blogging can help you become an active member of your community and build relationships with people



87

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.260

you want to reach.



88

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.770

For me personally, blogging has helped me meet so many new friends and connections in the tech and



89

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.490

business world.



90

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:15.680

It's amazing how many people you can meet organically just by becoming an active voice in the community.



91

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.670

And finally, if you're passionate about your topic, you may find that writing about it is just a lot



92

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.460

of fun for its own sake, even if you don't consider yourself a great writer.



93

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:31.630

The process of researching and talking to people and sharing ideas is incredibly fulfilling.



94

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.520

Now, how much does it cost to start a blog?



95

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:41.610

Well, as we'll see, the initial investment can be as low as nothing or as high as thousands, depending



96

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.370

on your budget and your ambitions.



97

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.600

Most new bloggers can get a great website up and running for well under a hundred U.S. dollars.



98

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.990

We'll cover all the various costs of setting up a blog as well as their free alternatives later in the



99

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.590

course.
