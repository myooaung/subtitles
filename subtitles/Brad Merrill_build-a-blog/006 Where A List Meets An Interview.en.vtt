00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.330

The next type of content I want to cover an expert roundup is essentially a combination of a list post



2

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.170

and an interview.



3

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.110

You may find that the most prominent experts in your industry are busy and simply don't have time for



4

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.250

an extended interview.



5

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.320

That's OK.



6

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.720

We can work around that with a round up style post where we ask a bunch of different experts one question



7

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.930

and then compile their answers for our audience.



8

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.720

Even the busiest people who you'd have no chance of interviewing for an hour may have time to answer



9

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.740

one question for you.



10

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.440

The process is pretty simple.



11

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.530

Email all the leading experts in your space.



12

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.320

Let them know what you're doing and ask them if they'd kindly answer one question for you.



13

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.030

For example, you could ask for their number one piece of advice, their favorite tools or products



14

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.510

or something more specific, like how they'd handle a particular problem.



15

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.030

Once you've got some responses, all you have to do is compile them together and you've got an extremely



16

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.330

valuable piece of content showing the various thoughts and perspectives from the captains of your industry.



17

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.730

There's another approach to this type of content that doesn't even require an interview of people to



18

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.780

follow list.



19

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.870

I'm sure you've seen these.



20

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.370

A good example is Entrepreneur Dotcoms, 50 online marketing influencers to watch.



21

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.160

This is basically a who's who of your industry, a list of people you feel are worth following and why



22

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.170

structure it like a list post.



23

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.730

Start with the person's name.



24

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.220

Write up a short blurb about who they are and why they matter, and be sure to include any relevant



25

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.560

links like their website or their Twitter account.



26

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.500

Expert roundups are valuable in and of themselves because they introduce your audience to important



27

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.060

figures they should know about.



28

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.350

But they also generate some extra buzz when the experts themselves share them.



29

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.870

If someone takes the time to answer your question or offer some advice for your round up, or even if



30

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.760

they just find themselves featured unexpectedly in your people to follow list, more often than not,



31

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.700

they'll want to share that content with their own audience.
