00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.340

So we talked about expert roundups, but another type of content that may fit into your strategy is



2

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.490

a link roundup.



3

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.730

This is exactly what it sounds like, a collection of links that you feel your audience should know



4

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.090

about.



5

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.000

I used to do a weekly roundup for the tech industry where I compiled the most important news and the



6

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.970

best thought and opinion pieces every single week.



7

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.980

You can do something like that, or you can go with a more evergreen approach where you compile the



8

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.750

best articles, videos, tools or resources on a given topic.



9

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.100

When you're curating content like this, you'll want to be very selective.



10

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.910

The way to create the best roundup is to filter out all the noise and compile the absolute best content



11

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.870

for your audience.



12

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.150

Spend some time summarizing each link so people know exactly what they're getting and neatly package



13

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.280

it into a nice, cohesive list.



14

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.460

A link roundup is pretty easy to write because you're curating other people's content rather than creating



15

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.120

your own.



16

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.130

But it's still valuable because it saves your readers from having to do the research themselves.
