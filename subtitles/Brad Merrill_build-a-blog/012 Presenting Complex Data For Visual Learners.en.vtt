Sticking with the theme of research and statistics, infographics are a great way to make complex data



2

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.590

and information easy to digest.



3

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.680

You can create an info graphic using data from your own research, which is a great way to complement



4

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.310

the article.



5

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.320

Or again, you can just collect relevant data from other sources and visualize it.



6

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.450

If you have design skills, you can create infographics in-house and that shouldn't be a problem.



7

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.990

But you can also outsource that part of the process and it can be well worth the investment to do so.



8

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.820

You compile the data, hire a third party designer on a freelance site and then publish and promote



9

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.940

it.



10

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.340

The great thing about infographics is that they're ridiculously shareable, especially if you take steps



11

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.820

to make sure they get shared.



12

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.360

So the first thing I'd recommend doing is offering an embed code right there with the info graphic on



13

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.600

your site, just a few lines of HTML that people can use to share the info graphic along with and this



14

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.950

is the key, a link back to your site.



15

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.430

You can also take a PR approach to promoting infographics, reach out to bloggers and journalists in



16

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.350

your industry, show them the info graphic and offer to let them republish it for their audience.



17

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.240

It's a great way to generate some buzz while also providing value to these other people who are looking



18

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.110

for valuable content to share.



19

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.430

So, again, an info graphic is a great way to present complex data for visual learners, and it's incredibly



20

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.000

shareable.



21

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.020

So it may be worth working into your content strategy.
