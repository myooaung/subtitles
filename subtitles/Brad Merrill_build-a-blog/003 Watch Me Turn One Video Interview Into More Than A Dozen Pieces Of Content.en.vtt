00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.060

In this lecture, I want to give you a concrete example to illustrate the impact that repurposing can



2

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.940

have on your content strategy and just how much of a competitive advantage you'll have as a result.



3

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.050

So let's say you interview a high profile thought leader in your industry and let's say it's a video



4

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.530

interview.



5

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:27.360

That kind of interview by itself is an amazing opportunity to generate traffic and links and social



6

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:34.020

shares and build authority and credibility around your brand simply by having that influencer come and



7

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.640

talk to you.



8

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.100

But if you just post the video and call it a day, as most people would, you're not really squeezing



9

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.750

all the juice out of the orange.



10

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.320

There's still a lot of untapped potential in that one piece of content.



11

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.790

So here's what I would do in that situation.



12

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.510

First of all, when I initially post the interview I'd uploaded to YouTube and then embed the video



13

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.260

on my site.



14

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.670

That way the video is discoverable on the YouTube platform.



15

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.850

So I have the potential to reach a lot of people who wouldn't otherwise know about me or my brand.



16

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.360

So again, I'd embed the YouTube video in a blog post.



17

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.270

Then I'd write up a quick introductory paragraph summarizing kind of the main points of the interview.



18

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.740

And below that, I would transcribe the entire interview to text every word that way.



19

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.660

If somebody comes along and wants to read the interview rather than watch it, they can do that.



20

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.900

And having that transcript there also helps with search traffic because search engines are a lot better



21

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.320

at understanding text than video.



22

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.160

So that's the initial post.



23

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.010

I've already done a lot more than my competitors probably would, but I am far from finished.



24

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.790

An interview with an influencer can be a great source of social media content, so I pull out a few



25

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.510

of the most impactful quotes and tweet them out over the next few days, making sure to tag the person



26

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.310

and link back to the interview.



27

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.960

Then I'd use those same quotes to create some beautiful graphics using a tool like Cannava or Pablo



28

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.800

by Buffer.



29

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.400

And I'd post those on Instagram and Facebook again, making sure to tag the person and direct people



30

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.630

to the original video.



31

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.450

I might even make a short highlight reel of some of the best one liners of the interview and share that



32

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.890

on Instagram as well.



33

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.760

Then if I have a podcast, I'd convert the video to audio and release it as a podcast episode and I'd



34

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.920

probably just record an intro in an outgrowth so my listeners understand the context of what they're



35

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.330

hearing.



36

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.960

We're still not done here.



37

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.410

We can actually go a little bit further and craft another blog post with a headline like The Three Most



38

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.060

Valuable Lessons I Learned from whatever the person's name is here.



39

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.550

We're appealing to a slightly different audience.



40

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.300

People who may not have time to watch or read an entire long form interview, but are still interested



41

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.060

in getting a condensed version of the main points.



42

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.420

Then you can even repurpose that post a little bit, turn it into a podcast episode where you elaborate



43

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.400

on what you learned and why it matters.



44

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.030

Maybe tweet out bits and pieces of what you learned, make more graphics and so on.



45

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.990

Think about what I just did.



46

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.450

I took one video interview and managed to turn it into a dozen or more individual pieces of content.



47

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.160

Most people are not willing to put in that extra effort, which makes it a great opportunity to set



48

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.330

yourself apart by providing more value than the competition.



49

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.500

And you know what?



50

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.500

It's not even that difficult since you're just repurposing existing content rather than creating something



51

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.430

entirely new.



52

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.620

It's not like you have to go back and interview that person again and again to create these other pieces



53

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.250

of content.



54

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.160

You're just creating them from what you already have.



55

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.130

So see if you can work this little trick into your content strategy, it's simple, but very, very



56

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.940

powerful.
