Here's another quick tip that you may find helpful for creating better content in general, every piece

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,000
of content you create should have one core idea or solve one main problem.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,980
You never want to try to do too much with a single piece of content.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,380
If you try to be everything for everyone, you're going to dilute the value and ultimately put off the

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,300
people who would otherwise be interested.

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,600
So start with the problem you want to solve.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,260
Prepare the solution or the core idea or whatever message you're trying to get across and keep that

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,830
in mind throughout the writing process to keep you on course.

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,040
Now, just to be clear, it's OK to dive deep into certain aspects of the problem as long as they're

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,800
relevant.

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:51,600
For example, I recently wrote a 4600 word blog post with more than 25 different subheadings.

12
00:00:51,930 --> 00:01:00,240
But every section and every word of that post was focused on solving one main problem, step by step.

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,790
What you don't want to do is go off on some kind of tangent and start talking about something that doesn't

14
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,810
actually contribute to the value of the post.

15
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,250
So whatever your main goal is, whether that's teaching the reader something, arguing a viewpoint,

16
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,370
selling a product, keep that in mind and make sure that everything you write supports that goal in

17
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:20,990
some way.
