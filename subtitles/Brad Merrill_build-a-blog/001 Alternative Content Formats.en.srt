00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,370
Usually when you think of blog content, you think of a standard text blog post, now, it might have

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,130
some images and videos and stuff like that embedded.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,570
But when it comes to the core content, what most people think of is text.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:18,480
But I'd like to challenge that assumption a little bit because we as bloggers are by no means limited

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,470
to the written word.

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:24,270
There are so many different content formats you can deploy to get your message across, and it's worth

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:30,030
exploring some of the different options to see which formats best suit your personal skillset as well

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,170
as the preferences of your audience.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,320
So video is a great example.

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,740
We're actually living in the golden age of online video.

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,540
So many companies are turning to video as their primary medium for storytelling.

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,070
And for a lot of consumers, it's the ideal way to consume media.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,480
So if you're good on camera or if you find video to be compelling, you could experiment with putting

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,010
out video content instead of just text.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,770
There are a couple of ways to do that.

16
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,680
You could just upload videos directly to your site.

17
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,980
But what most people tend to prefer is uploading videos to YouTube and then just embedding the videos

18
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,880
in WordPress.

19
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,860
That way, the video is hosted by YouTube, so you don't have to worry about the extra strain on your

20
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,490
server.

21
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:17,460
And you also get the added benefit of being discoverable on the actual YouTube platform, which is a

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,230
great way to start growing an audience.

23
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,450
Podcasting is another medium that's been exploding lately.

24
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,170
I actually hosted a roundtable podcast for a few years and that was enormous fun to do.

25
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,640
So if you think audio may play well with your audience, give it a try.

26
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,430
It's pretty easy to set up a podcast in WordPress.

27
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,520
Personally, I always use the power press plug in.

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,860
You just create a regular blog post, attach your audio file with power press and you're good to go.

29
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,420
Here's a little bonus tip.

30
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,930
If you're on a budget and want to start podcasting while keeping your expenses to a minimum.

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,760
Pick up the audio Technica 8R twenty one hundred.

32
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,390
This is a high quality, affordable microphone that works over both USP and Zellar and then use the

33
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,810
free program audacity for your recording and editing.

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,390
So, again, there's video, there's audio, if you have design skills, you could do infographics or

35
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,170
something like that.

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,110
The point here is that you're not limited to the traditional text blog post.

37
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:22,210
Feel free to take the content ideas we covered earlier in this section and adapt them to a format that

38
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,080
works for you.
