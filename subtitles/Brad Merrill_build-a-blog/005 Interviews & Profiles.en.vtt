00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.620

An interview is an excellent type of content for almost any topic.



2

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.560

The idea is to find an expert in your industry, reach out to them and ask them questions about their



3

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.310

expertise.



4

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.010

It's a great way to provide enormous value to your audience while also leveraging the authority of the



5

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.880

person you're interviewing to boost the credibility of your brand.



6

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.680

So how do you conduct a great interview, you want to start by choosing the right format, a face to



7

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.280

face interview can be great, but more often phone or Skype interviews end up being more practical.



8

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.630

To talk to someone face to face, you have to be in the same location at the same time.



9

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.090

You have to fit into the person's schedule and it often consumes a lot more time than necessary.



10

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.740

An interview by phone or video chat is a lot easier to set up.



11

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.450

It eliminates travel time and it's still pretty easy to build rapport and have a real conversation.



12

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.030

You can do email interviews, but they generally don't turn out as well as spoken interviews.



13

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.430

Make sure you're recording the interview and ideally have a backup method just in case something goes



14

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.790

wrong.



15

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.770

So, for example, you could be recording video and then have a separate audio recorder running or you



16

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.300

could have a microphone and then be taking handwritten notes at the same time.



17

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.510

You never want to get to the end of an interview and realize you have nothing to show for it.



18

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.900

Trust me, before you interview someone, be sure to do your homework, read everything they've written,



19

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.230

know their story, check out the interviews they've done in the past.



20

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.580

Make sure you're prepared in terms of the interview itself.



21

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.470

Keep it conversational.



22

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.710

Don't give the person a list of questions in advance.



23

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.510

You don't want canned responses.



24

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.190

You obviously want to have some questions and a general road map planned out.



25

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.330

But don't be afraid to go off course and ask follow up questions.



26

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.390

You want to listen to what they're saying, be an active listener and treat it more like a discussion



27

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.620

than an interrogation.



28

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.760

With that said, you also don't want to talk too much yourself.



29

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.600

Try to keep the focus on the other person.



30

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.680

Interviews can work well in just about any format.



31

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.620

You can do video, you can do audio, you can write it up as an article and even publish a full transcript.



32

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.310

Whatever you think will be the most valuable format for your audience.



33

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.360

If you want to go deeper, you can also do a profile, which is basically a mini biography or documentary



34

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.880

of a person or company in your industry.



35

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.310

Usually this begins with an interview, but you'll also want to do some additional research and include



36

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.430

other relevant information to tell a complete story.



37

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.100

After interviewing and profiling hundreds of people in companies over the last few years, this is easily



38

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.080

one of my favorite content formats.
