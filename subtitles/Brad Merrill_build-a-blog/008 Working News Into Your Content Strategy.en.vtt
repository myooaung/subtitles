News content is a great way to keep your audience up to date on what's happening in your industry,



2

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.880

news is interesting because it usually won't drive long term traffic, but it can drive a substantial



3

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.190

amount of short term traffic if you do it.



4

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.740

Well, in my experience, there are two distinct approaches that are really effective, either be the



5

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.690

first or be the best.



6

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.180

If you're the first person to cover an important story, you'll naturally get a lot of shares in traffic



7

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.640

and links as the original source.



8

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.810

But if you're not first, and let's be honest, most of the time you won't be.



9

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.960

You can spend some extra time to offer additional context and analysis that the original source may



10

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.830

have neglected.



11

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.230

For example, you can explain the implications of a story, how it applies to your audience and what



12

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.560

they specifically need to know about it.



13

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.240

You don't need to cover every single thing that happens in your industry, just the stories that actually



14

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.470

impact your audience.



15

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.830

In fact, you shouldn't feel obligated to do news content at all unless doing so provides some kind



16

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.300

of value to your audience.



17

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.000

Providing value is always the number one goal.
