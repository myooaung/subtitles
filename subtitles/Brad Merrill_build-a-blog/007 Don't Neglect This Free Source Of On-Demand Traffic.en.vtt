This one is going to sound pretty obvious, but a lot of people tend to forget when you have fresh content,



2

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.120

the first people to hear about it should be your email subscribers.



3

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.500

The people on your email list have specifically requested to hear from you.



4

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.190

So they're the best group of people to send new content to.



5

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.930

It's a free source of On-Demand traffic that you actually own.



6

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.450

And continuing to send new content to your subscribers is a great way to maintain that relationship,



7

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.750

keep them engaged and hopefully move them down your funnel over time.



8

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.130

Here's a bonus tip after you send out a new piece of content to your subscribers, wait a couple of



9

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.490

days and then use your email service provider to segment out the people who didn't open the original



10

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:52.100

message, then send just those people the exact same message again, but with a different subject line.



11

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.020

This is a proven way to significantly increase your open rate and engage people who may have missed



12

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.070

that first email.



13

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.650

We'll talk more on email marketing soon, but I wanted to offer a couple of quick tips here as it pertains



14

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.060

to content promotion.
