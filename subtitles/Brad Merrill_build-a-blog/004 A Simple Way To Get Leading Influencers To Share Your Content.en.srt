00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,790
Earlier, we talked about expert roundups as something that may fit into your content strategy, but

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:12,750
it deserves a mention as a promotion strategy to not only our expert roundups, a great content format,

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,800
they're also an effective way to get leading influencers to share your content.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:24,570
So to refresh your memory, you reach out to a bunch of experts, ask them a single question and compile

5
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,090
all their answers into one big post.

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,350
Then, and this is where it becomes a promotion strategy.

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,050
Send them a link to the post when it goes live because they contributed to it.

8
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,540
Chances are they won't mind sharing it with their audience.

9
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,190
The same principle applies to the people to follow list that we talked about.

10
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:50,670
In this case, the person didn't necessarily contribute, but it's a pleasant surprise and even an honor

11
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,470
to be recognized as one of the top experts on your topic.

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,060
So it's worth reaching out to those people as well and saying, hey, we featured you in our list of

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,830
experts in our industry.

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,500
More than likely they'll check it out to see what you said about them and hopefully share it with their

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,790
audience as well.

16
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,760
Now, a word of warning.

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,570
This is a strategy that's been overused a bit in the business and marketing niche.

18
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,290
So it's not as effective in that space as it once was.

19
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,560
But if you cover a different topic, there should be plenty of room for you to do one of these roundups.

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,580
And by the way, when you're creating this type of content, please don't just throw a bunch of people

21
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,240
into a list because they have a lot of Twitter followers and might end up sharing your post, choose

22
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,280
your candidates based on merit and make sure the end result is something that actually brings value

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,330
to your audience.
