00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.180

Once you've got a Web hosting account, installing WordPress is a breeze because it's so popular.



2

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.310

Most web hosting companies offer an easy one click WordPress installation.



3

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.110

But what that looks like is going to vary a little bit from one host to another.



4

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.210

You may have had an option when you first signed up to go ahead and install WordPress automatically,



5

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.480

or you may have to go into your control panel and do it there.



6

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.400

If you followed, along with the previous lecture and set up an account on Bluehost, here's what that



7

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.840

process is going to look like.



8

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.510

When you log into the Bluehost customer area, you should see a welcome message inviting you to create



9

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.980

or migrate your website.



10

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.160

To get started, click Create your web site.



11

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.740

At this point, Bluehost will open a wizard to guide you through some of the initial setup stuff.



12

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.440

You can go through this if you want, but to help you better follow along with this tutorial, I actually



13

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.320

recommend skipping all of these steps.



14

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.170

Now, when you see this page that says, how would you like to build your WordPress site, select the



15

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.390

limitless customization option.



16

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.210

So once you've skipped through the wizard, you'll find yourself in the main Bluehost customer area



17

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.180

from here.



18

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.870

Click the button that says Log into WordPress.



19

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.840

This will open the WordPress dashboard, which is where you'll manage all aspects of your website.



20

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.630

Now, right away, you may notice that this is a pretty busy interface with lots of things going on.



21

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.530

This is because Bluehost preloaded WordPress with a bunch of plug ins that you may or may not actually



22

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.130

need.



23

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.740

Personally, this kind of stresses me out.



24

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.600

I prefer to start with a clean slate.



25

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.020

So before we get into the nitty gritty of WordPress, let's get rid of all the stuff that's been pre-installed



26

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.030

so we can build our site from scratch.



27

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.930

So if you look over at the left sidebar, you'll see a menu option that says plug ins, hover your mouse



28

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.870

over that and then click installed plugins.



29

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.040

Next, scroll down to the list of plugins and use the checkbox at the top to select all of them.



30

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.130

Then use this bulk actions menu to select, deactivate and click Apply.



31

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.640

You can then use the exact same process to go ahead and delete all of these plugins as well.



32

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.100

Right away, your entire interface should look much cleaner, and it'll be easier to follow along not



33

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.830

only with this tutorial but with other WordPress tutorials you may find around the web because now you're



34

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.100

using the standard stock WordPress dashboard without any of the clutter that your web hosting company



35

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.270

adds on top of it.



36

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.370

We'll cover plug ins later in this course, and you can decide for yourself which ones you actually



37

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.550

want or need for your particular website.



38

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.050

Now, one more quick step to make your life a little bit easier.



39

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.650

Let's go ahead and set a password for your WordPress account.



40

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.440

This is going to allow you to log into your website directly without having to go through Bluehost every



41

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.770

time.



42

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:05.990

So over in the left sidebar menu, click profile under the user section and then scroll down and click



43

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.510

Set New Password, then just enter a new password and click Update profile.



44

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.290

Once you've done this, you should be able to access your WordPress dashboard any time by adding Slash



45

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.730

WP Dash admin to the end of your domain name.



46

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.970

From now on, you'll be managing everything about your website.



47

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.120

From the WordPress dashboard.



48

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.740

You really only need to log in to Bluehost when you want to change your billing preferences or contact



49

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.940

Bluehost support or add a new website to your account for anything else.



50

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.480

When it comes to managing your website itself, you're going to do that through the WordPress dashboard,



51

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:52.250

which again, you can find by adding Slash WP Dash admin to your domain name.



52

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.010

So again, your domain Dot-Com slash WP Dash admin.



53

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.990

From there, you'll just log in with your email address and the password you just created.



54

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.400

And by the way, if you get some kind of error when you're trying to visit your website or your WordPress



55

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.340

dashboard directly, you probably just need to wait a few minutes for your domain name to finish activating.



56

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.860

Sometimes that's instant.



57

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.370

Sometimes it takes a little while.



58

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.720

It just depends.



59

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.150

And once again, make sure you've verified your email address because you have to do that before your



60

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.220

domain name is fully activated.



61

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.980

Now, while we're on the subject, after you've waited a few minutes, go ahead and open a new tab and



62

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.240

type in your domain name.



63

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.100

Let me be the first to congratulate you.



64

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.420

You literally have a live website up and running now.



65

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:39.860

It's not much yet.



66

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.170

It's pretty boring, but it's there.



67

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.840

And now it's time to customize it.



68

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.850

Now that your website is up and running, there are a few basic settings you'll want to customize to



69

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.420

your liking.



70

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.310

So from your WordPress dashboard, click General under the Settings menu.



71

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.030

On this page, you can change your site title.



72

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.830

You'll notice there's probably a default placeholder there.



73

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.700

Just clear that out and enter whatever you want your site to be called.



74

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.710

Then you can add a short tagline, which may show up in various places on your site.



75

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.000

This is optional.



76

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.580

You can just delete the placeholder text if you're unsure.



77

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.180

Finally, be sure to set the time zone to match your local time when you're happy with these settings,



78

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.220

scroll down and click Save Changes.
