So you've got yourself a blog, you're putting out great content, you're growing your audience and



2

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.380

you're building an email list, so it's time to talk about monetization.



3

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.100

But first, we have to acknowledge an important truth about blogs.



4

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.060

A blog is not a business in and of itself.



5

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.230

Your blog is the engine that will enable you to reach customers and bring people into your ecosystem.



6

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.360

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.520

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.170

And what worked in the past may not necessarily work so well today.



11

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.490

In fact, things have changed dramatically even in the last five years.



12

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.920

This section covers some of the most popular revenue models you can use to build a business around your



13

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.930

blog, including the pros and cons and how to execute each one successfully.
