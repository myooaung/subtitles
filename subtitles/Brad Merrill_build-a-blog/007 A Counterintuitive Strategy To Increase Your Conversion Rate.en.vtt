00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.270

Here's a counterintuitive strategy you may want to try usually when you have a pop up or other call



2

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.280

to action to get people on your list, you'll have the Opt-In form embedded right there.



3

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.400

But some data shows that it may be better to add another step and have people click a button before



4

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.850

the form even shows up.



5

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.660

Obviously, they still have to enter their email address, but they don't even see the form until after



6

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.860

they've click the button.



7

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.630

Many marketers have reported increased conversion rates using this approach.



8

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.850

The psychology here is this.



9

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.680

It's a lot easier to click a button than to fill out a form.



10

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.250

So the friction of claiming your free resource is perceived as low.



11

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.050

But then the form appears.



12

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.570

And even though the friction is higher now by clicking the button, the visitor made a subconscious



13

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.430

commitment to the process and as a result, they're much more likely to follow through.



14

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.690

Very weird, very counterintuitive, but it seems to work.



15

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.930

So you may want to test it out for yourself.
