00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.380

In this lecture, we're going to take a look at a couple of basic things you can do as part of your



2

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.090

initial setup to optimize your site for search engines.



3

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.950

First and foremost, you need to make sure you're allowing search engines to crawl and index your site



4

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.290

before a Web crawler visits your site.



5

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.320

It looks for a file on your server called Robots Dot Text.



6

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.220

This file dictates whether the crawler is allowed to visit your site at all and whether you'd like any



7

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.320

areas of your site excluded from the search results.



8

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.040

This is a really powerful file and it can be helpful if you want to customize which parts of your site



9

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.440

get indexed and which parts don't, which bots are allowed to visit your site and which aren't and so



10

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.220

on and so forth.



11

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.590

But being that it is so powerful, you need to be careful and make sure you know what you're doing if



12

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.760

you decide to edit it.



13

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.760

The last thing you want to do is start blocking all bots from visiting your site and suddenly disappear



14

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.870

from the search results.



15

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.460

WordPress manages your robots dot text file dynamically, and it makes it very easy to toggle the global



16

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.720

setting for that file.



17

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.450

Right from your reading settings page, there's a checkbox at the bottom that says discourage search



18

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.690

engines from indexing this site.



19

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.070

If you want your site to appear in search engines, make sure that box is not checked.



20

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.450

It's off by default.



21

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.530

But since it is just a checkbox, it'd be pretty easy to enable it by accident.



22

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.270

So be careful with that.



23

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.670

The next thing to consider is the permalink structure for your content.



24

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.850

This determines what your post, your URLs look like.



25

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.860

This is important because search engines use the content of your URLs as one of many ranking signals



26

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.140

that determine whether your page is relevant.



27

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.140

If you URL contains the keyword you're trying to rank for, that will give you a slight advantage.



28

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.900

So to customize your Perman links in WordPress, click Perman links under the Settings menu in your



29

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.590

dashboard.



30

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.440

The default structure looks like this.



31

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.740

It's pretty ugly, just a cryptic post ID number and it doesn't make a lot of sense to people or to



32

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.670

search engines.



33

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.340

When you change your link structure to something containing the name of your post, you have the opportunity



34

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.130

to include keywords in your URLs.



35

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.020

I prefer to keep things simple and use the post name structure, but if for whatever reason, you'd



36

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.810

prefer to have dates in your links, you can do that as well.



37

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.100

As long as the post name is in there, you're good.



38

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.670

Now, a word of warning.



39

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.750

If you've already got an established site up and running, be careful not to do anything that would



40

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.250

break your existing links.



41

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.400

You don't want to lose the search cred you've already worked hard to attain.



42

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:41.370

Finally, the age old question to w w w or not to w w w most web servers are set up so you can access



43

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.150

a site with or without the dot prefix.



44

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.480

This can sometimes present a problem with search engines because in their eyes, the new version of



45

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.530

your site is actually a separate Web site from your top level domain.



46

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.230

So they see two websites with the exact same content and you end up competing with yourself.



47

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.930

Now, search engines have gotten a lot smarter in the way they handle this, but I say better safe than



48

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:07.380

sorry.



49

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.210

Choose the version you like better.



50

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.710

Make sure the other version redirects to your preferred version and specify your preference on the general



51

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.680

settings page.



52

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.790

In WordPress, there's no SEO benefit to choosing one or the other.



53

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.100

It's really just a matter of personal preference.
