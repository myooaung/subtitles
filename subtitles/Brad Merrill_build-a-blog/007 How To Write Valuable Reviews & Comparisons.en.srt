1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,970
Another great type of content that you've probably seen and used yourself many times is a review.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,760
Reviews are pretty self-explanatory.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,830
You take a look at a product or service that's relevant to your audience and provide an honest review

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,850
of your thoughts and experiences, breaking down the good and the bad.

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,510
The goal of a good review is to inform the readers buying decision.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,580
You want to give them all the information they need to make an informed choice.

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,340
The most important thing here is to be completely honest.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,230
Your reviews should serve your audience, not the brand or the product itself.

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,900
If a product is amazing, you should say so.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,290
But if it sucks, be honest about that and recommend against buying it.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,810
I found the best way to write a review is to start with a brief summary.

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,690
Go ahead and disclose your recommendation right up front.

13
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,840
Is the product worth buying or not?

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,340
Then break the product down into the most important categories.

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,040
For example, if you were reviewing a pair of wireless headphones, you could divide your review into

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,820
sections for sound quality noise, cancelling connectivity, battery life and so on.

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,350
And for each of these categories, you'll want to provide a detailed analysis of your experience, both

18
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,940
the good and the bad.

19
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,210
I like to close a review with a list of pros and cons and then the bottom line, where I explained whether

20
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,190
I recommend the product or not.

21
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,060
The natural extension of a review is a comparison where you compare to similar products that are competing

22
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,200
in the same market.

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,510
In this case, you'll want to go over the details of each product, but focus specifically on the key

24
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,100
differences between the two.

25
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:40,680
For example, this pair of headphones has longer battery life, but this other pair offer superior sound

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,180
quality, things like that.

27
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,860
When you're comparing to products, you may find that there's a clear cut winner, in which case you

28
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,640
should say so.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,470
But often one product or the other may be better suited for a particular group of people.

30
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:56,820
So you could say the pair of headphones with really good battery life is great for the traveler who's

31
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,840
always on the go.

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,830
But the pair with better sound quality is better suited for the audio file.

33
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,620
Who wants the best possible sound experience?

34
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:10,100
Again, the goal is to provide helpful information to inform the audiences buying decisions.

35
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,040
Keep that in mind.
