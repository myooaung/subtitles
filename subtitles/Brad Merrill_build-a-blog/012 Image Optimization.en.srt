00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,960
One aspect of that often gets overlooked is image optimization, search engines have no problem reading

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,450
your text, but they usually need a little help to understand the context of your photos.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,950
But if you add the proper metadata to your images, which only takes a few seconds, you can generate

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,960
some extra traffic by helping your photos rank in places like Google Images, for example.

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,480
And as an added benefit, you can also help visually impaired readers make sense of your content if

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,770
they're using a screen reader.

7
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,410
The process here is super simple.

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,870
Whenever you upload an image to WordPress and insert it into a post or page, take a second to write

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,620
a descriptive alt attribute to tell search engines exactly what the image is as I'm doing here.

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,200
This is a simple but effective way to tap into a traffic source that your competitors probably neglect.
