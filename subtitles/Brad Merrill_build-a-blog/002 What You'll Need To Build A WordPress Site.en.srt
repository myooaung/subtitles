1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,550
Before you can set up a WordPress site, you'll need a couple of things a domain name and a web hosting

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:05,940
account.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:12,570
Your domain name is the address people will use to visit your site, for example your blog dot com.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,660
Your web host is where your site's files are stored and where will install WordPress in the next lecture.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,120
The simplest approach is to get your domain and web hosting package from the same company.

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,550
If you don't, you'll just have to point your domain to your web server, and your host should give

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,050
you instructions on how to do that.

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,180
But again, if you're just getting started and want to keep everything simple, your best bet is to

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,300
grab a domain right along with your hosting package.

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,090
My current hosting recommendation, if you're building a brand new blog, is Bluehost, and that's for

11
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,060
a couple of reasons.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,560
Number one, Bluehost is the top hosting recommendation on the official WordPress.org website.

13
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,170
And number two, Bluehost is one of the most affordable hosting providers in the industry, which of

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,550
course, is a big plus when you're starting a new project that isn't generating income yet.

15
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,290
Bluehost also makes it incredibly easy to set up a new WordPress site.

16
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,740
You don't need any special knowledge or experience to be able to do it.

17
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,840
It's basically just a couple of clicks.

18
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,190
Now, of course, you don't have to use Bluehost if you have another hosting company that you prefer.

19
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,750
That's totally fine.

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,760
But for the purposes of this course, I'm going to show you exactly how to do it with Bluehost, and

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,080
you're welcome to follow along.

22
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,280
So let's get started now, hopefully after our lecture on naming and branding.

23
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,340
You've got some ideas in mind for what you might like to name your blog, whether it's just your personal

24
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,860
name or some other brand name that you thought of.

25
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:43,050
And this is where we're going to kind of set that in stone and register a domain name.

26
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,260
So I've created a special tool for students of this course, where you can easily check to see whether

27
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,650
the name you want is available as a domain name.

28
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,420
And then once you've done that, this tool is going to allow you to get your domain for free with your

29
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,030
Bluehost account, so you'll have to pay for the hosting.

30
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,160
But instead of also having to pay for the domain, that is going to be free for the first year.

31
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,410
So to use this tool, you'll want to go to Brad Names dot com.

32
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,210
That's Brad in Amy's dot com.

33
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,780
This is what it's going to look like.

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,080
You can enter any domain name that you're interested in into this box, and it's going to check to see

35
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,790
whether it's available, and it also give you some alternatives with other extensions.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,790
So if the dot com isn't available, you can also see if that same name is available on Dot Net Dawg

37
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,660
and so on.

38
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:41,310
So if we enter example dot com into this tool, we're going to see that example dot com is unfortunately

39
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:48,450
unavailable and so is Example Dot Net Dawg, Echo Dot Info, Dot US and dot biz.

40
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,010
So that's not going to work.

41
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,980
But if I enter something a little more original, say my cool test site dot com.

42
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,970
That one actually is available, and so are all these other extensions, so you can spend some time

43
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:08,640
trying different names in this tool, and when you find a name you like, just click claim this name

44
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,840
to get it for free.

45
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,610
That's going to pop you over to Bluehost, where you can sign up for the basic hosting package that's

46
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,530
going to get your website up and running.

47
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,200
So here you'll need to enter some basic information to create your Bluehost account and process your

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,620
payment.

49
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:28,560
Now, you'll notice you have the option of choosing a billing period from 12 to 36 months.

50
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,470
This part is important because the discounted price will be locked in for whatever period you choose

51
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,820
here, and you'll get a steeper discount if you choose a longer billing period.

52
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,770
So in other words, the longer the billing period, the more money you'll save over time.

53
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,010
Now, of course, that does come with a higher upfront cost.

54
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:53,030
So really, this comes down to what you personally are comfortable with toward the bottom of the page.

55
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,130
Bluehost is going to offer some package extras.

56
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,750
You can add or remove whatever you want here, but I'll give you some quick thoughts on this stuff.

57
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:07,180
So first, I would recommend adding domain privacy if it's not included in your plan already.

58
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:14,010
This just ensures that spammers, telemarketers and random internet crazies can't look up your contact

59
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,940
info and your address in the public domain records.

60
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:24,540
When you add the Domain Privacy Service, Bluehost will effectively act as your agent using their address

61
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,510
and contact info in the public records for your domain.

62
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:35,910
The other stuff here you don't really need notice they're offering this Microsoft 365 Mailbox trial.

63
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,160
You can take advantage of that if you want, but keep in mind they are going to charge you for that

64
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,600
after the 30 day trial.

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,880
So unless you want that service and you're willing to pay for it, you'll want to either uncheck that

66
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,300
box now or remember to cancel it before it renews.

67
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:58,500
Once you're satisfied with your options, you can enter your credit card details here or click more

68
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,610
payment options.

69
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,890
If you want to pay with PayPal, then just agree to the terms of service and click Submit.

70
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,980
After you've done this, just follow the instructions on screen to create a username and password for

71
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,380
Bluehost and then log into your account.

72
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,620
Meanwhile, you should have received an email from Bluehost asking you to click a link to activate your

73
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,400
domain name.

74
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,650
Make sure you do this as soon as possible.

75
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,220
That way, your website can get up and running without any delays.
