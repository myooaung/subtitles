00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,130
A case study is a really effective type of content if you have a business and you're trying to promote

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,930
your products or services.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,260
Now, I know I've repeatedly said that your primary goal should always be to provide free value.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,210
Constantly touting your products is not the best way to build trust with your readers.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,580
But there's a time and a place for everything.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,940
And a case study is a rare opportunity where bragging about your business's offerings can actually provide

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,590
value to your audience.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,040
So first of all, what is a case study?

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:38,190
A case study tells the story of how you've helped a particular customer solve a problem, often with

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,160
quotes or testimonials from the customer themselves.

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,350
Social proof is important in a case study is the ultimate form of social proof.

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,160
So how do you write an effective case study?

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,060
Well, first, you want to be sure to select the right candidate.

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,700
Whoever you profile in your case study should have extensive knowledge of your product, enthusiasm

15
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,030
about your business and impressive results to back up that enthusiasm.

16
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,510
So reach out to some of your top customers.

17
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:12,570
Let them know that they're special and important to you, and ask them to help tell their story, not

18
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,540
your story, their story.

19
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:20,130
It's important to make them the focus when you get somebody on board, move forward with an interview

20
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,070
process, talk to them about their experiences, ask open ended questions and learn more about their

21
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,490
problems and how your business has contributed to the solution.

22
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,600
A good case study should be structured as a story.

23
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,290
In this case, the customer you're profiling is the main character.

24
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,570
You're telling it from their point of view they faced some sort of conflict or problem.

25
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,900
They tried X, Y and Z, but those methods didn't work.

26
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,510
And eventually they overcame the odds and used your business to finally resolve the problem.

27
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,580
That's a case study in a nutshell.

28
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,160
Now, when you're talking about results, you'll want to be as specific as possible.

29
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:04,200
For example, if I was doing a case study on how I helped a client with their content marketing efforts,

30
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,700
I could say that they were able to triple their traffic or double their conversions.

31
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,500
But those phrases are kind of ambiguous, right?

32
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,490
I could have taken a company from 10 page views a month to 30, and that would technically count as

33
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,690
tripling their traffic.

34
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,840
Even though the end result was only 20 more page views.

35
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,750
It'd be much more effective if I said that I helped grow a client's traffic from, say, twenty thousand

36
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,180
page views to sixty thousand page views.

37
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,900
So use hard facts and concrete data as much as you can.

38
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,820
But of course, make sure you have the customer's permission to share anything that may be somewhat

39
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,390
private.

40
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,230
So those are some things to keep in mind when you're writing a case study.

41
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,960
Again, this is a rare opportunity to openly tout the benefits of your products, but make sure you

42
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,750
always do so within the context of a story.

43
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,210
This is a great way to provide value to your audience when they're in the stage where they're deciding

44
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,880
whether your business may be able to help them.

45
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,000
That social proof, that story of how you helped someone else can make all the difference.
