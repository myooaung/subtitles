We covered Lync roundups as a content idea earlier, and now we're going to take a look at the other



2

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.650

side of the equation, which is getting your content featured in someone else's roundup link.



3

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.470

Roundups are a really popular format, which means there are lots of opportunities if you have a valuable



4

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.360

piece of content to promote, the process is pretty simple.



5

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.540

Head over to Google and try searching for different variations of Roundup.



6

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.100

Plus your industry.



7

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.770

When you find some relevant lists, you can begin to reach out to the creators.



8

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.950

All you have to do is tell them who you are.



9

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.190

Let them know that you saw their link roundup and found it valuable and say that you have a piece of



10

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.110

content you want to share with them.



11

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.340

Make sure they know exactly why your post is awesome and what value it will bring to their audience.



12

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.920

Now, I'm going to pause here to remind you again that the quality of your content is always priority



13

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.490

number one.



14

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:00.210

And I would never advise you to waste your time and someone else's time promoting a piece of mediocre



15

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.770

content.



16

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.900

If you're going to be bold enough to directly ask someone to link to your content, it needs to be something



17

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.400

you're truly proud of.



18

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.040

With that said, getting featured in a link roundup is a great way to reach a new audience, drive some



19

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.160

long term traffic, and it's great for your SEO to have an authoritative site pointing to your valuable



20

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.750

resource with a link.
