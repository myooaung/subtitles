1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,090
Once you decide on an email marketing platform and set up a list, you need to convince people to actually

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:06,730
sign up.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,290
Now, of course, you want a place opt in forms in key locations on your website, but very few people

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,980
are going to hand over their contact information just because you asked for it.

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,750
You have to incentivize the opt in.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,850
In other words, offer something of value in exchange for an email address.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,740
So what exactly constitutes something of value?

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,840
Well, in some cases, it can just be the content of the emails you'll be sending, for example, if

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,450
you write an industry newsletter or something like that.

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:43,450
But most of the time, it's better to give people instant gratification with some kind of free resource.

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:50,010
This is often referred to as a lead magnet because it attracts leads and it's probably the most effective

12
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,860
way to get email sign ups.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,090
With that in mind, let's take a look at some examples to help you come up with an effective lead magnet

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,900
for your blog.

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,540
First, we have a checklist or a cheat sheet.

16
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:06,980
This is a classic lead magnet that converts really well because it's so easy to digest.

17
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,910
You just package everything people need to know into a simple, actionable list.

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,150
And interestingly, the general consensus in the marketing world is that short resources like checklists

19
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,550
actually convert better than something like an ebook because they're short and the time required to

20
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,160
consume them is minimal.

21
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,660
A tool kit is similar.

22
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,840
It's basically a list of tools that you use for a particular purpose.

23
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,630
So if you have an audience of photographers, you could put together a list of your favorite equipment

24
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,060
and software for photography.

25
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:45,600
A resource list saves people from having to do research themselves, and it compiles the most important

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,120
resources on a topic in one place.

27
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,900
A template is some kind of simple outline that people can grab and apply to their lives by filling in

28
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,590
the blanks.

29
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:02,700
Calendars and planners can be a great opportunity if you want to help people achieve a long term goal.

30
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,010
You tell them what to do each day over a certain period of time, and they do it.

31
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,800
For example, in the health and fitness industry, you could offer meal plans or workout routines as

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,580
your lead magnet.

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,990
Spreadsheets are a great way to manipulate data and make live calculations, but a lot of people don't

34
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,300
know how to program a spreadsheet themselves.

35
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,620
You can fill that need by offering a spreadsheet template as a free resource.

36
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,360
For example, if you cover personal finance, you could offer a budgeting spreadsheet so people can

37
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,390
just download it and input their own numbers to make it work.

38
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:43,660
So I mentioned that shorter resources tend to outperform longer ones, but if you can write an extended

39
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:50,270
guide or e-book that's actionable and rewarding enough, it can be a solid lead magnet.

40
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:55,110
Just make sure you deliver plenty of value and respect people's time.

41
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,680
Another way to offer deeper value is by delivering an email course.

42
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,790
You can do this with the autoresponder feature in your email marketing service.

43
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:10,090
Just write up a series of emails and cue them up to send every couple of days or so after someone signs

44
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:10,330
up.

45
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,550
If you cater to a creative audience, principles can be a great option artistic materials, calendars,

46
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,410
shopping lists, any of these things can be delivered as a print friendly PDF file.

47
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,160
Earlier in the course, we talked about conducting original research and sharing the results in a blog

48
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:36,880
post, another twist on that concept would be to share the results in a downloadable PDF in exchange

49
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,140
for email addresses.

50
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,300
You can summarize your results on your blog and point people to the free download if they want the full

51
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,590
extended report.

52
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:52,240
As we've seen in certain scenarios, audio makes more sense as a format than text or video.

53
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:58,530
It's great for busy entrepreneurs or something like guided meditation, for example, just set up an

54
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,650
Opt-In form and deliver the file as an MP3.

55
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:08,330
Live webinars are an amazing way to build trust with your audience, and they're also a great way to

56
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:13,820
collect email addresses, have people sign up if they're interested, and then send them more details

57
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,810
by email.

58
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:23,010
A super easy but effective way to turn blog readers into subscribers is by offering a PDF version of

59
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,530
your longer blog posts.

60
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,450
For some people, it's just a more convenient way to consume your content.

61
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:35,580
You can do it manually or use a tool like print friendly dotcom to convert your content into a PDF in

62
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,100
under 60 seconds.

63
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:45,620
Art and wallpaper, if you do design or photography, you can make some of your work available for free

64
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:52,940
in exchange for an email address, wallpaper's are great, as are Facebook and Twitter cover photos,

65
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:59,150
Photoshop templates and things like that can also be really effective if you have an audience of creatives.

66
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:06,050
We've repeatedly covered the value of niche communities focused on your industry, and I even mentioned

67
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,550
that you may want to create a community of your own.

68
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:15,170
You can also use that idea as a way to grow your list by offering a private community exclusive to people

69
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,060
who opt in to your email list.

70
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,570
This can be something you create and host yourself, or it can be as simple as a Facebook group or slack

71
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,060
team.

72
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,150
We've also talked about the value of a case study where you tell the story of a particular customer

73
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,800
in the role you played in solving their problem.

74
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:39,330
Another take on that concept is to put the case study behind an Opt-In form and deliver it by email.

75
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:46,920
The leads you get from that form are all but guaranteed to be highly qualified and far more likely than

76
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,450
other groups to buy from you.

77
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,960
And along the same lines, offering a free quote in exchange for contact information will also deliver

78
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,890
highly qualified leads that you can follow up with and close.

79
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,970
So those are all solid ideas for potential lead magnets.

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,010
Now it's worth mentioning that when you create a lead magnet, it's important that you give it the time

81
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,680
and attention it deserves.

82
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:16,690
The lead magnet sets the tone for your entire relationship with your email subscribers, so it should

83
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,310
be something you're really proud of.

84
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,220
Now, as far as delivery, most people deliver lead magnets in one of two ways.

85
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,960
The first is to include a download link on the thank you page, which is where you send people as soon

86
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,870
as they sign up.

87
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,140
The other is to put a download link in the welcome email that's delivered as soon as people confirm

88
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,230
their subscriptions.

89
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:43,510
That's the method I prefer because the download link isn't exposed on a public webpage, so only subscribers

90
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,440
can access it.

91
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:51,220
Lead magnets are essential for growing an email list, so start thinking about which ones you may be

92
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,020
able to employ for your blog.
