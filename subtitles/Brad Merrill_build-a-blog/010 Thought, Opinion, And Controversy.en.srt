Next up, we have thought and opinion content, your mileage may vary with this one depending on your

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:12,030
brand and your personal style, but opinion pieces are a great way to go deeper with your content and

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,700
encourage reader engagement.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,800
Consider an issue that's important to your audience and take a side elaborated on your position with

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,640
logical arguments and help the reader understand your point of view.

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,190
You don't want to come across as preachy, so allow some room for disagreement, but at the same time

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,780
assert your position and don't be wishy washy.

8
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,900
Interestingly, controversy is very good for traffic and engagement.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:43,020
I don't think you should actively seek out controversy, but I will say that any time I've taken a stance

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,020
on a controversial issue, it has generated a lot of buzz.

11
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,080
Now, of course, I'm talking about things that pertain to your audience and your niche.

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:59,670
Politics and religion and other heavy, divisive topics are usually not going to fit into your strategy

13
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,410
unless, of course, your blog is about one of those particular things, in which case go for it.

14
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,330
But if you're going to weigh in on an issue, make sure it's something that actually matters to your

15
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,890
audience specifically.

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,430
For example, a few years ago I wrote a series of posts about a large guest blogging network that was

17
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,520
using some, let's say, questionable tactics to game search engine rankings for the members of their

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,150
network.

19
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,490
I took a hard stance against that.

20
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,160
And while I took a lot of heat from the network itself and some of its members, my coverage was widely

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,570
credited for spurring Google to take action against them.

22
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,230
So even though it was controversial, my content was informative and persuasive.

23
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:45,870
It was relevant to my audience in the tech and business world and as a bonus, it resulted in an actual

24
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,240
solution to the problem.
