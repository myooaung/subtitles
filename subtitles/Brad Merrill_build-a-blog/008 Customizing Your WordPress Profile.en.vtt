Something you'll probably want to do before you start publishing content is customize your profile in



2

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.250

WordPress, you can do this by clicking your profile under the user's tab in your dashboard.



3

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:18.050

On this page, you can edit a few different options that just customize your experience inside of WordPress.



4

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.980

For example, if you want WordPress to look a little different, you can choose any of these alternative



5

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.990

color schemes.



6

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.760

But the most important section here is your actual profile information, which determines how you're



7

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.790

identified on the front end of your site so you can enter your first and last name here, as well as



8

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.040

a nickname, which can be anything you want.



9

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.090

And then you can choose to display your name publicly as any combination of those.



10

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.500

This is what people are going to see on your author page and on posts that you've written.



11

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.820

We also have contact info and biographical info, which may or may not show up on your site depending



12

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.540

on your theme.



13

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.930

And after that, we have your profile picture.



14

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.020

And to edit this, you'll need to create an account on Gravity Dotcom using the same email address that



15

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.010

you used here.



16

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.880

Gravitas means globally recognized Avatar, and it's basically a way to set a profile picture for yourself



17

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.060

once and have that profile picture follow you around the Web, most commonly on WordPress sites.



18

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.240

So it'll show up on your blog, but it also show up when you comment on somebody else's WordPress blog



19

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.940

as long as you use that same email address.



20

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.010

So sign up for gravitas, set a profile picture and it should automatically sink back to your site.



21

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.570

You can also change your password on this page if you need to.



22

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.130

And once you've configured everything, just click update profile and you're good to go.
