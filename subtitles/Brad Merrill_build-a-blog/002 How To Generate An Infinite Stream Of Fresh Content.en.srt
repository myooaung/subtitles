00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,520
In this lecture, I'm going to share with you a strategy used by some of the world's most prolific content

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,690
creators to generate what seems like an infinite stream of fresh content.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,650
So as we saw, when you're creating content for your blog, you have a number of different formats to

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,370
choose from.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,380
You can do regular written posts.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,180
You could do audio, you can do video.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,520
You can do other visual formats.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,520
You have plenty of options at your disposal and it can actually be in your interest to do more than

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:29,910
one.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,450
You see, when you create a piece of content in one format, there's a huge opportunity there to repurpose

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,900
that content and share it again in a different format.

12
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:47,220
You can use that as a way to promote the original content or to deliver the same message to a completely

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,350
different audience.

14
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,360
You can turn video into text and audio.

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,030
You could turn text into video and audio.

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,340
You can turn text into an info graphic.

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,910
You can turn audio and a video with slides or animation.

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,410
You can turn blog posts into social media content by sharing quotes and graphics.

19
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,380
The possibilities here are endless.

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,460
Repurposing is one of the most valuable secrets of content creation because it's such a simple and effective

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:21,660
way to extract additional value from your existing content and to grow your audience by reaching people

22
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,700
who may prefer a different format.
