When you're growing a new blog, building an email list should be your absolute number one priority.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,700
I know that surprises some people, but it's true.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:16,590
Even today, in the age of social media, an email list is still the single most effective tool for

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,070
generating repeat traffic and repeat customers on demand.

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,290
Think about it.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:29,760
It's the only communication channel that you actually own, meaning no news feed update or new search

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,630
algorithm will ever impact your ability to reach people with it.

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,500
Almost everyone checks their email daily, and most importantly, people have to opt in to your email

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,300
list, meaning everyone on your list actually wants to hear from you.

10
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,910
Your list is your greatest asset for building a strong community and a profitable business.

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,520
Here are some stats from the marketing world.

12
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:00,180
According to a study by McKinsey and Company, email is 40 times more effective in terms of customer

13
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,900
acquisition than Facebook and Twitter combined.

14
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:10,770
On top of that, get response reports that for every one dollar invested, email marketing generates

15
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,790
an average return of thirty eight dollars.

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,010
In other words, a 37 percent ROIC.

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,840
Now keep in mind, a good email marketing campaign begins with a good list.

18
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,510
You want real information from real people who check their email regularly, and you want those people

19
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,220
to be genuinely interested in your blog and what you have to offer.

20
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,320
Don't be tempted to buy an email list from a service that promises thousands of email subscribers for

21
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,080
a very small amount of money.

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:45,270
Most of the emails you get will be old or fake, and the few who are actual people probably won't be

23
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,310
interested in you or your content.

24
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,530
Plus, there's a good chance you'll get flagged as a spammer, which is just icing on the cake of a

25
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,990
very bad investment.

26
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,970
You'll see much better results by growing your own list organically and will cover exactly how to do

27
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,440
that in this section.
