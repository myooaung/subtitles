One of the biggest selling points of WordPress is its extensibility, you're not stuck with the default

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,460
set of features, your WordPress site is yours to customize, and it's very easy to customize.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,670
WordPress plugins offer a way to extend the functionality of your website without having to write the

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,780
code yourself.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:25,260
Just like Theme's WordPress has a repository of free plug ins, which you can also access from the plugin

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,790
section of your dashboard.

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:33,270
Plug ins range in their scope from simple things like adding social media buttons to your blog posts

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,900
to more complex things like turning your site into a full fledged social network.

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:43,680
So just to give you some examples, let's take a look at a few popular plug ins on WordPress, dawg.

10
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:50,900
A kismet actually comes preinstalled with every new WordPress installation in its function is to monitor

11
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,370
your comments and contact form submissions to protect your site from spam.

12
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:02,110
The jetpack plugin gives you access to a bunch of features that are offered to WordPress dotcom users

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,110
that self hosted WordPress sites don't have out of the box, for example, it has a great stat tracking

14
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:13,030
feature that monitors your traffic and gives you real time audience data at a glance.

15
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:19,340
BBY Press is a solution for adding forums to your WordPress site, and it's actually the same plug in

16
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,550
that WordPress dot org uses for its support forums.

17
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:29,450
And finally, Yoast CEO is probably the best WordPress plugin for search engine optimization.

18
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,120
We'll actually talk about Yoast in depth later in the course.

19
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,210
So these are just a few examples.

20
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,720
We could talk all day about different plug ins and what they do.

21
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,080
And we'll talk about several specific ones throughout this course.

22
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:47,570
But for now, I just wanted to introduce you to what they are and where to find them before you install

23
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:52,250
a plug in from the WordPress repository, always check out the reviews to see what other people are

24
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:52,960
saying about it.

25
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,970
Does it do what it claims to do?

26
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,460
Does it cause any problems or conflict with other plugins?

27
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,280
You'll often find that information in the reviews.

28
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,150
You can also purchase premium plugins from third party vendors.

29
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:10,400
But that's not something you'll need to do very often because most of the functionality you can think

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,120
of is already covered by free plug ins on WordPress, dawg.
