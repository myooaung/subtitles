00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,210
One of the responsibilities that comes with hosting your own WordPress site is managing your own security

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,140
and backups.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,310
This is a pretty dull subject and a lot of people tend to put it off or just assume it's not that important.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,200
But trust me, if your site ever gets hacked or if you lose a bunch of data and some kind of catastrophe,

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,900
you're going to wish you've been prepared from the start.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,090
We won't spend too much time on this, but I want to go over the essentials so you can protect yourself.

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,050
Let's start with the most basic thing passwords.

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:38,220
Understand that as the administrator of your WordPress site, your password is the only thing stopping

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,720
an intruder from gaining unfettered control of your site and locking you out.

10
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:49,410
So make sure that your WordPress password is secure, like a complex mix of letters, numbers and symbols

11
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,250
that wouldn't be easy to guess and don't use it for any other site.

12
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:59,370
On a related note, it's a good idea to use a password manager like Last Pass to generate and store

13
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,160
secure passwords for all of your accounts, not just WordPress.

14
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,570
All you have to remember is a single master password.

15
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,430
Last pass handles the rest and it's totally free.

16
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,040
I highly recommend it.

17
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:17,160
I also recommend you install a plug in called Log Organizer, one of the simplest methods the hackers

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:23,520
use to gain access to a site is a brute force attack, which is a trial and error tactic where a bot

19
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,730
basically tries random username and password combinations over and over and over until it finally gets

20
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,180
in.

21
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:37,050
This plug in will automatically lock a user out after a set number of unsuccessful login attempts protecting

22
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,640
you from brute force attacks.

23
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,670
There are a lot of plug ins out there for backups and security, but there's one in particular that

24
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,880
I strongly suggest you use, and that's vault press.

25
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,430
Now it is subscription based, so it'll cost you anywhere from five to thirty dollars a month depending

26
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,570
on the plan you choose.

27
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,300
But I'd say it's well worth it for what you get.

28
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,020
So what is Volp press?

29
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:05,040
It's a service that automatically backs up your data and monitors your site for malware and security

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,600
flaws.

31
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:10,860
If you ever need to restore backup, you can do it basically with a couple of clicks and volp presses

32
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,940
made by the same people who make WordPress so they really know their stuff.

33
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:21,180
Getting set up is as easy as signing up at Volp Press dot com and then installing the vault press plugin

34
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,890
on your site.

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,260
If you can't justify the cost of Volp press yet, there are free plugins out there such as word fence

36
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,800
for security and backup WordPress for backups.

37
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,610
As long as you've got something in place to prepare yourself, you're good.
