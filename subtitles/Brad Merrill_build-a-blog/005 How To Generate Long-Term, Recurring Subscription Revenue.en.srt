00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,520
Membership sites are another popular revenue model that has the potential to bring in recurring and

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,640
ever increasing revenue for you, a membership site could offer a catalog of courses, an exclusive

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,940
community, some kind of live coaching service or something of that nature, and people pay on a monthly

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,170
or annual basis for access.

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,860
I think membership sites can be a great opportunity, but I have to be honest, they're a difficult

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:26,290
sell.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,100
There are so many membership sites out there.

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,750
And it begs the question, does the world really need another membership site?

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,270
If you want to be successful with this model, you have to focus on providing some kind of unique value

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,940
prop to differentiate yourself.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,690
Why should people join?

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,860
And perhaps more importantly, why should they stick around for the long run?

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,000
And it may require more upfront work than something like an information product.

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:57,030
If you're offering a catalog of courses, for example, you have to first produce those multiple courses.

15
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,220
And if you're offering a community, you have to seed the community and get some real engagement started

16
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,440
as soon as possible.

17
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,470
Nobody wants to join a ghost town community, especially if they have to pay for it.

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,610
Now, if you have your heart set on a membership service, I'm not trying to discourage you.

19
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,770
Often the best opportunities are those with the highest barriers to entry.

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,570
If you're up to the challenge and feel you can bring unique value to the table, I say go for it.

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,140
You can use plugins like membership by PMU Dev or member press to get the job done.

22
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,920
And again, the sales process is very much like selling a product.

23
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,890
You publish epic content, funnel people into your list with free resources, provide value, build

24
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:44,010
relationships and then say, hey, if you want to dive deeper, here's a membership where you can get

25
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,360
X, Y and Z.
