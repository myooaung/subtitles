00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.090

Of course, we have to talk about social media now, using social media in your marketing is a lot more



2

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.150

involved than just shouting links all day.



3

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.540

It's important to understand the unique nuances of each platform and to create quality native content.



4

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.750

With that said, social media can be a great distribution channel as well.



5

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.230

Here are a couple of tips to keep in mind when you share your content on channels like Twitter and Facebook.



6

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.140

Any time you mention a person or company in a post, it's a good idea to tag them when you share it



7

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.200

on social media.



8

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.980

They'll get a notification and it's super easy for them to share it or retweeted right then and there.



9

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.520

On a similar note, you can use a service like Buffer to queue up a series of social media updates about



10

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.710

the same post without making it look like you're sharing the same post.



11

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.210

Not everyone will see your posts when you share it the first time, but you also don't want to post



12

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.810

the same headline over and over again.



13

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.840

Instead, try sharing bits and pieces of the post.



14

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:12.310

For example, if you did a round up of 15 experts answering the same question, that gives you 15 excuses



15

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.270

to tweet out the same post, tagging each of the experts and quoting their individual responses, you



16

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.540

can also turn your headline into a question or cite a statistic or share some other little nugget of



17

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.920

information from the post.



18

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.300

A teaser, basically.



19

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.750

Remember earlier we talked about repurposing content.



20

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.820

So if you had done a video interview, you could turn some of the best quotes into tweets, or if you



21

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.360

want to go a step further into graphics and share those on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc., of



22

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.480

course, making sure to tag the person wherever you post it.
