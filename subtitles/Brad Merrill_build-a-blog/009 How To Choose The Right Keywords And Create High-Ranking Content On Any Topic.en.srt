1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,240
From an audio perspective, it's a good idea to have a strategy in mind and know what keywords you want

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,160
a page to rank for before you even start writing content for it.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,050
But how do you decide on a keyword to target?

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,510
How do you know what to type into that focus keyword box?

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,080
Well, you'll have to do some research.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:25,050
If you're writing a blog post, you'll usually want to aim for what's called a long tail keyword, which

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,920
is basically a specific keyword containing multiple words.

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:34,920
If you have a general idea for what you're going for, a great starting point is to go to Google, start

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,920
typing some variation of your potential keyword and look at the suggestions in the drop down menu.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,080
By the way, before you do this, I recommend signing out of your Google account or opening a private

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,050
browser window so the options won't include your search history or tailored suggestions.

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,810
But anyway, all of these suggestions come from real search data.

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,960
So these are actual keywords that people are using to search the web.

14
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,720
A good starting point for this method would be frequently asked questions.

15
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:09,030
Think of the questions that people in your target audience often ask and spin those into the keywords

16
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,800
they may use to do research.

17
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,420
This is another time when Quora and Reddit and niche communities come in handy.

18
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,340
Once you've found some potential keywords you'd like to rank for, the next thing you'll want to do

19
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,220
is determine the search volume for those keywords.

20
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,050
In other words, how many people are searching for them?

21
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,780
Ideally, you'll want something with a relatively high search volume because that means you can get

22
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,810
a lot of traffic by ranking for that keyword to determine search volume, you can use the Google keyword

23
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,400
planner, which you can find pretty easily just by typing keyword planner into Google.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,720
Now, to use this tool, you'll need an active Google AdWords account.

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,830
You don't have to run any campaigns or anything, but you do need an active account.

26
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,460
When you get into the keyword planner, you'll see a few options.

27
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,450
We're going to select the one that says get search volume, data and trends.

28
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,710
When this box pops up, you can enter one or more longtail keywords.

29
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:08,040
Either one per line or separated by commas, for this example, will just enter one keyword and then

30
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,050
click get search volume.

31
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:17,070
What you get is a table of the keywords you entered in the average number of monthly searches for each

32
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,550
keyword.

33
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,170
There are also columns here for competition and a suggested bid.

34
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,700
Those are directed more at advertisers who are considering running ads for this keyword.

35
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,540
They don't really apply to our objectives here, so you can ignore those.

36
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,730
So just take a look at the average monthly searches for each of your potential keywords.

37
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,130
Eliminate the ones with low search volumes and then make a list of the ones that look like they're worth

38
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:41,850
pursuing.

39
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,940
Next, go back to Google, make sure you're either signed out or using a private browser window and

40
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,910
then just run a search for each of the keywords on your list.

41
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,730
Make sure to skip over any ads that appear at the top and then take a look at the first few organic

42
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,720
search results.

43
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,990
Are they the same type of content you intend to create?

44
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,870
Would your page fit well into these results?

45
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,440
You'll also want to assess the quality of the results.

46
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:12,240
Now, of course, this is kind of subjective, but it really comes down to this question.

47
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:18,090
Would any of the search results completely satisfy someone searching for that keyword?

48
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,970
Once you've answered that, you have a couple of options for your next move when there's nothing on

49
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:29,550
page one of the search results that would completely satisfy the readers needs, you have the opportunity

50
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,040
to write the first article of its kind.

51
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,460
So spend some time doing research and putting together a really epic resource that provides exactly

52
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,430
what people are looking for when they search for that term.

53
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,700
The second and more likely scenario is that there's already at least one piece of content that would

54
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,030
satisfy the reader, and that's probably result number one.

55
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,170
The question then becomes, can you create something better?

56
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,140
If the first result isn't absolutely amazing, you can take advantage of that and write the article

57
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:07,260
that people really need by diving deeper and offering more substance than the other top results.

58
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:14,340
And finally, if you're in a situation where all of the top results for your keyword already offer extremely

59
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,250
valuable content, you still have another option.

60
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:22,200
You can create a piece of equally amazing content in a different format.

61
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,840
You see the most competitive search results.

62
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:31,410
Spots are usually won by writers because they can create detailed, long form content that delivers

63
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,240
a ton of value to their readers.

64
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,150
But what about people who don't have an extra fifteen or twenty minutes to read a super long article,

65
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,610
or people who prefer to learn visually?

66
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:48,330
Often what those long form pieces are lacking is a short synopsis that makes it easier to digest.

67
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:55,500
You can offer that by presenting the same information as an info graphic or a checklist or video or

68
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,640
anything else that takes existing information and presents it in a different way.

69
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:05,190
Of course, you'll want to cite your sources and give credit where it's due, but your content may actually

70
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:10,680
be more valuable than the original stuff to a certain segment of people who prefer that alternative

71
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,250
format.

72
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,070
So those are some ideas you can use to choose a target keyword and create a piece of content that's

73
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,380
worthy of ranking for that keyword.
