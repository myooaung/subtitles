If you've been on the Internet at all over the last few years, you know, that list posts or listicle

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,590
are extremely popular and it's not hard to understand why.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,960
They're easy to skim.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:18,420
They're shareable and they don't require a ton of mental energy to digest, which is great for today's

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,700
forever distracted world.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,030
The structure of list content is pretty simple.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:29,520
You start with an introduction and then you have your list items usually divided by subheadings.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,200
And at the end you have a conclusion and hopefully a call to action.

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:40,500
But I advocate a slightly different approach to lists that'll really set you apart from the competition,

10
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:48,240
and that is going really deep into each list item with meticulous detail and explanations, as well

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,700
as rich media like images and videos.

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,870
This gives you an opportunity to serve two distinct audiences, the people who just want to skim and

13
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,730
the people who want more substance.

14
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,570
The skimmers can just browse the subheadings and the first few lines of your explanations and the readers

15
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,630
can get every juicy detail that you have to offer.

16
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,590
It's a win win.

17
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,140
So as an example, if I were writing a list of the 10 best ways to improve your content marketing,

18
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,350
I wouldn't just write a bullet point list and call it a day.

19
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,100
That's the lazy approach and naturally it comes with mediocre results.

20
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,900
Instead, I'd essentially write a mini tutorial for each list item detailing every step for each of

21
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,250
the strategies in the list.

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,780
This is how you set yourself apart by doing what your competitors aren't willing to do.

23
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:45,330
The result is your content will be more detailed and therefore more valuable and therefore more visible

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,700
because people are going to share it, reference it, linked to it, and you get to reap the rewards.

25
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:57,570
And by the way, it's worth mentioning that lists also lend themselves to incredibly catchy and shareable

26
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,230
headlines.

27
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,620
Something about the number in the title just makes it enticing.

28
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:09,330
I'm sure you've seen sites like BuzzFeed and Upworthy having huge success with this as a subcategory

29
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,170
of list content.

30
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:16,200
I think checklists are also worth mentioning here because they're a powerful form of content in their

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,820
own right with a checklist.

32
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:25,230
The goal is to create a list of items, products or actions that are necessary for a particular task

33
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:25,890
or goal.

34
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,250
So you compile everything that people need into a neatly packaged list and you've got a valuable, shareable

35
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,240
piece of content.
