00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.180

OK, so we've covered the kind of standard placements for your opt in forms, but there are also some



2

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.330

heavier approaches you can use to be a little more proactive about asking people to opt in.



3

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.670

For example, one of the best ways to get email sign ups is with what's called a feature box, which



4

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.970

is a big area above the content of your website, usually on the home page that tells people exactly



5

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.460

what your website is about with a strong call to action, encouraging them to sign up for your list.



6

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.250

It's really powerful when someone lands on your homepage because they instantly know what you're all



7

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.950

about and they know exactly what to do next.



8

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.310

If they think you can bring them value for a more minimal approach, you can use a plug in like Hello



9

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.030

Bar to add a dead simple call to action to the very top of your site.



10

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.170

This is great for growing your list or really promoting anything to your audience in an unobtrusive



11

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.310

but effective way.



12

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.060

Next, we have pop ups and I know what you're thinking.



13

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.800

Pop ups are annoying and in many cases I totally agree.



14

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.000

But here's the thing.



15

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.050

They work lightbox pop ups are one of the best ways to convert visitors to subscribers.



16

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.960

If you're going to use pop ups, though, make sure you offer a free resource that's valuable enough



17

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.380

to justify getting up in people's faces.



18

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.640

You have to strike a balance between optimizing your conversion rate and optimizing the user experience.



19

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.650

There are lots of plug ins out there you can use for pop ups, including Opt In Monster Sumi and Thrive



20

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.220

leads.



21

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.140

Exit intent pop ups are pop ups that trigger right when a user moves their mouse to leave the page,



22

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.060

they're less annoying than a traditional pop up because they don't interrupt people while they're browsing



23

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.330

your site and they can help you capture emails from people who would otherwise leave and maybe never



24

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.030

come back.



25

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.900

The key to success here is to offer something relevant and enticing enough for someone who is on their



26

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.190

way out to spend 10 more seconds typing in their email address.



27

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.600

This next one has a different name, depending on who you're talking to.



28

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.390

Some call it a slide up form.



29

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.380

Others call it a fly in form.



30

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.510

But it's basically a little box that slides up from the bottom, usually in the lower right corner of



31

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.050

the page, offering the user something and asking for their email address.



32

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.930

This is much less annoying than a full sized pop up, but it's still pretty effective.
