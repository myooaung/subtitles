00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,430
In this lecture, I want to give you a quick overview of the WordPress dashboard to make sure you understand

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,010
where everything is and how it all works.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:14,880
Once again, you can find your WordPress dashboard at your domain slash WP Dash admin.

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,290
This is going to be super basic, so bear with me if you're a little more advanced, but I just want

5
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:26,540
to make sure you have a good understanding of how WordPress works so we can start to dive deeper as

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,470
we move forward.

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,840
So let's start over here with the main menu.

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,750
You'll be using this menu a lot to navigate between different admin pages in WordPress.

9
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,600
The first thing you should notice is that our current page, the dashboard is highlighted and expanded,

10
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,540
and it has a couple of submenu options underneath it.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,090
The same is true with the rest of the menus here.

12
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,880
Just hover your mouse over each option to expand it.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,180
So after the dashboard, we have posts, which is where you manage your blog posts, media, which is

14
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,790
where you'll find any photos, videos or audio that you've uploaded to the site.

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,870
Pages are a little different from posts.

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:09,870
These are your permanent static pages like you're about page or your contact page comments.

17
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,920
That's where you can manage and moderate the comments people leave on your site.

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,660
Appearance is where you manage your themes and the overall look and feel of your site, plug ins are

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,230
basically extensions that add various functionality to WordPress to make it do exactly what you want

20
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,620
it to do, and you can add and manage plug ins here.

21
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,870
Under users, you can edit your profile and account information, or you can add other users to your

22
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,050
site with the exact editing privileges you want them to have.

23
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,510
In the Tools menu, you'll find things like import and export tools, which allow you to move content

24
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,830
from one state to another.

25
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,410
Settings includes all the global settings for WordPress and your site itself.

26
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,950
And finally, you can actually collapse this entire menu to give yourself a little more work space.

27
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,790
And then just click that little icon to bring it back.

28
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,670
Now, let's take a look at the admin bar at the very top of the page.

29
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,760
We'll just start from the left side and work our way across.

30
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,250
The WordPress logo here is something you'll probably never use, but I guess it doesn't hurt to have

31
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:20,610
it there.

32
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,920
If you click it, it'll give you information about your current version of WordPress and then you can

33
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,250
also go to WordPress.org, read the documentation, visit the support forums or send feedback.

34
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,650
The next item here is just the name of your site.

35
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,100
If you click that, it'll take you to your homepage.

36
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,710
Next, there's a comment button with a little icon to let you know how many comments are waiting for

37
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,400
your approval.

38
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,830
And then we have the new button, which is probably what you'll use more than anything else on the admin

39
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,160
bar.

40
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,110
You can use these options to add a new post, media page or user.

41
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,820
And finally, if we jump all the way over to the right side, it says howdy and then your username.

42
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,020
That's just a quick shortcut to edit your profile or log out.

43
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,970
Now, let's zoom out and take a look at the main dashboard page itself.

44
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,500
When you first create your site, you'll see this box at the top that says, Welcome to WordPress.

45
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,690
We've assembled some links to get you started.

46
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,110
So basically just gives you some easy shortcuts to the essentials.

47
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,520
Pretty useful as you're getting started, but if you want to get rid of it, just click Dismiss and

48
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,390
it disappears.

49
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,380
If you want to bring it back, you can go up to screen options.

50
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,250
And by the way, you'll find this on just about every page inside WordPress.

51
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,770
And check the box next to welcome.

52
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,260
Now, of course, you can also select or select any of these other options to show or hide whatever

53
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:41,800
you want.

54
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,170
And if you want to customize your experience a little more, you can drag and drop each of these dashboard

55
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,260
widgets to whatever location you like.

56
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:57,000
And while we're on the subject, let's talk about these widgets and what they do at a glance tells you

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,520
some quick information about your site, the number of posts, pages and comments, along with the version

58
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:08,160
of WordPress you're running and your theme activity shows you what's happening with your site right

59
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,490
now.

60
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,490
You can see your recently published posts and recent comments.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,620
Quick Draft lets you type in a title and just a little bit of content to save it as a draft.

62
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,740
So if you have a quick idea for a blog post, you can use that to make sure you don't forget.

63
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:26,310
And then you have the WordPress news widget, which is basically just a feed of updates from the official

64
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,390
WordPress blog.

65
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,270
So I guess that's it.

66
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,330
That is the WordPress dashboard, in a nutshell.

67
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,670
Feel free to click around and do some exploring.
