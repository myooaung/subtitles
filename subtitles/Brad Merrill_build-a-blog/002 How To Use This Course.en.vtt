00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.370

There is a lot of information in this course, and I want to make sure you get as much value out of



2

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.420

it as possible.



3

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.790

What I recommend for most students is to first complete the course from start to finish, to give you



4

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.490

a bird's eye view of everything and then return to individual sections later based on where you are



5

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.780

in your own progress.



6

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.300

I've also designed the course to be friendly to people with varying levels of experience so you can



7

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.160

feel free to skip around if something feels a bit redundant to you personally.



8

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.760

For example, if you've already installed WordPress, there's no reason to sit and listen to me talk



9

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.070

about installing WordPress.



10

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.460

That's just a waste of your time.



11

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.980

So please feel free to skip ahead.



12

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.830

Also, before we get started, I just want to thank you for joining me in this course.



13

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.400

I know there are a million other things you could be doing right now, so I really hope to make it worth



14

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.100

your time.



15

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.660

Thanks again and let me know if you have any questions along the way.
