00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.880

WordPress has a really nice theme customizer where you can edit various parts of your site while viewing



2

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.360

a live preview so you can see the effects of your changes in real time to open the customizer, go to



3

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.530

your WordPress dashboard and click customize under the appearance menu.



4

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.610

What you get is this screen a bunch of menus and options on the left and a preview of your site on the



5

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.030

right.



6

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.130

Anything you change on the left should be automatically reflected on the right.



7

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.050

What you can actually do with the customizer depends largely on your individual theme.



8

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.440

There are a few universal options here, but a lot of it is up to the developer of your theme, and



9

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.130

many themes will add a ton of extra customization options.



10

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.720

In this example, we're just using the default theme so there aren't too many options.



11

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.930

You can customize your site identity, which includes your logo, your site title, your tagline and



12

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.980

your site icon.



13

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.220

Here you can customize the primary color.



14

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.560

Next, you can add one or more navigation menus and display them in various locations on your site,



15

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.270

then we have widgets, which are basically little content blocks that you can add to your sidebar or



16

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.250

a footer area or something like that.



17

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.680

Where these actually show up depends on the widget areas offered by your theme.



18

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.790

Most often it'll be a sidebar.



19

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.680

And finally, if you're a little more tech savvy and want to add some additional success to style your



20

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.220

theme differently, you can do that here, by the way.



21

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.920

Make sure you click publish when you're happy with your changes.



22

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.500

Like I said, this is just the default theme and it's a pretty minimal design, so it doesn't have a



23

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.440

lot of options.



24

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.180

Third party themes tend to have a lot more stuff that you can customize.



25

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.780

But I just wanted to make you aware of the customizer.



26

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.350

You'll definitely want to take some time to explore it once you get your own theme installed.
