Right out of the box, WordPress supports two main types of content that you can publish posts and pages.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,840
Now, if we look at the editing screen for a post and then the editing screen for a page, you'll see

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,790
that they are nearly identical.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,260
So it makes sense that this confuses a lot of people as they're getting started.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,930
What is the difference between a post and a page?

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,420
Well, we're going to settle this right now.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,270
So posts are listed either on your homepage or your post page, depending on how your site is set up

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,110
in reverse chronological order.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,680
In other words, the posts appear from newest to oldest.

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,590
So whenever you add a new post, it's going to appear right at the top.

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,710
Posts are also dated and organized with categories and tags, and they'll often have comments.

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,380
Posts are what most people use to publish the central content of their sites, the content they're putting

13
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,550
out on a regular basis, blog posts, news articles, podcasts.

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,190
These are all things you would publish as posts.

15
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,040
Pages, on the other hand, are more static.

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,540
They stay in one place.

17
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,610
They don't show up on your homepage, they don't have categories or tags and they generally don't have

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,330
comments.

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,040
A few examples of pages would be your about page.

20
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,940
If you're running a business site, you may have a company history page or a staff page and then you

21
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,320
may have a contact page.

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,780
All of these are kind of permanent things that aren't time sensitive and that you want to keep in the

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,610
same place for a long time.

24
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,250
So a page is the more appropriate option.
