00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,900
To close out this section, I want to talk about some things you can do to become a better writer overall,

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,120
good writing isn't an ability you're just born with.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,780
It's a skill you have to practice and develop over time.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,200
So the number one thing you can do to improve your writing is to write and write, often write in a

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,430
journal, use different styles, cover different topics, even try your hand at fiction.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,960
What matters is that you're always improving your ability to communicate using the written word if you're

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,380
looking for some quick, actionable ways to improve your writing.

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,910
Here are a few tips.

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,690
First of all, one of the best ways to strengthen your writing is to use the active voice as much as

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:43,170
you can.

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,430
You see in English there are two main voices you can use in your writing the active voice and the passive

12
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:50,930
voice.

13
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,830
The distinction is simple.

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:00,030
Is the subject of the sentence doing the action or is the subject having the action done to them?

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,290
Here's an example.

16
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:09,780
You could say Luis kicked the ball across the field or the ball was kicked across the field by Louis'.

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,970
Which one of these sounds better?

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,950
Probably the first one.

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,210
And that's because it uses the active voice, the subject of the sentence.

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,660
Lewis is doing the action.

21
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,320
Luis kicked the ball.

22
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,710
In the second case, the subject of the sentence, the ball is having an action done to it.

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,540
The ball was kicked.

24
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,630
There are some cases where the passive voice makes sense, but most of the time you're much better off

25
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,370
using the active voice.

26
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:44,820
Next, let's talk about contractions, if you've ever written an academic paper, you've probably been

27
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,980
told not to use contractions.

28
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,870
Words like you're there don't, aren't, isn't and so on.

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,870
While contractions may not be appropriate for an academic setting, blogging tends to be more casual

30
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,040
and conversational.

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,130
Like I said earlier, you're not writing an encyclopedia.

32
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,370
You want to match the style and tone of your audience.

33
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,580
And usually that includes using contractions.

34
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:15,000
On a similar note, you want your content to be approachable, even for people who may not be experts

35
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,110
on your topic.

36
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,210
After all, that's usually why people come to you in the first place, because you're the expert.

37
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,730
So I recommend simplifying your vocabulary and avoiding excessive jargon.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,030
A great litmus test for one's understanding of a topic is whether they can effectively explain it to

39
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,880
a child.

40
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,450
Keep that in mind and always imagine you're writing for an audience that has no experience with your

41
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,020
topic unless you know for sure that your audience has a certain level of knowledge.

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,890
For example, if you write for an audience of physicians.

43
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,790
One of the most important tasks you have to accomplish as a writer is keeping your readers interest.

44
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,050
That's especially true in today's world, where as soon as somebody gets bored, they're clicking onto

45
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,750
something else.

46
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:06,670
One of the best ways to keep people engaged is to make your content easy, to skim short sentences and

47
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,710
short paragraphs, ideally broken up by subheadings and images.

48
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,370
If your post is just one giant wall of text, nobody's going to want to read it.

49
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,240
Try to break your writing up and make it easier to digest.

50
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:27,400
The next thing we need to discuss is one of the most common pitfalls in writing, and that is an overuse

51
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,610
of modifiers like adjectives and adverbs.

52
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:36,310
Adverbs in particular are often unnecessary, and I don't think I can explain it any better than Stephen

53
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,510
King in this great excerpt from his book on writing.

54
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,380
Consider the sentence.

55
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,150
He closed the door firmly.

56
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,390
It's by no means a terrible sentence.

57
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,710
At least it's got an active verb going for it.

58
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,490
But ask yourself if firmly really has to be there.

59
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,850
You can argue that it expresses a degree of difference between he closed the door and he slammed the

60
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,160
door and you'll get no argument from me.

61
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,960
But what about context?

62
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:08,320
What about all the enlightening, not to say emotionally moving prose which came before he closed the

63
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,120
door firmly shittiness.

64
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,210
Tell us how he closed the door and if the foregoing prose does tell us isn't firmly an extra word.

65
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,590
Isn't it redundant?

66
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,780
That's the end of the quote by Stephen King, I always reference that when I talk about overusing adverbs,

67
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,950
the idea here isn't to use zero adverbs just to use them sparingly.

68
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,550
And finally, editing is just as important as writing now, you could hire an editor to look over your

69
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:41,880
work, but I think self editing is a valuable skill that people too often neglect.

70
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,790
After you write your first draft, walk away for a bit, do something else, and then come back when

71
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,840
your mind is fresh.

72
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,760
At this point, you want to start cutting your content down, be merciless here.

73
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,810
You want your writing to be as clear and concise as possible.

74
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,730
So you have to remove the fluff.

75
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:06,150
Keep in mind that every piece of content should have one core idea or solve one main problem.

76
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,120
Anything that doesn't contribute to that should be cut.

77
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,190
And by the way, even if you're great at self editing, it still doesn't hurt to run your content by

78
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,000
somebody else just to get a fresh perspective.

79
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,540
So that's it.

80
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,580
Those are some of the most actionable pointers I can offer you if you want to improve your writing and

81
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,040
create better content.

82
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,700
Like I said, it does take time and effort to develop the skill of good writing.

83
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,050
But those are all things you can start doing to become a more effective writer today.

84
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,820
So I hope you put them into action.
