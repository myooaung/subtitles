00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,950
When you're just getting started, one of the best blog promotion strategies is writing a series of

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,490
guest posts for other, more influential blogs.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,430
It's a time consuming process, but it can give you a huge payoff by launching your blog into the spotlight

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,510
and really putting you on the map.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,510
There's an important caveat, though.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,760
Any guest posts you write have to meet an extremely high standard of quality.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,070
If you write a subpar guest post, it probably won't get published.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,120
But even if it does, remember that this is likely going to be the public's first impression of you.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,540
So make sure you only offer your best work for guest posts as far as actually getting published.

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,700
I wrote an article about this a few years ago.

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,830
I call it The Art of the Pitch.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,100
As an editor, I've gotten tens of thousands of guest post pitches over the years and most of them go

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,150
straight to the trash.

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,270
So which ones do I actually pay attention to?

15
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,550
Well, here's what a perfect pitch looks like to me.

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,070
Simple but descriptive.

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,900
Tell me who you are and why I should care and then give me three specific post ideas to choose from

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,130
with a simple outline or description for each one.

19
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,110
Start with the smaller blogs in your industry and work your way up to the big guys as you get some posts

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:16,790
under your belt.

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:23,080
You can also do other types of strategic collaboration, like making an appearance on a relevant YouTube

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:29,680
channel or podcast, being interviewed as an expert, doing traditional PR things of that nature.

23
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:35,290
The idea is you want to become a familiar face in the media world surrounding your particular industry.

24
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:40,140
This strategy isn't primarily about links or shout outs or anything like that.

25
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,490
Those are great and they'll definitely help you.

26
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,700
But the main purpose here is putting yourself and your brand on the map so that in the future you can

27
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,440
leverage that existing trust.
