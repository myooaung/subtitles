Now, let's talk about meta descriptions, meta descriptions don't appear anywhere on the front end



2

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.500

of your site, but they're used by search engines for the black text that appears under the title of



3

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.280

a search result.



4

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.770

By default, a snippet will be automatically pulled from your page content based on what the user searched



5

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.100

for.



6

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.050

But writing your descriptions yourself gives you the opportunity to increase your click through rate



7

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.050

significantly.



8

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.950

This can be done from the Yoast panel on the Post.



9

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.630

Ed click edit snippet, then enter your description right here.



10

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.040

Make sure it contains the keyword you'd like to rank for at least once and use it as an opportunity



11

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.930

to entice the reader to click through.



12

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.760

Just like with the title field, there's a colored bar underneath that tells you if your description



13

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.170

is too long or too short.



14

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.450

Always try to keep that in the green range.



15

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.260

There's really no good way to automate meta descriptions, and I don't recommend setting any global



16

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.260

meta descriptions since they should pertain to specific pages instead, just take an extra 30 seconds



17

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.880

or so after you finish writing a post or page to give it a relevant description.



18

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.130

I think you'll find it's well worth your time.
