WEBVTT

00:00.320 --> 00:06.170
Hundreds of guys and lock them back in now in the studio Vivah will be working up what customizations.

00:06.210 --> 00:07.740
So this is the best part.

00:07.890 --> 00:14.880
OK so some of the teams gave you the ability to customize your website you can see that here it's Saiz

00:15.050 --> 00:15.940
customize.

00:15.960 --> 00:16.450
OK.

00:16.950 --> 00:21.660
I would have wanted to show you about the team first but I wanted to tell you about the customized right

00:21.690 --> 00:22.580
now because.

00:22.800 --> 00:27.030
So you should just understand this and then we're going to be moving on with the team because team is

00:27.030 --> 00:28.300
so interesting part.

00:28.530 --> 00:34.110
And the customizes not it is a bet but the team is more so let's just go ahead and let's quickly just

00:34.110 --> 00:42.270
work but customize So if you just click here you can see a new window comes here and here I can customize

00:42.270 --> 00:46.850
my website completely so you can see taste and Sillerman and guarantees.

00:46.860 --> 00:48.660
Just another WordPress website.

00:48.810 --> 00:50.960
Here it is the menu here.

00:51.000 --> 00:51.740
Everything.

00:51.760 --> 00:52.570
And here it is.

00:52.590 --> 00:54.960
So where is this pencil appears.

00:54.960 --> 00:58.070
I can customize that like I can customize this image.

00:58.170 --> 00:59.690
I can customize this title.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.070
I can customize this this and this.

01:02.070 --> 01:05.910
So let's quickly just go ahead and overview all of them.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.460
Let's go to site identity.

01:07.500 --> 01:12.300
So here I can add a logo here like if I want to add the logo.

01:12.300 --> 01:14.010
So let's suppose that I want to add a logo.

01:14.010 --> 01:15.480
I want to go to upload files.

01:15.480 --> 01:25.350
I'm going to go to select files and then I am going to go to this stop and then let's just use this

01:25.350 --> 01:26.190
to be the logo.

01:26.360 --> 01:28.470
I said this is the logo that I have.

01:28.650 --> 01:30.290
I'm going to come here and I'm going to select it.

01:30.450 --> 01:30.720
OK.

01:30.720 --> 01:37.180
And then I have to just crop it down and tell us that this is my logo.

01:37.280 --> 01:39.050
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit Kropp.

01:39.070 --> 01:41.570
So now it will appear here.

01:41.690 --> 01:42.280
OK.

01:42.290 --> 01:44.280
And then you can see that logo is appearing.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.830
And then this as well as appearing.

01:45.830 --> 01:48.510
So let's suppose that I want to remove these.

01:48.680 --> 01:52.370
I'm going to go here and I'm going to uncheck this because I just want to show the logo.

01:52.370 --> 01:54.220
So this is the logo that is coming.

01:54.380 --> 01:57.000
And now it has changed the look of that.

01:57.370 --> 02:02.750
But I just want to remove the logo and I want to display the signed title and the tag line is going

02:02.750 --> 02:03.400
to be

02:06.240 --> 02:09.180
a web developer.

02:09.180 --> 02:14.610
OK so now you can see that I have this tag line so I can add any tag line right here.

02:14.720 --> 02:21.540
But you can add it like a web developer or you can add it like the best online company.

02:23.020 --> 02:23.540
OK.

02:23.630 --> 02:24.900
So this is how it works.

02:24.920 --> 02:25.380
OK.

02:25.580 --> 02:32.020
So now here what I'm going to do right now I am just going to go ahead and I'm going to go back.

02:32.450 --> 02:32.830
OK.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.020
And then we have the color.

02:34.040 --> 02:36.820
So in that color you can manage that color scheme.

02:36.990 --> 02:37.460
OK.

02:37.520 --> 02:42.230
Like you can manage it to be like dark if you want it to be dark and you can see that our Website is

02:42.230 --> 02:43.990
now in the dark mode.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.170
I can see how created this looking.

02:46.310 --> 02:46.660
OK.

02:46.820 --> 02:51.040
We have the custom colors so if you need the custom color you can choose it.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.780
And that is coming here as Dillinger's color.

02:53.780 --> 02:58.700
So but I think I just like the dark one or is light one.

02:58.870 --> 02:59.350
Okay.

02:59.390 --> 03:05.550
And then we have the header text color so you can pretty well manage the text color if you want to.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.020
I'm going to make it the white complete white.

03:08.150 --> 03:08.580
OK.

03:08.780 --> 03:10.230
And then we have to go back.

03:10.310 --> 03:11.810
We have the head of media.

03:11.810 --> 03:14.710
So this is also important is this is like that.

03:14.840 --> 03:16.020
This is the media that we have.

03:16.040 --> 03:22.490
If you need any other image you can add it or you can also add the video here as well.

03:22.490 --> 03:24.650
So let's suppose that I want to add a YouTube video.

03:24.710 --> 03:38.900
If I just go to YouTube dotcom and then I want to add the video for web site background video background

03:38.910 --> 03:39.480
loops.

03:39.490 --> 03:40.190
OK.

03:40.840 --> 03:41.500
This is the video.

03:41.500 --> 03:43.740
So let's suppose that this is the video that I want to add.

03:43.870 --> 03:46.480
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to copy the link.

03:46.900 --> 03:47.480
OK.

03:47.740 --> 03:54.000
And OK let's just go ahead let's just come here and let's copy OK.

03:54.210 --> 03:56.020
And I want to come here and I want to pay Stillings.

03:56.210 --> 03:56.790
That's all.

03:56.930 --> 04:01.750
And here you can see that the video will be coming so you can see how this is looking.

04:01.790 --> 04:06.870
This is how the video is coming and it's just looking pretty great.

04:06.890 --> 04:07.730
So what I'm going to do.

04:07.760 --> 04:13.220
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit publish and that's all the video is playing in the background

04:13.220 --> 04:13.820
sound like this.

04:13.820 --> 04:19.500
I can choose any other video like if I want to use and that will be coming as well.

04:19.580 --> 04:24.720
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to remove this because I just want to show a normal picture here.

04:24.740 --> 04:29.390
You can choose any other picture like if you want to you can add a new image and then you can select

04:29.390 --> 04:35.690
it and then you can hit select and crop and then you can crop it the way you want but you don't have

04:35.690 --> 04:40.140
to hit crop image and that will be coming as your image.

04:40.160 --> 04:42.900
So let's see how does it look.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.530
So now I can see how it is looking.

04:46.590 --> 04:46.930
OK.

04:47.070 --> 04:48.820
But I think you like this image mine.

04:48.870 --> 04:52.010
I am little look so funny.

04:52.110 --> 04:55.620
So I can see that we are totally done with this as well.

04:55.800 --> 04:59.070
Let's just go ahead and let's go back and we have the menu right here.

04:59.080 --> 05:04.140
So here you can manage the menu but we don't have to work with that since we already know about the

05:04.440 --> 05:06.930
menu and we can do that in the dashboard.

05:07.080 --> 05:10.150
And then we have the video so you guys already know about divergence.

05:10.200 --> 05:14.820
That is why I don't have to tell you if I just go to blog and you can see these are the Vincit Schrade

05:14.820 --> 05:15.210
here.

05:15.210 --> 05:19.380
I can make any changes and it'll be in the live view.

05:19.560 --> 05:22.630
Then we have the homepage settings so this is also right there.

05:23.010 --> 05:29.070
And then we have the additional CSSA So if you know CSSA you can work with that but I would highly recommend

05:29.070 --> 05:31.310
you if you did not know it.

05:31.410 --> 05:37.010
And that's nothing you can do work with the CSSA you can design you have upside down the CSSA as well

05:37.020 --> 05:39.390
so you don't have to worry about this.

05:39.380 --> 05:43.420
Don't don't worry if you don't know this Jasus OK because this is useless.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.000
OK.

05:44.200 --> 05:44.620
OK.

05:44.630 --> 05:46.180
This is people use it.

05:46.350 --> 05:51.730
OK because sometimes it is so useful but not every time.

05:51.810 --> 05:56.970
OK so I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to publish my web site and that's all I'm done.

05:56.970 --> 06:00.010
And in the next video we will be working up the team.

06:00.030 --> 06:05.040
I'm going to tell you where are the teams and how are they very used useful.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.060
So in the next video will be working up.

06:07.230 --> 06:07.830
Goodbye.
