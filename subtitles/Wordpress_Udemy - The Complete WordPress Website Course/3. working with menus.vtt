I'm going to go ahead I'm going to hit publish and there we go.

02:17.210 --> 02:19.970
You can see that my site you are l should be changed.

02:20.180 --> 02:26.270
I'm going to go back and now here in the menu section I basically want to create a new menu and then

02:26.270 --> 02:28.190
I sign it right here.

02:28.190 --> 02:31.450
So we're not going to go here directly but what I'm going to do.

02:31.460 --> 02:33.070
I'm just going to tell you another matter.

02:33.080 --> 02:33.380
OK.

02:33.380 --> 02:35.960
And that is to just go to iTunes dot com.

02:36.290 --> 02:36.680
OK.

02:36.680 --> 02:42.750
And then we have to go to the dashboard of our website OK and then we have to go to the menu section.

02:42.750 --> 02:44.460
Don't use the customized menu.

02:44.580 --> 02:51.340
Just always try to use this type of thing because here it would give you some more customization.

02:51.510 --> 02:51.850
OK.

02:51.900 --> 02:56.220
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to create a new menu and this menu is going to be menu one.

02:56.220 --> 02:58.760
So this menu name is not going to appear here.

02:58.770 --> 03:00.540
So you can name it anything you want.

03:00.540 --> 03:02.700
You can also name it as your girlfriend name.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.430
So it totally depends upon you.

03:04.590 --> 03:06.850
OK what you're having Do you have it create menu.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.060
And there I am in this.

03:09.060 --> 03:12.200
We have to now basically add new sections right here.

03:12.210 --> 03:15.730
So first of all I want to just go to the custom links.

03:15.870 --> 03:22.530
So here I can add pages I can add boast I can add custom links taken out categories that can add menu

03:22.710 --> 03:24.040
icon settings.

03:24.040 --> 03:28.820
So basically let's go ahead let's create some basis so that we can add them right here.

03:28.870 --> 03:37.460
So I need a page and that should be home page about page contactors privacy policy and something like

03:37.470 --> 03:37.860
that.

03:37.890 --> 03:40.260
So I need a home page first.

03:40.430 --> 03:40.910
OK.

03:41.010 --> 03:42.400
I'm going to go ahead I'm going to hit publish

03:46.050 --> 03:49.680
for the second page I want to add is services

03:52.450 --> 03:53.650
services

03:56.700 --> 03:59.160
OK and for the third page

04:02.150 --> 04:03.170
I want to publish it.

04:05.500 --> 04:13.820
Let's go to adenine again and get to bed should be contact me.

04:13.870 --> 04:19.420
So this is my profile of let's say just basically the first let's say the word creating is about me

04:19.420 --> 04:20.770
is about my profile.

04:20.770 --> 04:23.060
That is why I am creating this contact me.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.610
I'm not etting to contact us.

04:24.610 --> 04:30.760
There is a difference between contact me and contact us so you should also create a page that should

04:30.760 --> 04:32.590
be about me not about us.

04:32.590 --> 04:37.140
So if you have created now I haven't created so I have home services.

04:37.170 --> 04:39.670
Contact me and

04:43.940 --> 04:45.900
terms and conditions not terms.

04:45.950 --> 04:49.760
People see now OK we'll treat it when we want anyone.

04:49.790 --> 04:54.610
So about me section can be added about me.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.090
OK I'm going to go ahead.

04:56.090 --> 05:00.250

05:09.190 --> 05:10.980
to go ahead and hit publish.

05:10.980 --> 05:11.400
There we go.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.580
We're done with our pages.

05:13.590 --> 05:14.460
Now I'm going to go ahead.

05:14.460 --> 05:15.120
I'm going to hit.

05:15.180 --> 05:19.580
I'm going to come here and I'm going to refresh this page basically so that all the pages are loaded.

05:19.710 --> 05:20.100
Here you go.

05:20.100 --> 05:21.630
You can see that the pages are coming.

05:21.720 --> 05:28.030
So I'm going to I need this home page I need services and I also need me.

05:28.190 --> 05:28.670
OK.

05:28.860 --> 05:31.630
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit add too many.

05:31.950 --> 05:32.650
Here you go.

05:32.670 --> 05:39.900
I want to bring this to all pray here in this services should be right here and this navigation label

05:39.900 --> 05:42.120
should be contact instead of contact me.

05:42.120 --> 05:42.630
OK.

05:42.660 --> 05:47.080
And I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit safe.

05:47.340 --> 05:47.830
OK.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.640
And I basically need to display this on to the main area.

05:53.730 --> 05:54.090
OK.

05:54.150 --> 05:57.140
So it should be the main This is called Basically the main area.

05:57.150 --> 05:58.690
This is the top area.

05:58.800 --> 06:03.600
This is the footer and this is the mobile So if you want to show a different menu for mobile I'll show

06:03.600 --> 06:06.650
you later on and we will be doing the mobile optimization so I'm going to go ahead.

06:06.660 --> 06:10.970
I'm going to hit save and come here and let's view our Web site.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.170
So here we go.

06:12.170 --> 06:13.790
You can see that this is how it is working.

06:13.790 --> 06:18.580
We have our home page we have our services and then we have our IT Contact Us page.

06:18.590 --> 06:21.620
We are totally done with our morning section.

06:21.630 --> 06:25.230
We can create some different meaning we can show them right here above.

06:25.230 --> 06:28.620
So if we want to add a new menu I can just come here.

06:28.650 --> 06:30.360
I can hit creating new menu.

06:30.360 --> 06:34.330
I can name it as the top menu.

06:34.530 --> 06:39.810
OK I'm going to go ahead I'm going to hit enter and then here I can add some other things like if I

06:39.810 --> 06:40.590
want to add

06:45.140 --> 06:47.500
the terms and conditions page or something like that.

06:47.510 --> 06:51.230
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to go ahead I'm going to hit this and here I'm going to just

06:51.230 --> 06:57.950
say hash tag and I'm going to link it as links should be Terms and Conditions.

06:57.980 --> 07:03.490
So basically hash tag is used if you don't want to add any page right now but you will add it later.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.170
So that is why we use the hash tag.

07:06.380 --> 07:08.030
And then we need to try to see

07:11.340 --> 07:12.210
post-CPP.

07:12.220 --> 07:12.530
OK.

07:12.660 --> 07:14.280
I'm going to go and I'm going to hit enter.

07:14.700 --> 07:18.390
And so this is how you can create it.

07:18.480 --> 07:22.790
I'm going to assign this to be as the home tool bar and I'm going to hate manual.

07:22.830 --> 07:28.320
So now if I just come here and I refresh this area I see this is the terms and conditions.

07:28.350 --> 07:30.950
And this is the privacy policy that is coming here.

07:30.960 --> 07:36.570
You can add about section rate here about terms and conditions or if you want to add log in register

07:36.570 --> 07:42.750
if you are creating like multa or just to say I show you that how can your clients register on your

07:42.760 --> 07:47.510
website and the general if you want that section to be able to you can and something like that.

07:47.510 --> 07:48.670
OK.

07:48.990 --> 07:54.640
So this is outrage to top many words to this main menu and in the last menu we have is the footers.

07:54.660 --> 07:58.050
If I just signed this to be and saying this to as the footer as well.

07:58.050 --> 08:02.000
And I just come here and I refresh this you're going to see how this is going to look.

08:02.050 --> 08:03.810
You can see that these terms and conditions.

08:03.810 --> 08:04.980
Privacy Policy.

08:05.010 --> 08:09.300
So I think this looks great on here right here.

08:09.300 --> 08:11.950
This is basically is looking amazing.

08:12.120 --> 08:17.810
So I can remove it from the top bar because I don't think so if I need it on the top bar for the tool

08:17.820 --> 08:21.020
bar you can create a new menu OK.

08:21.190 --> 08:26.380
I'm going to change this to be asked for a manual because this is now assigned to me.

08:26.550 --> 08:29.220
OK here we go.

08:29.260 --> 08:31.920
Now we are totally done with the remaining speak.

08:31.970 --> 08:38.620
Now no know how many works how we how we can create a limited menus how we can make everything.

08:38.620 --> 08:43.570
So you guys already know about child identity and you is also now knew about demonios.

08:43.570 --> 08:49.320
So in the next video we'll be moving on with more stuff but more detailed stuff so Stadion guys.

08:49.360 --> 08:50.230
And by.
