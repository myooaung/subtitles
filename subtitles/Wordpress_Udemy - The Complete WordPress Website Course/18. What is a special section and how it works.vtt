00:00.450 --> 00:06.290
What does a guy and what KMAX an hour video we need to add some stuff here and add some stuff here.

00:06.390 --> 00:12.330
But basically what we want to do we want to add one more a column into here and we want to divide this

00:12.330 --> 00:14.000
whole section into more further.

00:14.010 --> 00:15.830
So how we're going to do this.

00:15.960 --> 00:22.710
But the thing that we have to do is that instead of this we have to add a new special section which

00:22.710 --> 00:28.420
is this OK and this would be like this so we have to select the first one.

00:28.540 --> 00:29.000
OK.

00:29.110 --> 00:31.590
You can see this right here.

00:31.600 --> 00:37.990
We have a new row we have insert trolls so we can choose it like this that we want to add the real right

00:37.990 --> 00:39.970
here so you can see how this is.

00:39.970 --> 00:44.030
This is like this we have two columns for a here and then we want to add anything we can add.

00:44.050 --> 00:45.110
It's like this.

00:45.430 --> 00:47.500
OK let me show you everything from scratch.

00:47.500 --> 00:47.900
OK.

00:48.010 --> 00:48.630
Let's get to here.

00:48.670 --> 00:52.350
We want to add two more columns right here.

00:52.390 --> 00:53.730
So how we will do this.

00:53.740 --> 00:54.180
OK.

00:54.280 --> 00:56.260
We have to add a special section.

00:56.290 --> 00:56.760
OK.

00:56.800 --> 01:01.000
And this is the section that here would be the contact form here would be to find a stamp.

01:01.150 --> 01:06.880
And then here would be our details that our office time our e-mail address our phone number our facts

01:07.600 --> 01:09.610
and our address in something like that.

01:09.610 --> 01:10.000
OK.

01:10.150 --> 01:13.730
So we basically need to add the specialty section instead of this.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.180
And just going to click here and you can see this is right here.

01:16.180 --> 01:18.490
So my first section is going to be a full width.

01:18.670 --> 01:19.150
OK.

01:19.210 --> 01:22.240
And this is how I'm going to work don't work on it.

01:22.240 --> 01:22.800
OK.

01:22.900 --> 01:24.490
I'm just going to come here.

01:24.490 --> 01:27.920
I'm just going to bring this whole column right here.

01:28.180 --> 01:30.360
OK let's bring this.

01:30.430 --> 01:33.020
Find us and let's get right here.

01:33.250 --> 01:33.670
OK.

01:33.820 --> 01:38.080
And let's try this divider you're right.

01:38.230 --> 01:39.020
Let me come here.

01:39.070 --> 01:39.990
Let me just select this.

01:40.000 --> 01:40.520
OK.

01:40.630 --> 01:43.900
And I want to bring this divider right here.

01:45.440 --> 01:46.010
OK.

01:46.050 --> 01:48.780
And I want to bring the text right here below.

01:49.380 --> 01:49.870
OK.

01:49.870 --> 01:50.610
Same like this.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.410
I want to add one row here.

01:52.770 --> 01:53.390
OK.

01:53.390 --> 01:59.440
And inside that show I want to add text straight here.

02:00.420 --> 02:00.930
OK.

02:01.050 --> 02:03.730
And let's add that divider right here.

02:04.200 --> 02:08.120
So now here if I just click here again you can see how this is looking.

02:08.220 --> 02:13.250
I'm just going to delete this whole section so that it doesn't look much so it doesn't confuse you.

02:13.320 --> 02:13.770
OK.

02:13.770 --> 02:16.020
You can see that we have find us we have this.

02:16.080 --> 02:20.680
And then here we want to add one more row right below.

02:20.810 --> 02:22.600
OK so that we can work for that.

02:22.620 --> 02:26.230
I'm just going to click here and you can see I need to call them real here.

02:26.280 --> 02:30.740
I just wanted this but I can not edit the normal regular section.

02:30.750 --> 02:31.130
OK.

02:31.140 --> 02:33.360
So this might be so confusing to you right now.

02:33.390 --> 02:35.550
Let me do this again so that you understand it.

02:35.720 --> 02:36.110
OK.

02:36.150 --> 02:41.610
We basically want to add some stuff here but we cannot do this with the regular one.

02:41.610 --> 02:47.040
OK if I just add it then if I had to call them and I want to add one more column right below here I

02:47.180 --> 02:49.830
cannot edit guys I can not add it.

02:49.860 --> 02:54.390
Let me just switch on the grid mode so that it makes it easier for you to understand.

02:54.820 --> 02:56.300
OK here we go.

02:56.400 --> 03:02.670
Now you can see that I if I want to add one more in this regular whole section then I can not add it.

03:02.670 --> 03:05.080
OK I can just add one more.

03:05.310 --> 03:09.950
But I want to add two more rows here into this guy right here.

03:09.990 --> 03:10.800
How will I get it.

03:10.830 --> 03:13.360
I need to add the special rule.

03:13.380 --> 03:15.860
Let me just come here and let me add this.

03:15.870 --> 03:21.090
And you can see that in the special roll we have this that here would be our contact form here would

03:21.090 --> 03:23.400
be our find us heading in everything.

03:23.520 --> 03:29.820
And then here would be some icons that show our e-mail address fax and some stuff said this is how we

03:29.820 --> 03:30.640
want to design it.

03:30.660 --> 03:31.130
OK.

03:31.200 --> 03:40.350
So that is why I added this special section and the first one is the normal one in the other one is

03:40.350 --> 03:41.270
the second one.

03:41.280 --> 03:45.750
So this is how you can see that here would be my final step here would be my contact form and here would

03:45.750 --> 03:50.220
be some of my links so I hope that this would be very easier for you to understand.

03:50.370 --> 03:52.690
Now let me do this so that you can understand it.

03:52.710 --> 03:57.670
Let's come here and we basically want to just let me just remove this.

03:57.830 --> 03:58.180
OK.

03:58.290 --> 04:03.230
And you can see that I want to just come up with this right here so that we can add some self.

04:03.300 --> 04:03.660
OK.

04:03.720 --> 04:08.100
I want to come here I want to just add some blurbed right here.

04:08.100 --> 04:15.850

04:15.850 --> 04:16.630
I'm going to add.

04:16.900 --> 04:21.010
This is going to be phone number phone.

04:21.140 --> 04:21.510
OK.

04:21.680 --> 04:30.740
And I want to go to concentrate here and here should be the phone.

04:30.970 --> 04:34.810
Or let's just remove this phone and only add the phone number.

04:34.810 --> 04:42.530
So I'm going to add plus 9 to 3 7 0 3 5 2 9 7.

04:42.750 --> 04:43.280
OK.

04:43.330 --> 04:44.960
And I want to add the image icon.

04:44.980 --> 04:49.110
So my email icon is going to be this and I want to add a phone right here.

04:54.830 --> 04:55.410
OK.

04:55.790 --> 05:02.000
Now what I want to do I want to go to the design right here and I want to go to the image an icon in

05:02.000 --> 05:06.660
my eye kindred replacement should be left so you can see how this is looking.

05:06.710 --> 05:11.170
I want to come here and I want to change the color of this to match this guy right here.

05:11.660 --> 05:12.290
OK.

05:12.290 --> 05:13.770
This is looking totally cool.

05:14.000 --> 05:21.130
What I'm going to do right now I just want to duplicate it to placate it to be located duplicated triplicated.

05:21.290 --> 05:23.040

05:40.250 --> 05:42.430
We have our phone numbers right here.

05:42.440 --> 05:48.820
And then I wanted to add to call them tray here so now I think it would be so easier for you to understand

05:48.820 --> 05:50.920
that what I am talking about.

05:51.020 --> 05:52.910
I cannot edit this single row.

05:52.910 --> 05:55.850
I cannot divide this row into more further.

05:55.850 --> 05:56.940
This is what I'm talking about.

05:57.050 --> 06:00.770
So we have to add the speciality row that we can add.

06:00.770 --> 06:04.760
OK so let me just come here and let me to lead these sections because we don't need it any more.

06:04.760 --> 06:05.840
