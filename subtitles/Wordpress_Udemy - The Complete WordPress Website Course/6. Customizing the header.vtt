OK.

00:53.450 --> 00:55.830
But we'll be moving on with the.

00:55.910 --> 00:58.160

You can change your look.

01:38.700 --> 01:41.770
I'll show you later on how you can change more log.

01:41.820 --> 01:44.410
So I'm going to be using the minimally normal one.

01:45.020 --> 01:45.630
OK.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.200
And here we go.

01:47.400 --> 01:51.870
Now what I'm going to do I'm just going to move on with the background color so Bactrim color is going

01:51.870 --> 01:52.810
to be blue.

01:52.990 --> 01:54.150

02:10.250 --> 02:12.720
I'm going to go to a default one.

02:12.920 --> 02:13.370
OK.

02:13.580 --> 02:16.710
Let's follow the normal colors so there should be no border.

02:16.880 --> 02:17.160
OK.

02:17.180 --> 02:22.450
I'm going to just increase the color of this so there should be some off the gobbing between it.

02:22.460 --> 02:23.180
OK.

02:23.480 --> 02:26.230
This is now fully blue right here.

02:26.540 --> 02:26.870
OK.

02:26.900 --> 02:29.030
I'm going to go back KHRAIS here.

02:29.030 --> 02:32.110
Go back and let's go to the header section.

02:32.180 --> 02:40.540
And in the letter for general the border bottom color it should be there should be no color.

02:40.910 --> 02:48.480
Let's go back and then we have the head of media so we don't want to add any of the video right here.

02:48.560 --> 02:51.110
There should be no head or image position.

02:51.110 --> 02:53.060
Just go back.

02:53.560 --> 02:53.850
OK.

Then we have the logo so we don't want to add any logo right here OK.

02:58.800 --> 03:03.390
And then we have the manual section right here so you can see that it says select.

03:03.420 --> 03:08.020
So you can what were the top level trub down icon second level drop down icon.

03:08.160 --> 03:11.460
Then we have the positions we can align any where we want.

03:12.060 --> 03:17.520
And then we have the link effect as well underlying from left underline up brackets.

03:17.580 --> 03:21.020
So you can see that we can go with the link effect as well.

03:21.110 --> 03:24.320
If I just print memos here you can see how this is changing.

03:24.360 --> 03:27.660
So you can customize this completely and this is.

03:27.750 --> 03:30.040
This looks seriously amazing.

03:30.150 --> 03:35.540
The small small things and small small effects you have on your side.

03:35.540 --> 03:40.950
Seriously guys it's going to be so amazing and your viewers who are coming to you and say they're going

03:40.950 --> 03:41.690
to love it.

03:41.820 --> 03:44.560
So you can see you can see this effect.

03:44.580 --> 03:46.290
This effect I'm going to love for this effect.

03:46.290 --> 03:46.960
OK.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.740
Then we have Xmarks disbarred.

03:49.970 --> 03:50.220
OK

03:57.350 --> 03:59.960
so one on one I want this to be

04:03.080 --> 04:08.600
what does the backlighting let's just view this as well and then let's see.

04:08.720 --> 04:12.420
This looks cool as well but I want just to underline.

04:12.470 --> 04:13.110
So

04:16.490 --> 04:18.580
Or what does a circular reveal.

04:22.590 --> 04:23.020
No.

04:23.220 --> 04:23.610
OK.

04:23.670 --> 04:26.120
I want this to be underlined from left

04:30.890 --> 04:31.320
OK.

04:31.450 --> 04:32.700
Underline looks cool.

04:32.890 --> 04:33.470
OK.

04:33.580 --> 04:34.730
I'm going to go down.

04:35.200 --> 04:39.430
And then we have the main styling so we can go over the left right batting big soles.

04:39.430 --> 04:40.210
You can change it.

04:40.270 --> 04:42.690
You can see how this is looking.

04:43.090 --> 04:46.790
I'm going to use the default one that is 15 and then I have the link collar.

04:46.810 --> 05:00.540
So my link is going to be white ok and if someone brings this mouse it should turn into block.

05:00.750 --> 05:01.380
Like that.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.880
De-link effect Kular should be turned to black

05:07.240 --> 05:07.840
cool.

05:07.850 --> 05:08.980
Now you can see you.

05:08.990 --> 05:12.450
You should be understanding this very very much.

05:12.470 --> 05:15.760
You should be understanding this because how everything is changing.

05:15.800 --> 05:21.320
The link effect colors changing and everything is changing to black and you can already see that how

05:21.590 --> 05:23.010
amazing this is looking.

05:23.030 --> 05:24.140
OK.

05:24.770 --> 05:28.360
I am going to go to a link color current menu item.

05:28.550 --> 05:32.860
So if any any link is selected then it should be the current menu item.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.300
OK let me just published this right here.

05:35.690 --> 05:36.240
OK.

05:36.350 --> 05:42.100
And if I just come here then the current menu item should be turned to full block.

05:42.230 --> 05:46.110
OK I can see that this is the current menu item that is why it is full black.

05:46.400 --> 05:49.190
You can change it to be like crazy or anything.

05:49.190 --> 05:56.190
Or if you want this to be created can also be turned to Krien.

05:56.230 --> 05:57.760
I think black looks cool

06:02.320 --> 06:02.700
OK.

06:02.750 --> 06:05.340
Now always go down and then we have the dropdown styling.

06:05.420 --> 06:07.020
What is this dropdown styling.

06:07.030 --> 06:08.040
I'm going to show you.

06:08.270 --> 06:08.570
OK.

06:08.570 --> 06:10.110
Let me just publish this.

06:10.220 --> 06:15.050
Let me just go to I deal dot com website

06:19.110 --> 06:26.820
and here I want to go to the dashboard and let's go to the menus right here.

06:27.990 --> 06:34.880
And let's go to the main our main menu one looks like this.

06:34.970 --> 06:35.960
And here we have it.

06:35.990 --> 06:44.900
So under this home I can add a new page and that is going to be about a are in the services.

06:44.950 --> 06:47.090
So if I just save my this menu.

06:47.420 --> 06:47.910
OK.

06:48.130 --> 06:50.820
And then I just go back and view my website

06:54.310 --> 06:59.340
and you can see how this is looking.

06:59.450 --> 07:01.240
OK so this is how it is working.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.130
Now you can change this as well.

07:03.160 --> 07:07.530
So I'm going to go ahead I'm going to refresh this so that we can actually see what you're doing.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.210
OK.

07:18.680 --> 07:20.630
It is taking some time to load.

07:20.990 --> 07:21.470
OK.

07:21.480 --> 07:30.450
And now what I have to do I have to go to my header section right again and I want to go to the menu.

07:30.850 --> 07:36.790
And here we have the dropdown dialing so for the background color it should be blue

07:40.440 --> 07:41.080
de

07:46.400 --> 07:51.170
link color should be white.

07:51.710 --> 07:52.370
And

07:55.000 --> 08:01.810
link color holders should turn to black addling background color should be should remain

08:04.630 --> 08:05.400
should remain low.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.130
Yes.

08:06.300 --> 08:06.830
OK.

08:08.740 --> 08:10.300
So this is how it is where I can you can see

08:13.340 --> 08:19.550
OK this looks cool like color current menu item and link Bactrim current anyway.

08:20.030 --> 08:22.890
So then we have the search icon style.

08:23.120 --> 08:26.360
So search like on sale is coming as a drop down.

08:26.360 --> 08:30.610
So you can change this bill like disable you can disable it and it's going to be removed.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.730
The search if you don't want any search icon.

08:33.920 --> 08:36.290
You can also go with the head every place.

08:36.710 --> 08:37.730
OK how this is going to work.

08:37.730 --> 08:48.740
This is also a trade effect you can see how this is looking so and you can also go with the overlay.

08:48.800 --> 08:55.930
OK so I think I don't need any of the search bar right here because this is a portfolio website so I

08:55.930 --> 08:57.200
didn't think so I need it.

08:59.760 --> 09:00.220
OK.

09:00.460 --> 09:05.170
I'm going to go down on we have dropped down categories so we don't want to work with this right now.

09:05.650 --> 09:06.070

09:34.580 --> 09:37.130
I basically need to go to the header section again.

09:37.130 --> 09:39.170
Let's go to the logo and Hiran.

09:39.320 --> 09:40.910
OK so for a logo.

09:40.970 --> 09:46.740
I think I should be moving on with this to be white and if someone brings this mouse it should turn

09:46.740 --> 09:47.240
to black

09:50.920 --> 10:00.670
or I think it should be black and if someone brings this mouse it should turn to White cool.

10:00.690 --> 10:02.800
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit publish right now.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.990

10:24.100 --> 10:28.350
I can change I can change this tag to store bar I can change anything.

10:28.370 --> 10:33.050
You guys I already know about it if I just go to blog and you can see the blog page is going to be black

10:33.130 --> 10:34.880
