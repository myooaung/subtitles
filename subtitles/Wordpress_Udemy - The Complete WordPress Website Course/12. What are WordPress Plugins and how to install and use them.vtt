00:01.010 --> 00:02.420
What is it guys and welcome come back.

00:02.430 --> 00:05.530
So now in this video we're going to be working up with the plug ins.

00:05.530 --> 00:11.310
OK so what are the plug ins and why are they so useful with wordpress.

00:11.370 --> 00:12.180
Let's get started.

00:12.220 --> 00:16.930
First of all you have to go to the dashboard and then you can see that we have another top that is called

00:17.230 --> 00:17.830
the plugin.

00:17.830 --> 00:24.040
So before going into the plugins I want you to know and know that that what are the plug ins and how

00:24.040 --> 00:28.440
did these four and just like why do we need it.

00:28.610 --> 00:33.020
OK so you must not be seeing any of the plug in it as default install by Word Press I'm going to go

00:33.020 --> 00:37.590
hit I'm going to delete all of the plug ins so that we can just start from right now.

00:37.700 --> 00:38.080
OK.

00:38.210 --> 00:42.040
So now I want to show you the.

00:42.140 --> 00:47.810
I want to tell you a great example of a plugin so plug ins can be called as the apps.

00:47.930 --> 00:48.300
OK.

00:48.300 --> 00:56.090
Like they enhance your website like they are add ons to your side or the extra things that can be added

00:56.090 --> 01:01.350
to your upset she can see that we have designed just a simple basic Web site that's all.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.040
OK we have designed this website.

01:03.080 --> 01:05.240
We have all the necessary pages.

01:05.240 --> 01:08.250
OK we have her blog we have it contact us and everything.

01:08.390 --> 01:08.720
OK.

01:08.840 --> 01:17.630
And now I want to tell you like let's suppose that I want to add something more into my website like

01:17.630 --> 01:22.600
we saw a slide show in our website in different websites like a old web site.

01:22.640 --> 01:23.020
OK.

01:23.120 --> 01:27.950
So let's suppose that I want to add that how will I add that this is the most important thing and the

01:28.020 --> 01:30.770
plugins are the one that do this job.

01:30.800 --> 01:36.080
So there are so many plug ins that you can find on the Wordpress directory and there are also some other

01:36.080 --> 01:37.160
plug ins that are not.

01:37.170 --> 01:43.100
So if I just go ahead and click Add new and you can see that these are the plug ins like we have this

01:43.100 --> 01:49.460
jet back we have this WB super catchy it enhanced the speed of your website like you say it is loading

01:49.460 --> 01:49.880
slow.

01:49.880 --> 01:55.070
If you install it your website will go like amazing and very much faster.

01:55.070 --> 01:58.360
I'm not telling you to install it right now to not install it guys.

01:58.370 --> 01:58.810
OK.

01:58.910 --> 02:04.610
So if you go to the popular tab then we have so many popular plugins like Gumbi can add the contact

02:04.610 --> 02:11.630
form to her Web site like I'm here will be a contact form and the contact page and any of the user can

02:11.630 --> 02:16.320
just go ahead and he can enter his details and it will send me an e-mail.

02:16.520 --> 02:16.980
OK.

02:17.070 --> 02:17.720
Same like this.

02:17.720 --> 02:21.480
We have our back.

02:21.490 --> 02:24.810
That will help us to just enhance the ex-CEO.

02:24.950 --> 02:30.710
We go down and we have the security that will help us to like work with our security.

02:30.710 --> 02:34.000
And there are so many plug ins that we have here.

02:34.120 --> 02:34.510
OK.

02:34.610 --> 02:38.630
So let me give you an example right now and let's just go ahead and go over the top plug in that is

02:38.630 --> 02:40.880
the most popular plug in and this is coming on the top.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.650
I'm going to go it and I'm going to install them and let's just set install and install this and let's

02:45.650 --> 02:46.070
work with it.

02:46.070 --> 02:51.860
Let's see how does it work how does this plug in work and how can we just add a contact form to our

02:51.890 --> 02:52.740
website.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.410
So this plug in is here.

02:55.550 --> 02:59.180
This blue line indicates that this plug in is activated.

02:59.210 --> 02:59.660
OK.

02:59.720 --> 03:02.320
And we have this contact form 7.

03:02.450 --> 03:02.910
OK.

03:02.990 --> 03:07.620
Let's just go ahead and let's just go to the settings here and let's see what is here.

03:07.670 --> 03:08.110
OK.

03:08.120 --> 03:13.540
You can see this is a new tab that has been created because of this plug in.

03:13.540 --> 03:16.870
And here we can manage all the settings here.

03:17.090 --> 03:24.210
So here it's conduct for one that has already been created and it was created one minute ago.

03:24.230 --> 03:30.080
That means that when we install this plug in this contact form was created let's just go ahead and let's

03:30.080 --> 03:31.000
head at it.

03:31.250 --> 03:31.670
OK.

03:31.850 --> 03:38.590
And on just sitting at it you can copy this short cord and paste it into your post or text widget content.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.240
OK.

03:39.260 --> 03:42.160
So this is a form that is already created.

03:42.320 --> 03:42.750
OK.

03:42.890 --> 03:50.990
And if you just go to the meal settings you can see that if someone enters the farm the farm credentials

03:51.230 --> 03:53.980
is going to be sent to this e-mail address.

03:54.110 --> 03:54.560
OK.

03:54.590 --> 03:56.060
So it just indicates that.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.080
Let's just go ahead.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.670
I'm not telling you about this form right now.

03:58.670 --> 04:01.650
I'm just telling you about the plugins that you plug into.

04:01.670 --> 04:05.040
So do not get yourself confused with this because I'm not telling you anything about it.

04:05.090 --> 04:07.980
I'll tell you later on we will move forward with this course.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.030

04:14.230 --> 04:17.210

06:36.900 --> 06:39.460
is available you can update that same like this.

06:39.470 --> 06:42.970
