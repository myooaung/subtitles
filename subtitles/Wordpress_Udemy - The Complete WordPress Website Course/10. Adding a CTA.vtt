00:01.090 --> 00:06.100
What is up guys and Malcolm X An now in this video we're going to be talking about the next section

00:06.160 --> 00:07.850
and that will be a call to action.

00:08.020 --> 00:08.310
OK.

00:08.320 --> 00:13.630
So basically now we are talking about a company we have given about a company name.

00:13.630 --> 00:14.050
OK.

00:14.060 --> 00:19.030
We have told that this is the best company and you can read about us and you can contact us.

00:19.070 --> 00:24.330
And then if a person goes down there we have told him about our services that we offer right now.

00:24.430 --> 00:33.130
And down below we want to give him a sign that we all for free consultation or you can conduct this

00:33.130 --> 00:38.090
for free and get a code for free so we can just add him add that section OK.

00:38.170 --> 00:42.750
I'm just going to go to this camera here that says Adnams section.

00:43.040 --> 00:43.460
OK.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.970
And I'm going to hit regular are full of it.

00:45.970 --> 00:51.370
So it totally depends upon you that you want to go with the regular full with.

00:51.430 --> 00:54.620
I think we should be going up at the regular rate here.

00:54.790 --> 00:55.390
OK.

00:55.420 --> 01:00.460
And then we have this row that how much will we want in anything.

01:01.270 --> 01:03.730
So I'm going to be choosing this one right here.

01:03.960 --> 01:04.350
OK.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.620
And this will be free.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.710
So we want to add a free consultation.

01:08.710 --> 01:09.150
OK.

01:09.220 --> 01:13.890
So here should be request for a free consultation and then here should be the button.

01:13.910 --> 01:16.070
And here should be an image.

01:16.430 --> 01:17.190
OK.

01:17.260 --> 01:20.440
So we need basically two columns for this.

01:20.440 --> 01:21.600
I'm just going to come here.

01:22.030 --> 01:25.150
I'm going to change column structure and I'm going to choose to column.

01:25.150 --> 01:30.740
So here would be the call to action and stuff and here would be the rest of this stuff.

01:30.740 --> 01:33.160
OK.

01:33.230 --> 01:37.510
And behind this one the image I'm going to go to the section setting's right here.

01:37.520 --> 01:42.320
I'm going to go to the back room right here and I'm going to come here to the image and I'm going to

01:42.320 --> 01:42.950
choose an image.

01:42.950 --> 01:45.960
So for this I need to choose a best image.

01:45.960 --> 01:46.820
I'm going to come here.

01:46.850 --> 01:48.270
I'm going to choose an image right here.

01:48.290 --> 01:50.460
Let's just choose.

01:51.460 --> 02:02.890
This image OK let's me let's just come here to splash dot com OK let's search for the image that is

02:02.890 --> 02:04.720
about Dean

02:08.210 --> 02:09.960
team or something like that.

02:10.180 --> 02:10.580
OK.

02:10.630 --> 02:11.750
This looks cool.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.110
Or a handshake.

02:13.110 --> 02:13.500
I think

02:35.280 --> 02:42.420
handshake.

02:42.500 --> 02:46.240
I think this one I like the most for a consolidation I think.

02:46.490 --> 02:48.800
Or we can move on with the handshake for that.

02:48.800 --> 02:53.490
So I think this one this one looks cool.

02:53.600 --> 02:54.300
I'm going to come here.

02:54.320 --> 02:57.040
I'm going to hit download and you can see this is being looted.

02:57.170 --> 03:00.500
So I'm going to just open this up and Photoshop.

03:00.770 --> 03:01.300
OK.

03:01.310 --> 03:04.220
I'm going to bring this right here so I'm going to Pring.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.320
I'm going to just resize it.

03:06.410 --> 03:08.570
So it looks cool.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.160
So here we go.

03:10.370 --> 03:11.100
OK.

03:11.100 --> 03:12.500
I want bring this up.

03:22.700 --> 03:23.200
Coat.

03:23.480 --> 03:23.810
OK.

03:23.900 --> 03:29.860
What I want to do right now I want to just press control all safe and I'm going to save it as to on

03:29.870 --> 03:30.580
the desk top.

03:30.710 --> 03:31.210
OK.

03:31.400 --> 03:37.370
And on this topic and I want to open up a PC and then I want to come here to the P and G and I want

03:37.370 --> 03:38.510
to name it as

03:43.130 --> 03:47.710
Viji request form.

03:48.000 --> 03:48.480
OK.

03:48.630 --> 03:51.590
I'm going to I'm here to save and I'm going to hit OK.

03:51.630 --> 03:52.130
There we go.

03:52.140 --> 03:56.070
I'm going to go to my s.a.a here and I'm going to come here to upload files.

03:56.070 --> 04:00.300
I'm going to select files and I'm going to go with that still pray here and I'm going to just open up

04:00.300 --> 04:00.740
this.

04:00.930 --> 04:06.260
So if you don't resize your image and then you directly try to upload the image from here it will not

04:06.540 --> 04:12.200
look great and it will not be uploaded to make sure that you resize it to one to a dear by 720 pixel.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.810
OK.

04:13.920 --> 04:21.750
So let's wait until it is resized and we can then upload it.

04:21.940 --> 04:22.420
Here we go.

04:22.420 --> 04:23.770
You can see this is right here.

04:23.770 --> 04:27.010
I'm going to upload image and this image should be right here.

04:27.800 --> 04:28.390
Here we go.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.340
I'm going to use.

04:29.390 --> 04:33.260
I'm going to click use the parallax effect and it should be a true parallax.

04:33.290 --> 04:39.990
So I'm going to use the C Ss so you can see that we have these handshake Crais here.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.470
So it looks good.

04:41.550 --> 04:42.350
It looks good on this.

04:42.360 --> 04:46.530
And then I'm going to come here to just carry here and I'm going to choose a color right here so my

04:46.530 --> 04:51.070
color should be a beautiful orange.

04:51.110 --> 04:55.670
We need to go to the Korean right here so I'm going to use the chrÃ©tien and I'm going to bring this

04:55.770 --> 04:57.640
the Creator into above for a here.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.420
I'm going to choose a color here.

05:02.950 --> 05:05.030
OK we are choosing the parallax effect.

05:05.030 --> 05:06.480
That is why we cannot add it.

05:06.650 --> 05:09.200
So I'm going to come here I'm going to choose this guy right here.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.250
I'm going insolated.

05:10.430 --> 05:13.190
I want to go to the Creedon effect and I'm going to choose

05:18.290 --> 05:19.830
plays creating and above the.

05:19.910 --> 05:25.260
I'm going to decrease it a bit.

05:25.290 --> 05:30.690
OK so I want to just go with the black and gold.

05:32.150 --> 05:37.670
Hey we basically want to focus on that or you can just go with the full black if you want to.

05:37.890 --> 05:40.580
So full black also looks good I think.

05:41.170 --> 05:41.860
Yes.

05:41.860 --> 05:42.290
OK.

05:51.190 --> 05:57.580
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to go with the design right here and here I think we're totally

05:57.580 --> 05:58.300
done with this.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.010
I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit OK.

06:00.480 --> 06:00.890
OK.

06:00.910 --> 06:07.450
And here what I wanted to do I want to just come up and I want to add a call to action button here that

06:07.450 --> 06:09.650
says request a free consultation.

06:09.820 --> 06:11.430
And then here would be an image.

06:11.560 --> 06:19.660
So I'm going to go to the big Zubayda calm to get the PNB image because we need a GMH.

06:19.780 --> 06:26.410
So I going to go to transparent and I'm going to search for consultation so consultation

06:29.190 --> 06:30.570
cray and

06:43.080 --> 06:50.310
so I think we can go with this one but I need that that that matches my color thing so that matches

06:50.310 --> 06:51.120
my sight color.

06:51.150 --> 06:56.790
So let's get him here ask me to do a consultation consult a rich

07:01.600 --> 07:03.050
let's go with this one OK.

07:03.430 --> 07:05.560
I'm going to come here to free download lets him here.

07:05.590 --> 07:07.390
I said download and there we go.

07:07.390 --> 07:08.230
This is right here.

07:08.350 --> 07:13.210
I want to come here come here and I want to just click this guy right here and I won't use the image

07:13.240 --> 07:15.110
so I'm choosing this image.

07:15.130 --> 07:19.660
I want the image to be uploaded Ray here so when I drag and drop a tray here

07:22.330 --> 07:25.190
and top it fray here and here it should be uploaded.

07:25.240 --> 07:27.000
So I'm going to hit upload image.

07:27.010 --> 07:31.120
And here is the image I'm going to go to the design right here and I'm going to go to the sizing so

07:31.120 --> 07:34.220
I'm going to use it to be a bit low.

07:35.350 --> 07:35.920
Cool.

07:36.110 --> 07:37.790
I'm going to make it to the center.

07:37.890 --> 07:42.020
OK I can also align it to the left so iting aligning it to the left looks good.

07:42.260 --> 07:46.120
I'm going to come here right here right now and I need

07:49.120 --> 07:49.840
a blurb.

07:50.010 --> 07:50.480
OK.

07:50.590 --> 07:57.960
On blurb on just bringing the blurb you can see I can get a title so the title would be Rick vest.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.710
Free consultation.

08:06.930 --> 08:07.340
Cool.

08:07.510 --> 08:08.820
OK.

08:09.250 --> 08:09.810
What I'm going to do.

08:09.820 --> 08:11.400
I'm just going to go with the design right here.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.310
I'm going to use that type sticks to be the light

08:17.070 --> 08:21.090
way when I go to the tile decks I'm going to increase it.

08:21.090 --> 08:23.300
Request a free consultation.

08:23.410 --> 08:23.890

08:24.040 --> 08:28.220
OK what I wanted to do right now I want to go to the I want to just hit OK.

08:28.440 --> 08:32.810
I want to just configure this whole row and I want to make it full because we are adding.

08:32.870 --> 08:36.660
For free Kingley the full That sections are going to go to the alignment sizing and I'm going to make

08:36.660 --> 08:37.490
it full with.

08:37.530 --> 08:40.840
And the custom that Irbid would be no good.

08:40.860 --> 08:43.590
It is not the custom it the custom

08:46.730 --> 08:49.530
custom red would be no.

08:49.610 --> 08:51.070
So you can see that now.

08:51.140 --> 08:53.450
This is totally relying on this.

08:53.450 --> 08:58.080
I'm just going to use to see it because we need to custom it

09:03.320 --> 09:03.830
OK.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.310
You can see this looks pretty cool.

09:05.320 --> 09:08.860
I'm going to come here and I'm going to resize it because I want to make it a bit much shorter right

09:08.890 --> 09:09.300
now.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.170
So I'm going to go to the sizing right here.

09:11.190 --> 09:13.890
I'm going to choose it to be this much.

09:13.990 --> 09:14.340
OK.

09:14.440 --> 09:15.900
So I need this to center.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.440
So this looks cool.

09:17.770 --> 09:18.250
OK.

09:18.250 --> 09:24.910
I want to change the color this color to be the black or the orange one.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.330
So I'm going to go to this carry here.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.890
Let's just double click it.

09:29.630 --> 09:30.170

10:00.420 --> 10:02.890
And now what I want I want a divider here.

10:02.940 --> 10:09.500
So a divider basically adds basically enhance your website.

10:09.550 --> 10:15.290
OK so I really recommend adding dividers to beneath every heading.

10:15.330 --> 10:19.020
So I'm just going to come here and I'm going to search divider and here it is.

10:19.170 --> 10:21.270
I'm going to come here and I'm going to show a divider.

10:21.360 --> 10:28.490
I'm going to go to that design the color so my color is going to be the orange and I want it to be go

10:28.520 --> 10:29.900
to this content.

10:29.910 --> 10:33.550
The visibility the design the style.

10:33.660 --> 10:37.050
So now let's go to the sizing so I wanted to it to be two pixel

10:40.210 --> 10:44.860
0 3 3 3 3 looks cool and I'm going to make it like this.

10:46.660 --> 10:47.110
Cool.

10:47.260 --> 10:55.050
I want it to be center and center left align so on aligning this to left it is not looking big cool.

10:55.390 --> 10:55.890
OK.

10:56.020 --> 11:00.580
What I wanted to do I want to just come here I want to go to the design of this and the text should

11:00.580 --> 11:01.980
be aligned to left.

11:02.080 --> 11:05.110
So this is already aligned to lift.

11:05.180 --> 11:06.190
Ok cool.

11:06.220 --> 11:09.020
I want to make the edits right here.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.830
Let's just double click it.

11:12.990 --> 11:15.600

11:15.730 --> 11:16.630
So the margin.

11:16.740 --> 11:20.310
So I'm going to go to the design and I'm going to go to the spacing right here.

11:20.520 --> 11:23.940
And here we need to just take it from this side to this.

11:24.010 --> 11:26.850
We need some margin from the right side.

11:26.940 --> 11:27.180
OK.

11:27.180 --> 11:27.930
This is that right.

11:28.000 --> 11:28.520
OK.

11:28.530 --> 11:33.750
We need to margin 25 pixel.

11:33.810 --> 11:34.920
Why is it not working.

11:37.820 --> 11:38.770
This is the right tape.

11:38.900 --> 11:39.240
OK.

11:39.350 --> 11:40.520
We need to give some left.

11:40.520 --> 11:44.850
So I wanted to use some.

11:44.930 --> 11:51.440
