00:00.210 --> 00:04.040
What is it guys and what KMAX an now in this film you will be working up this home page OK I'm going

00:04.040 --> 00:11.130
to design exactly this home page but that will be under my control since I can not edit this home page

00:11.400 --> 00:13.740
but I want to make a home page that I can edit.

00:13.740 --> 00:14.270
Come on.

00:14.280 --> 00:14.730
OK.

00:14.820 --> 00:15.940
What I'm going to do right now.

00:16.080 --> 00:20.370
So first of all what we have to do is that we need to go to the all pages right now and I just need

00:20.370 --> 00:24.000
to keep this page open as a reference for myself.

00:24.000 --> 00:24.400
OK.

00:24.570 --> 00:26.070
So I'm just going to go to home right here.

00:26.070 --> 00:27.840
I'm just going to look at it.

00:27.960 --> 00:28.350
OK.

00:28.350 --> 00:33.270
And then here I am just going to click the template and that will be full of it.

00:33.360 --> 00:33.830
That's all.

00:33.870 --> 00:39.080
OK let's just update and let's just open this page up.

00:39.120 --> 00:39.620
OK.

00:39.690 --> 00:44.190
So let's just bring this right here so you can see this is our home page right now and this is our home

00:44.190 --> 00:45.270
page right now.

00:45.720 --> 00:46.020
OK.

00:46.020 --> 00:48.030
And now here we'll be working up.

00:48.070 --> 00:54.240
So let's just go ahead and let's come here first what we need is that we need to come here to screen

00:54.240 --> 01:00.200
options to see how much things that we can get to we can go to the cones and two columns and everything.

01:00.210 --> 01:07.910
OK let's just come here first thing what I want to do right now is that I want to show the show by category.

01:07.930 --> 01:10.300
So I'm just going to come here and it's going to click here.

01:10.300 --> 01:12.130
And now here I want to add a heading.

01:12.210 --> 01:18.960
So that will be sharp by category OK.

01:19.150 --> 01:22.290
I want to align this to center the way this is here.

01:22.360 --> 01:23.300
I want to go down.

01:23.500 --> 01:27.810
And now here I want to show the product so I'm just going to come here.

01:27.820 --> 01:30.000
I'm just going to go to the products right here.

01:30.310 --> 01:30.730
OK.

01:30.730 --> 01:31.990
And sorry.

01:31.990 --> 01:33.030
The product category.

01:33.040 --> 01:38.600
So I just want to show you the category that I want.

01:38.950 --> 01:41.990
So let's come here and let's come here.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.530
And I don't want to show all the categories.

01:44.530 --> 01:46.410
I just want to show these two categories.

01:46.420 --> 01:47.080
OK.

01:47.170 --> 01:48.070
I'm just going to come here.

01:48.070 --> 01:49.030
I'm going to click here.

01:49.090 --> 01:56.080
And now I want to add this so you can see this is right here and now here I want to come here and I

01:56.080 --> 02:03.700
want to use the ID so you can see that you can just work with the product on the 80s base.

02:03.700 --> 02:04.350
OK.

02:04.360 --> 02:08.200
So if it if I just go down go down.

02:08.200 --> 02:09.880
And then you can see that this is how it's going to work.

02:09.880 --> 02:13.750
So if you you can see full display a specified product category.

02:13.780 --> 02:14.170
Sorry.

02:14.380 --> 02:14.770
Yes.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.960
A display a specified product category.

02:17.020 --> 02:18.460
So I'm going to come here.

02:18.460 --> 02:20.790
I'm just going to go to this one right here.

02:20.830 --> 02:24.860
Let's go to the product categories page.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.110
Let's open this page up.

02:26.350 --> 02:29.310
OK so this might be so confusing to you but you will understand it.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.020
OK.

02:37.620 --> 02:43.110
So now here I want to show the T-shirts first so I wanted to grab the idea of this T-shirt.

02:43.170 --> 02:43.570
OK.

02:43.590 --> 02:44.510
How I'm going to do this.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.410
I'm just going to come here.

02:45.420 --> 02:52.560
I'm just going to open this up and you can see that it is a product category and tag ID is equal to

02:52.560 --> 02:53.520
17.

02:53.700 --> 02:54.140
OK.

02:54.330 --> 02:55.190
I'm just going to come here.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.890
I'm just going to add it like ID is equal to 17.

02:59.070 --> 02:59.910
OK let's add this

03:03.950 --> 03:08.100
on to this debate and let's have a look at her page.

03:08.110 --> 03:11.000
So this is working or we have made a mistake.

03:12.550 --> 03:15.670
Show by category is totally up and running but this page is not coming.

03:15.670 --> 03:22.600
So we cannot add it like this so I'm for product category.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.080
We have to go down.

03:25.110 --> 03:31.230
OK so I did a change basically what I did is that I add product categories and then I add IDs.

03:31.230 --> 03:31.690
OK.

03:31.860 --> 03:32.900
So this is how it's work.

03:32.900 --> 03:34.640
So you just make it plural.

03:34.650 --> 03:37.650
So you have to make it plural in order for this to work.

03:37.730 --> 03:40.360
OK and now we want to add the accessories here.

03:40.620 --> 03:41.020
OK.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.880
So I want to add the reason this I.D. is 15.

03:43.920 --> 03:47.630
I want to add a comma here and this will be 15.

03:47.640 --> 03:51.830
I need one more comma and this will be the Hoodie's itself.

03:54.770 --> 03:55.500
This is 16.

03:55.550 --> 03:56.050
OK.

03:56.150 --> 03:58.250
Let's come here and let's add 16.

03:58.430 --> 04:07.230
OK let's just update trade now and let's have a look at our Web site so you can see these two or right

04:07.230 --> 04:09.570
coming here or the other one is not coming.

04:09.570 --> 04:14.280
And the reason is that we haven't added any of the product in the series.

04:14.310 --> 04:20.460
If we add any product in the history and this count is one then this category will appear otherwise

04:20.520 --> 04:21.700
it will not appear.

04:21.730 --> 04:24.040
OK so you can see this is totally done.

04:24.210 --> 04:24.480
OK.

04:24.480 --> 04:31.120
I want to add only I want to show only three column or two column c o u m and s.

04:31.150 --> 04:31.780
OK.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.530
And this will be said to do.

04:33.540 --> 04:39.240
OK so now it will show only two of the column and it will be said to do so if I just come here and I

04:39.240 --> 04:40.240
refresh this.

04:40.390 --> 04:41.710
You'll see this will be bigger.

04:41.760 --> 04:45.220
And we have two categories only up and running.

04:45.470 --> 04:45.760
OK.

04:45.780 --> 04:48.650
Now we have the next section and that is new in.

04:48.720 --> 04:49.280
OK.

04:49.350 --> 04:54.120
So this will show the recent products basically I'm just going to come here I'm going to hit this I'm

04:54.120 --> 04:56.760
going to come here and I'm going to enter here.

04:56.850 --> 04:59.600
Let's add one more space and let's add a heading.

04:59.700 --> 05:03.920
So I'm on a heading and this will be new in.

05:04.070 --> 05:04.660
OK.

05:04.890 --> 05:11.010
I want to bring this to center and I want to show the new products that are recently added.

05:11.040 --> 05:11.990
I'm going to come here.

05:12.270 --> 05:20.280
I'm just going to come here and I want to show the product the Order By would be date and the order

05:20.280 --> 05:21.380
would be descending.

05:21.380 --> 05:22.140
So that is what.

05:22.140 --> 05:24.560
So that then it will show the reason for it.

05:24.570 --> 05:29.020
So let's come here come here and we need to add the product.

05:29.130 --> 05:29.730
OK.

05:29.820 --> 05:30.390
So

05:33.620 --> 05:35.600
I'm going to go to the short Gord's right here.

05:35.720 --> 05:41.870
I want to show the products and when I come here I'm going to come here I'm going to come here and I'm

05:41.870 --> 05:42.770
going to paste it.

05:43.040 --> 05:43.790
OK.

05:43.790 --> 05:51.220
So what I want to do show right now this will be the order by would be equal do.

05:51.420 --> 05:54.260
And the order would be is equal to do.

05:54.930 --> 05:58.210
So let's just come here and want to.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.260
OK let's just close the steps.

06:04.040 --> 06:04.470
OK.

06:04.690 --> 06:05.710
We want to show

06:08.480 --> 06:12.430
the order by would be the date.

06:12.750 --> 06:13.330
OK.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.920
So I'm going to come here I'm going to hit.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.330
Order by Otterbein would be set to date.

06:19.650 --> 06:20.120
OK.

06:20.330 --> 06:22.940
And the order would be descending.

06:22.940 --> 06:26.270
So let's come here and let's see this is the d se

06:29.050 --> 06:30.750
d e c.

06:30.910 --> 06:34.790
Ok so now you can see that if I just come here and I just said update.

06:35.130 --> 06:35.620
OK.

06:37.630 --> 06:39.340
So you can see this is done right here.

06:39.350 --> 06:43.180
What I'm going to do right now I'm just going to come here and I'm going to refresh my page to see if

06:43.180 --> 06:44.230
this is running or not.

06:44.350 --> 06:47.870
OK this is running OK.

06:48.010 --> 06:50.680
This is showing all the recent products.

06:50.680 --> 06:55.260
If I just come here you can see we just want to stop it till 4.

06:55.380 --> 06:59.480
OK but this is not stopping it on four sections so I'm just going to come here.

06:59.490 --> 07:00.510
I'm going to hit limit.

07:00.510 --> 07:01.080
OK.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.350
Just add the limit.

07:03.380 --> 07:05.460
Let's just check if the limit is fine.

07:05.480 --> 07:08.480
OK yes the limit is this.

07:08.480 --> 07:11.510
So I'm going to come here I'm going to hit this and I'm going to add a limit.

07:11.510 --> 07:22.710
So limit is going to be for OK let's sit update and let's just come here let's just refresh this Andheri

07:22.780 --> 07:25.760
you go you can see the limit is now four.

07:25.840 --> 07:29.700
If I want to add five call them here I can also add the column here.

07:29.710 --> 07:32.120
So I can just add it like columns.

07:32.320 --> 07:32.750
OK.

07:32.890 --> 07:35.090
And then I want to add the column to be five.

07:35.140 --> 07:41.060
And I won the limit to be five so that it should show 5 products in one single line.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.160
OK let's get him here.

07:42.220 --> 07:44.350
Let's refresh this.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.440
And here we go.

07:45.550 --> 07:52.660
This is like this so you can see that we can do the customization Dowd even buying the pro version guys.

07:52.660 --> 07:53.250
OK.

07:53.260 --> 07:54.510
So the approach is invalid.

07:54.510 --> 07:59.520
You do this in the Customize section but we can do the Customize without even touching that.

07:59.640 --> 08:03.180
OK so now we have let's come here and we have on sale products.

08:03.190 --> 08:04.680
We want to come here to the Schardt gorge.

08:04.690 --> 08:05.290
OK.

08:05.410 --> 08:13.760
And now we have two show the on seal products so the seal products would be seal products.

08:13.780 --> 08:15.660
OK let's come here let's copy this.

08:15.660 --> 08:19.290
Let's come here and let's add a gapping.

08:19.380 --> 08:19.900
OK.

08:19.980 --> 08:22.290
I want to add a heading.

08:22.410 --> 08:24.950
This will be on sale.

08:25.140 --> 08:25.990
OK.

08:26.070 --> 08:28.380
One two on the center.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.990
Let's go down to this.

08:31.210 --> 08:37.610
Well it's just out of date and it's going to show all the sale products that we have.

08:38.100 --> 08:38.920
So here we go.

08:39.180 --> 08:44.740
But I want to limit this to force so that it doesn't show all the seal products.

08:44.740 --> 08:45.320
OK.

08:45.420 --> 08:51.270
I want to limit this to four so that it should show only four products so if we add in future more sale

08:51.330 --> 08:54.410
products then it will not go beyond that.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.490
OK so people just limit the four products.

08:56.520 --> 08:57.110
OK.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.770
This is exactly same.

08:58.770 --> 09:03.000
Now here we on the best seller so best sellers mean like popular.

09:03.180 --> 09:07.180
So you can show the best selling products like the popular products will be coming here.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.240
So I'm just going to come here.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.550
I'm going to add this.

09:09.590 --> 09:10.020
OK.

09:10.110 --> 09:11.150
And now I'm going to come here.

09:11.190 --> 09:11.510
OK.

09:11.640 --> 09:17.370
We have a different cord for recent products but you can just ordered by date and then you can just

09:17.370 --> 09:18.470
ordered by descending.

09:18.470 --> 09:23.400
So it really depends on how you want to order it and you can also show the best selling products by

09:23.400 --> 09:25.850
the order by the popularity the number of.

09:25.860 --> 09:26.550
But it teases.

09:26.560 --> 09:32.100
So it can also show the best selling products by the order by the number of personnel popularity so

09:32.100 --> 09:34.470
you can just come here to the products OK.

09:34.620 --> 09:36.090
You have to just come here to the Utterback.

09:36.090 --> 09:40.370
And then you have to select the popularity and then you have to select the order to be the ascending

09:40.380 --> 09:42.000
so it will be default ascending.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.280
So let's just either you can come and copy this or either or you can just use this one but I will be

09:47.280 --> 09:52.320
going up with this one so that it is understandable to you guys and we have more customization so I'm

09:52.320 --> 09:53.230
going to come here.

09:53.310 --> 10:02.030
I am going to add one more score down and even to add the best sellers so I'm going to come here.

10:02.410 --> 10:04.270
I'm going to add the heading

10:07.120 --> 10:08.610
OK and this will be a line to center.

10:08.770 --> 10:11.770
So I'm going to add best sellers.

10:11.860 --> 10:12.490
OK.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.830
And now below I want to add this products.

10:14.830 --> 10:15.370
OK.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.930
And the order by

10:21.130 --> 10:25.540
what is equal to the popularity.

10:25.680 --> 10:28.990
So popularity means the number of users.

10:29.010 --> 10:30.320
Ok so I'm going to come here.

10:30.330 --> 10:34.140
I'm going to hit popularity OK.

10:34.550 --> 10:35.980
And now here's the order.

10:35.990 --> 10:42.080
Order would be ascending because it should show like the most number of products that has the seal on

10:42.080 --> 10:47.780
top so I'm going to use A.S.C. But as is default the EFC so you don't have to mention it here but I

10:47.780 --> 10:50.140
am just showing it to that it should show the best seller.

10:50.210 --> 10:51.040
OK.

10:51.320 --> 10:55.580
So you can also Shwed like non-HD best seller and then you can choose the DSC.

10:55.580 --> 10:59.870
So let's get him here and let's refresh this and you will see that the best selling products will be

10:59.870 --> 11:00.680
coming here.

11:00.830 --> 11:01.210
OK.

11:01.340 --> 11:03.040
So we have to limit this to four.

11:03.440 --> 11:07.590
So I'm going to go I'm here I am going to hit this and I'm going to hit a limit.

11:07.630 --> 11:10.050
He goes to and let's at four.

11:10.460 --> 11:16.580
So let's set up date and you can see that we should be matching this best seller and everything should

11:16.580 --> 11:23.310
be totally same vidis so he can see best selling is this and this is also exactly the same.

11:23.320 --> 11:24.630
So this is our big.

11:24.760 --> 11:30.920
You have now designed this home page exactly the same as this one.

11:31.600 --> 11:36.810
And you did not even mark that provers.

11:36.850 --> 11:37.130
OK.

11:37.160 --> 11:42.200
You can also add more things you can also add a product attribute you can also add top rated products.

11:42.220 --> 11:42.880
OK.

11:42.880 --> 11:46.020
If I just add one more of then you can also add a top rated price.

11:46.020 --> 11:48.670
So I'm just going to come here and I want to add.

11:48.670 --> 11:53.440
But since we don't have any of the top rated products that is why we cannot not added then we will be

11:53.440 --> 11:54.760
very king of the reviews.

11:54.760 --> 11:57.600
Then after the reviews you can get that.

11:57.850 --> 12:03.760
OK so let's just add this one into Sellersville so that they should come here in the on field product

12:03.760 --> 12:04.850
and this should fill.

12:04.870 --> 12:07.690
So I'm going to come here I'm going to hit a product.

12:07.700 --> 12:08.090
OK.

12:08.170 --> 12:09.250

12:09.280 --> 12:12.510
I'm going to go down and I want to be seal on 15 bucks.

12:12.550 --> 12:13.230
OK.

12:13.510 --> 12:18.760
Let's come here and let's say if it seems like this I want one more product to be added on to seal products

12:18.760 --> 12:20.620
so that will be

12:24.340 --> 12:29.280
this one quick edit and here the sale price is going to be 50.

12:29.780 --> 12:33.990
