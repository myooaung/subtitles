WEBVTT

00:00.370 --> 00:05.210
Hear what is a guy I want KMAX and now you can see that we're totally done with the forums section.

00:05.230 --> 00:05.860
OK.

00:05.860 --> 00:10.300
We have now got the basic understanding of how forum works and how everything works.

00:10.330 --> 00:11.010
OK.

00:11.020 --> 00:15.410
So in this one you will be working up on wed the social networking Web site.

00:15.550 --> 00:16.030
OK.

00:16.030 --> 00:20.620
So I'm going to show you how the social networking sites work how people can interact with each other

00:20.660 --> 00:26.290
how these people can just send notifications to each other and you can see how this not to forget or

00:26.500 --> 00:27.840
not notifications.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.410
But the friend requests if I just open up this you can see the sky back he has mentioned me in a common

00:33.430 --> 00:34.740
that says thank you so much.

00:34.760 --> 00:35.890
NZL and I'm just going to go ahead.

00:35.890 --> 00:36.610
I'm going to favorite.

00:36.610 --> 00:37.120
OK.

00:37.220 --> 00:43.690
So if I just want to send a friend request this how can I send it if I wanted to send a public message

00:43.810 --> 00:47.010
not a private message if I want to send a private message to him.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.790
How can I send a private message.

00:49.000 --> 00:49.440
OK.

00:49.540 --> 00:52.380
So I have to make sure that I can do that.

00:52.450 --> 00:53.640
And I want to do that.

00:53.640 --> 00:58.210
So we have to basically work with our site settings and then we can do that.

00:58.210 --> 00:58.640
OK.

00:58.720 --> 00:59.350
So let's get started.

00:59.350 --> 01:03.820
First of all what we have to do is that we need to go to the dashboard let's open this up in a new job

01:04.080 --> 01:09.400
to just a word for that and also see the changes here that we are making.

01:10.220 --> 01:17.390
So you can see this is where my profile right now if I just go to a profile you can see I have just

01:17.410 --> 01:17.990
my name.

01:18.090 --> 01:18.450
OK.

01:18.460 --> 01:19.780
I can change it.

01:19.810 --> 01:20.980
I can change my name.

01:20.980 --> 01:23.030
I can change my profile photo as well.

01:23.270 --> 01:26.720
OK I can change his disguise profile photo OK.

01:26.850 --> 01:28.410
I have a supply with it.

01:28.420 --> 01:31.360
And then that photo will be uploaded so I'm just going to go to

01:36.130 --> 01:36.910
this right here.

01:37.030 --> 01:37.390
OK.

01:37.540 --> 01:39.300
So this is being uploaded right now.

01:39.310 --> 01:40.210
And you can see that.

01:40.210 --> 01:43.180
Now I have to crop this image so I'm just going to go ahead.

01:43.180 --> 01:53.370
I'm just going to crop this image OK and I'm going to add cropping mange so he can see this I mean just

01:53.370 --> 01:54.240
right here.

01:54.240 --> 01:54.850
TALKBACK.

01:54.870 --> 01:55.330
OK.

01:55.350 --> 01:57.390
So I have this cover right here.

01:57.390 --> 02:02.390
I can also change the cover image and I can see this is exactly like Facebook.

02:02.550 --> 02:03.960
This is the Facebook style.

02:04.050 --> 02:09.600
Or you can say basically it's a Twitter style so I can just also add a cover photo as well so you can

02:09.600 --> 02:11.100
see this is being uploaded.

02:11.130 --> 02:15.480
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit upload right now and this will be here so we can see

02:15.480 --> 02:18.080
your new cover image was successfully uploaded.

02:18.270 --> 02:19.190
And this is right here.

02:19.290 --> 02:24.980
So you can see if I just go to activity right now and then here would be like and and determined changed

02:25.290 --> 02:26.390
their profile picture.

02:26.390 --> 02:27.670
A few seconds ago.

02:27.810 --> 02:31.050
So anyone can see it than they would they can just favorite it.

02:31.050 --> 02:33.420
They can just commandeered and something like that.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.870
So let's get started and let's just work.

02:35.930 --> 02:41.610
So you guys have the basic experience but Facebook I hope that you guys are on Facebook Facebook is

02:41.610 --> 02:43.110
the best social networking Web site.

02:43.110 --> 02:48.240
I'm not comparing it for them but still I'm just telling you that we are creating a social networking

02:48.320 --> 02:50.230
site where people can interact with each other.

02:50.250 --> 02:51.190
They get social.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.430
So this is what I mean.

02:52.500 --> 02:52.960
OK.

02:53.040 --> 02:56.190
So what we have to do is that we need to go to

03:01.460 --> 03:03.160
the body process in the setting steps.

03:03.180 --> 03:07.670
You have to just hope where your mouth is here and then you have to hit the press but the press is the

03:07.670 --> 03:15.080
plug in that we installed for the social networking and the beby press was the plug in that we installed

03:15.080 --> 03:16.150
for for him.

03:16.540 --> 03:17.120
OK.

03:17.180 --> 03:21.050
So this is how you can just differentiate them.

03:21.080 --> 03:23.960
This is the body press you can see and extend extended profile.

03:23.960 --> 03:30.130
Customize your community with fully editable profiles that allow users to describe themselves.

03:30.590 --> 03:36.310
Sure I want that and then I have the account settings allow users to modify their account in notification

03:36.310 --> 03:39.230
settings directly from the vendor profiles.

03:39.250 --> 03:45.310
Yes friend connections let your users make connections so they can track the activity of others and

03:45.310 --> 03:48.040
focus on the people they care about the most.

03:48.040 --> 03:52.420
This means that if anyone post a comment and they are in the friends he's going to he's going to get

03:52.420 --> 03:57.290
a notification or he's going to get in the activity that sais that and they say that.

03:57.300 --> 04:00.880
So what I'm going to do right now I'm just going to activate that functionality OK.

04:01.030 --> 04:02.060
I'm just going to come here.

04:02.080 --> 04:05.510
I am going to just select this and I'm going to save settings.

04:05.790 --> 04:06.260
OK.

04:06.330 --> 04:12.060
So just clicking this you can see that I just come here and I just refresh this member who is attacking

04:12.140 --> 04:14.250
backy and he's Trackback.

04:14.270 --> 04:14.710
OK.

04:14.830 --> 04:17.590
I can just add this add him as a friend.

04:17.590 --> 04:18.040
OK.

04:18.100 --> 04:21.140
So if I just click here he can see the request would be sent.

04:21.140 --> 04:26.590
I can also cancel the friendship request so I'm the teacher and I'm sending my student request.

04:26.820 --> 04:27.200
OK.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.930
So I'm just going to come here and I'm going to refresh it.

04:29.950 --> 04:34.400
So on refreshing it can see that I also have a profile picture.

04:34.690 --> 04:35.010
OK.

04:35.010 --> 04:38.780
And I also have this you have a friend friendship request from Danegeld.

04:38.800 --> 04:44.070
If this guy opens up he can just come here and then he is going to accept that he concedes.

04:44.290 --> 04:46.810
Then Ziel view member and I'm just going to accept.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.450
And this guy is going to be accepted.

04:49.450 --> 04:54.000
So then Ziel is now de-friend friend of this Trackback.

04:54.010 --> 04:54.500
OK.

04:54.520 --> 04:56.020
So this is what I mean.

04:56.950 --> 04:58.780
I'm just gonna come here and I'm going to add one more.

04:58.780 --> 05:03.850
And that is the private messaging allow users to talk to each other directly and in private.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.840
Not limited to one on one discussions.

05:06.840 --> 05:14.190
Messages can be seen between any number between any number of numbers so I'm going to check this and

05:14.210 --> 05:19.430
I'm going to set it to save the setting so this means there Vivyan to allow people to just talk to each

05:19.430 --> 05:19.980
other.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.150
So if this guy is if I just come here and I just go to the home page.

05:25.190 --> 05:26.810
Ok this is a home page.

05:26.850 --> 05:31.700
So I come here and again sieged says Peggy accepted a friendship request I'm going to say oh my god

05:31.730 --> 05:32.970
thank you.

05:33.050 --> 05:33.440
And

05:36.960 --> 05:38.990
so he can see you back.

05:39.290 --> 05:41.400
The active member Kancil friendship.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.130
I can just view his profile as well OK.

05:44.160 --> 05:49.770
He's an active member and this is like this so he has to say he is seeing Hey man how are you.

05:49.770 --> 05:53.800
I'm just gonna open his profile up and see OK.

05:54.020 --> 05:54.870
He's my friend.

05:55.020 --> 05:56.750
You can also consider a friendship with him.

05:56.780 --> 06:01.460
If if if if he got get a fight and we say OK you know what.

06:01.530 --> 06:02.560
You are not friends.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.660
OK.

06:03.680 --> 06:06.430
I don't want you I don't need you and you just go to hell.

06:06.560 --> 06:10.010
So I was going to cancel friendship and the friendship is going to be canceled.

06:10.010 --> 06:12.140
So now we're not friends.

06:12.170 --> 06:12.530
OK.

06:12.590 --> 06:18.410
So this is how it breaks in and I can also just private message him and I'm just going to abuse him

06:18.800 --> 06:26.910
and he's going to sell him and do so and do this means that I have to just enter the username and this

06:26.910 --> 06:32.390
will be sent to them so I have this one message right here.

06:32.460 --> 06:32.730
OK.

06:32.730 --> 06:40.530
And then I have the subject on we are not friends anymore.

06:40.760 --> 06:41.150
OK.

06:41.320 --> 06:46.950
So now here I want to enter something so I'm going to enter

06:49.950 --> 06:50.850
I need a break.

06:51.030 --> 06:51.350
OK.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.490
OK.

06:53.730 --> 06:54.690
I don't know what I'm in.

06:54.720 --> 06:54.960
OK.

06:54.970 --> 06:59.250
Just now I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to send a message so you can see this message is going

06:59.250 --> 07:00.560
to be sent to him.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.760
Message to send so you can see it.

07:02.760 --> 07:03.560
It is like this.

07:03.570 --> 07:05.090
We're not friends anymore.

07:05.100 --> 07:05.790
This is the message.

07:05.790 --> 07:06.910
This is a message subject.

07:06.930 --> 07:07.810
And then here it is.

07:07.860 --> 07:14.040
This is basically kind of like an e-mail based message like if he if he go to Gmail right now and then

07:14.040 --> 07:18.140
he go up you can see that G.M. how G.M. works G.M. works on that like this.

07:18.150 --> 07:18.720
OK.

07:18.840 --> 07:23.160
If I want to reply to any one like if I want to reply to this I can just come here and I can reply to

07:23.160 --> 07:23.320
it.

07:23.380 --> 07:25.080
Then the person will reply.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.690
He'll just come here and he will reply.

07:27.720 --> 07:29.590
This is how this G.M. works.

07:29.600 --> 07:35.040
OK so this is kind of like a G.M. not not just saying but it just kind of like.

07:35.070 --> 07:40.240
So if someone just come here and he's just here you'll see this this.

07:40.330 --> 07:41.170
This right here.

07:41.280 --> 07:46.640
You don't deal send you a new private message is going to come your and it is we're not friends anymore

07:46.650 --> 07:48.550
what what what.

07:50.040 --> 07:53.100
Why OK.

07:53.230 --> 07:57.430
So this guy's right here saying the canonization but mean than zeal.

07:57.430 --> 08:03.340
And so if if this guy just go through the messages itself then you can see in the message from zeal

08:03.580 --> 08:06.330
and the subject is this and that.

08:06.490 --> 08:08.160
So I can just unreal that I can make it.

08:08.170 --> 08:12.300
The first message is like I can make a feature feature too.

08:12.310 --> 08:16.590
It will be the first message that I have to see always reply in some like that.

08:16.590 --> 08:18.600
So that's how it works.

08:18.610 --> 08:19.720
They also have to send one

08:22.890 --> 08:26.880
so I have sent two deaths like it really you're not friends anymore.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.140
So this is how it works.

08:28.170 --> 08:28.950
OK.

08:28.950 --> 08:29.960
I can even compose it.

08:29.970 --> 08:35.250
So if I just wanted to be like this and I can just add NZL So I just want Anthony OK.

08:35.340 --> 08:36.650
I just going to add his user name.

08:36.780 --> 08:37.420

09:06.340 --> 09:07.940
And now I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit send.

09:07.950 --> 09:14.050
As you can see I have entered an invalid username art.

09:14.220 --> 09:20.160
OK let me open the seals profile and then let me just and send them a message.

09:20.190 --> 09:21.650
I'm just gonna open up the profile.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.960
I don't know why I cannot just do it like that.

09:24.090 --> 09:28.620
My infinity is in it and I'm going to get private message so now I'm going to enter the subject so subject

09:28.620 --> 09:29.310
is going to be

09:35.740 --> 09:36.460
OK.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.760
So I'm just saying them go to hell.

09:38.770 --> 09:39.260
OK.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.780
And I just sent him send a message.

09:40.780 --> 09:44.100
So this is right here and made it successfully.

09:44.110 --> 09:49.810
So if the deal will open up his account his account and he'll be like oh ok my student is just stitching

09:49.810 --> 09:50.780
me dad and I.

09:50.800 --> 09:58.770
And now I'm just going to open his profile and then I am going to basically OK let's just come here.

09:58.810 --> 10:01.660
Let's just get married and you can see it's not take it to to read bage

10:04.610 --> 10:06.080
and you don't open this up.

10:06.410 --> 10:08.260
GDH OK.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.390
So let's just say this subject.

10:20.400 --> 10:23.430
So we have to had this subject to open up the message.

10:23.430 --> 10:27.580
Hey I just figured out how to just open up the message so it.

10:28.270 --> 10:29.090
OK.

10:29.250 --> 10:34.350
You are spam now OK.

10:34.570 --> 10:39.500
And I'm going to hit send reply so you can see the reply is being sent so this is how this works I can't

10:39.620 --> 10:40.730
get any of the featured.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.020
I can make it like that.

10:42.020 --> 10:43.200
So this is how it works.

10:43.200 --> 10:48.810
OK so now in the forum you can see that if I just go to forums right here then you can see forum topic

10:48.810 --> 10:49.510
started.

10:49.650 --> 10:53.740
So in my mind say you can see this was a topic that was started by me.

10:53.790 --> 11:01.020
So now I'm just going to go to settings right now and you can see that here is the settings.

11:01.020 --> 11:05.060
Here is the email and here will also be the profile profile activity.

11:05.070 --> 11:10.570
So you can see Send an e-mail notice when a member joins when a member mentioned this this this so you

11:10.570 --> 11:13.190
can see this is how you can manage it pretty well.

11:13.260 --> 11:18.180
Seems like Facebook and Facebook if you go to profile settings and then you have to see these changes

11:18.180 --> 11:18.990
that you can make.

11:18.990 --> 11:21.100
So this is how it works.

11:21.120 --> 11:26.360
So now here let's just come here and we have the activity streams.

11:26.490 --> 11:30.310
Activity is like Facebook so if you just go to Facebook home page OK.

11:30.450 --> 11:35.370
If I just open this Facebook home page then you can see this is all the activity that is coming.

11:35.370 --> 11:40.770
So this is all the activities that are like the pages that I have like are some of the sponsored content

11:40.770 --> 11:41.370
here.

11:41.490 --> 11:47.540
And if I just go down and I have the pages so I mostly get the pages that I like.

11:47.670 --> 11:53.930
OK you can see none of the friends have disposed a status or shared anything.

11:56.190 --> 11:57.510
Let's go down till I find something.

11:57.510 --> 11:57.870
OK.

11:57.930 --> 11:58.660
This is the one.

11:58.680 --> 12:01.100
So if this is my friend OK.

12:01.230 --> 12:02.180
He's in my friend list.

12:02.220 --> 12:07.620
OK so this guy status is also coming I can just like and I can commentate or I can do anything.

12:07.620 --> 12:09.610
So this is how Facebook is working.

12:09.750 --> 12:10.140
OK.

12:10.260 --> 12:12.700
Seemed like that the activity is working OK.

12:12.780 --> 12:18.300
So if I just go to the pages right now and then I go to all pages so I don't know why there's something

12:18.300 --> 12:20.340
itching in my nose I don't know why.

12:20.610 --> 12:27.240
OK so here in the activity if I just open this up that you can see here it is so here's everything.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.070
Take me back you change your profile picture.

12:29.070 --> 12:31.750
I'm not going to say OK well I'm going to favorite it.

12:31.800 --> 12:38.640
It's going to show the activity of everything that has that is coming to our website and what is and

12:38.640 --> 12:40.600
it is also the status option right here.

12:40.620 --> 12:43.780
I can just say hello everyone.

12:45.570 --> 12:47.040
I really

12:49.840 --> 12:52.480
like zealots classis

12:55.440 --> 13:00.290
OK and I'm going to hit post today so you can see this is right here.

13:00.290 --> 13:01.500
So this is right.

13:01.700 --> 13:04.930
OK I'm just talking about myself I really like these glasses.

13:05.150 --> 13:07.440
OK so you can see this is how it works.

13:08.120 --> 13:08.520
OK.

13:08.640 --> 13:13.360
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to just close my top so that no notifications comes up.

13:13.640 --> 13:13.940
OK.

13:13.940 --> 13:19.020
So now we have the notifications notifications you guys already know about it.

13:19.100 --> 13:20.350
I think more than myself.

13:20.480 --> 13:26.690
So now I have that user group so allows users to organize themselves into specific public private or

13:26.690 --> 13:30.060
hidden sections that separate activity streams and member listing.

13:30.230 --> 13:33.710
What this means is that user if you just go to Facebook dot com.

13:33.710 --> 13:34.120
OK.

13:34.220 --> 13:38.120
So then on clicking the Facebook dot com we have so many scripts.

13:38.130 --> 13:44.000
OK you guys already know about it so if I just go to any of the group I can just move on.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.710
So like I have some of the crops like if I am in this.

13:48.780 --> 13:49.240
OK.

13:49.310 --> 13:51.460
Like education education this is a group.

13:51.470 --> 13:51.830
OK.

13:51.830 --> 13:54.860
And here is the person who is the administrator.

13:54.860 --> 13:57.570
And then here are the people who are coming here.

13:57.590 --> 14:00.320
Everything related to the education.

14:00.320 --> 14:07.220
So I if I if I if I want to give a test like here I can just go there and I can just tell him that tell

14:07.220 --> 14:12.370
them I ask the people that event is the admission form skimming or something like that.

14:13.100 --> 14:14.840
So this is how it works ok.

14:14.990 --> 14:17.580
I'm just going to click here and now I'm going to close this down.

14:17.600 --> 14:25.060
So now you can see this is exactly the same as the copilot did say so if you want to be allowed to dislike

14:25.070 --> 14:28.270
users can just create groups and then you just check it out.

14:28.280 --> 14:35.250
OK so will just give them more access ability they can organize themselves into some criteria.

14:35.760 --> 14:41.770
OK and the last we have is the site cracking recall activity for new post and comments for your site

14:41.790 --> 14:43.660
so you just have to select this is all.

14:43.670 --> 14:48.980
And then we have the buddy press corps and we have the community members everything in a press community

14:49.400 --> 14:50.940
revolves around its members.

14:51.030 --> 14:53.230
Okay I'm just going to save settings right now.

14:53.570 --> 14:55.640
OK and everything has been changed.

14:55.730 --> 14:58.180
So now I'm going to go to the pages right now.

14:58.190 --> 15:04.220
And here in the pages we have this member section we have this activity section and we also have now

15:04.250 --> 15:09.210
a cross section if I just open up the cross section you can see that I can create Krups OK.

15:09.260 --> 15:10.570
There were no groups found.

15:10.920 --> 15:11.320
OK.

15:11.510 --> 15:12.590
Last active nothing.

15:12.590 --> 15:13.310
I'm just going to go ahead.

15:13.340 --> 15:21.260
I'm going to create a new group since I have two members in my that is what we say in my profile or

15:21.260 --> 15:23.780
in my social I'm working up say that is why I have a little neon light.

15:23.780 --> 15:26.840
My friend who has that backpack.

15:26.960 --> 15:34.150
So I'm just gonna enter my name and that will be verb developers.

15:34.330 --> 15:35.140
OK.

15:35.210 --> 15:41.170
Or just create an alert for like students off class

15:45.870 --> 15:47.510
9 B.

15:47.750 --> 15:48.160
OK.

15:48.290 --> 15:51.110
So here description.

15:55.180 --> 15:57.260
You can enter your rules here about this.

15:57.340 --> 16:02.370
That tag group means taking this like only

16:04.790 --> 16:20.120
students of the above mentioned class will be allowed to enter this group.

16:20.550 --> 16:23.130
So since I'm creating this group I am the admin.

16:23.160 --> 16:26.390
OK I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to create a group and.

16:28.430 --> 16:29.090
And here you go.

16:29.090 --> 16:30.340
You can see it says this.

16:30.380 --> 16:35.210
This is a private group only you can see that there are the privacy options so you can see public from

16:35.270 --> 16:37.180
any site member can join this group.

16:37.180 --> 16:44.100
No we just want the users who are like the students of class 9 B.

16:44.210 --> 16:47.650
They can also tell what I'm going to do I'm just going to select this as a private group that isn't

16:47.680 --> 16:50.180
available or sit in the cribs directly and search results.

16:50.190 --> 16:52.780
This group will be listed in the groups directly and insertion results.

16:54.690 --> 16:55.800
That's one.

16:56.040 --> 17:01.730
So this one I should be going up because Darnton activity will be visible to the members of this group

17:01.730 --> 17:02.070
so.

17:02.100 --> 17:06.970
And then we have the group in predations of which members of this group are allowed to invite others

17:07.040 --> 17:10.780
or group members group admins and moderators only group admins only.

17:10.790 --> 17:15.030
So I'm just going to select group admins the moderators obviously and I'm going to hit next steps so

17:15.060 --> 17:16.280
it's in the future the next step.

17:16.290 --> 17:17.470
And there I have the forum.

17:17.500 --> 17:24.000
So create a discussion forum to allow members of this group to communicate in a structured bulletin

17:24.000 --> 17:25.770
board style fashion.

17:26.130 --> 17:27.810
Yes I want this group to have a forum.

17:27.840 --> 17:31.920
OK yes I'm going I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit next step and can see that here we

17:31.920 --> 17:36.510
have the photos so I just want to upload the photo of that profile photo that describes the 90s.

17:36.510 --> 17:38.360
So let's just upload it.

17:38.370 --> 17:39.440
OK.

17:39.720 --> 17:40.790
This will be right here.

17:40.800 --> 17:41.960
I think I have to crop it.

17:42.000 --> 17:42.640
Yes.

17:42.690 --> 17:42.930
OK.

17:42.930 --> 17:45.340
This is right here and just going ahead crop image

17:49.560 --> 17:53.500
and now we have to hit next steps so the next step I have to select the cover image.

17:53.580 --> 17:54.840
So this is all important.

17:54.840 --> 17:55.720
OK.

17:55.920 --> 17:58.950
I'm just going to read this and I am going to upload this one.

17:58.950 --> 18:01.260
So this is right being uploaded.

18:01.470 --> 18:04.880
And once it is I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit next step and then we have the might

18:04.900 --> 18:06.790
so then we have to invite people.

18:06.870 --> 18:07.480
OK.

18:07.500 --> 18:12.900
I'm just going to click here and you can see that in the inmate section I have to once you have a builder

18:12.990 --> 18:16.060
friend connections will be able to invite others to your home.

18:16.140 --> 18:22.590
Since I don't have anyone in my friend request I just basically move back back back from my friend who

18:22.630 --> 18:25.760
advised me just broke up so that I could not do there.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.880
So I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit that friend.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.020
OK.

18:29.390 --> 18:32.000
And now here I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to finish this.

18:33.660 --> 18:35.250
So you can see this is a group.

18:35.370 --> 18:36.150
This is the title.

18:36.150 --> 18:38.020
Students of class Denby.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.260
And here is the forum.

18:39.260 --> 18:44.050
Here's members who are send in my €10 everything you can see this is exactly same.

18:44.070 --> 18:47.650
Anybody can create the group then they can just enter information.

18:47.740 --> 18:49.650
It's going to be shown to everybody.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.540
And now we have that group admins as well.

18:51.540 --> 18:57.270
So let me just come here and just send the friendship to him so that I want to add him here to my social

18:57.270 --> 19:02.990
networking Web site so to to my group here it is.

19:03.020 --> 19:07.100
You have a friend request from Dinsdale I'm going to open it up and I'm going to accept it.

19:07.110 --> 19:12.000
So on accepting this you can see he's in my friend class so friendless study.

19:12.100 --> 19:17.380
I'm just going to come here and I am going to Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo go to groups.

19:18.330 --> 19:18.780
OK.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.110
And now I'm going to rephrase this.

19:20.130 --> 19:22.520
You can see in the groups this is right here.

19:22.550 --> 19:28.730
So now I'm going to refresh this and see that I am right here I am just going to go ahead and I'm going

19:28.730 --> 19:30.880
to send invites so send invites.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.740
Anyone want to send in my invitation to this guy.

19:33.970 --> 19:40.490
He she she must be and my friend Naughtie he must be my friend request friend list so that I can just

19:41.690 --> 19:46.490
send him invite so you can see this is in my invitation and this is very moving.

19:46.760 --> 19:50.830
If I just come here and I just go to Home page you can see I'm right here.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.690
And the member is one still one OK.

19:53.720 --> 20:00.080
The reason is that because the back has just accepted my friend request or sorry he hasn't accepted

20:00.080 --> 20:03.360
the request of approval or pressed for the form.

20:03.830 --> 20:09.500
Let me just rephrases OK let me just come here to send invites

20:14.830 --> 20:20.230
send invites so you can see an invitation has been sent.

20:20.230 --> 20:22.970
So if I just go to members you can see nothing is here.

20:23.060 --> 20:24.560
I'm just going to go back and.

20:24.620 --> 20:27.650
And once I refreshed this you can see here would be two.

20:27.650 --> 20:32.450
And it says you have a new you have an invitation to the students of class and be ok.

20:32.490 --> 20:33.780
I think you see it OK.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.610
This is like this to me.

20:35.690 --> 20:39.350
This is the students of Glaston B and one one members right here.

20:39.380 --> 20:41.570
So we're going to go ahead and I'm going to just accept that.

20:41.570 --> 20:44.150
So in the crops it can see that I have

20:47.780 --> 20:50.770
OK let's just come here to a membership right now not an invitation.

20:50.770 --> 20:53.480
You can see that I have this group Citizens of Clauss Tenby.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.420
I can even leave this group.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.850
It is a private group and it is it has two members.

20:57.850 --> 21:01.290
I'm just going to come here and I am just going to open this group up.

21:01.370 --> 21:01.820
OK.

21:01.820 --> 21:04.820
And then here I am going to add in anything so I'm going to add

21:07.670 --> 21:19.570
I like this maybe body press plugging.

21:20.090 --> 21:20.510
OK.

21:20.560 --> 21:25.020
And now here I am just going to go hit and I'm going to post a date so you can see this is right here

21:25.020 --> 21:26.340
and the page didn't load.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.240
Ajax is working already.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.240
So this is how it is working.

21:29.260 --> 21:36.280
I'm just going to come here and I am going to just view my home for this specific group and again see

21:36.280 --> 21:37.940
Taqi back is right here.

21:37.940 --> 21:42.010
If I just go here you can see techi Becky accepted your friendship request is also coming I'm just going

21:42.010 --> 21:44.570
to come here and I'm going to make it favorito that.

21:44.880 --> 21:45.320
OK.

21:45.340 --> 21:47.360
This is I'm also enjoying.

21:47.480 --> 21:51.610
I'm going to comment that same here.

21:51.880 --> 21:52.250
OK.

21:52.400 --> 21:56.180
So I'm just going to hit post great now so you can see the post will be here.

21:56.180 --> 22:00.380
So this is how it works so you can see how it is looking and if I just come here and I just go to the

22:00.380 --> 22:06.340
home page you can see here and it has been Zele commented on one of your updates OK.

22:06.350 --> 22:10.420
I'm just going to come here and open it up so you can see.

22:10.430 --> 22:10.970
Same here.

22:10.980 --> 22:18.000
I can even reply to him and I can just send him an emoji so I'm going to post-Second see this emoji

22:18.050 --> 22:19.410
will turn into that.

22:19.650 --> 22:20.850
OK it is not turning.

22:21.050 --> 22:24.560
So I can see everything is totally up and running OK.

22:24.680 --> 22:29.300
We have now done the basic things of this process.

22:29.330 --> 22:29.780
OK.

22:29.870 --> 22:34.070
Now the basic understanding of how everything works in the options we are just going over with them

22:34.070 --> 22:35.550
and then we're going to move forward.

22:35.550 --> 22:39.010
So here we have that toolbar.

22:39.140 --> 22:41.040
So the toolbar for logged out is.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.650
So this is called the toolbar.

22:42.770 --> 22:48.080
If someone is not in our website then do you want to show the toolbar like here that tell you to log

22:48.080 --> 22:49.750
into our website or something like that.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.380
If you want to show it just select it and if you want to show it just uncheck this and it'll not be

22:54.380 --> 22:58.460
show I can deletion allow registered members to delete their own accounts.

22:58.460 --> 23:02.660
Yes this is very important if someone is registering that he has the right to deactivate his account

23:02.660 --> 23:03.720
obviously.

23:03.830 --> 23:11.420
So you have to allow them do we have OK if someone is a student then he should send an application and

23:11.420 --> 23:16.060
then his account will be deleted so if you need some of the some of the policy for that you then you

23:16.170 --> 23:18.700
have to take this totally depends upon you.

23:19.100 --> 23:24.560
Then you have the profile photo uploads allowed to disturb members to upload avatars and then we have

23:24.560 --> 23:30.320
to cover them and profile sinking we have groups creation and able groups creation for all users.

23:30.320 --> 23:35.360
Ok this is important and you can just change it like group for uploads group cover photo of Lords and

23:35.360 --> 23:41.450
then we have the blog and forum comments so allow activity stream commenting on blogs and for them boast

23:41.980 --> 23:43.210
this is this is important.

23:43.220 --> 23:43.820
OK.

23:43.970 --> 23:49.630
If someone is commenting on our website or commenting on our blog then in the activity.

23:50.060 --> 23:51.860
And then we have activity or to finish.

23:51.860 --> 23:52.270
OK.

23:52.370 --> 23:57.590
So this means that if I am in the activity OK then it'll auto refresh and everything will be coming

23:57.590 --> 24:00.780
up here and my website will be basically running in the background.

24:00.790 --> 24:01.960
So this is important.

24:02.120 --> 24:07.220
But if you have low servers or if you are using free web hosting or something like that then do not

24:07.220 --> 24:09.880
just check it because you are several Vittal be down.

24:09.980 --> 24:13.200
So you can see now we are totally done with the buddy press.

24:13.190 --> 24:17.810
We're done with everything right here and now Vivah will be working up in the designing of the site
