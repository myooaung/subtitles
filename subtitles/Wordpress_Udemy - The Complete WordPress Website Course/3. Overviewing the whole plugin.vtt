So everything is going to come here.

00:38.860 --> 00:39.400
OK.

00:39.490 --> 00:46.000
So then we will be very clear about the products we will add it will also just add some order from us.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.350
OK so we will also just do fake order so that everything will come here.

OK so you can run that.

01:15.100 --> 01:15.530
OK.

01:15.550 --> 01:16.980
You can create a coupon.

01:17.350 --> 01:22.140

01:22.180 --> 01:28.090
You can see that everything that is coming right here we have the customers right here is going to show

01:28.090 --> 01:33.370
a list of customers that has been added to here that customer sales that guess sales is going to show

01:33.400 --> 01:35.100
a crowd who's coming here.

01:35.210 --> 01:37.260
And tell me how this stock is going to show that.

01:37.300 --> 01:39.890
What are the products that are low on stock.

01:39.910 --> 01:46.330
What are the products that are out of stock and more of the products that are most stocked in your e-commerce

01:46.330 --> 01:51.700
sites or the products that are most stock you can run a sale that they're not being sold or something

01:51.700 --> 01:52.050
like that.

01:52.050 --> 01:52.570
Okay.

01:52.600 --> 01:57.370
And then we have the settings right here here we're going to manage every setting that we have.

01:57.420 --> 02:02.550
You're going to see that we have the address and these are already added When we were just forced over

02:02.550 --> 02:08.560
it and installed Word installed the new commerce will pay and we have the city we have the country postcode

02:08.590 --> 02:10.060
and everything right here.

02:10.060 --> 02:10.520
OK.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.080
So then we have the products tab right here.

02:13.450 --> 02:18.030
And the products we have everything we have shipping as well.

02:18.040 --> 02:18.590
Okay.

02:18.640 --> 02:24.010
So you can see that we have shipping for Pakistan and then we have the shipping for like the country

02:24.010 --> 02:29.380
where we have we don't have assigned a shipping zone so we can assign a shipping zone for another country

02:29.380 --> 02:34.180
like if I want to assign a shipping zone to China or if anyone is saying the shipping zone to us or

02:34.180 --> 02:36.570
UK or something like that I can do that.

02:36.580 --> 02:42.150
I can also go to the Czech code and then here I can just check everything here.

02:42.160 --> 02:45.050
So the page is all also being created.

02:45.490 --> 02:49.980
Everything is right here that beamin gateways are coming right here.

02:50.140 --> 02:50.590
OK.

02:50.680 --> 02:53.050
And then we have the account Stabb.

02:53.230 --> 02:59.170
OK so in the accounts I'm going to tell people that enable customer registration on the checkout page

02:59.540 --> 03:07.060
and customers should must be registered in order to just buy anything so you can just do that and everything

03:07.060 --> 03:08.000
is right here.

03:08.050 --> 03:12.710
And then in the emails you can work with that if any order has created that e-mail is going to be sent

03:12.710 --> 03:18.340
to this if his order on hold that e-mail is going to be sent to customers if his order is completed

03:18.340 --> 03:21.780
the e-mail will be sent to discuss more in something like that everything.

03:21.940 --> 03:26.260
OK so we will be working up to this and then we have the last one is the AP.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.030
So how EPA works.

03:28.030 --> 03:32.590
If you want to connect your immobile with your it this website.

03:32.740 --> 03:37.260
OK you can do it or if you want to just connect your site to print full.

03:37.270 --> 03:37.960
You can also do it.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.380
I'm going to show you what a print full is how it is.

03:40.480 --> 03:41.380
Everything.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.200
I'm going to show you in this quarter.

03:43.270 --> 03:50.380
OK so you can connect your mobile with this when using API and how this will work is that if you want

03:50.380 --> 03:56.610
to post anything any product from that app then you can post that app API.

03:56.740 --> 03:58.330
So I'm going to show you how this is going to work.

03:58.330 --> 04:04.800
Then we have the status and it it will tell us the status of say that if our website is compatible there

04:05.050 --> 04:08.550
are in our hosting environment.

04:08.560 --> 04:13.390
OK I can see that these are giving giving is some things but these are not much recommended.

04:13.570 --> 04:16.820
OK so everything is totally up and running.

04:16.820 --> 04:19.610
We have to set up the terms and conditions bejeweled set it up.

04:19.780 --> 04:24.520
OK so everything is totally up and running and then we have the finally some extensions OK.

04:24.580 --> 04:27.730
So in the extensions we can work with these things as well.

04:27.730 --> 04:30.800
I'll tell you in the later on.

04:30.900 --> 04:31.400
OK.

04:31.420 --> 04:34.260
So now we have this one right here.

04:34.300 --> 04:38.070
Let's just go to the products and let's go to all products right here.

04:38.190 --> 04:43.520
All products that it's going to show all the products that we have seen like post in the post.

04:43.630 --> 04:47.800
If we go to all post it's going to show all the post if we go to add new it's going to add a new product

04:48.160 --> 04:51.600
product and then we have the categories tags and the attributes.

04:51.610 --> 04:54.890
Everything is exactly same as this.

04:54.910 --> 04:55.480
OK.

04:55.510 --> 04:57.700
So this is going to be so much fun.

04:57.760 --> 05:02.900
I don't think so if I should explain the just because you guys already know already have got the idea

05:02.900 --> 05:08.350
that how can we assign product category how can we assign product to tag something like that.

05:08.390 --> 05:13.520
So we will be doing that in the next video so stadium guys and in the next video will be adding a fresh

05:13.520 --> 05:17.110
product and vote for that so on and by.
