WEBVTT

00:01.120 --> 00:02.660
It what is it guys and welcome back.

00:02.700 --> 00:07.080
Now in this video I'll be showing you that how can you add a booking product so this will be like a

00:07.090 --> 00:14.590
people can procure UCU for the purpose of that what ever they want and for something like that so you

00:14.590 --> 00:21.190
can just create an online shop for like if you need an electrician then you have electricians and you

00:21.280 --> 00:27.520
want people to just book electricians for just like on all the bases and on daily bases they can do

00:27.520 --> 00:28.760
create a website for that.

00:28.890 --> 00:29.390
OK.

00:29.440 --> 00:33.800
And if you also want to create website like for yourselves like iTunes yielder.

00:33.810 --> 00:41.600
Com if I just want to add that functionality in here so that people can just hire me on the hourly basis

00:41.680 --> 00:46.810
just they can hire me like that so I'm just going to also show you how ANY just created to first thing

00:46.810 --> 00:47.600
comes first.

00:47.680 --> 00:52.540
I just want to show you that if someone wants to hire me here like this OK how can he hire me.

00:52.540 --> 00:54.390
So first we will be just trying it right here.

00:54.400 --> 00:54.770
OK.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.400
I'm just going to show you what you have to do.

00:56.400 --> 00:59.030
How can he hire myself on hourly basis.

00:59.050 --> 01:05.060
And if someone has already hired me then the other person should not be able to hire me on that day.

01:05.200 --> 01:12.090
And on that specific are and I also defined that from which time to which time it will be available

01:12.220 --> 01:15.270
and Sunday would be off dead Sunday I will not be doing the work.

01:15.340 --> 01:18.930
We just hanging out with my friends and family and other.

01:18.970 --> 01:24.240
So I have to just define everything in here and this is a vast thing.

01:24.370 --> 01:29.940
OK you have to understand everything guys has because if you do not understand this seriously you will

01:29.980 --> 01:30.540
not.

01:30.650 --> 01:32.110
You will not be able to do that.

01:32.110 --> 01:36.730
So make sure to leave everything just concentrate on it because this is not the designing part.

01:36.730 --> 01:40.360
This is the technical part and you have to focus on it.

01:40.440 --> 01:40.840
OK.

01:40.960 --> 01:46.510
If you do not find anything to be like if there is any confusion that then she may surely just go ahead

01:46.540 --> 01:48.480
and watch the video again.

01:48.610 --> 01:54.910
And if you still if thats still convenient is not over then you can ask me and you to me for him to

01:55.060 --> 01:56.600
pay attention to it guys.

01:56.650 --> 02:01.180
So lets just get him here and he can see that we have an extra thing that says all the bookings so since

02:01.180 --> 02:03.630
we dont have any of the booking and sees nothing ok.

02:03.760 --> 02:04.540
I'm just going to go ahead.

02:04.540 --> 02:05.710
I'm going to add a product.

02:05.830 --> 02:10.780
So we will be adding a product for the booking like the first IF are creating a hotel booking then we

02:10.780 --> 02:13.630
have to enter the hotel name in the product section.

02:13.630 --> 02:17.950
So if you are creating just a Web site for a hotel booking then you just need a one single product.

02:17.960 --> 02:18.330
Okay.

02:18.520 --> 02:19.920
And thats all you do.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.340
You do not need anything.

02:21.340 --> 02:23.740
And then here would be the different options that you get out.

02:23.740 --> 02:26.750
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit this.

02:27.190 --> 02:31.300
Head of product so the product name that I wanted to be like higher than Zele.

02:31.470 --> 02:31.790
Okay.

02:31.900 --> 02:40.840
So since I am a person here who has just create my own thing here it will be like higher than zero from

02:40.840 --> 02:47.470
my book insight from like S10 a company that will be course dot com and then Zele Phil be working for

02:47.470 --> 02:53.080
like one hour and for one hour he'll charge $50.

02:53.080 --> 02:53.470
OK.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.430
So I'm just going to come here I'm just going to select this.

02:55.450 --> 03:00.210
And here you can see that I have an extra options that says bookable product.

03:00.250 --> 03:00.730
OK.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.830
So we already know about these.

03:02.920 --> 03:03.250
OK.

03:03.250 --> 03:08.170
I don't have to explain you if you do not know then make sure to follow the e-commerce section because

03:08.170 --> 03:13.920
that is important if you do not have the understanding of this you cannot understand the bookable product.

03:13.930 --> 03:17.740
Please guys please please please do not just jump into this.

03:17.740 --> 03:20.400
Go ahead and learn everything.

03:20.410 --> 03:22.880
Learn the whole section of the e-commerce section.

03:22.880 --> 03:24.490
Do watch that and then come here.

03:24.490 --> 03:30.280
So now here I just want to select the bookable product right now and here its here and just ask me three

03:30.280 --> 03:30.760
questions.

03:30.770 --> 03:35.380
OK the first one is like a virtual has persons has resources.

03:35.410 --> 03:41.270
So the virtual is like that cannot be shared since he is hiring me I am allowed we ship to his country

03:41.430 --> 03:42.350
OK.

03:42.400 --> 03:48.640
If you are like something hiring like Key me and then it will also be the ship that you want to charge

03:48.640 --> 03:52.630
him like I'll just come to your country and you have to pay me that I don't want to do that.

03:52.630 --> 03:54.100
So this is the virtual product.

03:54.110 --> 03:54.680
OK.

03:54.710 --> 03:56.670
Basically he's hiring me.

03:56.800 --> 04:02.980
I'll do his work on the team you or I'll do any work that any work he wants from me and he can just

04:02.980 --> 04:04.690
hire me on all the bases.

04:04.690 --> 04:14.020
OK so now we have this has operations and this is specifically for flight test ok like if you want if

04:14.020 --> 04:19.220
you want an on line test basis like there people can register and you can go ahead and check thislike

04:19.480 --> 04:20.080
has a person.

04:20.080 --> 04:26.890
So if your classroom has 30 seats available you can just allow that 30 percent out 30 people is the

04:26.890 --> 04:29.570
maximum and only one person can book.

04:30.230 --> 04:30.720
OK.

04:30.880 --> 04:35.230
And it all just like if it exceeds the tourney then we will not allow it.

04:35.230 --> 04:42.820
So that's like this or if you are just doing a hotel service like it's a hotel and the people and wants

04:42.820 --> 04:50.470
to be coming up and staying in the hotel it can be like like a child or a normal like an adult so you

04:50.470 --> 04:56.140
can just create two categories like if he's a child then we'll charge him five bucks and if he's an

04:56.140 --> 04:58.740
adult and he'll charge him like 20 bucks.

04:58.780 --> 05:00.050
So this is what they mean.

05:00.070 --> 05:07.830
But since I don't want to charge on the child or anything I'll just charge him like it's normal for

05:07.830 --> 05:12.590
a bit but everybody waited for the right guy with the record go all over the child.

05:12.870 --> 05:15.010
You have to pay $50 for an hour.

05:15.140 --> 05:15.630
OK.

05:15.660 --> 05:21.690
And then we have the has resources so for resources it can be like if you are using a hotel then you

05:21.690 --> 05:30.230
can ask them like you need a big bedroom you need a bedroom bed and LCD Elodie TV internet my FAE are

05:30.230 --> 05:34.700
simple that so you can add multiple resources to just charge your customers.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.210
And most people do that I just hate it.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.340
Seriously guys them.

05:37.440 --> 05:42.960
These are things you should add that in your hotel so that people can just buy it.

05:43.320 --> 05:46.410
So let's go ahead and say we have the booking duration.

05:46.410 --> 05:49.120
So this is me like booking duration.

05:49.130 --> 05:54.810
How much time the booking duration would be so we will be charging the customers on the all the bases.

05:54.810 --> 05:55.360
OK.

05:55.380 --> 06:02.990
So this is like an hour so a customer can book this for in our ok he can not Bowcock more than ours.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.840
So you can just select that if you want to.

06:06.040 --> 06:11.310
Or you can also give your customers the option is that customer defined blocks like customer you can

06:11.610 --> 06:15.630
hire me for I like minimum duration should be one hour OK.

06:15.720 --> 06:18.470
And the maximum duration can be like five hours.

06:18.480 --> 06:24.330
I will not work more than five hours because five hours after five hours I'll I'll get tired and I cannot

06:24.330 --> 06:24.680
work.

06:24.690 --> 06:26.920
So you can just select it like this.

06:27.040 --> 06:32.830
OK a minimum duration is one hour or two and the maximum is five or so this is how it's going to work.

06:32.990 --> 06:37.200
OK and her Tay's Kolender always visible.

06:37.210 --> 06:43.000
So what what does this mean is that it will show a calendar on the basis of like how much you want to

06:43.000 --> 06:46.910
book for how long you want to book and the dates that are available.

06:47.170 --> 06:48.340
I am to the book.

06:48.370 --> 06:51.430
So let me show you let me just published this post.

06:51.460 --> 06:52.530
Let me just publish it.

06:52.660 --> 06:57.220
Let me show you how this is going to look so if I just come here and I just open this product right

06:57.220 --> 07:02.120
now and then let me show you how this is going next sick and see artists looking at teazed a generation

07:02.440 --> 07:03.970
that for how long you want me to hire.

07:03.970 --> 07:11.200
So it says if the guy says I want him to be two hours pay and then here is this a date and here I can

07:11.200 --> 07:17.140
just move on like it is like to be like chandlery 18 and then I can say like I want to I want to hire

07:17.140 --> 07:19.150
him for him for this one.

07:19.300 --> 07:19.700
OK.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.400
And then I'm going to select the time.

07:21.520 --> 07:25.900
For the time like for 4 AM I want him to work at 4 a.m..

07:25.900 --> 07:27.340
So this is the cost that is coming.

07:27.340 --> 07:31.520
This is free obviously we haven't added any cost for like a single hour.

07:31.640 --> 07:32.960
OK that is why this is coming.

07:33.070 --> 07:39.470
If we just we can also make it like it will not be visible the customer can only hire me for one single

07:39.470 --> 07:44.170
are OK if he just selected and it will be like four or five six and four five six will not be bookable

07:45.700 --> 07:51.190
by another person OK because he has our Me and this is higher than Ziller him on.

07:51.190 --> 07:55.380
This is the one single guy how can you work for two people industry.

07:55.390 --> 07:59.280
So if a guy just looks me if I just book me.

07:59.410 --> 08:00.160
OK Dan..

08:00.310 --> 08:03.430
Then another guy cannot book me on that specific date.

08:03.580 --> 08:04.930
And on that specific date.

08:04.930 --> 08:09.260
So this is the power of that plug in and that is why this plugin cost that much.

08:09.260 --> 08:16.270
OK guys so now let's go ahead and do what we want to do is that we can also just like it like fixed

08:16.270 --> 08:17.510
number of one hour.

08:17.510 --> 08:24.660
So the customer only has to buy me for me not by me book me for one single or he can not go beyond that

08:24.670 --> 08:30.990
so if I just select it he can see it will be like okay we haven't assigned any thing that is right is

08:30.990 --> 08:37.430
just showing free but you can see that the customer can not go beyond that if it is so like 2 to 22

08:37.590 --> 08:44.010
then he has to select this like if he selects 11 am done is right here he cannot just go beyond that

08:44.040 --> 08:44.460
one.

08:44.470 --> 08:50.610
RS If you just book trate now it will say that he has bought me for he has bugged me for one single

08:50.610 --> 08:55.060
are the pay this is what I mean I'm just going to go ahead.

08:55.200 --> 09:01.140
And now here I just want to select the customers so that customers can just hire me from 1 to 5.

09:01.180 --> 09:02.470
RS OK.

09:02.820 --> 09:03.780
Now we have the calendar.

09:03.780 --> 09:04.610
All is visible.

09:04.620 --> 09:07.100
I showed you that how calendar will be looking.

09:07.650 --> 09:08.070
Okay.

09:08.130 --> 09:10.730
And now here we have requires confirmation.

09:10.830 --> 09:14.500
This means that if someone just hire me and then they book now.

09:14.620 --> 09:15.020
OK.

09:15.150 --> 09:20.970
So then it requires confirmation that I'll be getting an e-mail and I even type confirm it then he will

09:20.970 --> 09:24.530
be to not accept this guy do not exceed this thing.

09:24.540 --> 09:30.830
I seriously seriously you want to evade someone to pay if he just didnt even approve it.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.340
And then he will be to be a long time.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.590
So just do it.

09:34.630 --> 09:38.110
Everything from automatically like if this is available he can just book it.

09:38.130 --> 09:38.690
He can pay.

09:38.700 --> 09:41.160
And if he is being old I will work for it.

09:41.160 --> 09:46.220
But if you do not one that you just whine like if he wants to book he just have to confirm.

09:46.250 --> 09:50.510
I just have to confirm like when he said that he dont have to pay right now.

09:50.580 --> 09:50.780
OK.

09:50.790 --> 09:55.740
Payment will not be taken during check out Vence approve it and then the payment will be taken.

09:55.740 --> 09:57.920
So do not approve this guy seriously.

09:57.960 --> 10:04.080
You can also arm this bill like an appointment for the doctors so you can also do it like on all the

10:04.080 --> 10:09.390
bases and on something like that so you can see this is also how it can work for appointment you can

10:09.390 --> 10:13.470
just just like confirm it like if the doctor is available.

10:13.560 --> 10:18.750
Or if the doctor has to do anything else but since this is a freelance based work and I will and I would

10:18.750 --> 10:24.350
not recommend you to choose this for any of the field category but do you guys know that.

10:24.390 --> 10:25.920
Which type of thing that you want.

10:25.920 --> 10:31.740
So if you want it to be checked and you can check it check this box if booking requires admin approval

10:31.980 --> 10:36.570
confirmation payment will not be taken during check out so they can check it and they say it can be

10:36.570 --> 10:37.360
canceled.

10:37.470 --> 10:42.180
Check this box if the booking can be cancelled by the customer after it has been pre-Chase a refund

10:42.180 --> 10:43.870
Milad be sent automatically.

10:43.920 --> 10:50.880
So if someone has booked something then it can be cancelled so if you want like if someone has hired

10:50.880 --> 10:53.130
me already OK then he can cancel it.

10:53.130 --> 10:58.180
No if you have hired me then you should pay for it and you cannot cancel it.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.370
OK I'll be there if you if there is a change in time.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.360
I'll just mention in the privacy policy.

11:03.360 --> 11:09.450
I'll just mention it in the terms and conditions when then person can just when the person is being

11:09.450 --> 11:09.900
that.

11:09.900 --> 11:17.580
If you want to cancel your jesting is not refundable and not just Heibel because if you hire me and

11:17.580 --> 11:23.790
then this is just a simple guy if someone has already hired me then he has paid me.

11:23.860 --> 11:29.820
After a few minutes or after a few hours he's just like like I don't want it and then physically he

11:29.820 --> 11:34.110
has taken the right of the other person and any other guy could hire me on that time.

11:34.290 --> 11:36.270
So why would I want to refund them.

11:36.420 --> 11:37.570
OK he has had me.

11:37.590 --> 11:38.680
He has to be.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.090
So this is what I mean.

11:40.230 --> 11:44.220
OK so you can just check it if you want to but it requires a lot of effort.

11:44.220 --> 11:51.090
So payment bilabiate refund automatically the booking will be cancelled and then you have to do it manually

11:51.090 --> 11:52.180
so do not check it.

11:52.320 --> 11:55.170
OK this is totally done right here.

11:55.290 --> 11:57.930
Now we have the next section and that saves cost.

11:57.930 --> 11:59.210
So this is really important.

11:59.370 --> 12:08.270
OK we have to select everything it says base cost and block cost so what does the base cost physically

12:08.540 --> 12:16.520
based cars is something like If you buy only me for one just like one hour she'll be the same if you

12:16.520 --> 12:18.040
buy me for two hours.

12:18.050 --> 12:23.720
It will be the same if you buy me for three years it will be same and block cost means like this is

12:23.720 --> 12:25.540
like we have chosen one are here.

12:25.640 --> 12:26.240
OK.

12:26.240 --> 12:29.420
So this is like if you buy me if you hire me.

12:29.420 --> 12:32.280
Sorry if you hire me for one hour.

12:32.390 --> 12:36.260
OK then I will charge you $50.

12:36.470 --> 12:36.970
OK.

12:37.010 --> 12:41.900
And if you buy me for two hours OK then I will charge you $100.

12:41.900 --> 12:47.290
So this is like block block means that a single thing a single art this is defined here.

12:47.300 --> 12:53.010
If I just select it to be like months then it will be like if if someone buy me for one month then it

12:53.010 --> 12:54.160
will be $50.

12:54.200 --> 12:58.250
And if someone buys me for two months then it will be $100.

12:58.250 --> 13:02.570
This is how you can define it here and this will be called as a block.

13:02.750 --> 13:05.290
OK.

13:05.550 --> 13:11.250
So I have chosen here that the block will be on all the bases and if someone hires me for one arm then

13:11.250 --> 13:15.750
I'll charge him $50 OK and then I have the display cost.

13:15.780 --> 13:18.060
So this split cost means that how much you want to display it.

13:18.060 --> 13:21.900
So leave it as the floater that it displays like from $50.

13:21.900 --> 13:22.620
That's all.

13:22.830 --> 13:30.870
OK if you added like base cost as well like if you want to charge like service fee or like pay fee or

13:30.870 --> 13:35.100
like if you're using a Pieman gate feel like to check out and you can also charge you to check out feel

13:35.100 --> 13:39.210
like $2 extra you charge him for one single thing.

13:39.470 --> 13:41.630
So you can do that if you want to but I don't want to do it.

13:41.640 --> 13:42.330
I don't want to do it.

13:42.330 --> 13:43.840
I don't want to charge any extra.

13:43.860 --> 13:46.060
He's offering me and that's OK.

13:46.080 --> 13:51.590
So then to split costs be like 50 plus two and you can shoot it like 50 here and then then you can add

13:51.590 --> 13:52.870
it in the check out.

13:53.360 --> 13:54.420
But leave it as it is.

13:54.420 --> 14:00.030
I would recommend you do not charge them for base costs like for using your website or services and

14:00.030 --> 14:02.420
you can charge them for $1 if you want to.

14:02.460 --> 14:07.380
And this would be like block costs this would be like if you hire me for one or this she'll be $50 and

14:07.380 --> 14:10.140
then we have display costs you can display anything.

14:10.140 --> 14:15.030
But I would recommend you to leave it as default so it would be like from $50 and you can just hire

14:15.030 --> 14:22.670
me from so long like how you want to hire for one hour two or three are four or five hours.

14:22.980 --> 14:24.420
And then we have this range.

14:24.420 --> 14:29.430
So all merging rules will be applied to the bookings so this range is not recommended to use.

14:29.480 --> 14:35.380
OK you can use it distrained in the availability to not use it when he or she can be like 4.

14:35.520 --> 14:40.410
You can give a discount code like that so how this will work is that if we want to give discount.

14:40.530 --> 14:43.100
OK so if I wanted to be like date range.

14:43.110 --> 14:43.500
OK.

14:43.650 --> 14:46.050
So if someone buy it on Monday.

14:46.260 --> 14:46.720
OK.

14:46.830 --> 14:57.580
And the Monday's time ranges will be like if someone is buying on Monday and his time is like 5:00 p.m.

14:57.850 --> 14:58.190
OK.

14:58.310 --> 15:08.000
So let's suppose that it's time is 5:00 p.m. and his 5:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. basically since

15:08.000 --> 15:10.270
Monday is not is is a bad day.

15:10.400 --> 15:15.600
Ok Monday we get a lot of sales and a lot of customers so let's just choose it to be like Friday Friday

15:15.610 --> 15:20.930
when we don't get so much sales so if someone buys me or hire me on five.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.480
OK 45 p.m..

15:22.670 --> 15:24.080
OK let's just come here.

15:24.080 --> 15:29.500
You know it's like 2:00 p.m. Then his block cost will be equal still.

15:29.740 --> 15:30.170
OK.

15:30.170 --> 15:34.900
So we will charge him like oh look we will charge him 50 percent off.

15:34.910 --> 15:37.380
So he is going to go I'm going to divide it by two.

15:37.400 --> 15:46.070
So if someone hires me OK on Friday and his range is like from this to this then we will charge him

15:46.160 --> 15:51.290
like 50 percent after that has divided by the total price divided by two.

15:51.290 --> 15:53.810
So let's just go ahead and let's update and let's check it out.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.070
How this is how this works.

15:55.070 --> 15:56.430
OK.

15:56.840 --> 15:59.260
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to view the product right now.

16:00.520 --> 16:06.150
And now here we can see how this is looking so the person can hire me on Friday.

16:06.370 --> 16:06.910
OK.

16:06.910 --> 16:14.770
And if he hires me on 12pm then we charge him 50 if he hires me on 4 p.m. then we charge twenty five

16:14.770 --> 16:15.490
$25.

16:15.490 --> 16:20.130
The reason is that we are charging him for giving him 50 percent off so you can run a sale.

16:20.260 --> 16:21.420
You can run something like that.

16:21.420 --> 16:23.710
So hire hire us on Friday.

16:23.710 --> 16:28.570
So like you don't get so many customers like here if you just go to bounce.

16:28.620 --> 16:35.920
P.K. Bonsall thing about Karachi is basically here in Pakistan and vended don't get customers to run

16:35.920 --> 16:37.820
a sales so there aren't like that.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.070
You just hire.

16:39.070 --> 16:43.730
Sorry you just come here OK this is coming right here.

16:43.740 --> 16:46.400
Let me just go to Facebook dot com and I think they have the offer.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.890
Let me show you what they mean.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.590
And you can get the best example.

16:49.590 --> 16:53.040
So I'm just going to come here I'm going to search for like bounce

16:56.030 --> 17:05.750
so this is basically a company and they say that if you just protégées is a sock and percés a slot on

17:05.750 --> 17:09.370
Monday to Tuesday then you are going to get 50 percent off.

17:09.380 --> 17:13.820
So because they don't get they didn't get a lot of customers on that then that is why they're running

17:13.820 --> 17:18.740
the sales so I just saw that and I just wanted to show you.

17:18.740 --> 17:19.910
I hope they have it right now.

17:19.940 --> 17:20.210
OK.

17:20.220 --> 17:21.590
Yes this is the one I can see.

17:21.600 --> 17:22.860
I'm going to say.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.130
Let me just play this for you.

17:25.140 --> 17:31.920
It is.

17:32.140 --> 17:35.120
You can see his her piece 208.

17:35.260 --> 17:36.600
This is the currency of Pakistan.

17:36.610 --> 17:37.320
OK.

17:37.450 --> 17:39.770
You can see rupees 200.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.730
And the actual price is basically 400.

17:42.850 --> 17:49.510
So if someone comes here in this city they just buy it like from this you can see Monday to Thursday

17:49.740 --> 17:52.180
1:00 p.m. to 4:15 p.m..

17:52.300 --> 18:02.740
So if you want anyone to like be like Dan if anyone just wants to hire me on those dime I very I don't

18:02.740 --> 18:05.010
get so many seals then I can run a sale.

18:05.130 --> 18:08.560
So like I can rent a sale that you can get 50 percent off on that.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.630
So I hope this is a perfect example for you.

18:10.630 --> 18:12.030
This is the video.

18:12.530 --> 18:14.770
And mostly companies do actually around that.

18:14.760 --> 18:18.330
So this is the perfect example that you can add ETrade here.

18:18.340 --> 18:20.180
I'm sorry I'm just getting a lot of barbs.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.980
I just eat so much food.

18:22.180 --> 18:27.210
So let's just go ahead and I don't want to do that since I don't want to decrease anything.

18:27.220 --> 18:28.730
I don't want to run any of the sale.

18:28.870 --> 18:32.010
But if you want to run a sale it's a great way to do that.

18:32.230 --> 18:32.630
OK.

18:32.770 --> 18:37.380
And then we have the availability to say maximum booking per block.

18:37.420 --> 18:42.310
Obviously obviously obviously guys there should be one because there is no deal or there's just only

18:42.310 --> 18:47.110
one singled in the amount into the room and only be visible to one single people who can just offer

18:47.110 --> 18:48.030
him his services.

18:48.220 --> 18:52.050
So minimum bookable block bookable into future.

18:52.060 --> 18:53.130
So this should be zero.

18:53.350 --> 18:54.330
We don't want anything.

18:54.460 --> 18:59.950
So this should be like in future if anyone wants to be like a book like it should be one days in future

19:00.400 --> 19:06.850
and this should be like minimum future should be one month or two one two month into like if anyone

19:06.850 --> 19:08.430
wants to hire me.

19:08.500 --> 19:13.510
After two months so he can just go beyond that and if he just slight a fee if he don't want anyone to

19:13.510 --> 19:15.810
just go beyond that then we will restrict it.

19:15.820 --> 19:21.260
So if I just come here and I just refresh it OK and then I want to go ahead and I want to go beyond

19:21.260 --> 19:22.510
that so let's just come here.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.710
You can see I can not go like that.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.230
This is just like two months.

19:27.300 --> 19:32.810
A guy can just go ahead and he can just buy me any if I just selected to be like 0 you can see that

19:32.870 --> 19:37.170
today's the day today's 22 20 seconds sorry that is 20 seconds OK.

19:37.220 --> 19:40.350
And I have chosen that in future.

19:40.350 --> 19:42.950
Let's go to the availability and future.

19:43.070 --> 19:46.040
The blog bookable would be like one day into the future.

19:46.070 --> 19:53.880
So like he can hire me on the 22 at two I will not you can not hire me on 22nd which is Saturday.

19:54.070 --> 19:58.160
Today is like you have to me on the next day.

19:58.180 --> 19:59.730
So this is important guys.

19:59.860 --> 20:01.110
You should be doing that.

20:01.120 --> 20:04.060
But if you want to keep a zero you can keep it zero.

20:04.060 --> 20:09.550
And then you will see if I just come here and I just refreshed this and you will see 22 will be visible

20:09.850 --> 20:12.250
because people can't hire me today as well.

20:12.250 --> 20:18.820
So it would be so mess if I have to set my schedules as well because I have to set my schedule every

20:19.370 --> 20:22.830
booking will be here have to set my schedule after just be prepared.

20:22.840 --> 20:28.150
I have to be ready and I have to study his question that what is a problem to his thing and I have to

20:28.150 --> 20:33.400
do a lot of work as well so I have a personal life that is why I would recommend you if you are using

20:33.400 --> 20:37.270
that service then make sure that you just use it to be like one day.

20:37.270 --> 20:41.400
So if this is the same day that he can not hire you for today.

20:41.440 --> 20:45.040
OK so let's just go ahead and let's just say I like it to be like one day.

20:45.040 --> 20:46.630
You can also go and like one.

20:46.740 --> 20:53.240
So if only one single artist left than he can not hire you for one single Arald that is left so.

20:53.340 --> 20:54.810
I mean you can also choose to be left.

20:54.820 --> 20:59.790
But I would recommend you to stick with one name so that he should be like he should not be this 22nd

20:59.930 --> 21:04.970
one he should book 23rd which is a tomorrow so he can just start his book from that tomorrow.

21:04.990 --> 21:06.100
Not from that today.

21:06.330 --> 21:06.830
OK.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.790
So then we have maximum we'll him.

21:08.890 --> 21:10.030
This is two months.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.340
You cannot go beyond the tumor.

21:11.380 --> 21:15.130
You can also choose it to be like three four or five but it totally depends.

21:15.310 --> 21:15.680
OK.

21:15.820 --> 21:20.340
And then we go down we go down and we have all dates are available by default.

21:20.410 --> 21:22.360
This is now very important section guys.

21:22.360 --> 21:23.400
Please pay attention to.

21:23.560 --> 21:25.690
OK what I'm saying you have to understand this.

21:25.690 --> 21:26.120
OK.

21:26.170 --> 21:35.950
So basically let me tell you I will not be just like a fake from 24 hours I'll not be working 24 hours.

21:35.950 --> 21:40.220
There is some time where I will be working and I have to take office.

21:40.240 --> 21:40.630
Well.

21:40.650 --> 21:45.970
I will not be available on Sunday because I told you guys that Sunday I'm not free and nobody can hire

21:45.970 --> 21:46.320
me.

21:46.330 --> 21:47.530
This is the time from a Goldring.

21:47.530 --> 21:54.250
Sorry my friends whom I hang out hang out there and my family obviously I have to give give my time.

21:54.580 --> 21:54.990
That is right.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.780
So I want to be applied in here.

21:58.810 --> 21:59.580
How will I do that.

21:59.620 --> 22:00.090
OK.

22:00.160 --> 22:05.310
So basically we have to select like all dates are not available by default.

22:05.490 --> 22:05.910
OK.

22:05.950 --> 22:09.930
And then this will work that we have to assign that we've worked from this to this.

22:10.090 --> 22:11.890
And then all dates are not available by.

22:11.890 --> 22:15.760
Let me just select it and let me show you what I mean to say and I will do it.

22:15.760 --> 22:18.960
What I'm saying basically and then you will understand that what I am saying.

22:18.970 --> 22:25.540
So in the range first I have to say that from like nine to five I will be available.

22:25.620 --> 22:26.030
OK.

22:26.230 --> 22:31.040
So from nine to five you can hire me for that you can not hire me.

22:31.040 --> 22:31.530
OK.

22:31.630 --> 22:38.330
So this is what I mean let's just come here and we have to select like diamond range.

22:38.480 --> 22:45.730
So this will be like a date range but byme mandate he was Dave and as you said any range of Munns range

22:45.730 --> 22:49.480
of Meek's so you can't just hire someone on Beeks OK.

22:51.910 --> 23:00.010
And date range you can also add the ranges to be like I'll be available like let me show you from the

23:00.010 --> 23:02.620
time first and then I'll show you that date.

23:02.620 --> 23:03.030
OK.

23:03.250 --> 23:07.000
So first of all we have to just skim here and we have to like time rain so we have to just assign the

23:07.000 --> 23:13.150
time range that I will be working from 9 to 5.

23:14.660 --> 23:17.970
So it's like 9 a.m. is it 9am.

23:18.030 --> 23:21.320
I just have a lot of confusion so I'm sorry I'm sorry.

23:21.320 --> 23:24.790
So this is being me.

23:25.270 --> 23:25.930
It's OK.

23:25.940 --> 23:30.660
This is this is 9:00 a.m. So I'll be working from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

23:33.970 --> 23:35.850
OK and then this is bookable.

23:35.980 --> 23:36.580
OK.

23:36.640 --> 23:39.780
Anyone can just book me from 9am to 5pm.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.040
After that he can not book me.

23:41.050 --> 23:43.390
And before that he cannot book me.

23:43.530 --> 23:46.090
OK so priority is 10.

23:46.150 --> 23:47.860
I will show you what this is.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.250
So let's just get him here and let's just debate it.

23:51.040 --> 23:52.790
And let me show you what I'm trying to say.

23:52.800 --> 23:57.810
Make sure that this is selected as not available by default and then it'll be work you have selected

23:57.810 --> 23:58.170
like.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.920
All dates are available and it will not work.

24:00.920 --> 24:06.240
So make sure guys that this is checked like not available by default and now that I'm here in college

24:06.300 --> 24:12.880
just refreshed this so if someone is here we are first of all 22 is not available just because this

24:12.880 --> 24:13.750
data is available.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.770
This is coming but I can not select it.

24:15.940 --> 24:16.410
OK.

24:17.530 --> 24:23.710
So the reason is that because we have said to the minimum block into the future like it should be like

24:23.710 --> 24:24.850
one day after.

24:24.850 --> 24:25.920
So if I just select it.

24:26.200 --> 24:26.630
OK.

24:27.560 --> 24:33.690
And just like did arrogancy it says OK let me select 24:1 because it is just applying to whole 24 hours

24:33.690 --> 24:34.420
to that.

24:34.440 --> 24:42.070
So let me select just 24 ones and you can see a guy can just hire me from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. OK.

24:42.090 --> 24:44.860
So I am I'll be working these hours these nine hours.

24:44.880 --> 24:45.560
OK.

24:45.570 --> 24:53.060
If it's like 25 a guy can just hire me from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. if he's like 26.

24:53.230 --> 24:56.020
I can just hire me from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. OK.

24:56.050 --> 24:58.780
And he can also hire me for 5 pm.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.330
Sorry the selected block is not available.

25:01.410 --> 25:03.240
If he's like for that is available.

25:03.310 --> 25:03.700
OK.

25:03.700 --> 25:06.380
So since I'm working from 9:00 to 5:00.

25:06.620 --> 25:07.110
OK.

25:07.180 --> 25:08.250

25:13.570 --> 25:14.130

25:14.230 --> 25:16.130
So this duration is two one hour.

25:16.150 --> 25:19.910
OK if you just choose to and then he comes here any choose four.

25:19.960 --> 25:25.540
You can see it should say sorry this is not a verbal OK I can just work for four and five and six.

25:25.570 --> 25:31.820
My total time would be six if I if I just go ahead and say so like three then this is also available

25:31.820 --> 25:33.350
so he can hire me onward.

25:33.350 --> 25:35.210
OK this will be like apply to that.

25:35.210 --> 25:40.510
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to select on like I need zero RS If I select for our schools

25:40.520 --> 25:40.830
here.

25:41.030 --> 25:41.650
There will be no.

25:41.660 --> 25:43.540
But I can not go beyond 1.

25:43.700 --> 25:46.600
Ok so if it's like 5 p.m. I will not be available.

25:46.610 --> 25:51.240
Sorry the selected block is not available if you just go to 27.

25:51.310 --> 25:52.560
You can see this is also not available.

25:52.570 --> 25:53.580
If I just go to.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.630
This is available.

25:56.150 --> 25:57.800
So this is how basically it works.

25:57.800 --> 26:00.470
And I hope you guys understand what I'm saying.

26:00.920 --> 26:01.490
OK.

26:01.490 --> 26:08.150
And now I want to tell you that I need off on Sundays and they are not available otherwise my current

26:08.150 --> 26:13.310
has just told me that I need a break up so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to head Day strange and

26:13.310 --> 26:17.750
in here I need to go with that end of days.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.980
So on Sunday.

26:20.040 --> 26:20.780
Sunday.

26:21.090 --> 26:21.620
OK.

26:21.740 --> 26:22.870
I am not bookable.

26:22.960 --> 26:23.200
OK.

26:23.210 --> 26:27.460
And the priority is sit tonight because the priority will be like over it.

26:27.470 --> 26:29.720
So this should be like on Sunday.

26:29.780 --> 26:30.860
No one can hire me.

26:30.860 --> 26:31.730
OK.

26:31.910 --> 26:37.880
The priorities are to mine because it's rules with lower priority will override the will with a higher

26:37.880 --> 26:40.700
priority so that I am available all the weeks.

26:40.730 --> 26:41.310
OK.

26:41.330 --> 26:45.250
And it says that I'm look I'm not available I'm not available on Sunday.

26:45.410 --> 26:49.250
And the priorities that this is this will override the above one.

26:49.310 --> 26:50.450
This is the priority.

26:50.470 --> 26:53.010
So I'm just going to go out and I'm going out of date right now.

26:53.630 --> 27:00.190
Let's just come here and let's just reverse this so you can see this Sunday is now not coming so I'll

27:00.200 --> 27:01.440
not be available on Sunday.

27:01.440 --> 27:03.590
I can work for you on Saturday.

27:03.810 --> 27:04.200
OK.

27:04.200 --> 27:10.240
I can work for you on the 21st which is Monday but I'm not available on Sundays.

27:10.260 --> 27:13.830
If you go beyond that you can see Sunday is totally off track.

27:14.160 --> 27:18.690
And I can also do it like I was just going to here to availability.

27:18.690 --> 27:24.270
I also want a time range so on time range it should be like daydreams of a time

27:28.470 --> 27:31.910
range of months weeks at end of days.

27:33.260 --> 27:37.660
Date Range nine so you can select any of the day trains like how you won.

27:37.670 --> 27:38.960
How should I tell you.

27:38.960 --> 27:39.460
OK.

27:39.590 --> 27:45.950

27:50.480 --> 27:51.380
family.

27:51.380 --> 27:55.370
So I'm just going to like I'm going to Dubai or anywhere.

27:55.510 --> 28:00.980
But is the best place to go on the new year just because I don't like the fireworks but I actually like

28:00.980 --> 28:01.710
the s.l.

28:01.760 --> 28:08.360
I don't know why there are girlie jeans in my head because most people do say that.

28:08.450 --> 28:14.210
Mostly girls like the seal but I am addicted to seals to guys if anything is just on sale and it is

28:14.210 --> 28:17.900
like 50 percent off or at like 90 percent 80 percent or whatever.

28:17.900 --> 28:19.550
If it's 10 percent I'll just buy it.

28:19.550 --> 28:21.860

28:43.780 --> 28:44.230

So from a twenty fifth of December to the first of January I'm not bookable OK.

28:50.670 --> 28:53.310
And this should be the top of the line so this should be.

28:53.310 --> 28:54.660
They should override everything.

28:54.660 --> 28:56.040
This is the main important thing.

28:56.050 --> 29:00.800
I'm not one anything I'm going to select this date that I should override everything.

29:01.020 --> 29:01.350

29:45.300 --> 29:48.280
So I want you to please pay attention OK.

29:48.310 --> 29:51.610
And if there is any confusion then go ahead and watch the video from the start.

29:51.610 --> 29:56.730
Do not go like rewind 10 seconds 15 seconds 30 seconds to not just go.

29:56.740 --> 29:57.790
Everything from start.

29:57.850 --> 29:58.910
And watch this video.

29:58.970 --> 30:00.610
OK because this is so important.

30:00.740 --> 30:01.130
OK.

30:01.270 --> 30:03.400
And then we have everything it says maxim direction.

30:03.420 --> 30:06.120
OK so we were on the availability.

30:06.250 --> 30:06.640
OK.

30:06.820 --> 30:10.860
So since I am on this holiday that is why this is here now.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.980
And now let's add.

30:13.030 --> 30:14.290
OK so this is totally done.

30:14.290 --> 30:19.510
I don't think so that there is anything else so you can also restrict the days from here instead of

30:19.510 --> 30:21.950
this like I can select it like I'll be in it.

30:21.970 --> 30:24.600
I'll be working on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday or Friday.

30:24.760 --> 30:25.930
And I can just remove it.

30:26.290 --> 30:32.380
But I would recommend you do choose this one instead of this one that is going to select this and you

30:32.380 --> 30:35.200
can see it is how this is working.

30:35.440 --> 30:39.110
And then we have the attributes so an attribute chicken and anything.

30:39.110 --> 30:46.180
This is exactly like the wise old saying about the attributes of this is there is no link here about

30:46.180 --> 30:48.160
the attributes because there is no variation.

30:48.160 --> 30:51.460
So you you don't have to add the attribute.

30:51.460 --> 30:56.730
Now we have the advanced lab so you can just interpretational it like it would be.

30:56.740 --> 31:01.290
Thank you for hiring me.

31:02.080 --> 31:06.790
Looking for ready to work with you.

31:12.260 --> 31:13.870
Looking forward to it for you.

31:13.970 --> 31:14.470
OK.

31:14.510 --> 31:17.220
And then what I'm going to do I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going ahead of the.

31:17.510 --> 31:21.850
So now the main part starts and that is we are going to actually test that.

31:21.890 --> 31:23.420
If anyone buys it.

31:23.570 --> 31:23.870
OK.

31:23.870 --> 31:29.270
And the other guy is going to come here to our website and he's trying to buy the same date the same

31:29.270 --> 31:31.490
time and really be able to buy.

31:31.760 --> 31:38.860

31:38.870 --> 31:41.960

31:41.960 --> 31:44.100
