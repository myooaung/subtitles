00:11.420 --> 00:13.640
We will be moving on with our projects.

00:13.640 --> 00:14.090
OK.

00:14.120 --> 00:14.690
So let's get started.

00:14.690 --> 00:20.900
First of all you can see that I am in here and I'm the current user here and I am the administrator

00:20.900 --> 00:24.060
so administrator is the one who manages the website.

00:24.230 --> 00:24.630
OK.

00:24.770 --> 00:27.680
That's all I think I don't have to explain about this administrator.

00:27.680 --> 00:28.530
I am the admin.

00:28.550 --> 00:31.360

00:31.670 --> 00:37.930

00:37.950 --> 00:42.650
OK then every user must be registered and logged in to comment.

00:42.840 --> 00:47.460
OK let's suppose that this is selected and I am saving this.

00:47.570 --> 00:47.960
OK.

00:48.110 --> 00:53.830
And then a guy comes here to my website in a private window and he is not the user of my website.

03:14.810 --> 03:20.180
And then when he will just click log in you will see that he will be logged into our website too.

03:20.210 --> 03:22.390
This is how his website is.

03:22.520 --> 03:29.360
And now if you just go to the Web site right now and he just come here he go to the blog section and

03:29.360 --> 03:35.210
now when he will just come here to iTunes offers mobile apps development and then you can see that this

And then his can post a comment.

03:43.730 --> 03:44.090
OK.

03:44.240 --> 03:45.840
So this is how it's going to work.

03:45.860 --> 03:48.960
But the commande is first time he's commenting.

03:49.040 --> 03:54.620
That is why it is evading for moderation so this is how it is where again we have all these settings

03:54.620 --> 03:55.030
done.

03:55.120 --> 03:55.610
OK.

03:55.660 --> 04:01.930
And we didn't come here and I am now going to refreshed the list of users so I just refreshing.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.440
You can see that this is a guy right here.

04:04.580 --> 04:08.040
And here is the role of him that is coming right now.

04:08.210 --> 04:09.240
So he's a subscriber.

04:09.260 --> 04:10.810
He's just subtribe to our website.

04:10.940 --> 04:13.430
And then he can post comment that's all he can do.

04:13.530 --> 04:17.040
OK so now here if I just go to the dashboard a.

04:17.270 --> 04:17.650
OK.

04:17.780 --> 04:20.680
And then here you can see that we have just profile.

04:20.690 --> 04:22.990
And that's all the list of polls that are coming.

04:23.210 --> 04:28.370
And that's all we haven't given him the access so let's suppose that I want to give him more access.

04:28.370 --> 04:28.760
OK.

04:28.910 --> 04:33.370
And I want the rules to be like the contribution.

04:33.410 --> 04:39.520
So for the CONTRIBUTOR Well he can do he can post to our website so I feel just come here.

04:39.650 --> 04:40.770
He'll just refresh.

04:40.820 --> 04:46.670
You can see that he can boast and he can even get a contact remailed OK.

04:46.870 --> 04:54.280
He can conduct emails and he can also work with the common sense but he can not just work for this common

04:54.280 --> 04:55.510
he cannot approve it.

04:55.690 --> 04:56.200
OK.

04:56.440 --> 04:57.730
Again just go ahead to post.

04:57.730 --> 04:59.480
He can add a new post.

04:59.650 --> 05:00.210
OK.

05:00.210 --> 05:07.310
Like let's suppose that he want to add an impostor post by the con computer.

05:07.810 --> 05:08.130
OK.

05:08.220 --> 05:14.840
And now what he's going to do is can just not enter his post and he can not publish it.

05:14.970 --> 05:15.450
OK.

05:15.450 --> 05:17.340
It is submitted for a review.

05:17.340 --> 05:19.180
The reason is that he's the contribution.

05:19.200 --> 05:23.280
He's not the author if he's the author and he can publish it.

05:23.430 --> 05:25.890
But his post will now be submitted for review.

05:25.980 --> 05:26.310
OK.

05:26.430 --> 05:27.750
So you can just previews those.

05:27.780 --> 05:28.800
And this is this post.

05:28.800 --> 05:29.120
OK.

05:29.130 --> 05:35.280
Is posed by the contributor and this is posted by his guy and the Post is now actually submitted for

05:35.280 --> 05:35.630
review.

05:35.640 --> 05:36.620
It's pending.

05:36.780 --> 05:37.150
OK.

05:37.350 --> 05:40.620
So when I even log in I will see.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.850
OK let me just go to the dashboard.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.600
Let me just go to the main page.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.810
And now here you can see it's Hayes.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.820
The common dissolves for approving.

05:48.900 --> 05:52.310
And if I just go to the polls right now and then I just come here.

05:52.350 --> 05:54.670

05:54.690 --> 05:56.620
I'll just view it and I will just see.

05:56.630 --> 05:57.210
OK.

05:57.330 --> 05:59.480
His post is cool and his post is great.

05:59.490 --> 06:01.890
I'm just going to I'm here and I'm going to hit Post Published.

06:01.890 --> 06:02.300

06:02.520 --> 06:06.450

06:06.450 --> 06:08.990
That post is now published right now.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.970
And then I will just come here and just refresh you can see Tay's post by the contributor but the guy

06:14.970 --> 06:16.930
can not end it now.

06:17.080 --> 06:23.300
OK so this is how it works the country bhooter has the limited access and he can just post and post

06:23.340 --> 06:28.230
as published and this post is approved that he can not hated that so we have given so much access.

06:28.240 --> 06:29.350
We've given this much access.

06:29.370 --> 06:31.670
If you make it the author then he will regret it.

06:31.670 --> 06:34.500
But we're not discussing about the role OK.

06:34.590 --> 06:40.190
We're just over this so I hope that you have got the idea of how users work how you can get it and when

06:40.210 --> 06:45.330
you will be working over the social networking website and forums then you will learn how it works much

06:45.330 --> 06:45.790
better.

06:45.900 --> 06:46.260
OK.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.690
So now we're totally done.

06:47.690 --> 06:49.940
