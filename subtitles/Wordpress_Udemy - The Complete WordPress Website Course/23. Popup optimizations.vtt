00:00.640 --> 00:01.810
What is it guys and welcome back.

00:01.810 --> 00:08.440
So in this video we're going to be very king up with our this burden rate here so that if someone is

00:08.440 --> 00:13.900
on a mobile device he should see he should be taking to the page and if someone is on computer he should

00:14.170 --> 00:14.760
see a pop up.

00:14.760 --> 00:17.570
So let's go ahead and let's get at it with elementary.

00:17.650 --> 00:18.210
OK.

00:18.430 --> 00:21.740
And now here I

00:26.210 --> 00:31.040
want to come here and you can see dead on mobile.

00:31.250 --> 00:32.860
This is basically hidden.

00:32.870 --> 00:33.840
This is basically hidden.

00:33.860 --> 00:34.330
OK.

00:34.400 --> 00:35.670
So what I want to do.

00:35.810 --> 00:40.860
I just want to go ahead and I want to just hit it rigid.

00:40.970 --> 00:44.940
I basically want to copy this which I want to duplicate this widget so I'm going to come here.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.720
I'm going to hit this and I'm going to placate.

00:46.810 --> 00:47.710
OK so you can see that.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.280
Another one is right here.

00:49.520 --> 00:50.180
OK.

00:50.210 --> 00:55.970
And here I want this to be slash higher dash me.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.270
So like this.

00:57.410 --> 01:01.090
I want to go down and I want to do it with this guy right here.

01:01.130 --> 01:02.570
I want to come here.

01:02.570 --> 01:05.360
I want to come here to duplicate and this is right here.

01:05.360 --> 01:05.860
OK.

01:05.870 --> 01:10.450
And the first one should be having hash higher.

01:10.490 --> 01:11.960
That's going to trigger the pop up.

01:12.110 --> 01:14.870
And the second one is going to be higher than me.

01:14.870 --> 01:15.250
OK.

01:15.410 --> 01:16.700
So how this is going to work.

01:16.760 --> 01:18.700
We have to do some changes right now.

01:18.830 --> 01:22.840
OK so let's go to here let's see him here.

01:22.880 --> 01:26.970
And this is the hashtag High me that is going to trigger the pop up.

01:27.080 --> 01:27.540
OK.

01:27.590 --> 01:34.750
So for this we wanted to pop up to be triggered only on desktop and tablet.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.510
So this should be disabled on phone.

01:36.890 --> 01:41.760
And we've found the link to be redirected on mobile devices.

01:41.930 --> 01:42.380
OK.

01:42.380 --> 01:49.400
So this will disable this will be disabled on desktop and on tablet same like that we have to do this

01:49.460 --> 01:50.070
right here.

01:50.120 --> 01:50.550
OK.

01:50.630 --> 01:51.950
So let's select this.

01:51.950 --> 01:56.480
And you can see that this hashtag hire me is going to trigger the pop up.

01:56.480 --> 02:00.520
So this higher means should be disable on phone.

02:00.560 --> 02:00.980
OK.

02:01.090 --> 02:08.120
Let's get to here hashtag our height on mobile and this redirecting this is going to redirect slash

02:08.120 --> 02:08.820
hire me.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.720
Or you can enter the full UI trail.

02:10.770 --> 02:13.050
Basically I'm using the slash hire me.

02:13.070 --> 02:20.720
This means that if this is written in it and deal dot com and slash hire me add a slash hire me to my

02:20.720 --> 02:21.340
Web site.

02:21.530 --> 02:23.710
OK so this is basically used for that.

02:23.720 --> 02:29.550
So now what I want to do I want this to be only enabled on mobile device.

02:29.570 --> 02:31.290
Let's go ahead and this.

02:31.490 --> 02:35.500
This will only be enabled on mobile device or this will be hidden on desktop and tablet.

02:35.930 --> 02:43.890
OK let's go ahead and let's save let's get him here and let's refresh this page so on refreshing you'll

02:43.890 --> 02:46.310
see only one button is appearing.

02:46.520 --> 02:46.980
OK.

02:47.910 --> 02:50.010
Only one button will also appear right here.

02:50.010 --> 02:54.090
This is triggering this is triggering the What's this is triggering the pop up.

02:54.090 --> 02:57.570
You can see here hashtag higher means coming.

02:57.660 --> 03:01.090
And if I bring them out here this is triggering the pop up.

03:01.170 --> 03:01.480
OK.

03:01.560 --> 03:02.420
So let's click this.

03:02.430 --> 03:04.440
You can see that pop up is appearing.

03:04.470 --> 03:06.350
Let's go down and let's click this.

03:06.390 --> 03:13.310
You can see pop up is appearing OK if race just do this and I increase the size to be like tablet mode.

03:13.310 --> 03:14.780
I want to be the tablet mode.

03:14.820 --> 03:15.210
OK.

03:15.270 --> 03:22.970
So on tablet you can see that pop up is still coming and here as well pop up is going OK.

03:23.040 --> 03:29.400
And if it is the mobile device.

03:29.540 --> 03:31.220
So this is the mobile device.

03:31.220 --> 03:36.570
If I click here you can see that it is redirecting me to the higher rates.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.860
This is outrageous you can do unlimited Things Guys seriously.

03:39.890 --> 03:43.820
You can see that pop up will not be open on a mobile device.

03:43.820 --> 03:47.510
If I go down in a case like this it is taking me to the higher me.

03:47.510 --> 03:48.930
So this is how you manage this.

03:49.040 --> 03:55.990
You create Dubard and separately and one button will be visible for desktop and the other one bill so

03:56.040 --> 03:59.810
that the first Briton is going to trigger the pop up and the second one is going to do that.

03:59.810 --> 04:02.130
So this is how you can manage everything.

04:02.600 --> 04:06.270
So now we're totally done over the upside.

04:06.290 --> 04:06.610
OK.

04:06.620 --> 04:07.630
This is how we are done.

04:07.640 --> 04:13.070
Now we also have to make some changes to the dimensions right here so I want to align I want to assign

04:13.070 --> 04:20.780
this to be the services so I'll just add the CCS effect to be hash Service see him here let's go dear

04:20.930 --> 04:22.730
and we want to add this to be about.

04:22.730 --> 04:29.600
So I want to come here I want to just select this and this is basically set to about if I just come

04:29.600 --> 04:36.000
here to advance you can see that this Yesus ID is about I go down and this is the one disservice.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.930
So I want to game here to style.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.820
I wanted to go to advance and I want to add this.

04:40.860 --> 04:50.390
Assess what I can do about what I can do about this is this 80 should be service a CRV.

04:50.580 --> 04:52.800
Yes sir it says OK.

04:52.850 --> 04:58.860
And this should be follow EF 0 0 0.

04:59.630 --> 05:03.350
And this should be the call direction so we don't want anyone to call to action.

05:03.350 --> 05:07.920
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit save OK.

05:08.110 --> 05:12.320
And now I want to go to this guy right here and I want to go to menus.

05:15.910 --> 05:19.600
What I have to do I have to change the services.

05:19.670 --> 05:21.520
And on this

05:24.650 --> 05:26.920

This is how it works.

07:00.340 --> 07:01.930
So thanks a lot guys for watching.

07:01.930 --> 07:06.610
Still here we also going to do some changes to a little bit because it was not looking cool on a mobile

07:06.610 --> 07:06.950
device.

07:06.970 --> 07:08.570
If I just decrease this how has it been.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.500
I wanted the logo to be decreased Monch.

07:10.540 --> 07:16.130

07:45.220 --> 07:46.190
So here we go.

07:46.210 --> 07:50.370
You can see that it says font size so when I come here I want to select DeMaio.

07:50.590 --> 07:53.350
And on mobile the française should be

08:00.480 --> 08:02.450
as much on tablet.

08:02.590 --> 08:03.600
It is cool.

08:03.830 --> 08:05.290
