00:05.490 --> 00:13.950

00:14.010 --> 00:19.270
when it comes to SEO guys because WordPress will help you a lot and you've a lovebird press.

00:19.290 --> 00:23.110
After just watching these videos that I'm telling you right now.

00:23.250 --> 00:25.870
So I'm not just optimizing everything here.

00:26.010 --> 00:27.390
Create a double of that type.

00:27.500 --> 00:27.930
OK.

00:28.050 --> 00:33.100
I'm just telling you that how you will get a lot of help from the wordpress.

00:33.120 --> 00:36.670
But first I'm sorry.

00:36.720 --> 00:37.060
OK.

00:37.170 --> 00:45.770
So but first before getting started fitted we first have to look at that domain and web hosting.

00:45.950 --> 00:46.360
OK.

00:46.440 --> 00:49.210
So this is very important for a web site.

00:49.350 --> 00:49.770
OK.

00:49.950 --> 00:56.190
And before that we have to focus on the keyboard and what is a key word and how everything everything

00:56.190 --> 01:00.920
might be jumbling into your head and you must be like OK I want to know.

01:01.100 --> 01:01.530
OK.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.060
So what is a key word.

01:04.250 --> 01:04.590
OK.

01:04.600 --> 01:12.280
Like let's suppose that I want to build an online store for the shirts.

01:12.290 --> 01:12.660
OK.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.810
I want to do the business for a WordPress e-commerce site.

01:16.170 --> 01:22.860
And my main aim is to give the shirt or supply a shirt.

01:22.950 --> 01:31.800
It can either be like in my country or Canada to be like in my city or it can either be like worlwide

01:32.920 --> 01:34.400
OK so it it.

01:34.600 --> 01:44.590
Now if you want to do it in your own city on your or your own country and then I would highly recommend

01:44.590 --> 01:49.320
you to buy the domain name of your country extension like it.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.110
Like I live in Pakistan.

01:51.220 --> 01:51.800
OK.

01:51.820 --> 01:56.450
And here is really those Web sites come on the number one page result.

01:56.560 --> 02:00.030
Those who have the domain extension of the country.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.600
So let's suppose that I search for like

02:04.970 --> 02:10.000
buy laptops online.

02:10.370 --> 02:10.710
OK.

02:10.890 --> 02:12.930
Let's suppose that I searched for this.

02:12.930 --> 02:18.280
Now let's see which websites come on and I'm on page result so this is an ad basically.

02:18.720 --> 02:23.030
Let's just see it says Baia laptops online in Pakistan at best prices.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.250
It takes Telemark.

02:24.270 --> 02:28.370
So this is the first Web site we have here is the beacon.

02:28.590 --> 02:29.010
OK.

02:29.100 --> 02:35.520
So it refers to like if you want to business start a business in your own country then make sure to

02:35.520 --> 02:39.570
buy your domain name for your own country extension.

02:39.710 --> 02:40.070
OK.

02:40.290 --> 02:41.550
So like this.

02:41.700 --> 02:46.260
OK it is the first one is tell them or don't gate it's not tell them or dot com.

02:46.460 --> 02:46.940
OK.

02:47.030 --> 02:48.520
And we have I shopping.

02:48.580 --> 02:52.040
He gave the Nasdaq gave my Shabat pick it.

02:52.190 --> 02:52.810
OK.

02:52.840 --> 02:53.300
Clap.

02:53.340 --> 02:53.820
Pick it.

02:53.820 --> 02:57.260
Get like see dotcom that big case scenarios that it.

02:57.400 --> 03:00.770
Let's start it and then we have Amazon.com.

03:00.790 --> 03:03.820
And so we cannot compare them to Amazon.

03:03.840 --> 03:04.290
OK.

03:04.380 --> 03:09.880
Amazon is the huge company and they don't even just like stand with the Amazon.

03:10.020 --> 03:10.410
OK.

03:10.600 --> 03:19.890
So what do you see one thing that does my country said to Pakistan OK and whatever I'm searching google

03:19.890 --> 03:22.660
will give me the results related to my own country.

03:22.660 --> 03:27.750
So this is the power of the domain name that you have to focus on guys.

03:27.780 --> 03:35.190
So if you are doing business locally in your own country and then make sure to get your domain name

03:35.340 --> 03:38.140
that has your country extension.

03:38.160 --> 03:41.400
So if you are in the US you can go for us.

03:41.400 --> 03:50.040
So I think that for the EU Australia basically my brother lives in there and he had to just register

03:50.040 --> 03:55.800
a domain name so I was just building up say an Italian letter that I cannot register because I have

03:55.800 --> 03:59.250
to register a company there in Australia.

03:59.250 --> 04:04.580
I don't know why it was there and something like that because I was registering a domain name for that

04:04.590 --> 04:07.050
so it was a problem for me.

04:07.050 --> 04:14.670
So if you have a problem like your country that that country will tell you to register a business first

04:14.750 --> 04:19.440
via taxation and every information then I would highly recommend you to do that because if you do that

04:19.740 --> 04:20.760
it will help you a lot.

04:20.760 --> 04:25.490
Guys seriously if you have your country extension OK.

04:25.650 --> 04:30.350
So now basically how to get that domain name.

04:30.360 --> 04:38.700
So host Keeter will not give you that domain because the housekeeper works worldwide and it don't have

04:38.700 --> 04:42.730
much resources to give every country's extension domain name.

04:42.870 --> 04:46.060
So how you're going to do that tell about that you live and get us.

04:46.100 --> 04:46.540
Okay.

04:46.660 --> 04:50.110
And maybe searching for United States domain.

04:50.530 --> 04:50.860
OK.

04:51.060 --> 04:55.100
That's all I have to search and it's going to give me like free to register and to do it.

04:55.100 --> 04:55.990
So tell us about that.

04:56.030 --> 04:58.040
It's getting us to mean OK.

04:58.070 --> 04:58.960
Us.

04:59.370 --> 05:03.210
What is the domain of domain name registration.

05:03.210 --> 05:04.780
So is this OK.

05:04.950 --> 05:15.800
And so if I live in like UK UK domain registrar.

05:16.080 --> 05:16.560
OK.

05:16.760 --> 05:18.340
And it's going to give you like that code.

05:18.390 --> 05:18.900
OK.

05:19.020 --> 05:21.920
So this is most popular for UK.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.740
And so this is how it works.

05:23.770 --> 05:24.280
OK.

05:24.550 --> 05:28.200
And if I just search for anything then you can register.

05:28.210 --> 05:35.930
Open it up so the most popular predictor are that I'm telling you right now is cheap.

05:36.130 --> 05:38.940
The second one is like Go Daddy.

05:39.170 --> 05:43.310
The third one is ok I don't know.

05:43.390 --> 05:45.650
I just use the name cheap and they go ready that's all.

05:45.760 --> 05:54.310
And for the registration of the domain name here in Pakistan neither go that he supports Naar that name.

05:54.400 --> 06:05.450
So the PNAC dot com is the one that registers OK it is I think can I see that Nat can I see that peek

06:05.450 --> 06:07.630
at.

06:07.790 --> 06:12.620
Ok so I think this is the one and they will help you get the domain name for it.

06:12.650 --> 06:14.010
So if you want to register it.

06:14.010 --> 06:21.650
So if you live abroad here and you want to register a domain name for Pakistan then it'll cost you like

06:21.650 --> 06:23.510
$49 per two ears.

06:23.510 --> 06:23.930
OK.

06:24.020 --> 06:25.370
So this is I was going to work.

06:25.460 --> 06:30.260
So you can register a domain name for that and you can work with it.

06:30.530 --> 06:37.100
So I would highly recommend you to buy a domain name for your own specific country.

06:37.160 --> 06:37.600
OK.

06:37.820 --> 06:46.570
So now the second tip that I have here is that make sure that you have a brand name.

06:47.020 --> 06:48.310
OK.

06:48.710 --> 06:50.000
What do I mean by that.

06:50.330 --> 06:52.770
Let's suppose that I want to start a short business.

06:52.790 --> 06:53.190
OK.

06:53.420 --> 06:58.820
So I'm not going to be registering a domain name for like T-shirts dot Piquet discharged RPK is a great

06:58.820 --> 07:03.090
domain name but I'm not going to be registering and I mean I'm like buy T-shirts.

07:03.200 --> 07:08.630
So this should not be good would not be available because it should not be gay must be disturbed by

07:08.630 --> 07:09.520
someone else.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.350
OK.

07:10.490 --> 07:13.020
So this is how it's going to work.

07:13.020 --> 07:19.320
I have to focus on a brand name you can see Go Daddy is a brand name cheap is a brand name names is

07:19.320 --> 07:20.050
a brand name.

07:20.160 --> 07:20.850
OK.

07:20.850 --> 07:25.350
So this is going to work if I just search for like what we were searching laptops by online

07:30.380 --> 07:34.910
Ok then you can see that every domain name here is a brand name.

07:34.970 --> 07:36.480
There's Zarar.

07:36.490 --> 07:40.980
It's a Stella Mart backslap.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.330
It is eye shopping.

07:42.350 --> 07:46.940
It is my shop so I shopping seems like a brand name.

07:46.950 --> 07:50.420
This seems like a brand name because it's not an English word.

07:50.700 --> 07:57.960
OK so your brand name consist of English words but make sure that you of word kind of looks like a brand

07:57.960 --> 07:58.370
name.

07:58.680 --> 08:02.800
And if it is looking up say Valco huge anime.

08:03.090 --> 08:11.070
So now basically now we know how to work on a domain name that we want to start locally.

08:11.210 --> 08:11.690
OK.

08:11.780 --> 08:15.450
No idea but then I want to register a business.

08:15.480 --> 08:16.100
OK.

08:16.200 --> 08:21.480
I want to start a business you know and I have declined from all around the globe.

08:21.960 --> 08:27.360
If I have that then I would highly recommend you to go with a dot com domain name.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.960
Leave dot net dot net.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.500
Don't go with dot net.

08:31.610 --> 08:35.130
No doubt this type of stuff do not go with that.

08:35.250 --> 08:35.670
OK.

08:35.850 --> 08:41.820
Because dot com failed come on the top and people say that you should be choosing the domain name.

08:41.940 --> 08:47.580
Ok this might work sometimes but the majority is like dot com here.

08:47.580 --> 08:53.430
So if if you want to target all your clients from all over the world keep that in mind.

08:53.430 --> 09:03.660
Guys if two business are being run OK let's suppose that this is the guy who is running a business and

09:03.660 --> 09:08.160
he is doing a business locally and you are doing a business all around the globe.

09:08.160 --> 09:16.460
So if I live in a country of this guy who is doing the business locally and I just search here laptops

09:16.460 --> 09:21.110
buying online and you are also selling laptops and that guy is also selling laptops.

09:21.120 --> 09:28.050
But that guy has the domain name of the country domain name like he wants to target only Pakistan only

09:28.050 --> 09:29.210
Pakistan people.

09:29.310 --> 09:29.630
OK.

09:29.730 --> 09:31.510
And you want to target all around the world.

09:31.560 --> 09:40.140
Google will show the Web site that the guy who wants to target Pakistan people because his his his audience

09:40.200 --> 09:41.110
is limited.

09:41.330 --> 09:41.710
OK.

09:41.790 --> 09:50.270
So if his audience is limited then Google will give his site on top so keep that in mind and then move

09:50.270 --> 09:55.530
the dot dot com meaning so you can also go with like you register to domain names for your own country

09:55.530 --> 09:56.910
as well like.

09:57.010 --> 10:03.510
So if my brand name is D-Jack or something like that and then I can go to like D-Jack who dot com and

10:03.640 --> 10:08.680
I could pick it up could you what I can do just for three four five domain names at once.

10:08.780 --> 10:09.210
OK.

10:09.240 --> 10:10.830
And then I can build a web site for them.

10:10.830 --> 10:18.480
So if a guy just search for that specific domain name for a specific keyword like laptops buy online

10:18.690 --> 10:21.290
then he will see my website he will be redirected to it.

10:21.390 --> 10:21.730
OK.

10:21.900 --> 10:26.210
So this is number one tip that I'm giving you right now.

10:26.430 --> 10:29.970
OK so now we're totally done with that domain name.

10:29.970 --> 10:35.510
So I hope that you guys have got the idea of how domain name works and how you should choose your domain

10:35.570 --> 10:39.810
name Eisley in the next video you'll be breaking up into more tips.

10:39.810 --> 10:45.930
So make sure you keep these tips as very important because what I'm giving you they'll help you a lot.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.300
