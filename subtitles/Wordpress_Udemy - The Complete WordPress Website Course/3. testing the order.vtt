This is it right here.

00:29.790 --> 00:30.890
I'm just going to plug this one.

00:30.990 --> 00:33.240
And let's just said the product image.

00:33.510 --> 00:36.760
I use this edge because I am in the suit.

00:36.780 --> 00:43.590

00:43.610 --> 00:46.290
is why this is the marriage background of my cousin.

So this is the photo of that.

00:47.940 --> 00:51.910
So let's just come here and let's just have it so I'm dating it.

00:52.060 --> 00:54.270

Here we go.

00:54.860 --> 00:56.240
Hey this is me.

00:56.280 --> 00:58.310
So now you can see everything is here.

00:58.320 --> 01:01.050
And now we're going to do the testing of the product basically.

01:01.050 --> 01:07.200
So let's suppose that a guy wants to hire me on it on third off from 9:00 a.m. So he wants me to work

01:07.230 --> 01:10.340
for 9 p.m. and the booking cost is $50.

01:10.380 --> 01:10.850
OK.

01:10.860 --> 01:14.070
We have a signed dad here already for the per block.

01:14.160 --> 01:20.870
If I just come here and I'm just going to cost them and see we have facility the cost to be like $50.

01:20.860 --> 01:22.530
So that's him here.

01:22.650 --> 01:29.400
And if a guy is hiring me for 50 bucks like 9:00 AM OK anyones of work to be done.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.650
So I'm just gonna go hey I'm going to book now.

01:31.950 --> 01:34.410
So that guy has hired me for a 9:00 a.m..

01:34.440 --> 01:38.520
OK you guys can see how it ends the man has been added to your cart and he's going to go ahead.

01:38.520 --> 01:39.710
He's going to view the cart.

01:39.780 --> 01:43.860
It's his booking date is this booking time is this and duration is one order.

01:44.010 --> 01:44.510
OK.

01:44.910 --> 01:45.790
OK cool.

01:45.810 --> 01:48.290
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to just go down.

01:48.330 --> 01:52.860
I'm going to hit proceed to checkout so and the check out option I have to enter my billing details

01:53.040 --> 01:55.990
everything here and here it says A also.

01:56.010 --> 02:00.930
I've just checked the check payments so that I can just I don't have to check everything with Pal create

02:00.930 --> 02:02.790
a sandbox account and test it.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.670
So this is the check payments and the total costing is $50.

02:05.720 --> 02:06.660
Fifty bucks.

02:06.660 --> 02:07.890
OK.

02:07.890 --> 02:10.460
Now the guy go ahead and he just save the place.

02:10.470 --> 02:15.000
So I would recommend you not to accept the check payments only except baseball guys this is recommended

02:15.270 --> 02:19.500
if you want to have the credit card and you can go with it to check out there but did not go beyond

02:19.500 --> 02:22.180
that do not just accept bank transfer.

02:22.200 --> 02:27.060
In these stuff do not accept the guy seriously because the people will order and then they will not

02:27.060 --> 02:30.200
pay the amount and your time will be based.

02:30.210 --> 02:34.990
Now you can see that I have this check weighman matter just to test every order.

02:35.010 --> 02:35.490
OK.

02:35.580 --> 02:37.500
So you can see that the order has been received.

02:37.620 --> 02:38.150
OK.

02:38.250 --> 02:42.730
These are the order detail details higher booking number 19 and the generally.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.110
OK 2018.

02:44.130 --> 02:46.260
And it's 9:00 a.m. So I'm going to go ahead.

02:46.260 --> 02:47.460
I'm going to view my bookings.

02:47.470 --> 02:52.280
It is an Batesville IG and you can see the price is unbathed because I haven't received his check.

02:52.420 --> 02:54.220
The booking is this order is 20.

02:54.270 --> 02:55.410
And what he says.

02:55.410 --> 02:57.360
And so I will come here.

02:57.360 --> 03:02.700
He'll just go to commerce and Otter's and once he receives that check I'm just going to go ahead and

03:02.700 --> 03:08.790
he's going to just completed so on just talking complete you can see that the booking should be completed

03:08.790 --> 03:10.540
so you can see he's paid.

03:10.670 --> 03:11.160
OK.

03:11.280 --> 03:18.340
And I'll be working him on January 3 and from 10:00 a.m. 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m..

03:18.360 --> 03:21.260

03:21.280 --> 03:23.430
Now let's come here and let's get to the booking.

03:23.440 --> 03:27.490
So I am the admin and I'm using this dad who's booking are here.

03:54.970 --> 03:59.520
So now then I will set my schedule according to that.

03:59.520 --> 04:06.040
So now let's see if a same guy wants to hire me on that specific date.

04:06.270 --> 04:08.350

04:22.980 --> 04:25.630
Because another guy has already hired me.

04:25.680 --> 04:30.000
If I just go here and I just opened this up in incognito window.

04:30.210 --> 04:35.670

OK so I suppose that I want to hire him from like 10 a.m. and my duration is going to be five.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.660
So I can not go beyond that five.

04:56.660 --> 04:59.730
OK we have selected it right here in the edit product.

04:59.900 --> 05:04.660
OK if you just come here and we just go to the availability then he can see that we have added that

05:04.730 --> 05:05.020

05:05.030 --> 05:15.000
If he does go to availability I can see he's very cost that's what the maximum duration is set to five.

05:15.200 --> 05:15.710
OK.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.890
So this is we have already mentioned.

05:17.890 --> 05:21.650
So now here the guy is hiring me for five.

That can cost us.

08:04.200 --> 08:07.030
But he is just hiring me for five hours.

08:07.050 --> 08:09.740
OK so I'll be working him from three four.

08:09.810 --> 08:12.670
And on the next day this will cost us a lot more.

08:12.690 --> 08:13.910

08:54.690 --> 08:56.730

08:56.730 --> 09:01.570
So it's just Crossette and I can see the order has been received.

09:01.740 --> 09:05.020
The booking is this and he's just going to go ahead and he's going to view the payment.

09:05.130 --> 09:10.680
Is is going to be the booking so as is 3 p.m. to 8 8 p.m..

09:10.680 --> 09:11.160
The reason.

09:11.190 --> 09:16.980
Because the reason why is that we have selected dad for booking is held.

09:17.090 --> 09:20.570
Then the booking will be from that to that so you have to work on that time.

09:20.590 --> 09:23.880
OK this will be not available since I'm not available from that time.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.500
That is why I cannot manage it.

09:25.500 --> 09:26.040
OK.

09:26.130 --> 09:33.320
If I just come here to this right here and I just want to edit this product so you can see that we have

09:33.320 --> 09:34.330
mentioned in here

09:38.010 --> 09:40.120
the maximum duration and can be this.

09:40.140 --> 09:43.740
So you have to select it like this.

09:43.830 --> 09:50.550
I mean like you have to select air like five three so maximum duration can be only one arm and the person

09:50.910 --> 09:52.010
will stick to one art.

09:52.020 --> 09:57.090
But if you just select it like and if the guy hires you for five Rs then you have to work for him because

09:57.090 --> 09:58.670
the guy has hired you.

09:59.120 --> 09:59.620
OK.

09:59.880 --> 10:00.450
And

10:03.280 --> 10:08.740
so I can see that we're totally on middes and now in the next video I'll be showing you that how can

10:08.740 --> 10:09.690
you.

10:10.240 --> 10:18.610
So in the next video we learn how can we just enter a hotel booking room OK or people can just hire

10:18.670 --> 10:23.140
a hotel room and this would be having House person and house resources.

10:23.140 --> 10:26.000
So we'll be working up in that in the next video so stadium guys for that.

10:26.050 --> 10:26.800
And by.
