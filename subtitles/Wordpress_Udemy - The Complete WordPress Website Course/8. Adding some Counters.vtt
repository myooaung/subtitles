00:52.140 --> 00:54.170
I want to come here to the petting and I want to increase this.

00:54.170 --> 00:59.190

OK let's just come here and drop it free here so you can see this counter has been added but we need

02:18.030 --> 02:20.730
to enter some more counters to what I want to do.

02:20.730 --> 02:23.880
I want to come here and I want to just remove the widget.

02:24.330 --> 02:25.920
