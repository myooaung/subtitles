00:46.860 --> 00:47.990
how this looks OK.

00:48.180 --> 00:52.850
So here you can see that we have two tabs.

00:52.950 --> 00:54.390
The first one is the elements.

00:54.390 --> 00:56.700

01:12.270 --> 01:16.550
And here we have the add a new section and then we have the ad template.

01:16.560 --> 01:19.730
So we basically want to add a new section right here.

01:19.770 --> 01:20.300
OK.

01:20.340 --> 01:25.350
And we are going to assign or zoom that section as our header section.

01:25.400 --> 01:30.870
OK so I'm just going to hit this and I can see that it's a select your structure.

01:31.020 --> 01:37.440
So on clicking this at a news section it is asking me to select a new structure so I can go over to

01:37.470 --> 01:43.500
columns section and I can go with three columns I can go for a column or a here should be like one word

01:43.860 --> 01:48.990

01:49.110 --> 01:53.110
So I'm just going to go with the full column because I want to make the full length.

01:53.250 --> 01:58.940
So I'm just going to select this and I can see that this is the section that has been created right

OK.

02:14.550 --> 02:20.000
I'm just going to drag it and I'm going to drop it right here so you can see that it is.

02:20.070 --> 02:22.350
This is the heading element.

02:22.350 --> 02:22.890

02:23.310 --> 02:29.200
If I just click this this preview then it's going to preview this whole website.

02:33.720 --> 02:37.020
I'm just going to click here again and I want to change this.

02:37.050 --> 02:43.360
So I want to change this heading element to be my name because I want my name to appear right here.

02:43.380 --> 02:44.260
So it should be.

02:44.280 --> 02:47.050
And Ziel or mine.

02:47.160 --> 02:47.800

02:48.030 --> 02:51.480
And I want to change the style of fit.

02:51.510 --> 02:53.300
You can see that here.

02:53.370 --> 02:58.170

show me all the content right again.

03:08.400 --> 03:08.940
OK.

03:09.060 --> 03:10.550
And now let's understand this.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.600
This is basically the heading.

03:12.600 --> 03:18.240
This is the column that we selected that we need of one column and this is the whole section that we

03:18.240 --> 03:23.090
added so we can added the section we can added to this column.

03:23.340 --> 03:27.850
Or we can edit our this heading by just clicking here.

03:27.960 --> 03:28.430
OK.

03:28.590 --> 03:35.070
So if we want to change the background of this table we can change the background of the base if we

03:35.070 --> 03:37.450
want to change the background of this whole column.

03:37.470 --> 03:42.440
We can change the background of this whole column if I want to change the background of this whole section.

03:42.450 --> 03:43.590
We can also change that.

03:43.590 --> 03:48.000
So it totally the customization totally depends upon you and you guys are going to love it.

03:48.060 --> 03:54.190
If I want to make that changes to my title right here OK I'm just going to come here.

03:54.450 --> 03:56.750

04:03.750 --> 04:05.300
So this is how it works ok.

04:05.460 --> 04:09.330
If I just drink to it like this again I want to edit this section.

04:09.330 --> 04:12.110
I'll just come here and you can see that this is coming right here.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.530
I have three dabs.

04:13.650 --> 04:14.900
I have the content.

04:15.120 --> 04:18.240
I have the style tab and I have the advanced tab key.

04:18.270 --> 04:21.520
So in advance I can manage the spacing.

04:21.600 --> 04:22.980
How many spacing I want.

04:23.100 --> 04:28.320
How many spacing I want from bottom side and I can do the animation and about Chrome and stuff and in

04:28.320 --> 04:33.510
the style I can go with a text color that I biography the shadow and something like that.

04:33.510 --> 04:34.040
OK.

04:34.260 --> 04:37.170
So I basically want to change the text color.

04:37.250 --> 04:37.910
OK.

04:37.920 --> 04:43.830
So are you the type all graphy I want to change the font size or font type so I want to just switch

04:43.890 --> 04:44.940
it on.

04:44.940 --> 04:50.810
And here is the size that is going so I want to increase the size OK.

04:50.870 --> 04:54.020
And here in the family I want to select a font.

04:54.080 --> 04:57.410
So I'll just go down.

04:57.870 --> 04:59.290
So I have to select the form.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.080
OK.

05:04.960 --> 05:11.830
So choosing a fonde 40 or heading should be great because you have two options to choose your form should

05:11.830 --> 05:15.310
be eye catching and you can choose a signature type form.

05:15.310 --> 05:18.700
So if we have a signature of one.

05:18.780 --> 05:21.660
OK so this font looks great cookie.

05:21.760 --> 05:22.220
OK.

05:22.410 --> 05:30.750
I'm just going to increase the size of this OK and I won the vate surveyed is basically used for baldness.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.410
How much gold you won.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.700
So for vaid I'm going to choose this to be 300.

05:35.990 --> 05:38.030
You can see that the bowling is gone a bit.

05:38.120 --> 05:43.590
I'm going to choose 100 and this is much down.

05:43.590 --> 05:47.700
So we have to transform we can transform it to capitalize.

05:47.850 --> 05:50.220
We can transform it to upper case

05:53.290 --> 05:54.800
upper case doesn't look good.

05:55.060 --> 06:01.230
OK so I'm going to choose to capitalize one because the first letter should be capitalized.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.750
You can choose it like this.

06:02.750 --> 06:07.170
And then we have the style so we can go with the normal Telic and Blake.

06:07.180 --> 06:08.670
So I'm just going to go with.

06:08.710 --> 06:10.500

06:10.720 --> 06:13.320
I'll just go with italic and there we go.

06:13.340 --> 06:16.440
And now what I'm going to do I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit save.

06:16.440 --> 06:17.360
Once I'm done.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.810
So I'm just going to hit save.

06:19.160 --> 06:19.670
OK.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.990
And you can see that this is the title right here.

06:22.000 --> 06:22.700
It just coming.

06:22.850 --> 06:28.990

06:29.390 --> 06:30.130
OK.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.450
And here we go.

06:31.450 --> 06:37.640
You can see that this is the one that is coming so I can now manage this everything.

06:37.670 --> 06:40.390
This section right here this column right here.

06:40.430 --> 06:43.370
If I just come here and I just hit EDID column.

06:43.410 --> 06:46.060
We were just first editing this title.

06:46.160 --> 06:51.470
If I just come here and I had added column than here you can see that I can change the style of this

06:51.470 --> 06:56.900
whole column and if I just come here and I just hit EDID section then I can change the style of this

06:56.900 --> 06:58.110
whole section.

06:58.130 --> 07:01.230
So this section is being style so I can stretch this section.

07:01.370 --> 07:06.140
I can go with the content to be full of it and you can see that this is now changed to folded.

07:06.170 --> 07:08.010
So I'll just go with the box read.

07:08.210 --> 07:12.370
I'll just go read the column gap we have the hide Condon position and everything.

07:12.380 --> 07:16.100
So if I just go to style and then he can see that I have the background.

07:16.250 --> 07:19.820
So the box shown is we have the color right here.

07:19.850 --> 07:22.810
I can choose any of the color to be the background for the background.

07:23.050 --> 07:29.600
If I just select this you can see that this is the backbone that I have right here and I'm just going

07:29.600 --> 07:33.080
to come here and I can change the color of this.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.420
So I'm just going to come here.

07:34.550 --> 07:37.460
I'm just going to go with the text color and my text is going to be white.

07:37.460 --> 07:39.170
So you can see that this is how it is working.

07:39.260 --> 07:43.870
And when I click it you can see how this is working.

07:43.890 --> 07:45.070
So this is how it works.

07:45.090 --> 07:45.420
OK.

07:45.450 --> 07:52.230
Now I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit save and now in the next video Viiv we'll be adding a
