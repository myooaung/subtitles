01:47.030 --> 01:51.230
I want to come here I want to drag this testimonial and draw up a tree here so you can see this is how

01:51.230 --> 01:52.110
it's looking.

01:52.250 --> 01:56.810
So I want to change click Edit button to edit change this text.

01:56.810 --> 02:02.890
Lorem some color say it can see color adapting yield t a little.

02:03.020 --> 02:03.590

02:06.530 --> 02:07.840
I want to go to upload files.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.430
Now I want to get the picture of myself.

02:10.430 --> 02:11.250
OK.

02:11.390 --> 02:13.740
So this is my this is my picture.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.140
OK.

02:15.710 --> 02:23.060
This is not my picture of just recent picture but I know I look like OK just like that.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.880
So this is the Jondo.

02:25.490 --> 02:27.560
OK.

02:28.700 --> 02:35.110
What I want to do right now is that I want to just come here and I want to hate this this this.

02:35.200 --> 02:39.530
So when I come here and I want to hand this and you can see this is right here.

02:39.530 --> 02:43.060
So I think I shouldn't make it the full but I'm going to hit it it's action.

02:43.070 --> 02:47.200
I want to go to the box and I want to hit full with OK.

02:47.260 --> 02:50.080
We basically first need to fold this section.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.720
This is the whole section that that is making.

02:52.720 --> 02:56.620
So I want to hit this to be full length and stretch

02:59.380 --> 02:59.860
OK.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.880
Everything looks cool right here.

03:05.250 --> 03:06.320
OK.

03:06.500 --> 03:11.340
So now we are done with we're about section I think.

03:11.420 --> 03:12.210
OK.

03:12.410 --> 03:15.450
So now what we want to do we want to just save.

03:15.980 --> 03:16.330
OK.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.890
So this is basically the verbs say we're creating.

03:18.890 --> 03:22.830
I'll also show you that how can you build some more professional based let's say.

03:23.170 --> 03:23.560
OK.

03:23.570 --> 03:26.460
I also want to show you some more stuff.

03:26.780 --> 03:30.860
OK so let's go ahead and I want to change this physically.

03:30.910 --> 03:31.380
OK.

03:31.490 --> 03:33.640
I want to come here and I want to show you one more thing.

03:33.650 --> 03:39.050
Let's see I want to go to the advanced section and I want to go to the style basically and I want to

03:39.050 --> 03:40.140
go to the shape divider.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.810
So let's see how this shape works ok.

03:43.070 --> 03:46.430
I have this stop and this should be allowed.

03:47.490 --> 03:49.090
You can see how this is looking.

03:49.740 --> 03:50.270
OK.

03:50.340 --> 03:51.760
I want to go to this zigzag.

03:51.810 --> 03:57.900
So here this is right here or you can go to the mountains so Mountains looks good.

03:57.900 --> 04:02.550
I always use mountain my way to increase the height and

04:05.550 --> 04:06.490
this is the.

04:06.860 --> 04:09.350
So we can flip it as well.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.400
I think flipping is looking good.

04:11.540 --> 04:13.190
So you can see how well this is looking.

04:13.290 --> 04:14.960
I think I love this.

04:14.990 --> 04:18.550
You can see this is how the shape divider is looking.

04:22.300 --> 04:30.390
OK and basically you're just missing one thing and that is we need to focus on the color so we need

04:30.390 --> 04:31.800
to get this color.

04:31.800 --> 04:32.770
Exactly.

04:32.790 --> 04:40.370
I want to go to the vite and they think this is a bit of blow and this is why

04:43.820 --> 04:44.200
OK.

04:44.240 --> 04:52.710
So I basically want to tell you one thing and that is the color picker color picker chrome OK.

04:52.720 --> 05:01.270
This is basically a color pick a pick pick not pick this one color picker eyedropper.

05:01.330 --> 05:02.730
I think this is a plug in.

05:03.160 --> 05:08.890
This is the add on for Chrome that we'll just have to just drop it and then it will crop the color for

05:08.890 --> 05:09.720
you.

05:09.720 --> 05:10.450
So

05:14.500 --> 05:16.440
now just add this one color Zilah.

05:16.630 --> 05:17.780
So check this one.

05:17.780 --> 05:18.020
I do.

05:18.050 --> 05:21.460
What is the plug and I forgot the name of the plug in.

05:21.520 --> 05:24.070
So this plug in is added right here.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.340
OK let's shake this

05:39.510 --> 05:42.920
page a good active color picker.

05:48.590 --> 05:51.580
What does OK.

05:51.710 --> 05:52.680
Let's come here.

05:52.940 --> 05:54.810
Let's go to the color picker right here.

05:54.860 --> 05:55.700
And

05:59.540 --> 06:02.210
how can we pick that color.

06:06.680 --> 06:07.100
OK.

06:07.140 --> 06:07.970
This is the one.

06:08.090 --> 06:11.090
It is a this is how we can pick the colors I want to go from here.

06:11.280 --> 06:17.550
I want to come here to this section right here and I want to come here and I want to get active so you

06:17.550 --> 06:19.340
can see this is the color that is.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.960
So I want to just click this and can see that the color copy too.

06:23.100 --> 06:27.510
And I want to come here and I want to paste it and you can see that this is now totally same.

06:27.510 --> 06:29.770
So this is how this works.

06:29.820 --> 06:31.680
This is for Chrome only.

06:31.680 --> 06:32.090
OK.

06:32.400 --> 06:37.850
I'll just come here and I'll just sit cross so I can see that this is exactly matching like this.

06:37.920 --> 06:42.170
I want to go down and this is my work and say section and everything.

06:42.180 --> 06:45.290
So what I want to do I want to save right now.

06:46.230 --> 06:52.130
And you can see that my FEBE side is looking very cool.

06:52.170 --> 06:54.860
No one is going to teach you how to build this type of say.

06:54.870 --> 06:58.760
Ok seriously guys they just tell you that what is the word press is.

06:58.800 --> 07:06.540
And basically the main thing is the design of let's say OK design Medders a lot guys design matters

07:06.540 --> 07:06.910
a lot.

07:06.930 --> 07:11.670
If you see a website and that is not good in design what do you buy from them.

07:11.670 --> 07:14.520
No obviously no design matters a lot.

07:14.860 --> 07:15.310
OK.

07:16.150 --> 07:21.270
So now we have done with this section in the next video will be working up and more good.
