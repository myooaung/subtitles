00:40.780 --> 00:42.030

00:42.070 --> 00:43.180
And that's all I have to do.

00:43.180 --> 00:49.150
And let's just go ahead and let's view our website so you can see that we have our home about us blog

00:49.240 --> 00:52.030

01:07.270 --> 01:07.700
OK.

01:07.700 --> 01:11.740
We just have to work with that category and that's all.

01:11.740 --> 01:13.430
And then we're done with the blog thing.

01:13.480 --> 01:13.740
OK.

01:13.750 --> 01:15.180
You'll also learn about the common thing.

01:15.190 --> 01:15.550
OK.

01:15.560 --> 01:17.770
That is later part.

01:17.860 --> 01:18.130
OK.

01:18.130 --> 01:22.190
And then we're going to vary it and then I'm going to tell you about the customization of the website

01:22.470 --> 01:25.940
and then we're going to learn about the team and then the plug ins and that's all.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.210
Then we'll be working up with our project.

01:28.210 --> 01:32.290
So let's just go ahead and let's work with our dashboard.

01:32.390 --> 01:38.200
OK so I'm going to go to the categories like let's add the categories of the post so if you just look

01:38.200 --> 01:46.630
at the post then you can see that we can categorize it like the news room or like new events that we

01:46.630 --> 01:49.770
have or like a date or feature.

01:49.780 --> 01:52.380
So something like that so let's just go ahead in the post.

01:52.390 --> 01:59.880
You can see it has the categories I'm going to add this and you can see it says the taxonomy and this

02:00.110 --> 02:03.420
and it sees the add new category.

02:03.420 --> 02:08.590
And now you can see that here we have the list of all the categories that we have.

02:08.760 --> 02:10.240
OK let's just understand this.

02:10.260 --> 02:16.650
You can see we have this bulk actions and we have this Uncategorized and it has the count three.

02:16.650 --> 02:21.320
So if we just go ahead and we just open up all the post.

02:21.450 --> 02:21.940
OK.

02:22.090 --> 02:28.890
And you can see that these posts are under the category of Uncategorized which is to faultily created

02:28.890 --> 02:29.870
by word press.

02:29.990 --> 02:30.390
OK.

02:30.600 --> 02:34.460
So just let's quickly go ahead and let's rename this categories.

02:34.470 --> 02:39.070
I'm going to rename this category as like news.

02:39.510 --> 02:44.750
So you can see that I'm renaming this as news and I'm going to change the slug's slug is like what.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.600
OK I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit update.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.570
Now let's go back to categories.

02:49.590 --> 02:49.930
OK.

02:50.100 --> 02:56.850
So if I just view this category then I'm going to tell you what it is and how does it use for if I just

02:56.850 --> 03:02.900
go ahead and I just open this up I can see that it's a slash category and then slash the slug.

03:02.940 --> 03:06.620
This is the slug basically like Vu's this news.

03:06.660 --> 03:08.080
That is why this is here.

03:08.130 --> 03:14.460
If I just change this slug to be like a news room OK and then I keep it the need to be like news and

03:14.460 --> 03:16.190
then I just go ahead and I just updated.

03:16.380 --> 03:16.790
OK.

03:16.980 --> 03:21.350
And then when I refreshed this you will see an error like Page Not Found.

03:21.480 --> 03:23.840
OK you can see it says Page Not Found.

03:23.850 --> 03:31.870
The reason is that I have changed a slug and I have to add that in the news to be like news room then

03:31.990 --> 03:38.460
I refresh this you will see that this is now working like that because the slug is this which is you

03:38.470 --> 03:39.100
are now.

03:39.310 --> 03:42.440
And then I have the category which is news.

03:42.460 --> 03:43.980
And then I have these posts coming.

03:43.990 --> 03:49.690
So you can just categorize your posts and if someone view your post vid category like in the menu you

03:49.690 --> 03:53.050
can add that category and then you can just work for that.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.950
I'm going explain you this later on.

03:54.970 --> 03:57.970
But first let's just go ahead and let's add some more category.

03:57.970 --> 04:01.280
I'm going to go back and now here I'm going to add one more.

04:01.300 --> 04:04.580
So that is going to be like feature.

04:04.980 --> 04:06.620
And the slug is going to be none.

04:06.660 --> 04:08.870
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to just add this.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.800
I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit a new category.

04:12.000 --> 04:12.530
OK.

04:12.540 --> 04:13.520
This is added right now.

04:13.650 --> 04:13.920
OK.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.030
And the slug is already created from here.

04:16.110 --> 04:17.490
So I'm going to add one more.

04:17.550 --> 04:25.640
And that is going to be a showdown or like release press release OK.

04:25.800 --> 04:37.280
And then here I'm going to go to like press release like press Dasch release it's going to be like a

04:37.810 --> 04:40.940
slash category slash press release.

04:40.960 --> 04:41.370
OK.

04:41.520 --> 04:46.450
And let's go ahead and let's just head add new categories so we have these categories right here.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.490
Number one is the feature.

04:48.490 --> 04:49.960
The other one is the news.

04:49.960 --> 04:53.870
And so let's just go ahead and let's just set a new category.

04:53.890 --> 04:55.820
You can see this is right here.

04:55.960 --> 04:56.200
OK.

04:56.210 --> 04:58.370
And we have these count as this.

04:58.390 --> 04:59.510
So let's quickly go ahead.

04:59.540 --> 05:03.140
Well it's a sign these post to the feature and the press release as well.

05:03.190 --> 05:06.580
I'm going to go to the all post OK.

05:06.790 --> 05:10.350
And any here I want to make my.

05:10.360 --> 05:16.750

05:16.750 --> 05:20.540
category to be the feature and I'm going to check the news here.

05:20.620 --> 05:21.050
OK.

05:21.130 --> 05:22.420
And I'm going to hit.

05:23.050 --> 05:24.230
And this one.

05:24.310 --> 05:25.900
A thief got arrested by.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.940
This is going to be in the news.

05:27.970 --> 05:31.880
OK so this is the news and this hello world should be a feature.

05:32.110 --> 05:32.550
OK.

05:32.600 --> 05:38.280
Like it can be a feature or it can be like press release about from the hello world.

05:38.300 --> 05:41.560
I'm going to go to quick edit you can quick edited from here.

05:41.600 --> 05:47.390
Or you can just go ahead and you can hit edit from here and then you can see that it says the categories

05:47.390 --> 05:49.970
so here you can select to be like press release.

05:49.970 --> 05:53.220
And I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit a date and that's all you have to do.

05:53.420 --> 05:53.820
OK.

05:53.950 --> 06:00.080
And now when we go to the categories and then just the first page you can see that every post they'll

06:00.080 --> 06:02.550
be assigned 1 1 1.

06:02.840 --> 06:10.730
OK so any category like I give you to feature OK you can see this is the category feature and the category

06:10.730 --> 06:14.320
feature has just one single post and that is coming here.

06:14.510 --> 06:17.780
So this is how you can basically create these categories.

06:17.780 --> 06:25.900
Now you can add unlimited posed to the category so for a feature like you can add like Eitan Ziel now

06:29.150 --> 06:35.250
offers mobile apps development OK.

06:35.320 --> 06:39.000
And then here you can add the alarm of some content.

I'm going to add that I'm just going to go to the dot.com slash feed's slash each team.

06:45.930 --> 06:47.850
And then here is the content I'm going to go ahead.

06:47.850 --> 06:49.960
I'm going to quickly just copy this.

06:50.130 --> 06:53.750

06:59.220 --> 07:05.850
you have to just go ahead and you have to publish and you can see that we have now published our categories

07:11.790 --> 07:13.650

07:13.650 --> 07:19.280
And I didn't allow offers of web development and every category is coming right here.

07:19.300 --> 07:22.320
OK so now we're totally done with the category stuff.

07:22.320 --> 07:26.950
Now for the category you can add these categories in your menus.

07:26.970 --> 07:27.370
OK.

07:27.480 --> 07:31.920
How are you going to do that so you can add it like if you go to dashboard Let's suppose that you want

07:31.920 --> 07:36.480
to create a big blog and you want to work with it so if you want to add the link of the categories into

07:36.480 --> 07:38.160

07:38.260 --> 07:43.010
So here you have to select to be like categories and these are the categories that are coming.

07:43.010 --> 07:46.020
So let's suppose that I want to add feature props and everything.

07:46.030 --> 07:49.290
So let me just tell you one more thing.

07:49.530 --> 07:53.010
