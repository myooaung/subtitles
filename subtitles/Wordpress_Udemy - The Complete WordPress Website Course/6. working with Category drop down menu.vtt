Let's just go to the blog right here and let's go to the dashboard right here and we need to hit menus

00:09.360 --> 00:10.730

I'm going to go to menus and make sure that you go ahead and create a new menu.

00:14.910 --> 00:17.730
You can see that I have created a menu with the body you won.

00:17.880 --> 00:18.350
OK.

00:18.360 --> 00:21.410
And then here first I want to add them to the home page.

00:21.960 --> 00:25.990
So I'm going to get you all right here and see all these pages are coming here.

00:26.100 --> 00:28.260
So first of all I'm going to add home page.

00:28.500 --> 00:28.830
OK.

00:28.920 --> 00:30.940
And then I'm going to add the categories.

00:30.960 --> 00:36.130

00:58.260 --> 00:58.850

I'm going to go ahead.

01:05.220 --> 01:10.260
I'm going to select primary menu and I'm going to hit save menu and you can see this menu should be

01:10.260 --> 01:13.320
applied to our primary menu.

01:13.320 --> 01:17.610
Let's just go to this right here and you can see how this is looking so we have time line and here we

01:17.610 --> 01:23.100

I can show the categories.

01:37.920 --> 01:38.340
OK.

01:38.340 --> 01:41.550
So you probably might be wondering why they're not here and how we can add it.

01:41.550 --> 01:44.710
So this is so easy guys this is so easy.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.400
You just have to go ahead you have to click menus.

01:48.310 --> 01:48.640
OK.

01:48.640 --> 01:53.890
And then you have to come here to the categories so this will work only on the category pages you have

01:53.890 --> 01:59.980
to select this people reviews and then it says Ekstrom megaman you have come here and then you can say

02:00.280 --> 02:02.120
Mangere menu tree feature.

02:02.290 --> 02:07.140
You can come here and then you can click here megaman you've UBid three featured mega menu two featured

02:07.150 --> 02:08.810
and recent list in the apple.

02:08.980 --> 02:14.620
And then we have the blogging tips so we select mega menu list here.

02:14.650 --> 02:16.260
So we have selected both of them.

02:16.330 --> 02:16.960
OK.

02:17.080 --> 02:17.830
All three of them.

02:17.830 --> 02:20.180
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit save too many.

02:20.380 --> 02:22.960
And you can see this must be added to the menu.

02:22.960 --> 02:28.870
Let's have a look at them and how they look and how they enhanced look at our Web site so if I just

02:28.870 --> 02:30.300
come here to people reviews.

02:30.400 --> 02:35.220
You can see they're kind of like there's Chando is trade guy who to me is the best online platform.

02:35.220 --> 02:39.750
And then we have the dealer Romanies the best writing instructor and you're to me on you and me.

02:39.790 --> 02:45.380
So then I have the applause so we have featured right here you can see why you need to shift to us and

02:45.370 --> 02:51.550
then us bug fixes and then if I have one more in the Apple category it's going to appear right here.

02:51.550 --> 02:56.440
So since they were appearing we don't have any one else in that category that is why this is not appearing

02:56.440 --> 02:57.560
in the recent tap.

02:57.730 --> 03:02.560
So like this let's just go to blogging tips and you can see that in the blogging tips we don't have

03:02.650 --> 03:03.370
any added.

03:03.370 --> 03:08.440
So if he if he go replugging tips he can see that we have Megami annual list.

03:08.440 --> 03:11.270

03:11.290 --> 03:11.820
OK.

03:11.890 --> 03:14.350
So you can see that we don't have any added right here.

03:14.440 --> 03:16.500

03:36.190 --> 03:40.380

04:01.750 --> 04:03.940
tips and this is also showing the feature run.

04:03.940 --> 04:07.800
So since we don't have anything else right here that is why we cannot add it.

04:07.810 --> 04:12.820
