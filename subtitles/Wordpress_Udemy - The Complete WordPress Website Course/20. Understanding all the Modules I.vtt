WEBVTT

00:00.650 --> 00:05.880
What is going on Zamalka Markson out in this video feed will be working with all the Amadeo.

00:05.900 --> 00:06.440
OK.

00:06.440 --> 00:12.690
So this video is going to be so amazing because we're going to learn every day rebuilder Madill and

00:12.720 --> 00:18.170
this because it is really very important to understand everything that DV offers.

00:18.170 --> 00:18.500
OK.

00:18.620 --> 00:22.480
So I just wanted to show you how professional web sites are built.

00:22.490 --> 00:28.180
You guys know how Hetter works how blurbed model works how Call to Action works How about and works

00:28.220 --> 00:29.670
how these blurbed works.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.340
And these reviews and everything.

00:31.460 --> 00:37.190
So I tried my best to explain each and everything but obviously when we are creating a website we do

00:37.190 --> 00:38.500
not use everything.

00:38.570 --> 00:44.970
OK so I'm going to explain you everything that comes of it the TV builder module so that it looks good.

00:45.080 --> 00:45.640
And that's all.

00:45.710 --> 00:46.070
OK.

00:46.130 --> 00:46.880
So let's get started.

00:46.880 --> 00:52.340
First of all I have to just go to Ray here and I want to create a page so I'm just going to create a

00:52.340 --> 00:57.150
page in there and I'm going to name that page as all muddy fields.

00:57.160 --> 00:57.710
OK.

00:58.880 --> 01:01.190
All modules.

01:01.240 --> 01:01.650
OK.

01:01.690 --> 01:05.560
So here in this page we're basically going to be working with

01:08.470 --> 01:10.010
all the modules of the Dewey.

01:10.150 --> 01:13.720
So I'm just going to go there and I'm going to hit publish and you can see this page is going to be

01:13.720 --> 01:14.260
published.

01:14.380 --> 01:16.460
Now I'm going to go to the builder.

01:16.480 --> 01:20.470
And now here we're going to be working out for the builder and we're going to move forward.

01:20.500 --> 01:21.800
I'm just going to hit the builder.

01:21.820 --> 01:26.770
I'm going to use visual builder and it's going to take us to that page where we can and it did.

01:26.770 --> 01:31.300
So let's go to the first of all we need to start up the full width and then we're going to be working

01:31.300 --> 01:33.330
a bit more simultaneously.

01:33.340 --> 01:34.160
OK.

01:34.930 --> 01:37.740
So here let's come here and you can see the full width.

01:37.780 --> 01:41.200
So you guys already know about the full width code here what you can do.

01:41.210 --> 01:47.620
You can add anything that you want to add in a contact so you can add anything like HVM code so you

01:47.620 --> 01:50.150
can pretty well just get any HDMI code.

01:50.170 --> 01:55.650
If I just read each slider each t male.

01:55.800 --> 01:56.430
OK.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.970
And here it is

02:03.190 --> 02:06.870
and it's going to come here I'm going to copy all this.

02:06.920 --> 02:07.420
OK.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.080
So if I just copy

02:14.180 --> 02:22.830
everything from here and copy it I come here and I paste it you'll see a slideshow is coming like this.

02:22.830 --> 02:23.290
OK.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.400
So this is the slide show that is working.

02:25.590 --> 02:29.810
So you can pretty well at any of the each TNL code in this if you want to.

02:29.820 --> 02:34.630
But since we're not here for coding I think that we will not be moving up with this.

02:34.650 --> 02:37.920
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to come here and I'm going to delete this section.

02:37.920 --> 02:41.030
Now let's come here and let's come here again and let's get in here with the full.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.300
So we have the full header.

02:42.330 --> 02:49.060
We have already designed the full width header on that home page the full length image for the same.

02:49.170 --> 02:54.170
Ok what you have to do you have to just here the bag you just have to just come here to the image.

02:54.190 --> 02:57.350
OK let's upload and let's upload to you can upload any image.

02:57.390 --> 03:02.520
If I just uploaded and then I had upload image you can see this is just the image that is coming and

03:02.520 --> 03:07.920
you cannot add anything else if you want to upload any image you can upload that image and that's all

03:08.100 --> 03:09.610
that you can do anything.

03:11.110 --> 03:14.340
So that is why this is a useless function that DV has added.

03:14.460 --> 03:15.300
OK.

03:15.340 --> 03:20.320
I'm sorry but he says they use this function but some of the Web sites uses this.

03:20.560 --> 03:25.270
If you are creating a photography based Web site then you have to show some images full of images then

03:25.270 --> 03:25.930
you can go with that.

03:25.930 --> 03:28.030
So I think it is cool.

03:28.120 --> 03:28.560
OK.

03:28.570 --> 03:29.900
And then we have the full width map.

03:29.950 --> 03:35.340
We have also used this full with mabbe on the Contact page so we don't have to use it again.

03:35.500 --> 03:36.910
Let's just say delete again.

03:36.910 --> 03:39.550
Let's come here and let's come here to the fullest OK.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.790
And then we have the full width menu.

03:42.250 --> 03:44.240
You can show the full width menu if you want to.

03:44.350 --> 03:49.160
You can see the menu one is coming right here and if I choose it you can see this menu is coming up

03:49.160 --> 03:51.920
pray here so you can just design this menu.

03:51.970 --> 03:54.160
You can come here to the bar Krown you can design it.

03:54.190 --> 03:56.350
You can see how you want to design it.

03:56.350 --> 04:00.050
You can design it too if I just change it's like here you can see.

04:00.070 --> 04:02.060
And then I go to the design right here.

04:02.170 --> 04:07.060
I go to the lengths Ray here and then I can make the colors actively colors are going to be this my

04:07.060 --> 04:13.600
dropdown menu color my mobile menu color and I can go over the text colors and text colors basically

04:13.600 --> 04:14.570
going to be a light.

04:14.590 --> 04:18.030
You can see how this is looking and then I go here I go to the layout.

04:18.070 --> 04:20.140
You can see some menu opens downward.

04:20.140 --> 04:22.150
Make menu links full.

04:22.690 --> 04:24.320
So the menu links will be full.

04:24.340 --> 04:25.320
If you want to do it.

04:25.450 --> 04:26.020
OK.

04:26.050 --> 04:31.660
And then we have the menu text you can change how you want the menu text size to be so you can increase

04:31.660 --> 04:33.950
it to create and manage it.

04:33.970 --> 04:38.730
OK I'm going to come here and you can how must somehow manage the sizing of this.

04:38.800 --> 04:43.780
You can decrease the size of this and you can see how this menu is looking to get a line to center as

04:43.780 --> 04:44.070
well.

04:44.140 --> 04:44.540
OK.

04:44.650 --> 04:49.160
So this is basically called a full manual if you want to create a full with menu.

04:49.180 --> 04:50.030
You can create it.

04:50.110 --> 04:50.670
Let's come here.

04:50.710 --> 04:55.930
Let's the selected and let's just basically come here to the full it again and then we have the full

04:56.040 --> 04:57.380
support for you.

04:57.490 --> 05:03.130
I'm going to show you portfolio later on in the upcoming video because we have a complete section for

05:03.160 --> 05:08.910
portfolio and portfolios are important in explaining what portfolio is and everything.

05:08.960 --> 05:09.430
Okay.

05:09.550 --> 05:11.220
And then we have the full report slider.

05:11.230 --> 05:16.540
So you can just add this how this ball slider is going to come in that if you have a blog post then

05:16.540 --> 05:18.570
this is how the post slider will appear.

05:18.690 --> 05:19.150
OK.

05:19.210 --> 05:22.370
It is going to show all the post-edit you have in your blog.

05:22.540 --> 05:26.900
And this is how they're going to appear so you can see that I have the full with the hello world post.

05:27.060 --> 05:27.540
OK.

05:27.700 --> 05:31.210
This is how it is working if I have so many posts in my blog.

05:31.210 --> 05:33.520
You guys already know about how blog works.

05:33.540 --> 05:35.980
OK so I don't have to tell you again.

05:36.100 --> 05:40.060
The featured image will be the background image since we have no featured image that is why this is

05:40.060 --> 05:40.610
coming.

05:40.630 --> 05:46.270
Then here is the title here is by 10 Ziller am on this post and then we have the date that category

05:46.270 --> 05:47.830
we have and the common as well.

05:47.920 --> 05:51.300
And then here is the excerpt that is coming in then here is the read more.

05:51.300 --> 05:52.830
But and so this is how you can work.

05:52.830 --> 05:56.280
You can add the full cost if you want to.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.480
OK so let's come here down below.

05:59.240 --> 06:00.190
And let's Hedman more.

06:00.190 --> 06:06.010
I'm going to go down in here and have the full post title so I can add a post title if I want to you

06:06.010 --> 06:06.520
can come.

06:06.520 --> 06:09.830
You can see here the Amadeo that is coming and bite and zeal.

06:09.910 --> 06:13.610
I can come here to the elements I can remove this if I don't want to show this.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.600
Mean I can show the matter if I want to.

06:15.730 --> 06:17.900
I can show the author I can disable the otter.

06:18.040 --> 06:23.650
And this is how I can add the full posts in and you can see this is below titled as above.

06:23.650 --> 06:26.270
Title and everything like this.

06:26.270 --> 06:30.400
So I'm just going to come in here and I'm going to hit delete and let's come here and tell you this

06:30.400 --> 06:34.660
as well so you can show the full with tail but I don't think so.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.670
If this is much important.

06:36.670 --> 06:39.980
OK and then the last we have is the full slider.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.160
So this is basically use as the exception for Hetter if you don't.

06:44.200 --> 06:48.990
If you want to add a slider instead of a header you can do that how you will do that.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.260
You just have to come here.

06:50.290 --> 06:55.900
You just have to come here and you basically have to add the images to make sure that your images are

06:56.140 --> 07:01.060
of the same size and telling you again do not add the multiple times images.

07:01.060 --> 07:03.120
Make sure that your images are the same size.

07:03.130 --> 07:06.810
So let me come here and you can see I have a new slide right here.

07:06.820 --> 07:07.770
I'm going to come here.

07:07.870 --> 07:11.640
I'm going to go to the backroom and here in the backroom.

07:11.650 --> 07:15.380
I want to select any image so let's suppose I select a gradient effect first.

07:15.410 --> 07:22.790
OK this is a gradient effect that I have right now and I'm just going to come here and I'm going to

07:22.790 --> 07:24.660
go to the text right here.

07:24.680 --> 07:35.890
So let's say the text right here and this will be this is my slider heading OK.

07:35.950 --> 07:37.050
And then I have the button.

07:37.060 --> 07:44.370
So burden go is here.

07:44.520 --> 07:44.940
OK.

07:44.980 --> 07:46.150
And then I have the content.

07:46.210 --> 07:48.370
So I have to enter content

07:51.650 --> 07:53.960
goes here.

07:53.990 --> 07:56.410
OK this is out as you can see.

07:56.450 --> 07:58.350
This is looking pretty amazing.

07:58.550 --> 07:58.910
OK.

07:58.970 --> 08:03.710
That I can work with the design I can add overlay if I have any image you can see I can add a background

08:03.710 --> 08:08.520
overlay to this I can add a text overlay found want to see you can see how this is.

08:08.690 --> 08:09.350
I can.

08:09.370 --> 08:10.560
I can make pretty well change.

08:10.560 --> 08:15.450
You can see I can make it a little bit more darker from one two and I can see how this is so I want

08:15.460 --> 08:17.560
to just make it a little bit more here.

08:17.560 --> 08:22.340
So this is visible so you can see this is my first I'm just going to come here and it's going to disable

08:22.340 --> 08:27.560
this and you could see how this is I can just go to the image I can go to the text I can make some changes

08:27.590 --> 08:32.490
I can give some batting I can give some line height so that this does not stick here.

08:32.570 --> 08:36.260
So I'm just going to I'm here I'm going to add the line Heidi you can see how this line height is working

08:38.470 --> 08:38.990
OK.

08:39.050 --> 08:39.620
So I'm like this.

08:39.630 --> 08:43.350
I'm going to come here and make sure that you just come here and then you get it.

08:43.350 --> 08:46.470
So you just get it you can see two sliders are right here.

08:46.470 --> 08:48.520
I'm just going to come here in the next Slider.

08:48.600 --> 08:52.700
I'm going to add instead of the background image that creates an effect.

08:52.800 --> 08:53.970
I'm going to add a background image.

08:53.980 --> 08:56.570
I'm going to come here I'm going to choose any image right here.

08:56.580 --> 08:59.500
So let's suppose if I choose this image I'm going to hit upload image.

08:59.550 --> 09:04.800
You can see if I just come here this is my slider heading you can see how this slider is looking.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.780
The slider is looking so amazing.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.360
I can also choose the parallax effect.

09:08.370 --> 09:12.400
So you can see if I just move this you can see how this image is moving.

09:12.510 --> 09:16.320
But I will not use this on the slider because on slider it doesn't look much better.

09:16.350 --> 09:18.410
So now I'm going to come back again.

09:18.570 --> 09:23.760
I'm just going to duplicate it and duplicate it so I can choose pretty more images.

09:23.760 --> 09:24.710
I'm going to go from here.

09:24.900 --> 09:27.450
I'm going to choose a different image right here for this image.

09:27.450 --> 09:28.510
I'm going to choose this image.

09:28.560 --> 09:29.460
I'm going to choose it.

09:29.480 --> 09:29.880
OK.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.260
And then I come here we can see how it's going to look.

09:34.530 --> 09:38.070
This burden is not appearing so if this is not appearing I'm going to go to the design right here I'm

09:38.070 --> 09:42.090
going to go to the background overlay and I'm going to apply it so you can see this is also coming totally

09:42.090 --> 09:42.670
ok.

09:42.750 --> 09:46.890
I'm going to come here I'm going to go to this one for it's one I'm going to go to the background right

09:46.890 --> 09:48.280
here and I'm going to choose a different name.

09:48.290 --> 09:51.200
So I'm going to choose this image right here.

09:51.270 --> 09:51.810
OK.

09:51.820 --> 09:54.300
Let's upload and let's go to this image.

09:54.330 --> 09:55.130
Let's click here.

09:56.210 --> 10:00.730
And you can see this is how it is looking so if it doesn't work you can change the color of the button.

10:00.830 --> 10:04.280
And if you want to add an overlay You can also add the overall layer.

10:04.280 --> 10:06.390
So this is also looking pretty well.

10:06.410 --> 10:07.590
OK let's come here.

10:07.610 --> 10:10.790
Let's go back here and let's to choose the last one.

10:10.820 --> 10:11.200
OK.

10:11.240 --> 10:15.140
Let's come here to the background so you have two in the back room you have to add the background image

10:15.140 --> 10:16.480
OK.

10:17.330 --> 10:21.390
I'm going to add this one right here.

10:21.450 --> 10:22.610
Let's upload image.

10:22.670 --> 10:27.230
Let's go to the design and let's go to the overlay and I'm going to add in an overlay right here.

10:27.230 --> 10:28.870
So this is visible to me.

10:29.910 --> 10:35.340
OK if you want to make this overlayed much brighter then you can also show that I'm just going to come

10:35.340 --> 10:37.300
here and you can see this is full black.

10:37.350 --> 10:39.340
I'm going to come here and I'm going to decrease this a bit.

10:39.360 --> 10:40.620
So this is visible to me.

10:40.710 --> 10:41.230
OK.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.030
This is how it is looking.

10:42.030 --> 10:45.780
I'm going to click here and you can see how amazing this slider is going to look.

10:50.120 --> 10:54.060
See it yourself guys see it yourself how amazing this slider is looking.

10:54.070 --> 10:59.530
OK so you can build slider instead of the home head or if you want to add a slider as well.

10:59.530 --> 10:59.930
OK.

10:59.980 --> 11:05.220
So but but one thing that you have to keep focus on is that you have to focus on the concentrate here.

11:05.260 --> 11:10.830
If I just add one more than you can see the slider is the slider sizes change.

11:10.870 --> 11:17.110
And if I just come here you can see this slider size it's coming perfectly here come in perfectly here

11:17.380 --> 11:18.450
and coming perfectly here.

11:18.460 --> 11:18.840
OK.

11:18.910 --> 11:24.490
So this is so this is totally OK if I just add more Condon I'm going to come here I'm going to paste

11:24.490 --> 11:33.050
it here so you can see that this my slider size is increased and again see that now everything is totally

11:33.080 --> 11:33.550
OK.

11:33.770 --> 11:36.250
So this slider is looking perfectly OK.

11:36.380 --> 11:39.170
You can pretty well do anything but this slider.

11:39.260 --> 11:39.630
OK.

11:39.720 --> 11:42.270
You can you can edit it as well from here.

11:42.320 --> 11:46.330
I'm just going to I'm here I'm going to come here and I'm going to delete everything from here.

11:48.780 --> 11:49.510
So here we go.

11:49.530 --> 11:54.720
You can see it the slider has managed it's used now.

11:54.810 --> 11:59.130
So if you want to manage this whole slider You can also manage it you can just come here you can go

11:59.130 --> 12:00.300
to the elementary here.

12:00.390 --> 12:04.970
You can also just show arrows you can hide the heroes if you don't want to show ID.

12:05.340 --> 12:09.810
If you want to do if you're not if you don't want to show the arrows and if you want to hide the controls

12:09.810 --> 12:13.390
you can also hide the controls so you can see how the controls are hidden.

12:13.470 --> 12:16.290
Then we have the background so we don't have to add anything in the background.

12:16.320 --> 12:22.920
We have the design we have the layout I have the text you have the title text and then we have the spacing

12:22.920 --> 12:23.340
right here.

12:23.340 --> 12:24.950
So is this.

12:24.990 --> 12:29.310
This defines that how much spacing you want from the top so if I wanted to more spacing I can add some

12:29.310 --> 12:30.220
more spacing.

12:32.590 --> 12:33.010
OK.

12:33.180 --> 12:35.230
You can see how the spacing is increase.

12:35.280 --> 12:41.600
So I have added 5:55 from all the sites so if I just add like 200 pixels from both sides.

12:44.710 --> 12:47.860
Or just said 500 pixels from 500.

12:47.880 --> 12:51.430
Sorry not not from the right but from the bottom 500.

12:51.460 --> 12:55.220
So you can see the slider is so much bigger.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.640
So this is how we have to manage it.

12:56.680 --> 12:57.890
Everything OK.

12:57.940 --> 13:02.140
You can also bring your slider to the home page if you want to as well.

13:02.280 --> 13:02.730
OK.

13:04.690 --> 13:09.910
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit close so you can see this is how my slider is looking

13:09.910 --> 13:10.490
right now.

13:17.350 --> 13:18.370
Let's go to the design.

13:18.400 --> 13:23.190
Let's go to the sizing and you can see here you can manage the video of this later.

13:23.380 --> 13:23.960
OK.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.920
Here he can manage the spacing and everything.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.490
We have the water as well.

13:27.510 --> 13:30.030
I have the box shadow filters in animation as well.

13:30.040 --> 13:30.370
So.

13:30.450 --> 13:34.650
So we have a specific new section for the animation so don't worry about it.

13:34.690 --> 13:35.260
OK.

13:38.300 --> 13:40.530
Now let's go ahead and let's add a new thing.

13:40.580 --> 13:41.030
OK.

13:41.120 --> 13:45.520
I'm going to come here and I'm going to go to regular because we are too lead on the full video.

13:45.650 --> 13:48.080
I'm going to come here to the regular And you can see.

13:48.170 --> 13:50.130
Now here we want to add the full width.

13:50.270 --> 13:50.770
OK.

13:50.780 --> 13:55.310
So first of all we have to work with the accordion but his accordion you'll be working up the audio

13:55.310 --> 13:59.540
bar counters blog player plop button and everything.

14:00.830 --> 14:02.480
So let's come here to the accordion.

14:02.570 --> 14:03.310
And here we go.

14:03.380 --> 14:09.480
OK what I have to do I have to just add here to enter the title so here it will be my title.

14:10.510 --> 14:11.140
OK.

14:11.190 --> 14:13.580
And then here would be myself to Demi Condon.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.140
So I'm just going to come here I'm going to click here.

14:17.080 --> 14:24.040
I'm going to go from here to Lipscombe dot com slash feed slash H.T. and Mail.

14:24.140 --> 14:24.630
OK.

14:24.910 --> 14:31.580
I'm going to copy this and I'm going to come here and I'm going to paste it OK.

14:31.670 --> 14:32.280
Let's come here.

14:32.330 --> 14:39.340
Let's collect this and let's get it so you can see how this accordion works.

14:39.340 --> 14:45.820
This is exactly as same as like dad but if I just come here and I open this up you can see this is now

14:45.820 --> 14:46.270
close.

14:46.270 --> 14:47.640
This is our accordion.

14:47.750 --> 14:53.090
Accordion is a new version of that thing that we added in the conduct section.

14:53.110 --> 14:58.790
So if you want a first one to always open you can also add that to open so you can pretty well fake

14:58.800 --> 15:03.430
news in here like the first one will be always open and if someone clicks your you can see the second

15:03.430 --> 15:08.930
one is being open so you can create a fake news with this like here you can enter a question.

15:09.070 --> 15:10.240
And then here he can enter that.

15:10.240 --> 15:20.740
So if I just come here I just sit there and he can see what if my account is deleted.

15:23.690 --> 15:24.000
OK.

15:24.090 --> 15:27.030
So if someone wants to read it he'll just come here and he'll just read it.

15:27.150 --> 15:29.430
What if his account is deleted so he'll just read it.

15:29.430 --> 15:33.870
That if your account is deleted you have to do blah and blah and your account will be active.

15:33.870 --> 15:35.180
So this is or you can show them.

15:35.380 --> 15:40.090
OK let's come here and let's add a specific news section basically.

15:40.110 --> 15:40.910
So.

15:41.200 --> 15:41.730
OK.

15:41.810 --> 15:45.910
And we need to add a new section here to the regular array here and we need the full width.

15:46.140 --> 15:46.520
OK.

15:46.590 --> 15:49.430
So you can basically design them into columns if you want to.

15:49.530 --> 15:49.820
OK.

15:49.830 --> 15:52.890
It totally depends upon you you can design them into columns.

15:52.890 --> 15:53.600
OK.

15:53.940 --> 16:00.490
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to choose our audio right here and here should be the audio

16:00.490 --> 16:00.930
right here.

16:00.930 --> 16:02.930
So here should be the title right here.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.080
The title would be.

16:04.140 --> 16:08.910
Hello the artist's name is NZL

16:12.580 --> 16:19.920

16:26.590 --> 16:32.330
I have it in the music.

16:32.660 --> 16:35.000
I ordered this I just forgot the name.

16:35.070 --> 16:36.210
No no music.

16:36.320 --> 16:40.900
The documents says it's downloads.

16:40.910 --> 16:43.200
And here I think I have it in the music.

16:43.210 --> 16:43.840
Yes.

16:44.180 --> 16:44.440
OK.

16:44.510 --> 16:46.370
So let me add the audio right here.

16:46.460 --> 16:47.030
OK.

16:47.090 --> 16:49.040
This is this is being uploaded.

16:49.040 --> 16:53.330
Let this be uploaded and then I'm going to hit upload files so you you can basically upload the audio

16:53.330 --> 16:54.600
if you want to.

16:54.860 --> 16:59.690
And people can listen to songs while just browsing your website.

17:00.200 --> 17:04.620
OK this is also a great way to market OK.

17:04.630 --> 17:05.160
Here it is.

17:05.170 --> 17:06.010
If I just come here and

17:06.010 --> 17:12.190
the

17:17.560 --> 17:30.360
See this is in your help this site is no need to hi slimier.

17:30.380 --> 17:32.230
Love you when you're high is

17:41.490 --> 17:44.300
made and you know

17:47.470 --> 17:47.960
I don't know.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.700
OK so I can just control these volume right here.

17:50.710 --> 17:54.340
I can control this playbook and right here I can move it anywhere around the wall.

17:54.360 --> 18:00.660
But make sure that you just try to keep it normal because don't upload so much audio Otherwise people

18:00.660 --> 18:01.450
will come here.

18:01.480 --> 18:06.160
Listen to all of you and your server would be down so don't just uploaded the audio is not very much

18:06.190 --> 18:07.110
higher.

18:07.330 --> 18:11.620
Instead of the video videos are so big so you can add it if you want to.

18:11.640 --> 18:14.890
Then you go to the design right here and you can move on with this.

18:14.890 --> 18:18.460
I'm just going to come here and if I want to make it the full width I'm going to come here to disarray

18:18.460 --> 18:24.420
here I'm going to go to the design and I'm going to make the sizing to be full.

18:24.550 --> 18:24.920
OK.

18:24.990 --> 18:30.070
And I'm going to come here to the red and I'm going to use it to be once you can see this is coming

18:30.070 --> 18:30.460
right here.

18:30.460 --> 18:31.170
Exactly.

18:31.360 --> 18:36.960
And I'm going to come here and I need to just basically remove these paddings so you can see how you

18:37.120 --> 18:42.280
you can basically make any row exactly how you want it to be

18:49.450 --> 18:54.660
this is our everything is looking here is the pleasure of me me of myself.

18:54.760 --> 18:58.750
OK I'm going to come here and I'm going to just add a new section right here.

18:58.900 --> 19:02.240
So let's add a new section let's say regular and let's have a full.

19:02.290 --> 19:05.100
So you can pretty well manage them in the column if you want to.

19:05.170 --> 19:10.390
I'm just telling you about how these works you pretty well know that how blurbs and how everything works

19:10.390 --> 19:15.340
how module works how can you apply them and to call them How can you use special section as well so

19:15.340 --> 19:16.480
you know everything.

19:16.480 --> 19:21.430
I don't have to tell you I'm just telling you about D.S. So you guys already know about Ubar counters.

19:21.430 --> 19:23.060
We added that in the About section.

19:23.170 --> 19:23.550
OK.

19:23.620 --> 19:28.270
We have to work in the blog page so in the blog you can pretty well add the post from the blog.

19:28.270 --> 19:28.690
OK.

19:28.810 --> 19:31.940
You can call them this is exactly like that OK.

19:31.990 --> 19:32.980
I'm just going to come here.

19:32.980 --> 19:35.950
I'm going to hit OK and then I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit save.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.190
And let's add some of the poetry here so that we can show them right here OK.

19:41.260 --> 19:45.760
I'm going to come here and this is now you can see this is adding a post I'm going to add a hello.

19:45.780 --> 19:46.300
OK.

19:46.310 --> 19:50.900
And hello tansy.

19:51.120 --> 19:51.670
OK.

19:51.700 --> 19:55.160
And then I'm going to go down and I'm going to go said the featured image right here.

19:55.270 --> 20:00.690
So you can see I'm going to come here and I'm going to choose any image right here.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.790
This is the featured image.

20:01.810 --> 20:03.930
I'm going to hit publish right now.

20:04.150 --> 20:07.600
Here you can enter obviously the text that you want to add.

20:07.780 --> 20:11.730
So I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit publish again because that was not published thing

20:15.320 --> 20:15.910
OK.

20:16.020 --> 20:21.210
I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit publish right now and again see this is being published.

20:21.210 --> 20:25.200
So let's wait till this is published and then I'm going to show you how this blog post works.

20:25.200 --> 20:28.520
I'm going to come here I need to upload add some more posts.

20:28.570 --> 20:32.010
Let's add about 45 posts and exposing them to you right now.

20:32.010 --> 20:33.920
I'll be back when I'm done with them.

20:34.590 --> 20:34.890
OK.

20:34.890 --> 20:38.040
So you can see that I have added some poetry here.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.690
I'm going to go to all the models right here.

20:39.690 --> 20:44.750
I'm going to hit Savery now and I'm going to come here and I'm going to refresh this basically.

20:44.850 --> 20:45.220
OK.

20:45.360 --> 20:52.010
So I just saw that my video is so going I'm big.

20:52.020 --> 20:56.850
So I have it just this is the last section that we're doing right now and then I'll stop my video and

20:56.850 --> 20:59.310
then we will move forward in the next video.

20:59.460 --> 21:02.450
OK so let's come here and let this be loaded.

21:02.660 --> 21:03.120
OK.

21:03.150 --> 21:04.020
You can see that.

21:04.020 --> 21:06.020
Now this is how it is looking.

21:06.200 --> 21:11.460
There you can see in the first video we added the recent post of our word processor and now you can

21:11.460 --> 21:13.010
see this is how they are coming.

21:13.240 --> 21:13.690
OK.

21:13.800 --> 21:18.550
This is how the title is coming to read more is coming and everything is coming like here.

21:20.000 --> 21:20.910
So this is how it is.

21:20.960 --> 21:25.640
So you can pretty well manage it if you just come here you can show some only two post if you want to

21:25.910 --> 21:27.700
and you will see that two post will appear.

21:27.740 --> 21:32.360
So you can just dumb include the categories if you just selected only one category will be appear if

21:32.360 --> 21:38.150
you don't select any of the category all the categories will appear so Otterbein would be from New to

21:38.150 --> 21:38.940
all.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.420
It will show the latest post onto the top.

21:41.510 --> 21:45.410
So then we have Otunnu and then we have the title you can also show it by the tidal wave.

21:45.590 --> 21:51.430
And then we have to read more text so you can just add anything in the text bar right here and in can

21:51.470 --> 21:54.720
then display you can show you should not show the full content.

21:54.720 --> 22:00.460
I would recommend you with your slider would go so long and it would be like not good.

22:00.470 --> 22:05.690
OK so make sure that you select the excerpt one you supposed excerpt if defined.

22:05.950 --> 22:06.340
OK.

22:06.470 --> 22:08.970
And then we have automatic Xserve plan.

22:09.050 --> 22:13.150
It is 270 so you can just normalize it to how much you want.

22:13.270 --> 22:13.710
OK.

22:13.820 --> 22:19.480
So this is how this is where you can now go down and you can see this is how these balls start coming.

22:19.480 --> 22:24.680
So if I just come here and I just hit this guy right here and I just come here and I just hit the settings

22:24.680 --> 22:25.340
of this.

22:25.340 --> 22:27.240
So this is how these posts are coming.

22:27.290 --> 22:29.030
You can see how they are looking.

22:29.150 --> 22:33.890
Every post is coming since we have chosen 10 balls numbers that is why there are coming up like this.

22:34.090 --> 22:34.450
OK.

22:34.580 --> 22:38.930
I can do that to be like one and only one Postville be like here.

22:38.960 --> 22:42.780
Coming up break here like here.

22:42.910 --> 22:45.440
I have to I have one.

22:45.480 --> 22:45.720
OK.

22:45.740 --> 22:50.620
I have to choose only one post right here and you will see that only one post is coming in right here.

22:50.660 --> 22:53.160
I'm just going to choose the zero.

22:53.330 --> 22:59.860
So then here you will see all the posts are coming if you choose zero.

22:59.860 --> 23:00.410
OK.

23:00.430 --> 23:02.130
And then I have the date formats.

23:02.140 --> 23:03.370
This is the normal one.

23:03.430 --> 23:03.790
OK.

23:03.880 --> 23:07.690
We have the month and the date and then the year.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.050
So we have the content.

23:09.260 --> 23:13.750

So you guys already know about it.

23:45.230 --> 23:51.340
We also did this very elementary and you can see if you use the creative one then this is how the post

23:51.410 --> 23:52.000
will appear.

23:52.000 --> 23:57.250
So I would highly recommend you to go with the creative one because Redmond looks really amazing.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.320

show only the top three balls that are appearing right here.

24:14.120 --> 24:14.710
OK.

24:18.990 --> 24:23.880

25:05.260 --> 25:10.260
OK so you can show full all the balls if you want to you can create a blog based website.

25:10.450 --> 25:13.790
