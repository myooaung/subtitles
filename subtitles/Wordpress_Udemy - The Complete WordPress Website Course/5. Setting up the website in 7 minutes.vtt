What we want to do.

01:33.040 --> 01:37.180
We also want to go to update the word press so we need to have that word press.

01:37.180 --> 01:37.800

So there we go.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.790
You can see it has been updated.

01:45.790 --> 01:50.430
I'm going to go to appearance and then I'm going to go the teams and I want to set up this table of

01:50.450 --> 01:56.830

02:15.750 --> 02:16.260
OK.

02:16.290 --> 02:19.220
And we basically need to work with the head.

02:19.290 --> 02:22.220
This header is under the ocean double team.

02:22.290 --> 02:25.670
This is because we can not added the elementary plug in this.

02:25.690 --> 02:32.430

So let's have a look at how our Web site is looking.

03:38.910 --> 03:40.700
So we may see how it is.

03:40.740 --> 03:42.900
This is how our website is looking.

03:42.900 --> 03:47.060
We have our poster coming pray here and we have a footer right here.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.740
So what I'm going to do I'm going to just come here I'm going to go to the dashboard right now.

03:51.090 --> 03:56.210
And I want to go to the settings and then let's go to the permalink and let's change the permalink type.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.690
So I'm going to click here and I'm going to get post name.

03:58.740 --> 04:02.160
I'm going to come here and I'm going to save the changes to make sure that it is like this.

04:02.280 --> 04:05.130
Go to the appearance and then menus and create a new menu.

04:05.140 --> 04:06.350
Let's apply that menu.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.890
So I'm going to go here I'm going to name my name to be menu one.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.430
I'm going to create menu.

04:12.660 --> 04:15.200
So the menu has been created and I want to add some links.

04:15.210 --> 04:20.220
So let's go ahead let's delete this and the post let's go to the custom links and links and the custom

04:20.220 --> 04:20.820
links here.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.460
After that we're going to be editing them.

04:22.530 --> 04:26.310
So let's add a hash tag right here and let's come here to the link.

04:26.310 --> 04:28.410
Excellent sex is going to be about.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.700
OK.

04:29.710 --> 04:35.280
We also want to create a new page and that will be services

04:39.000 --> 04:42.570
services OK.

04:42.860 --> 04:47.420
Let's go ahead and we also want to create one more and that will be

04:50.090 --> 04:53.240
contact C O and t is t.

04:53.440 --> 04:55.070
Let's go ahead and said Antonio.

04:55.100 --> 04:56.340
So these are too many.

04:56.380 --> 04:56.980
I'm going to go ahead.

04:56.980 --> 05:01.640
I'm going to hit primary menu and I'm going to hit save so you can see that you can she has a display

05:01.650 --> 05:02.380
location to be.

05:02.380 --> 05:06.320
So some things have the main menu set as some theme has the primary menu in Romania.

05:06.470 --> 05:10.050
And now let's go ahead and let's say that how it is looking right now.

05:12.040 --> 05:17.050
So here we go you can see we have home about services contact and we are totally done with this.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.880
If you go to rate this right now you can see that the permalink is also set.

05:20.890 --> 05:25.180
Now one more thing that we want to do is that we need to create a new page and that will be our home

05:25.180 --> 05:25.700
page.

05:25.720 --> 05:30.300
I'm going to go to page and I'm going to add a new page and I'm going to name it as home.

05:30.910 --> 05:31.340
OK.

05:31.420 --> 05:34.000
I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit publish.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.210
So we have these as well OK.

05:36.460 --> 05:39.670
I'm going to go to publish

05:42.450 --> 05:50.840
and we also want to create a new page and that will be our post page or block page.

05:51.210 --> 05:54.060
So it's going to be a blog.

05:54.610 --> 06:01.650
I said publish and we want to do one thing and that is we want to activate these plug in we haven't

06:01.650 --> 06:02.600
activated them.

06:02.610 --> 06:04.470
This is the mistake that we are doing right now.

06:04.470 --> 06:12.230
I'm going to come here I'm going to hit activate and attack activate and legit activate apply so here

06:12.450 --> 06:14.370
we go every plug in has been activated.

06:14.370 --> 06:18.630
And now let's have a look at our website.

06:19.030 --> 06:21.720
So this is how our Web site is looking right now.

06:24.850 --> 06:25.310
OK.

06:25.490 --> 06:26.790
This is looking pretty well.

06:26.840 --> 06:32.650
I'm going to go ahead I'm going to come here and I want to just go to the settings right now.

06:32.660 --> 06:42.680
I don't want to go to the General tab or sorry and writing to see the reading was happening to me.

06:42.760 --> 06:42.940
OK.

06:42.940 --> 06:47.110
And I want to make my home page to be my home page because we're going to edit that age so I'm going

06:47.110 --> 06:47.230
to.

06:47.230 --> 06:47.630
I'm here.

06:47.650 --> 06:52.180
And this is all it's already said to homepage because we install that plug in and you can see that our

06:52.180 --> 06:54.640
home page is now from bage basically.

06:54.660 --> 06:55.050
OK.

06:55.160 --> 06:58.490
And post just now Plock page that has already been created.

06:58.580 --> 07:00.730
So it's looking cool already.

07:00.790 --> 07:01.560
I'm going to come here.

07:01.570 --> 07:07.060
I'm going to go to the pages so this is by installing that plug in what it did is that it automatically

07:07.060 --> 07:08.950
created some post and stuff stuff.

07:08.950 --> 07:09.430
OK.

07:09.430 --> 07:12.400
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to delete this plug in.

07:12.670 --> 07:13.080
No sorry.

07:13.090 --> 07:16.940
The page and I also want to delete this pages ago.

07:18.570 --> 07:19.080
There we go.

07:19.110 --> 07:20.270
We have two pages right now.

07:20.280 --> 07:23.020
This is our main page and this is our blog page.

07:23.040 --> 07:28.990
We're going to be editing this whole Web site and this and I'm going to show you that how can you create.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.540
