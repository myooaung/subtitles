WEBVTT

00:00.540 --> 00:05.000
What is up guys and Malcolm X so now and this video we will be working with the team.

00:05.040 --> 00:09.400
And this is the most amazing board because you guys are going to love this.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.580
OK.

00:10.590 --> 00:15.230
So where are them and how are they used for it and for disco to dashboard.

00:15.300 --> 00:21.450
And then I just go to appearance and then the teams then you can see that WordPress comes with three

00:21.450 --> 00:23.970
default teams that are already installed.

00:24.050 --> 00:27.350
2017 2015 and 2016.

00:27.510 --> 00:30.270
So these are the teams that are already installed and wordpress.

00:30.270 --> 00:33.150
I can just go ahead I can activate any other team.

00:33.150 --> 00:36.900
So lets suppose that I want to activate this 2016 team.

00:37.050 --> 00:41.710
OK I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit activate and I'm just activating.

00:41.910 --> 00:48.780
You can see that I will be having a different look for my web site you can see that my website is totally

00:48.780 --> 00:49.470
changed.

00:49.470 --> 00:49.980
OK.

00:50.100 --> 00:52.160
We have this right here.

00:52.770 --> 00:53.160
OK.

00:53.280 --> 00:59.070
And then I just come here and I have this about this page and this is my about us I have the blog page

00:59.070 --> 01:05.580
with these I have the Contact Us page and everything but this has totally changed the sidebar is constantly

01:05.580 --> 01:06.700
coming here.

01:06.720 --> 01:07.220
OK.

01:07.260 --> 01:10.030
And there might be different functions for the.

01:10.050 --> 01:10.630
Well.

01:10.820 --> 01:13.490
You can see we have different things for it customize.

01:13.530 --> 01:18.500
Instead of this so every theme comes with different customization.

01:18.540 --> 01:20.670
I just wanted to tell you this.

01:20.760 --> 01:25.860
Now let's just go ahead and let's just have a look at the most popular teams that we have here.

01:26.220 --> 01:30.490
So you can see that there are so many teams that you can add and Burkely that.

01:30.490 --> 01:35.330
So let's suppose that this is the team or this is the team.

01:35.490 --> 01:36.090
OK.

01:36.530 --> 01:44.230
If I just want to add it or if I want to work with this one this is the team I can just go ahead.

01:44.300 --> 01:44.830
I can.

01:44.860 --> 01:47.280
Installed is and on just installing.

01:47.310 --> 01:54.150
I will just hit activated and this team will be activated as well and in my all team section you can

01:54.150 --> 01:55.770
see this team is coming.

01:56.070 --> 01:56.480
OK.

01:56.610 --> 01:59.790
So they can see how it is looking.

01:59.850 --> 02:02.020
I just come here and I just view my website.

02:02.210 --> 02:03.290
ALEX Have a look at this.

02:03.300 --> 02:06.710
You can see is this the home page is this.

02:06.900 --> 02:11.770
OK which is already here and the content area is coming here.

02:11.780 --> 02:12.130
OK.

02:12.270 --> 02:13.780
So this is all the content area.

02:13.800 --> 02:19.390
And then we have this coming and the slider is already coming here but we haven't added it.

02:19.520 --> 02:19.960
OK.

02:19.980 --> 02:21.370
So how are you going to customize it.

02:21.370 --> 02:27.330
How we're going to do that for that we have to read the documentation or we can just go ahead and we

02:27.330 --> 02:31.020
can go to customize and in the Customize section we can manage it.

02:31.130 --> 02:31.460
OK.

02:31.590 --> 02:37.780
You can see that we have different things and we also have the documentation for that.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.670
We can learn that how this team works.

02:40.680 --> 02:41.110
OK.

02:41.130 --> 02:45.260
It's going to tell us everything that we have the page layout and everything.

02:45.270 --> 02:49.100
But let's just go ahead and let's quickly edited if I wanted to edit this.

02:49.650 --> 02:56.160
OK I want to go to team options and here you can see the team option just right here.

02:56.160 --> 03:06.870
I want to go to the home page and in the home page featured I have this OK so I can just manage it right

03:06.870 --> 03:07.140
here.

03:07.140 --> 03:10.560
Let's suppose that I want to switch it on.

03:10.770 --> 03:11.160
OK.

03:11.310 --> 03:15.230
And then I want to add the area.

03:15.390 --> 03:18.240
So it's going to be like angled double left.

03:18.300 --> 03:20.580
So it's going to be like double left angle here.

03:20.760 --> 03:24.750
And then here I can add the title to that is going to be like hello.

03:25.340 --> 03:28.260
Hello OK.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.420
How old.

03:29.750 --> 03:30.130
OK.

03:30.260 --> 03:32.090
And this will appear here.

03:32.090 --> 03:33.380
So this is how it works.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.550
Seriously guys.

03:34.580 --> 03:39.670
Promise promise by God I have just installed this team right now.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.160
I didn't know about this thing.

03:41.240 --> 03:41.660
OK.

03:41.780 --> 03:45.560
And now I am editing this theme just because just by installing that.

03:45.560 --> 03:48.180
So this is the experience that you get guys.

03:48.380 --> 03:48.760
OK.

03:48.890 --> 03:52.250
So I'll just tell you about this experience I'm going to just work.

03:52.280 --> 03:56.600
I'm just going to go through all of the teams I'm going to tell you about different type of things I'm

03:56.600 --> 04:01.280
going to tell you how you work with this team how to work with that team and then how to edit that team.

04:01.400 --> 04:06.890
And then you will understand it who will then be able to edit any theme you just go ahead you just sit

04:06.980 --> 04:07.570
on you.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.550
And then you can understand that.

04:09.560 --> 04:10.060
OK.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.720
So now you know everything about WordPress.

04:12.770 --> 04:13.010
OK.

04:13.040 --> 04:16.870
But you have to work on the projects.

04:17.240 --> 04:22.630
And then will be a WordPress expert not by just understanding WordPress.

04:22.640 --> 04:26.890
So then we go to the popular Darb you can see that we have so many themes.

04:26.900 --> 04:27.430
OK.

04:27.620 --> 04:31.460
We have this this and this and everything.

04:31.460 --> 04:34.760
Let's just go ahead and let's quickly just work with this team.

04:34.820 --> 04:40.930
OK if I just go ahead and I just said install OK and then I go ahead and I just hit activate it again

04:40.940 --> 04:46.640
see the Steimle be activated so I can pretty well manage with different teams I can work with like how

04:46.640 --> 04:48.340
different team work and all this work.

04:48.350 --> 04:51.640
So you can see these teams are added but this team is activated.

04:51.710 --> 04:55.320
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to view my website I'm going to see how does it look.

04:55.530 --> 04:59.580
OK you can see this is how it is looking at this change in custom Isar.

04:59.600 --> 05:05.270
We have about as blog contactors and we go down and this is how it is looking.

05:05.270 --> 05:09.010
We have to get in touch and we have these rates here.

05:09.050 --> 05:12.250
So this is how the team works.

05:12.260 --> 05:19.880
But I wanted to just explain to you how team works ok not how to edit.

05:19.910 --> 05:25.560
Any team will understand it because there is no tutorial that will teach you like how to edit anything.

05:25.610 --> 05:26.210
OK.

05:26.420 --> 05:30.440
This is from the experience that you'll get by the projects what you will do.

05:30.560 --> 05:30.930
OK.

05:31.130 --> 05:36.690
So in the upcoming videos we will be doing the projects then you will understand much better.

05:36.860 --> 05:41.630
So let's just go ahead and quickly learn about the plug.

05:41.630 --> 05:48.020
So for that I want to go ahead and I want to switch back to my teams and then I want to switch back

05:48.020 --> 05:54.320
to the 20:17 so that we can work with the plugins so I can see that we are totally done with the teams

05:54.560 --> 05:55.390
in the next video.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.890
I'll show you how can you work with a plug in.

05:57.890 --> 06:03.020
And where are the plug ins and why are so much important.

06:03.460 --> 06:03.790
Goodbye.
