WEBVTT

00:00.550 --> 00:01.840
WHAT DOES IT guys and we'll come back.

00:01.840 --> 00:08.230
So now you can see that we are totally on the menus and other stuff and this is how we're looking right

00:08.230 --> 00:09.110
here.

00:09.130 --> 00:13.170
So I basically want to change the font of this instead of getting a logo.

00:13.180 --> 00:18.610
I want to change the font because it is my personal web site and I don't think so if logo is going to

00:18.610 --> 00:19.650
look great.

00:19.990 --> 00:23.440
So I'm just going to go to change the font right here and work with it.

00:23.680 --> 00:28.380
So basically we have the home page settings right now he can see that we have our home page to be this

00:28.450 --> 00:29.990
and a blog which to be this.

00:30.070 --> 00:35.050
And now here we have to move on mid-channel options so in the general options we have the general styling

00:35.550 --> 00:39.630
we have primary color or primary color or main water color.

00:39.700 --> 00:42.720
We have our side background Bactrim to mange and Lincs color.

00:42.970 --> 00:45.610
So we don't have to work for this right now.

00:45.610 --> 00:51.280
We will first design our Web site right here the main can then real designer whole website and then

00:51.280 --> 00:54.950
we will be working up a journal stating so we have general settings as well.

00:54.970 --> 00:57.050
We don't have to work for this right now.

00:57.150 --> 00:57.770
OK.

00:58.060 --> 01:04.740
I'm going to go back in here we have the title right here so we don't have to work on it as well.

01:04.870 --> 01:05.370
OK.

01:05.580 --> 01:10.580
So I'm going to go back and this is the one that we have.

01:10.700 --> 01:11.770
Scroll to the top.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.490
We don't have to work with the settings right now.

01:13.530 --> 01:17.360
I'm going to go back I'm going to go to the topography basically.

01:17.430 --> 01:24.660
And here we have the general setting so we have the font subsets we have the body and we have to basically

01:24.660 --> 01:27.370
we want to work with a logo in the body section.

01:27.480 --> 01:30.990
We're going to be using a plugin to make everything look amazing.

01:30.990 --> 01:34.390
But first we have to work with the logo so we have the logo right here.

01:34.410 --> 01:39.240
This is basically a text I want to change the font to be amazing so I'm going to go ahead I'm going

01:39.240 --> 01:44.130
to choose this and I'm going to go down this using your keyboard to change your font.

01:44.130 --> 01:47.180
So then your funds are going to be changed.

01:47.450 --> 01:48.510
And when you click this

01:51.290 --> 01:56.070
so choose a fund that suits your self.

01:56.090 --> 01:59.600
Basically when you are creating your own personal lives saved.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.330
Just try to be yourself.

02:01.340 --> 02:01.890
OK.

02:02.060 --> 02:09.650
So let's go down let's go down this looks crazy.

02:09.960 --> 02:10.590
OK.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.970
I'm going to go ahead I'm going to just increase the font size.

02:14.320 --> 02:15.070
OK.

02:15.100 --> 02:18.850
And the line height should be decreased a bit.

02:19.050 --> 02:19.730
OK.

02:19.750 --> 02:22.430
And I'm going to increase the font size.

02:22.430 --> 02:23.110
There you go.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.070
I'm going to increase a little bit of hate.

02:25.070 --> 02:25.950
What does line hide.

02:25.970 --> 02:30.220
Basically you can see that if you increase it you can see the page sizes increasing.

02:30.540 --> 02:35.950
So this is basically called line height that how much height you want to get from this side and this

02:35.950 --> 02:36.490
site.

02:36.790 --> 02:37.330
OK.

02:37.370 --> 02:40.120
This is called The Lion's Head So let's suppose that this is a line.

02:40.310 --> 02:40.820
OK.

02:40.820 --> 02:46.730
And how much size height you want to get from here to here and I could see that your side is already

02:46.730 --> 02:47.840
gaining some stuff.

02:47.840 --> 02:48.440
OK.

02:48.520 --> 02:50.640
So these are really looking amazing.

02:50.870 --> 02:53.690
So I'm going to just to create a bit of line height.

02:54.020 --> 02:54.740
OK.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.200
And then we have the letter spacing how much spacing you want to give.

02:58.250 --> 03:02.340
So I don't think so if I need to give so much space.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.000
Zero is better.

03:04.210 --> 03:04.630
OK.

03:04.670 --> 03:09.750
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit publish.

03:10.280 --> 03:10.660
OK.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.460

06:38.900 --> 06:44.180
I'm going to go ahead I'm going to send this e-mail because that is not matching my site because I have

06:44.180 --> 06:45.550
used the dark one right here.

06:45.590 --> 06:47.940
I should be using the dark one right here as well.

06:48.130 --> 06:50.790
OK.

06:51.140 --> 06:52.720
I was going want to remove this.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.060
All right here.

06:54.170 --> 06:56.550
So this is now dark.

06:56.690 --> 06:59.290
So this is how do we have the phone number here.

06:59.300 --> 07:04.130
And we have the e-mail address so everything is looking cool still here.

07:04.310 --> 07:09.080
OK what I'm going to do I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit publish right here so you can

07:09.080 --> 07:12.210
see that this is how my website is designed.

07:12.530 --> 07:14.650
Everything is ready from here toolbar.

07:14.780 --> 07:17.810
We can color it any any how we want.

07:17.810 --> 07:24.290
We can change the color we can change the link color the background color text color and everything.

07:24.590 --> 07:29.630
So if you want to change the background color I can just come here or you can use it to be dark blue.

07:29.660 --> 07:30.440
And here we go.

07:30.530 --> 07:34.260
We can just come here to now text Giller I mean ingenius to be white.

07:34.370 --> 07:36.260
So you can see how this is looking.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.020
So this is how you can change it.

07:38.210 --> 07:43.940
But we will be moving on this later on and we will design a website completely but I think this is already

07:43.940 --> 07:44.730
looking cool.

07:44.750 --> 07:46.050
So just leave it.

07:46.280 --> 07:53.120
OK let's go back and then we have the social icons so we can show our social icons right here if you

07:53.120 --> 07:53.950
want to show.

07:54.050 --> 07:57.040
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to add Twitter for Twitter.

07:57.050 --> 07:58.670
I'm going to add a hash.

07:58.670 --> 08:02.200
So you have to create your social profiles and then you can add them.

08:02.330 --> 08:09.020
So here as well Facebook Google Plus and Instagram Ellington.

08:09.510 --> 08:10.860
OK let's go back.

08:11.000 --> 08:18.880
Let's go to the channel options and we have the link so you can choose the link as well.

08:18.970 --> 08:21.150
I'm going to select this to be white as well.

08:23.220 --> 08:23.730
OK.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.530
The border color should be white.

08:27.660 --> 08:28.350
And here we go.

08:28.350 --> 08:30.100
You can see how this is looking.

08:30.510 --> 08:34.830
So now let's go back and let's go to social right here.

08:35.100 --> 08:42.130
So for social things I think I should choose it to be Plock or

08:44.820 --> 08:49.750
I think black looks cool or we can also go with the purple purple is not looking cool.

08:49.950 --> 08:51.900
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to head black.

08:52.050 --> 08:56.270
Or yes black and on over it should turn to white.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.050
So now you're going to see how this has got.

08:58.260 --> 08:59.330
So if I just bring memos.

08:59.340 --> 09:00.740
It is changing to white.

09:00.930 --> 09:04.270
So you can see how amazing this is looking OK.

09:04.340 --> 09:05.090
You can shift it.

09:05.090 --> 09:08.270
You can make this black and you can make this white

09:12.780 --> 09:13.890
you can see how this is changing.

09:13.890 --> 09:17.730
So this is giving a creative fictitiously of this.

09:17.760 --> 09:21.690
OK I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit publish and I can see that we are totally done with the

09:21.690 --> 09:22.330
Tabar.

09:22.350 --> 09:27.670
We're also done with the menu bar and now we have to work on the content area.

09:27.910 --> 09:35.210
So seemed like that we have our Hetter in the head or we can manage everything from here.

09:35.430 --> 09:37.640
OK maybe you'll be doing that after.

09:37.680 --> 09:43.870
And we will design this or just field design this header section right here and then we'll design this

09:44.160 --> 09:45.830
so stadium guys and bely.
