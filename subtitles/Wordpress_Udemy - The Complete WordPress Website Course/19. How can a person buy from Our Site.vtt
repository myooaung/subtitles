00:00.450 --> 00:04.510
What is up guys and what KMAX are now in this video Viva will be very keying up with the reviewing of

00:04.510 --> 00:04.610
it.

00:04.620 --> 00:11.070
I would say that if a person wants to buy from our website how his experience will be and how the admin

00:11.070 --> 00:12.080
can view that.

00:12.120 --> 00:13.950
OK so let's get started.

00:13.950 --> 00:17.550
First of all what we have to do is that we need to open up the private.

00:17.670 --> 00:18.120
OK.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.370
You have to just come here if you are using Chrome.

00:20.400 --> 00:25.470
You have to just click this and you have to click new Incognito window or you can just see it control

00:25.500 --> 00:26.050
shift.

00:26.130 --> 00:32.460
And I don't know about the Mac but you you have to just click here and the private tab will be open

00:32.470 --> 00:34.970
and it says you have gone incognito.

00:35.190 --> 00:38.450
If you are on Firefox then you have to open up your Firefox.

00:38.460 --> 00:39.200
OK.

00:39.420 --> 00:41.160
I know it would be open already.

00:41.160 --> 00:47.010
So now here you have do we have to just click here and it's a new private window that will seek control

00:47.010 --> 00:51.780
shift be an a private will be open and you have to work on that.

00:51.780 --> 00:54.760
So since I use the chrome I will just move the Chrome itself.

00:54.810 --> 00:55.390
OK.

00:55.520 --> 00:59.470
Now here I have to enter the S-5 up complete that will be course dot com.

00:59.580 --> 01:06.900
And this is how my website will be loading up on and on the computer.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.540
So this is always look it is looking.

01:08.540 --> 01:12.410
And so let's suppose that he sees this page and he like this one.

01:12.630 --> 01:17.350
He like only deregister giving the Nike sured for just $25.

01:17.370 --> 01:18.340
OK.

01:18.660 --> 01:20.740
So I have just done a mistake.

01:20.760 --> 01:23.880
You can see that this is a T-shirt and I have a shirt inside here.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.890
So this is the biggest mistake that I've done.

01:25.890 --> 01:28.420
OK just let's suppose I just wanted to show you how it works.

01:28.440 --> 01:30.260
So I'm going to use that I like the blue color.

01:30.270 --> 01:30.640
OK.

01:30.720 --> 01:33.380
And unclogging the blue the color would be changed on my end.

01:33.510 --> 01:34.360
This is changed.

01:34.530 --> 01:34.920
OK.

01:34.980 --> 01:37.680
So let's get to here and I want to say this to be the medium.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.290
OK.

01:38.430 --> 01:39.500
Because the medium size would fit.

01:39.510 --> 01:41.410
But I know Excel would fit me.

01:41.480 --> 01:46.790
So I'm just going to come here I'm going to hit add two cards you can see that T-shirt for Nike.

01:46.950 --> 01:49.510
They should for men by Nike has been added to my card.

01:49.560 --> 01:52.970
I'm going to hit new card right now and you can see that it is right here.

01:53.070 --> 01:54.100
OK.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.250
Here it is.

01:55.260 --> 02:00.390
We have the 50 bucks right here and we have the shipping rate and the flat trade is applied to shipping

02:00.420 --> 02:02.950
and we also have access.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.300
This is V-8.

02:04.500 --> 02:04.990
OK.

02:05.010 --> 02:09.390
So if I just click here to calculate shipping you can see this is Pakistan and this is saying and we

02:09.390 --> 02:12.330
have this approach I'm going to select enter my zip code.

02:12.710 --> 02:18.640
OK and again see that we have the flat rate so I can just proceed to check out.

02:19.560 --> 02:21.950
And then you can see that I have to do my deal.

02:21.990 --> 02:28.320
So here I want to enter my first name so let's suppose that the first name of this guy is John and the

02:28.320 --> 02:29.330
last name is dope.

02:29.370 --> 02:34.800
So this is the universal name that people uses for testing purposes.

02:34.830 --> 02:35.340
OK.

02:35.370 --> 02:47.760
And then his company as a example OK his street address is exam or house number one two three example

02:47.760 --> 02:48.270
Street

02:51.280 --> 02:52.160
example

02:55.800 --> 02:59.610
and I'm just using the wrong spelling exam B.

02:59.750 --> 03:04.300
And not only the ones I'm using yes or twice x a and b.

03:06.410 --> 03:06.860
OK.

03:06.940 --> 03:13.800
And then I have to go down and it takes the town city so my town city is going to be this way.

03:13.810 --> 03:16.440
Here are the categories they're supposed to go.

03:16.440 --> 03:23.290
Is this my phone number is already added just use because the Chrome has the chrome is doing the thing.

03:23.320 --> 03:25.560
So now I have to enter the e-mail address.

03:25.570 --> 03:32.040
This is going to be in for example or Dargan.

03:32.070 --> 03:35.700
Now we have created an account if you wanted to create an account you can just check this and you can

03:35.700 --> 03:38.130
see that I have to enter the password to my password.

03:38.210 --> 03:38.520
Be

03:41.280 --> 03:45.900
this now we have the ship to a different address if I'm on the product to be shipped to a different

03:45.900 --> 03:50.070
address I can check it and then I can enter his details but I don't want.

03:50.150 --> 03:52.520
Now I have to enter the order no.

03:52.530 --> 03:53.730
So it will be like

03:56.620 --> 04:03.150
please add a note.

04:03.280 --> 04:08.460
Happy birthday.

04:08.490 --> 04:11.580
So this guy will add a note in the product packaging.

04:11.640 --> 04:15.480
This is this T-shirt from and by Nike and that will be the happy book.

04:15.510 --> 04:20.790
So if I want to send a gift to the person then I also have to check this that and the address to be

04:20.790 --> 04:22.290
shipped to anywhere else.

04:22.380 --> 04:26.820
But I've worn this and do not.

04:27.090 --> 04:37.140
Please do not add the invoice.

04:37.310 --> 04:41.410
Since I am just sending a gift that is why I do not want to read the invoice in the package.

04:41.600 --> 04:47.160
But I can not do this obviously otherwise it will get stuck in the customs and something like that.

04:47.180 --> 04:49.820
OK so then I have the direct bank transfer.

04:49.820 --> 04:54.560
I have the check payments and I also have to pay bills so I suppose that I select the check payments.

04:54.570 --> 05:00.000

06:59.610 --> 07:05.680
So then we have this order number and if I just view it you can see the order will be basically on hold.

07:06.000 --> 07:06.430
OK.

07:06.510 --> 07:13.250
Because I haven't send the check to this one so I have to send a check to there.

I hope that my e-mail is the one I'll just come here to the setting itself.

07:35.620 --> 07:35.940
OK.

07:35.950 --> 07:37.580

07:40.390 --> 07:42.690
Let's just go to spam and here we go.

07:42.690 --> 07:43.510
You can see that.

07:43.810 --> 07:45.750
I also have received an e-mail.

07:45.880 --> 07:46.820
This is me.

08:11.140 --> 08:11.560

Evading check payment order status changed from bending to on hold.

08:58.960 --> 08:59.410

So this is on hold.

09:00.490 --> 09:00.780
OK.

09:00.800 --> 09:06.550
Now what I have to do and once I have received the payment OK I have to just come here and that will

09:06.550 --> 09:13.040
change this to precessing and then I'll update it because I have received the payment and now I'm processing

09:13.330 --> 09:19.300
so that the person can see that this order is being processed so if this person logs in again and then

09:19.300 --> 09:22.730
he sees that OK my order is now currently processing.

09:22.750 --> 09:24.320
They must be processing my order.

09:24.460 --> 09:24.860
OK.

09:24.910 --> 09:34.210
So when this guy will get everything and when I received when I ship this product to disperse and address

09:34.300 --> 09:41.800
OK and then I will change this product to be completed because I have completed this order or I can

09:41.830 --> 09:44.950
