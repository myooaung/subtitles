00:01.620 --> 00:02.910
What is it guys in Welcome back.

00:02.910 --> 00:06.800
So in this video we're going to be working in the content area as you can see that in the previews would

00:06.850 --> 00:09.830
we regard the header and this header looks amazing.

00:09.840 --> 00:14.710
So make sure that you follow one color and then stick with that as in the previous video Privets Pervis

00:14.880 --> 00:18.130
section we created it and deal dot com and we followed that.

00:18.150 --> 00:18.950
The blue on.

00:18.960 --> 00:19.390
OK.

00:19.470 --> 00:21.240
And now we're following the tree Schwann.

00:21.300 --> 00:23.280
And you can see how our website will look.

00:23.430 --> 00:28.020
So first of all I need to come here and I want to go to the home page and you can see that I am in the

00:28.060 --> 00:29.300
page of the home page.

00:29.310 --> 00:30.960
I have created that home page.

00:31.080 --> 00:37.090
You guys already know that if I just go to all pages right here you can see that this is my home page.

00:37.140 --> 00:42.240
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit it with a mentor and this page is going to be edited.

00:42.360 --> 00:46.990
So you can see that I am in the elementary age and here I can edit that completely.

00:47.070 --> 00:50.870
But we have these things right here and these things we want to work on it.

00:50.910 --> 00:51.740
I'm just going to come here.

00:51.750 --> 00:52.200
I'm going to hit.

00:52.200 --> 00:53.400
Go to dashboard.

00:54.940 --> 00:59.980
I'm going to go to this page right here again and I want to come here and say the card contents lay

00:59.980 --> 01:00.250
out.

01:00.250 --> 01:05.040
I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit 100 percent full with because I want 100 percent full length

01:05.320 --> 01:07.780
and I want to go to the table here.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.840
And the title should be disabled.

01:09.870 --> 01:17.760
Let's come here and here we're going to work on it right now so you can see this is Howard pages looking.

01:17.830 --> 01:20.700
I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit Edyta with elementary.

01:20.860 --> 01:22.780
And here we're going to start it.

01:22.780 --> 01:27.310
So first of all we need to add something.

01:27.310 --> 01:27.680
OK.

01:27.700 --> 01:32.250
We want to add a header right here to that of a page should look better.

01:32.260 --> 01:32.720
OK.

01:32.740 --> 01:36.240
I want to come here I want to hit adenine section and I want to have this.

01:36.250 --> 01:43.300
So here should be the header and the header should be having some of the featured Bozo or some trait

01:43.380 --> 01:44.350
post-trial like this.

01:44.350 --> 01:44.780
OK.

01:44.950 --> 01:46.390
What I want I want

01:49.190 --> 01:54.710
a background image first I want to just click this and I want to go to style right here.

01:54.720 --> 01:56.000
Let's come here to the normal.

01:56.070 --> 01:58.330
And we need a background image.

01:58.350 --> 02:00.350
So the background image should be classic.

02:00.360 --> 02:06.600
I want to come here to MHRA here and let's add an image so the image that I want to add

02:09.470 --> 02:10.730
will be this.

02:10.750 --> 02:11.540
OK.

02:11.810 --> 02:12.460
Let's come here.

02:12.470 --> 02:13.890
Let's insert media.

02:14.200 --> 02:14.660
OK.

02:14.720 --> 02:19.370
And I want to overlay so in overly.

02:19.400 --> 02:24.240
I want it to be the black color.

02:24.560 --> 02:29.490
So let's add the black color OK.

02:29.510 --> 02:33.730
The back plaque colors should be full and full capacity.

02:33.790 --> 02:38.340
And I want to increase the capacity a bit more.

02:38.380 --> 02:38.970
Cool.

02:41.070 --> 02:41.470
OK.

02:41.620 --> 02:42.390
This looks cool.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.520
I want to come here to the background.

02:45.940 --> 02:51.790
I want to come here to attachment so it should be fixed and size should be cover so you can see how

02:51.790 --> 02:54.060
this is coming right here.

02:54.130 --> 03:02.710
Let's just give you the lay out and we want the content with the height to be fit to screen for this

03:02.710 --> 03:03.290
screen.

03:03.520 --> 03:10.000
So this is how the fit to screen is looking I think fit the screen doesn't look much better to me.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.770
I think I should go ahead.

03:13.930 --> 03:18.610
The minimum height so the minimum height I think 400 pixels looks cool.

03:18.730 --> 03:20.560
Or we can show some boast if you want to.

03:20.570 --> 03:22.790
Or we can show a tidal array here.

03:22.790 --> 03:28.790
So let's come here and let's click this guy right here and I want to add some post.

03:28.910 --> 03:31.910
So let's search for post

03:35.180 --> 03:35.500
OK.

03:35.530 --> 03:35.820
OK.

03:35.830 --> 03:43.780
We need to do one thing and we need the pro version of this just because we can not move further until

03:43.840 --> 03:45.620
and unless we have the procedure.

03:45.730 --> 03:53.590

07:49.230 --> 07:53.390
I want to hit full with so you can see Fulbeck looks much better.

07:53.400 --> 07:53.930
OK.

07:54.090 --> 07:55.950
And then what I want here.

07:56.340 --> 08:00.220
I want to just come here to see how this is looking so we have a feature to me.

08:00.230 --> 08:04.140
We have a feature that may have a feature feature to make and then we have a title right here and then

08:04.140 --> 08:06.140
we have a read more section.

08:06.190 --> 08:12.370
So I think we should be just going with the boxed bit box it looks cool.

08:12.850 --> 08:22.030
OK yes what I want to do I want to come here I want a heading right here and that will be coming up

08:22.180 --> 08:24.700
here and it's going to show us

08:28.280 --> 08:31.040
some recent

08:34.010 --> 08:38.160
post some recent boast.

08:38.710 --> 08:43.070
OK I want to go to style right here and I want to go to the text color.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.110
Semitic scholars are going to be white.

08:45.610 --> 08:46.150
OK.

08:46.150 --> 08:50.230
I want to come here I want to click this and I want to select the topography to be on.

08:50.260 --> 08:55.500
I want to increase the size ok and i will increase the line height.

08:59.240 --> 08:59.700
OK.

08:59.980 --> 09:04.570
You can see the line height is giving some space from the top and the bottom so if I just come here

09:04.600 --> 09:07.370
and I view my post you can see how this is coming.

09:07.540 --> 09:09.510
So we have some recent post right here.

09:09.520 --> 09:11.420
And these are the posts that are coming.

09:11.650 --> 09:15.010
So what I'm on trade now.

09:16.740 --> 09:18.640
I want to add one more dot.

09:18.640 --> 09:21.140
OK let's come here let's just edit it.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.160
So we have the columns 3.

09:23.180 --> 09:27.820
We have post per page and we have the image and then we have the Mansouri.

09:27.870 --> 09:32.190
So you can see how this is changing if I just selected to make make sure we change it.

09:35.730 --> 09:43.830
And you can also change to a major bit or if you just uncheck it it is no problem.

09:43.960 --> 09:44.310
OK.

09:44.320 --> 09:50.650
And then we have the image size so the image size can be thumbnail as well if you want to choose a thumbnail

09:52.440 --> 09:56.540
or just a medium to go to the medium large

09:59.280 --> 10:02.890
and now a thing the image pixel is cool.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.020
OK.

10:04.080 --> 10:08.230
Or you can go with the medium normal medium 300 by 300 pixel.

10:08.250 --> 10:12.260
So let's see what the quality is being decreased a bit.

10:12.420 --> 10:18.410
So I think I should go up with the medium large now it looks good.

10:18.630 --> 10:19.090
OK.

10:19.190 --> 10:22.990
But this is going to take some time to load on say too.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.870
I think I should go with the medium.

10:25.220 --> 10:25.630
OK.

10:25.790 --> 10:27.390
And then we have the image ratio.

10:27.500 --> 10:30.600
So I can just slow it down.

10:30.710 --> 10:34.570
And I think this looks cool image ratio.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.840
And then we have the image too if you wanted to create the image with.

10:37.850 --> 10:39.830
You can also decrease it.

10:39.860 --> 10:42.850
I'll be just going up the full 100 percent video.

10:43.070 --> 10:43.540
OK.

10:43.670 --> 10:49.820
And then I have the title right here so you can change the look of the title.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.880
I'll show you how you're going to change it if you want to just hide it.

10:52.880 --> 10:55.400
You can see that the title will be hidden.

10:55.410 --> 10:56.040
There we go.

10:56.160 --> 10:56.710
OK.

10:56.780 --> 10:58.540
And then we have the title tag.

10:58.550 --> 11:02.010
So I'm going to be choosing each two tag right here for the title.

11:02.240 --> 11:02.630
OK.

11:02.630 --> 11:04.030
And then we have the excerpt.

11:04.130 --> 11:04.880
What does it serve.

11:04.880 --> 11:10.040
Basically this is called the excerpt that how much content you want to show so you can see that I have

11:10.040 --> 11:14.430
chosen the twenty five character if I choose one more or one more character would be added.

11:14.570 --> 11:19.790
You can see and think I should be going up to 25 correcter because it looks cool.

11:19.960 --> 11:20.210
OK.

11:20.210 --> 11:25.820
And then we have the meta data so you can add so much data you can add the author name as well and something

11:25.820 --> 11:26.420
like that.

11:27.950 --> 11:32.520
OK so I can also show the author name the time when it was posted.

11:32.720 --> 11:40.930
OK so time is also going to appear so you can keep us posted on 11:56 a.m. 11:55 a.m. 11:55 a.m. OK.

11:41.060 --> 11:42.180
I'm just going to cancel it.

11:42.290 --> 11:48.110
And I just want to show us the date the author and

11:51.730 --> 11:57.240
so I'm going to be selecting the author a here and you can see the Alturas coming this is coming and

11:57.250 --> 12:00.920
this is coming and then we have the separator between sort of how we want to separate it.

12:01.150 --> 12:03.730
OK so you can separate it with three slash right here.

12:03.730 --> 12:10.820
I think I should go to almost Prader this is the distending dash.

12:10.840 --> 12:12.140
I said OK.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.350
And then we have to read more.

12:13.350 --> 12:15.690
And so this is going to come here like read more.

12:15.700 --> 12:17.600
So you can change it if you want to.

12:17.740 --> 12:19.090
And then we have the query.

12:19.090 --> 12:24.760
So if you wanted to add the query you can also add the query in some recent post.

12:24.850 --> 12:28.270
You can as a queried that how he wanted Craig to be.

12:28.270 --> 12:29.870
So it is showing the post.

12:29.920 --> 12:30.240
OK.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.690
It can also show that pages if you want to.

12:32.890 --> 12:33.310
OK.

12:33.340 --> 12:36.260
Like if I select the pages you can see it is showing the pages.

12:36.280 --> 12:40.180
You can also selected the what you want to show right here.

12:40.480 --> 12:46.160

15:41.170 --> 15:45.360
I want to come here to the image right here and a Ones spacing.

15:45.460 --> 15:47.170

15:50.290 --> 15:52.510

15:56.210 --> 16:01.010
OK Matt I should be a bit of KHRAIS OK.

16:01.160 --> 16:04.160

16:08.650 --> 16:09.090
OK.

16:09.160 --> 16:15.210

Or you can also change the topography of your table color if you want to as well.

16:20.020 --> 16:24.090
You can also move on with the spacing so I think it's giving some spacing.

16:24.100 --> 16:25.960
It looks great.

16:26.020 --> 16:26.580
OK.

16:26.620 --> 16:30.350
