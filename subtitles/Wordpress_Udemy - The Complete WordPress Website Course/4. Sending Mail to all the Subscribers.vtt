00:09.780 --> 00:15.960
This is my domain name mailing list and I want to send them a test email so let's just go to the skyway

00:15.960 --> 00:19.070

00:19.080 --> 00:24.240
Basically we can say and now I want to basically send them an e-mail.

00:24.240 --> 00:28.920
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to create a campaign and then here I want to just go ahead and

00:28.920 --> 00:30.990
I want to hit create an e-mail.

00:31.080 --> 00:31.650

00:31.650 --> 00:32.700
So it create an e-mail.

00:32.700 --> 00:40.630
I'm just going to come here and my campaign name is going to be like I Ziel test.

00:40.740 --> 00:41.130
OK.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.810
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to begin.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.700
Is just going to begin this and now here it is.

00:46.710 --> 00:48.540
Who are you sending to.

00:48.780 --> 00:49.110
OK.

00:49.110 --> 00:50.050
I'm just going to select.

00:50.070 --> 00:52.270
And like I NZL mailing list.

00:52.380 --> 00:56.560
I just want to send them and it has croupe our segment.

00:56.700 --> 00:57.270
OK.

00:57.270 --> 01:02.430
So you can dislike the entire list and saved or pre-build segment.

01:02.490 --> 01:08.070
So you're going to select like group a system and like a date recipient you can just add anyone in the

01:08.070 --> 01:08.550
crew.

01:08.730 --> 01:15.720
If the e-mail address first name is this then you want to add him or if the e-mail address can be an

01:15.720 --> 01:20.360
activity is this if he is in the VIP is his last name is this.

01:20.370 --> 01:23.350
If a sign up source is like this.

01:23.370 --> 01:31.790
If his location is like this like OK or if his location is in the United States so we can just filter

01:31.800 --> 01:32.040
them.

01:32.040 --> 01:36.770
So the United States and then I'm going to hit validate location.

01:36.780 --> 01:41.130
So is just going to validate the location and then we can just say like this I'm just going to select

01:41.130 --> 01:42.250
to use location.

01:42.360 --> 01:43.730
So you can see that I can add it.

01:43.730 --> 01:45.690
So this is always going to work ok.

01:45.750 --> 01:50.440
I'm just going to say like like the entire list I want to send so I have three recipients everyone.

01:50.490 --> 01:52.420
And your list will receive this e-mail.

01:52.560 --> 01:53.070
OK.

01:53.090 --> 01:56.880
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit next right now so it's just going to take me to the

01:56.880 --> 01:57.450
next step.

01:57.450 --> 02:03.240
And here is my campaign name internal use only X-News later test for.

02:03.240 --> 02:10.910
So then we have the e-mail subject so email subject is going to be like this is the test e-mail to you

02:15.750 --> 02:16.120
OK.

02:16.250 --> 02:22.940
And then I have the previous text so my private text is going to be like this snippet appeared in the

02:22.940 --> 02:24.990
inbox after the subject line.

02:25.010 --> 02:27.700
So I don't want to add anything here.

02:27.750 --> 02:32.780
OK and then we have there from name and then I have the from e-mail address and then I have track opens

02:32.780 --> 02:34.340
and everything like here.

02:34.340 --> 02:38.610
So you can just select it like how you want to linking and clickable click.

02:38.630 --> 02:40.620
But I don't want to select anything.

02:40.640 --> 02:44.680
You can also just auto post your campaign to Facebook.

02:44.820 --> 02:48.260
OK but I don't want to on a bus I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit next.

02:48.260 --> 02:50.150
So it's just going to take me to the next page.

02:50.270 --> 02:55.880
And here it say's here it gives you basically the layouts that you can just go ahead and then you can

02:55.910 --> 02:58.340
edit some stuff and then you can send the mail.

02:58.340 --> 03:01.130
So this is exactly like the elementary guys.

03:01.370 --> 03:01.900
OK.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.780
But I just want it to be like a simple text.

03:04.790 --> 03:08.950
I just want to still send them a simple text to all of my e-mail subscribers.

03:08.960 --> 03:09.520
OK.

03:09.560 --> 03:16.250
And then here I am just going to tell you Mr. Faber it's time to design your e-mail.

03:16.250 --> 03:20.990
This this and this so what I'm going to do now I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to move this

03:21.690 --> 03:27.270
away and then I'm also going to remove this.

03:27.290 --> 03:33.260
So here we have this what I'm going to do right now I am just going to drag the text right here and

03:33.260 --> 03:34.990
