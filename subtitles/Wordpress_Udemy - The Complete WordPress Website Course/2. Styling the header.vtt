00:58.430 --> 00:58.910
OK.

00:58.910 --> 01:03.480
So you can see that my page just published and now I'm going to go to the settings right here.

01:03.800 --> 01:04.170

Let's go to

01:12.160 --> 01:15.360
and I'm going to select a static page and my homepage is going to be home.

01:15.440 --> 01:19.790
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to save changes and again see that my home page is totally

01:19.790 --> 01:20.330

01:20.960 --> 01:24.050
So what I'm going to do right now I'm just going to come here and I'm going to view my web site.

01:24.050 --> 01:26.560
So this is how my web site is looking.

01:26.570 --> 01:28.090
I have nothing coming here.

01:28.190 --> 01:32.510
OK what I'm going to do right now I'm just going to customize some things to make our website look free.

01:32.610 --> 01:37.550
OK so first of all what we have to focus on is that we need to focus on the color combination and we

01:37.550 --> 01:43.220
need to focus on the font to make sure that you use only one single maximum to font use one single fahn

01:43.400 --> 01:47.400
for all your headings and use one single phone for all your conduct that is in sight.

01:47.420 --> 01:51.010
You can choose different phones for your burdens but it totally depends upon you.

01:51.110 --> 01:51.430
OK.

01:51.530 --> 01:56.800
So then we have the next thing and that is the color combinations to make sure that you use only two

01:56.810 --> 01:58.370
color combinations or three.

01:58.430 --> 02:00.260
Maxim did not go beyond that.

02:00.290 --> 02:00.690
OK.

02:00.710 --> 02:02.340
Otherwise your site will not look good.

02:02.450 --> 02:06.290
So what I'm going to do right now I'm going to go out into the you guys already know about it but I'm

02:06.290 --> 02:07.580
going to go to General option.

02:07.580 --> 02:09.380
So here we have the general styling.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.300

03:22.710 --> 03:25.900
And I also want to select this so I want it to be the main menu.

03:25.950 --> 03:32.370
I'm going to save money and you can see in some of the teams they use primary and in some of the teams

03:32.370 --> 03:33.000

03:34.200 --> 03:35.340
You have to select me.

03:35.400 --> 03:35.760
OK.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.020
Let's just go to general right here.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.450

06:29.520 --> 06:32.000
So I need the full black background color.

06:32.010 --> 06:34.940
So for this I need it to be full bark plaque.

06:35.070 --> 06:35.490
OK.

06:35.670 --> 06:38.740
And the border color should be none.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.280
So I just needed to be like 0 percent.

06:41.280 --> 06:42.840
So we don't need any of the water.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.460
OK.

06:45.090 --> 06:57.910
The Texas governor is going to be white or now the Linkletter's so my lane color is going to be in.

06:58.050 --> 07:00.210
We don't have anything so we don't have to work that out.

07:00.290 --> 07:00.620

07:00.630 --> 07:06.410
I'm going to go back right now and I want to go to social so social I want to just change the social

I want it to be white away and I want to Linkletter's to be blue.

07:23.820 --> 07:28.760
So that's just putting my mouse here and you can see how it is so we can also make the full block so

07:28.760 --> 07:31.800
if I bring them out here you can see this is changing to block.

07:31.860 --> 07:32.940
Nothing is appearing.

07:32.940 --> 07:34.820
So it looks amazing.

07:34.820 --> 07:37.660
Everything is totally looking awesome and we're done with this.

07:37.670 --> 07:38.680
I'm going to go back right now.

07:38.690 --> 07:39.640
I'm going to go back again.

07:39.650 --> 07:43.320
And I want to get into the head right now so we have to design the header as well.

07:43.590 --> 07:44.010
OK.

07:44.060 --> 07:48.360
I want to go to General and we have the Hill style so you guys already know about this hairstyle.

07:48.470 --> 07:48.830
OK.

07:48.830 --> 07:50.330

07:54.200 --> 08:00.200
So I want to change the background color and this is going to be a bit of great and wonderful but a

08:00.200 --> 08:00.920
bit of CCRI

08:08.640 --> 08:09.630
cool.

08:09.770 --> 08:11.250
Now here I want to go back.

08:11.330 --> 08:12.370
Then we have the head of media.

08:12.380 --> 08:17.960
So my header media is going to be this is.

08:18.320 --> 08:18.640
OK.

08:18.650 --> 08:20.300
I don't want to add any of the header media.

08:20.300 --> 08:24.050
You can add the before video if you want to in the header but it looks cheap guys.

08:24.050 --> 08:24.480
OK.

08:24.530 --> 08:25.960
So I want to go to lobal Ray here.

08:25.970 --> 08:27.240
You can add a logo.

08:27.320 --> 08:27.790
OK.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.280
I want the colors to be white.

08:29.390 --> 08:32.780
So since I'm not adding a little let's just add a logo.

08:32.800 --> 08:37.200
I'm going to and when I had a select file I want to go to.

08:38.140 --> 08:38.770
Let's come here.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.160
Let's come here to logo.

08:40.160 --> 08:41.080
Alex licked the logo.

08:41.090 --> 08:44.710
So I'm just going to select this one right here and there should be applauded.

08:44.840 --> 08:46.040
And let's just head select.

08:46.050 --> 08:47.730
See you can see this is going to be selected.

08:47.750 --> 08:53.290
I want to crop it right now so that it looks good on my side as well.

08:54.780 --> 08:55.980
OK cropped image.

08:56.010 --> 08:58.360
So this will be uploaded right now.

08:58.410 --> 08:59.540
Here we go.

08:59.780 --> 09:00.430
No.

09:00.990 --> 09:01.420
OK.

09:01.430 --> 09:05.580
Wait we have to wait something so he can see everything is up and running.

09:05.580 --> 09:09.230
This law does not appear you can see if he has chosen the wrong color.

09:09.450 --> 09:12.750
That is why this little boy is not looking so I wonder how much of it.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.220
So my max with is going to be

09:20.150 --> 09:26.810
one for and the next day will be this all be on these guys.

09:26.880 --> 09:30.210
You can choose it to be anything but I think it looks great.

09:30.350 --> 09:30.540
OK.

09:30.550 --> 09:34.830
And I can see this logo is visible and the menu size is also OK.

09:34.890 --> 09:37.320
I'm going to go back right now and I want to go to the menu.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.000
So let's design the menu.

09:39.150 --> 09:42.640
Let's just come here and we need to change the color to white.

09:42.930 --> 09:46.050
So it looks good about a bit gray.

09:46.070 --> 09:46.880
OK.

09:47.070 --> 09:51.030
Here I the one color on Hoovers So it's blue and it looks good.

09:51.170 --> 09:51.920
OK.

09:52.170 --> 09:59.760
I want to go to the link current color menu item when background slingback chrome should be fine.

09:59.940 --> 10:00.520
OK.

10:00.540 --> 10:04.710
And Bactrim Hoovers so you can also apply Dilling background where if you just bring them out here you

10:04.710 --> 10:05.850
can see how this is.

10:05.940 --> 10:09.560
And I think I kind of like this one right here just because it looks cray.

10:09.960 --> 10:12.100
So I'm going to go with this one going back from Hoover.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.410
Ailing back from current menu item No.

10:14.430 --> 10:16.020
