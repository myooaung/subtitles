00:00.480 --> 00:01.630
What is up guys it won't come back.

00:01.670 --> 00:03.800
Now and this video will be working at the checkout steps.

00:03.810 --> 00:07.860
Let's go go ahead and you can see that it says unable to use coupons.

00:07.860 --> 00:10.220
I didn't think so if I should explain this.

00:10.260 --> 00:10.810
OK.

00:10.890 --> 00:15.210
Know they should already know that you can create coupons and then we can give some discounts so that

00:15.210 --> 00:19.210
people can at coupon and then apply it in this will be automatically applied here.

00:19.290 --> 00:19.830
OK.

00:19.830 --> 00:25.620
So then we have calculate coupon discounts sequentially when applying multiple coupons apply the first

00:25.620 --> 00:29.700
coupon to the full price and the second coupon to the cumbered prize and so on.

00:29.700 --> 00:35.850
So this means that you can run two promotions at once like 50 percent off the other one is 50 percent

00:35.850 --> 00:36.220
off more.

00:36.230 --> 00:42.090
So if someone has got two coupons then you can apply to coupons both like even lent or 50 percent off

00:42.280 --> 00:46.380
the 50 percent off will be applied and then he will add that another coupon and that coupon will also

00:46.380 --> 00:47.220
be applied.

00:47.220 --> 00:52.830
So then I don't think so if you want to run there so make sure that you do not add it.

00:52.980 --> 00:57.850
OK you know you do not check this because only one coupon can be used order.

00:57.870 --> 01:04.500
OK and then we have enabled to get check out this means that when anyone wants to check out then he

01:04.500 --> 01:06.380
don't have to be registered.

01:06.450 --> 01:06.830
OK.

01:06.900 --> 01:14.300
So this means that if you want them to just enter the address and then check them out and then you can.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.290
Or they have to create an account for your site.

01:17.310 --> 01:18.750
And this is important to you Candice.

01:18.780 --> 01:22.430
And check this and that account creation will be compulsory.

01:22.440 --> 01:24.800
Then we have the force secure check out.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.360
This means that you need to get an SSL certificate.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.570
You can just read about it.

01:29.760 --> 01:34.770
This is that you have to buy and how this is this is basically this like HTP.

01:34.800 --> 01:40.920
And this is green secure so you can basically get the SSL certificate and then you can apply to your

01:40.920 --> 01:44.690
site I'm going to show you how can you get it for free even we will be moving on for it.

01:44.700 --> 01:45.130
OK.

01:45.330 --> 01:50.630
So let's go down and we have the card page we have the check out and then we have the terms and conditions.

01:50.640 --> 01:51.230
OK.

01:51.330 --> 01:55.680
So you can create a page for terms and conditions then you can add that so let's just go ahead let's

01:55.680 --> 01:57.230
just create a new page.

01:57.270 --> 02:04.980
OK let's look at the terms and conditions and let's just assign that so I'm going to add terms and conditions.

02:05.260 --> 02:05.780
OK.

02:05.820 --> 02:11.360
And then here I'm going to add some some of my terms so here would be condition one here would be condition

02:11.420 --> 02:14.790
two would be condition 3 and something like that so I'm going to go ahead.

02:14.790 --> 02:16.310
I'm going to hit publish right now.

02:16.530 --> 02:17.160
OK.

02:17.160 --> 02:21.420
And then I'm going to come here I'm going to ask first this page right now and then I'm going to select

02:21.420 --> 02:26.010
the page from the terms and conditions you can see that on the order page.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.450
If I just come here and I just refresh it.

02:28.610 --> 02:29.200
OK.

02:29.250 --> 02:34.170
And then I go to this right here I just click proceed to check out.

02:34.530 --> 02:37.990
Then you can see that here would be the terms and conditions and in fact click here.

02:38.100 --> 02:40.340
Seaven C2 C3 is coming.

02:40.340 --> 02:42.480
So this is this basically the first of this.

02:42.500 --> 02:45.860
OK so now let's go down and we have the baby.

02:45.870 --> 02:51.840
So this is like the you are railed at how you wonder are you are EL-TIBI for order be for order received

02:51.840 --> 02:57.540
for Ed and mentored for delayed pain and mentored for said default payment method so leave this as it

02:57.540 --> 02:58.170
does.

02:58.320 --> 02:59.250
Do not worry about it.

02:59.250 --> 03:01.150
And then we have the Bamian gate bays.

03:01.250 --> 03:01.780
OK.

03:01.830 --> 03:06.330
So first of all we have the check payments and that is enabled so if I just come here to the check out

03:06.630 --> 03:11.160
you're going to see that I have only one option and saying please send a check to store name store Street

03:11.160 --> 03:16.200
store down in country and scores store postcard postcard.

03:16.520 --> 03:16.970
OK.

03:17.070 --> 03:21.120
So let's see I'm like this we want to come here to the direct bank transfer and I'm going to add the

03:21.120 --> 03:21.770
account name.

03:21.780 --> 03:25.210
I'm going to be entering my account name here would be the My Account Number.

03:25.260 --> 03:25.810
OK.

03:25.830 --> 03:33.140
And then instead of the account number I want to add the bank name so that is going to be HBL.

03:33.410 --> 03:33.920
OK.

03:34.020 --> 03:35.750
And I'm going to add the source code.

03:35.760 --> 03:36.830
It can be anything.

03:36.960 --> 03:42.900
And I want to add the IB and that is the international bank account number and then the swift.

03:42.960 --> 03:50.320
So you can add anything here in there let's go ahead and let's get an account so you can see this has

03:50.320 --> 03:52.790
been added so let's just go ahead.

03:53.440 --> 03:58.660
I just deleted my account by mistake so I'm going to add this again and desart cord.

03:58.720 --> 04:01.340
I mean that's it.

04:01.360 --> 04:07.000
So you also want to check this because we want to enable the bank transfer make your payment directly

04:07.000 --> 04:08.020
into her bank account.

04:08.020 --> 04:13.840
Please use your order ID as the payment preference your order will not be Shib until the funds have

04:13.840 --> 04:14.980
cleared in our account.

04:14.980 --> 04:18.470
So I'm going to save the changes and you can see this is for here.

04:18.490 --> 04:24.120
So the bank transfer is right here if I just come here and I just said this you can see then here will

04:24.130 --> 04:26.990
be a new option in this case Deitrich bank transfers.

04:27.010 --> 04:32.720
If someone click years this is the description that is coming and then he will just place the order.

04:32.740 --> 04:35.240
We will then give him the bank account details.

04:35.260 --> 04:36.220
Not right now.

04:36.360 --> 04:40.190
Over a system like this we have the check ins and then we have the cash on delivery.

04:40.330 --> 04:44.060
If you want to be able to cash on delivery and the last we have is the bell.

04:44.260 --> 04:46.430
So you can just work with a pay bill.

04:46.560 --> 04:47.100
OK.

04:47.110 --> 04:51.250
How it's going to work you can just click people's standard and then you can come here you can enter

04:51.250 --> 04:53.230
your paypal title.

04:53.230 --> 04:58.620
This will be the description and this will be the e-mail address so if you want to enter this address.

04:58.620 --> 04:58.960
OK.

04:58.960 --> 04:59.990
And then I'm going to go ahead.

05:00.010 --> 05:01.730
I'm going to hit save changes right now.

05:01.840 --> 05:05.260
You don't you don't have to work on it right now.

05:05.350 --> 05:05.740
There you go.

05:05.740 --> 05:09.610
If I just come here right now and then I have to come here and then I refreshed this you're going to

05:09.610 --> 05:13.690
see a new thing and that will say Pay-Pal.

05:13.690 --> 05:16.030
So what is the bill if I just click here.

05:16.030 --> 05:22.120
You can see pay people you can baby with are a credit card your credit card if you don't have a paypal

05:22.120 --> 05:22.780
account.

05:22.940 --> 05:23.290
OK.

05:23.350 --> 05:26.360
So this is the Beamon gateway basically.

05:26.390 --> 05:31.090
There you have to sign up for your credit card and then you can receive payments if you want to run

05:31.090 --> 05:31.900
e-commerce sites.

05:31.920 --> 05:33.220
This is really very important.

05:33.220 --> 05:33.790
OK.

05:33.910 --> 05:39.690
So then when everything is done you can send receive payments from that pay bill.

05:39.700 --> 05:44.060
I'm also going to show you that how can you create d'Este payments with the sandbox account.

05:44.200 --> 05:48.490
Not great now but later on when we will add a lot of products and then we will be working up at the

05:48.490 --> 05:49.120
bottom and monitor.

05:49.140 --> 05:49.600
OK.

05:49.630 --> 05:53.800
So I'll also show you that how can you add a specific beamin gateway to your account.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.010
And also you can accept credit cards.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.610
All we're done with this right now.

05:57.610 --> 05:59.280
OK we have the receiver or e-mail address.

05:59.280 --> 06:03.990
We have the invoice prefix and then we have shipping details and everything right here.

06:04.150 --> 06:08.270
So now we're totally done with this in the next video you'll be working on that counts.

06:08.290 --> 06:12.580
And then we will just finish everything right here and then we will do everything over the products

06:12.580 --> 06:17.140
we'll add some more products we'll discuss different types of products and then we'll end that and then

06:17.280 --> 06:23.400
