00:00.950 --> 00:05.230
What does a guy who's want KMAX now in this video will be working up for the shipping tab OK.

00:05.270 --> 00:07.220
So first of all we have the shipping zone.

00:07.220 --> 00:10.650
We have the shipping options and then we have the shipping classes.

00:10.670 --> 00:11.240
OK.

00:11.240 --> 00:17.250
So if someone is Pakistan in Pakistan and then we will apply him a flat rate.

00:17.270 --> 00:17.860
OK.

00:17.890 --> 00:24.680
And if someone is not in Pakistan and is from any other country or ship do that we selected in the general

00:24.680 --> 00:28.750
tab OK then we will be charging in a different flat rate OK.

00:28.760 --> 00:31.330
So if we just come here and then we hit at a trade now.

00:31.550 --> 00:31.980
OK.

00:32.120 --> 00:37.170
And then you can see that if someone in Pakistan may charge him a flat rate I just come here and I just

00:37.170 --> 00:40.700
sit there and I can see that we're charging him a dollar ten.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.330
So this is taxable as well.

00:42.410 --> 00:42.970
OK.

00:43.070 --> 00:44.500
So this is what I mean exactly.

00:44.600 --> 00:47.900
If I just go back and then I gunas shipping options right here.

00:48.280 --> 00:48.800
OK.

00:48.860 --> 00:50.710
And then here you can see.

00:50.960 --> 00:52.410
First let's discuss it.

00:52.610 --> 00:55.760
Let's discuss the shipping classes because you already knew about it.

00:55.970 --> 01:03.470
That if someone is not in Pakistan then we will charge them $50 and if someone is in Pakistan then we

01:03.470 --> 01:05.980
will charge in Pakistan $10.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.380
OK.

01:09.030 --> 01:15.250
So this is what I mean Cinelli go ahead and let's just work with these shipping options.

01:15.270 --> 01:15.750
OK.

01:15.840 --> 01:21.580
Shipping classes swimming classes are mean that the more shipping costs that they can get.

01:21.750 --> 01:27.120
So let's just come here and again see the calculations enable the shipping calculator on the card bage

01:27.540 --> 01:31.240
high shipping cost until an address is entered.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.820
So when we go to the proceed to check out.

01:33.930 --> 01:39.050
And until the address is entered the shipping cost will not be appearing.

01:39.120 --> 01:40.650
But I would not recommend you to do that.

01:40.650 --> 01:45.510
Make sure that you add the shipping rate okay in here so that if someone wants to buy it he will buy

01:45.510 --> 01:49.170
it and if someone doesn't want to buy it and he'd be like oh my god they're charging the shipping rate

01:49.170 --> 01:49.460
as well.

01:49.470 --> 01:50.610
I don't want to buy them.

01:50.730 --> 01:51.130
OK.

01:51.180 --> 01:52.750
So there are some customers like that.

01:52.890 --> 01:57.810
So let's just go ahead let's just come here and you can see I'll make sure to just uncheck this and

01:57.930 --> 01:59.500
make sure that this is not checked.

01:59.760 --> 02:05.220
Now we have the shipping destination default to customers shipping address default to customer billing

02:05.220 --> 02:09.210
address for shipping to the customer billing address.

02:09.240 --> 02:09.680
OK.

02:09.780 --> 02:16.320
So this means that if only the person who was buying He should only ship to his own country he should

02:16.320 --> 02:20.870
not ship to a different shipping country make sure that you select like to default to billing address.

02:20.910 --> 02:27.030
If someone wants an address to be shipped to any other country then he can check the option in the check

02:27.030 --> 02:27.530
out page.

02:27.540 --> 02:32.250
OK so if I just click here and I just move to the check out page pay and then he or I have to enter

02:32.250 --> 02:38.010
that information so then this will be an option if I click here then only I can ship to a different

02:38.010 --> 02:40.650
address so make sure that this is selected because this is normal.

02:40.740 --> 02:46.660
If you selected then the person also has to enter the shipping rates the billing records and so much.

02:46.680 --> 02:53.380
And this will create a whole lot of things so make sure that you ask your customer not so much but a

02:53.380 --> 02:54.290
little bit less.

02:54.310 --> 02:55.100
OK.

02:55.120 --> 03:02.470
So you're asking the first name company name country address and phone number that's all.

03:02.770 --> 03:04.030
OK.

03:04.030 --> 03:09.340
So then we have debug mode enable shipping debug mode to show matching shipping zones and do bypass

03:09.340 --> 03:10.920
the shipping raid cache.

03:11.080 --> 03:15.580
So this means that if you want to debug something or something like that then you can unable to debug

03:15.580 --> 03:15.990
mode.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.650
But don't don't just work with this.

03:17.710 --> 03:19.710
This is not much important.

03:19.710 --> 03:20.060
OK.

03:20.170 --> 03:22.820
So I only have the shipping classes right here.

03:22.930 --> 03:24.120
Now this is interesting.

03:24.130 --> 03:24.850
OK.

03:25.240 --> 03:26.130
What is this.

03:26.140 --> 03:31.510
Let's just bring them out here and anti-shipping classes can be used to create products of similar types

03:31.540 --> 03:37.000
and can be used by some shipping method such as flat trade to provide different trades to different

03:37.000 --> 03:37.910
classes of products.

03:37.930 --> 03:38.410
OK.

03:39.260 --> 03:46.640
What I mean basically if we want to ship a cell phone and if we want to ship a piece of paper.

03:46.780 --> 03:55.680
OK then first cell phone is dead cell phones are expensive and we should invest in a bit of shipping.

03:55.750 --> 03:59.210
And if you want to sell a piece of paper then I don't think so.

03:59.360 --> 04:04.210
That doesn't really matter if it doesn't get shipped or if gets harmed or something like that then who

04:04.210 --> 04:06.280
cares about the insurance and something like that.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.610
So this mean exactly.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.550
Then you can sign the shipping classes.

04:09.550 --> 04:14.580
So if you want to sell a cell phone or something like that then there should be something like that.

04:14.580 --> 04:22.060
So if I want to add a shipping class name OK and that is going to be like if someone buy expensive expensive

04:22.060 --> 04:25.180
products OK and then lighted and shipping class.

04:25.200 --> 04:25.660
OK.

04:25.690 --> 04:31.860
And if someone buy med. products then this.

04:32.060 --> 04:36.750
OK so we have expensive products and then we have this so it's safe shipping classes.

04:36.770 --> 04:37.260
OK.

04:37.340 --> 04:39.380
Now let me show you how this is going to work.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.600
Let's just go to shipping zones.

04:41.720 --> 04:42.320
OK.

04:42.530 --> 04:44.530
And let's just come here to Pakistan.

04:44.690 --> 04:45.090
OK.

04:45.170 --> 04:50.380
And if someone is buying expensive shipping products OK.

04:50.450 --> 04:56.720
If someone is buying the expensive shipping products then the expensive shipping cost is going to be

04:56.810 --> 04:57.680
this.

04:58.430 --> 04:59.410
Plus this.

04:59.590 --> 04:59.930
OK.

04:59.990 --> 05:02.950
So we will charge him extra $50.

05:03.070 --> 05:03.640
OK.

05:03.650 --> 05:09.260
And if someone is buying medium priced products like if someone is buying shirts then we will charge

05:09.260 --> 05:13.430
him $20 because sures also are expensive and something like that.

05:13.430 --> 05:15.450
But they are in the medium category.

05:15.590 --> 05:22.400
So you can I say you can just leave that if a product is between $5000 to $10000 and will charge you

05:22.390 --> 05:23.710
an extra $50.

05:23.710 --> 05:30.440
And if a product is being $100 do thousand dollars to me all charge and $20 so this can be like the

05:31.220 --> 05:34.330
thing to them we have no shipping cost cost.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.330
OK.

05:35.450 --> 05:42.800
This is like enter cost or some dissa mean that if no shipping class is added OK.

05:42.920 --> 05:48.950
If nothing is the class and the product then the fee how much we want to add.

05:48.950 --> 05:50.200
So we want to add nothing.

05:50.350 --> 05:50.730
OK.

05:50.870 --> 05:52.060
Only this will be added.

05:52.100 --> 05:58.670
So then we have calculation type per class per order charge shipping for the most expensive shipping

05:58.670 --> 05:59.840
class.

05:59.840 --> 06:00.370
OK.

06:00.390 --> 06:06.760
So then we have this right here and then we have charged shipping for each shipping class individually.

06:06.770 --> 06:11.810
Obviously this one should be here so that if we have two phones right here and then we would charge

06:11.810 --> 06:12.540
him $50.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.230
So this is me like four phones and something like that.

06:15.380 --> 06:19.130
So let's just save changes right here and there we go.

06:19.130 --> 06:23.370
Now what I'm going to do right now I'm just going to come here and make sure that everything is safe.

06:23.600 --> 06:31.970
Now let's come here and let's go back to our site I just opened this up in the view card and you can

06:31.970 --> 06:35.130
see that we are just adding this flattery.

06:35.210 --> 06:35.580
OK.

06:35.600 --> 06:36.670
Nothing is at it.

06:36.770 --> 06:38.640
If I just go to edit page.

06:38.740 --> 06:39.060
OK.

06:39.080 --> 06:44.790
And this if this is product is so much expensive then enter another.

06:44.950 --> 06:46.730
I want to open this product tray here.

06:47.020 --> 06:47.490
OK.

06:47.560 --> 06:53.560
And since Let's suppose that this product is so expensive like this product just for two fifty dollars

06:53.710 --> 07:00.850
OK or $25000 then in the shipping tab I want to select the shipping class so I want to select the shipping

07:00.850 --> 07:04.120
class to be expensive that this will come under expensive.

07:04.120 --> 07:13.300
So if this product I have chosen that this product is expensive and person has to pay more $50 OK then

07:13.450 --> 07:18.790
what will happen if I go to View product right now and then I go to the card base right here and then

07:18.790 --> 07:19.560
I click here

07:24.050 --> 07:32.240
Bukhari then you can see that if I come here and I hit update totals OK I have to do it.

07:32.270 --> 07:38.990
I have to just remove it from here and then I have to return to shop to cart.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.130
Let's see if we have updated the product.

07:41.130 --> 07:46.360
I think that we haven't updated the product from there let's just say update added product.

07:46.470 --> 07:47.550
Let's just go down.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.090
Let's just go to shipping right here.

07:49.110 --> 07:50.550
And expensive is selected.

07:50.560 --> 07:51.680
Ok cool.

07:51.690 --> 07:55.280
I'm going to come here and you can see that if I just open up my car.

07:55.290 --> 07:56.130
Great here.

07:58.830 --> 08:00.190
So just coming like this.

08:00.210 --> 08:01.920
I entered the pass.

08:02.490 --> 08:10.810
This right here and you can see that on entering this my shipping rate my postal code you can see that

08:10.810 --> 08:18.690
this is costing me $60 because I have chosen the class and that is $50.

08:18.700 --> 08:19.120
OK.

08:19.210 --> 08:21.640
So $50 is being added.

08:21.640 --> 08:29.370
And also the shipping cost is being added toward this mean that if I just come here and you can see

08:29.370 --> 08:30.580
first this will be added.

08:30.700 --> 08:35.520
This is the most important of all this will be added Whether you buy anything whether you buy the most

08:35.520 --> 08:39.010
expensive thing whether you buy a normal thing whether you buy a medium thing.

08:39.120 --> 08:39.920
This will be added.

08:40.140 --> 08:46.060
But if you are buying a most expensive thing then extra $50 will be added to.

08:46.170 --> 08:47.910
This is what I mean exactly in the car.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.070
You can see that the $10 is already added because I mean I'm buying something I don't I'm in Pakistan

08:53.320 --> 08:57.110
OK and I am also buying the expensive product.

08:57.120 --> 08:57.400
OK.

08:57.420 --> 09:01.170
That is why the $50 extra that is being added.

09:01.170 --> 09:02.700
So this is I mean exactly.

09:02.730 --> 09:07.680
OK so this is how you can create the classes for it like that for a mobile phone you can have the mobile

09:07.680 --> 09:08.810
phone cost.

09:08.910 --> 09:12.940
And for mobile phone you can cost them more and like expensive and something like that.

09:13.080 --> 09:13.510
OK.

09:13.590 --> 09:15.670
So let's just go back to the shipping zones.

09:16.960 --> 09:21.400
And time like this you can also just manage this one right here.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.400
Hey you come here you just sit at it.

09:23.440 --> 09:27.580
And then the for expensive you're going to charge them $150.

09:27.610 --> 09:30.400
And for medium you're going to charge them a hundred bucks.

09:31.410 --> 09:35.420
So it's going to be like 50 plus 150 that it will be 200.

09:35.910 --> 09:43.560
Let's just save let's just come here and let's select to Norway of they totaled.

09:43.680 --> 09:44.890
And here we go.

09:44.940 --> 09:45.890
This is what I said.

09:45.900 --> 09:46.370
OK.

09:46.440 --> 09:51.070
So this guy is not from Pakistan and this guy is also under the postal code.

09:51.090 --> 09:56.610
And you can see that this clause that has been added in here is expensive products.

09:56.610 --> 09:59.540
That is why we are offering to him that.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.150
OK.

10:00.240 --> 10:06.840
So let's just come here and let's just remove the clause and when we have removed the class OK let's

10:06.840 --> 10:07.440
just come here.

10:07.440 --> 10:14.260
Let's just come here and let's like the medium product so if it is a medium product and then we will

10:14.260 --> 10:15.450
charge him a hundred bucks.

10:15.460 --> 10:20.800
So let's just get to here and let's just come here and you can see that in the card in the card if I

10:20.800 --> 10:30.250
just come here I just hit a card tray here and he can see we should charge him 150.

10:30.480 --> 10:35.580
So because we have changed the clause we have changed the clause to be medium how it is applying.

10:35.580 --> 10:41.460
If I just come here I hit this link and see 100 is being applying for medium products and 50 is the

10:41.640 --> 10:43.320
cost that is the main cost.

10:43.320 --> 10:43.790
OK.

10:43.860 --> 10:50.100
So seemed like this I can just come here a Can I just remove the class from here.

10:50.320 --> 10:56.740
OK let's from here to shipping let's just remove the class Ok let's come here and let's it update so

10:56.740 --> 11:00.730
far no shipping class no shipping class cost is zero.

11:00.730 --> 11:02.390
So only 15 will be applied.

11:02.410 --> 11:03.580
OK let's come here.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.580
Let's see I'm here and let's search for this.

11:05.950 --> 11:06.540
OK.

11:06.550 --> 11:09.040
This is still 150 Let's come here and let's rephrase this.

11:09.070 --> 11:10.180
You can see only 50.

11:10.190 --> 11:13.100
Will be right here because we haven't assigned any class right here.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.510
This is the normal product.

11:14.530 --> 11:14.980
OK.

11:15.190 --> 11:19.270
So this is how the shipping works and this works pretty well.

11:19.270 --> 11:24.040
That is why most people use this and most people do not know that this is how these type of shipping

11:24.040 --> 11:24.860
classes work.

11:25.030 --> 11:26.870
OK so now he does that.

11:26.980 --> 11:33.400
That is why I told you to please concentrate and please do not miss this section because this section

11:33.580 --> 11:35.480
is the basis of everything OK.

11:35.500 --> 11:39.680
You have to understand this and then so there will be no confusions later on.

11:39.700 --> 11:40.220
OK.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.660
So thanks a lot guys for watching this.

11:42.670 --> 11:45.530
In the next video we will be breaking up with the check out Deb..

11:45.610 --> 11:46.260
So stay tuned.

11:46.300 --> 11:46.890
And Bobby.
