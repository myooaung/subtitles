00:14.800 --> 00:19.550
So basically let's discuss that what is an e-commerce Web site OK.

00:19.570 --> 00:25.540
If we go to eBay dot com OK or we go to Amazon.com.

00:25.540 --> 00:25.890
OK.

00:25.900 --> 00:29.430
You can see that we have these type of websites.

00:29.470 --> 00:32.960
Well very fair that people can buy anything.

00:33.040 --> 00:33.460

00:33.610 --> 00:38.580
If they want to buy this purse or back or whatever you want to say OK they can buy it.

00:38.590 --> 00:44.750
So they just click here you can see this is the product so we have a specific page for our product and

00:44.740 --> 00:47.720
the people can select the color from them.

00:47.740 --> 00:48.170
OK.

00:48.280 --> 00:54.250
So if I want to select this color ok I selected this color ok and then I wanted the size so I need the

00:54.250 --> 00:55.180
size to be medium.

00:55.300 --> 00:55.880
OK.

00:55.900 --> 00:57.730
And then you can see that this is right here.

00:57.730 --> 00:58.490
I'm just going to do.

00:58.510 --> 01:00.420

And then he will ship that to me.

01:19.870 --> 01:20.190

OK.

04:22.490 --> 04:23.370
This is right here.

04:23.480 --> 04:28.880

04:34.160 --> 04:37.980
The auto focus auto focus is right running.

04:38.610 --> 04:43.880
So you can see that I have done this and again see that if I just go to my account right there

04:47.010 --> 04:48.340
or if I just go to my summary.

04:48.360 --> 04:49.380
Basically OK.

04:49.410 --> 04:51.300
I want to go to my summary

I bought this and these are the messages as well I can send messages to the sellers and everything.

05:20.590 --> 05:23.560
So we basically want to create a website like this.

05:23.560 --> 05:24.270
Not this much.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.810
This is a very heavy website.

05:25.870 --> 05:27.880
They have so many sellers like there.

05:28.060 --> 05:33.550
You want to create and you can create that as well but we will be creating a normal web site for a person

05:33.550 --> 05:38.320
who has an online shop who has a shop basically a physical shop and he wants to shop there or if anyone

05:38.320 --> 05:45.050
wants to start a drop shipping company and also show them how they can do that and everything OK.

05:45.100 --> 05:51.870

People can purchase online.

05:59.050 --> 05:59.530
OK.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.870
So we will be moving on this.

06:00.910 --> 06:05.010
So first of all what you have what we have to do is that we have to go with a WordPress plugin you can

06:05.020 --> 06:07.020
create a new subdomain name.

06:07.150 --> 06:12.820
OK you can see that WordPress is already installed and I have a name to my site my e-commerce site and

06:12.820 --> 06:18.250
just another WordPress website so we will be working on with this web will be changing this whole website

06:18.520 --> 06:19.690
into the e-commerce site.

06:19.690 --> 06:22.220
I'll show you how can you receive payments from Pay-Pal.

06:22.300 --> 06:28.150
And also I'll show you how can you integrate some other payment gateway to accept credit cards live

06:28.180 --> 06:30.100
on your website but you need some.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.680
There are some requirements for that.

06:31.690 --> 06:38.710

06:38.710 --> 06:40.150
