WEBVTT

00:00.680 --> 00:05.420
What is it guys and welcome back so now you can see that we're totally done with that website and now

00:05.450 --> 00:07.600
we will stop editing this website.

00:07.760 --> 00:14.000
OK we'll we'll be adding some and functionalities that people can hire us for one hour and then he has

00:14.000 --> 00:14.590

00:14.630 --> 00:18.990
He has to pay for like hourly bases on hourly basis if he wants to pay.

00:19.070 --> 00:24.800
He can be a credit card he can be that paid bill and then he can hire me for one hour.

00:24.890 --> 00:31.250
OK so we will be adding that functionality even we will be learning how to build an e-commerce website.

00:31.240 --> 00:36.560
OK so with that comes in the e-commerce category we'll learn this later on but first we will stop this

00:36.560 --> 00:37.750
project right now.

00:37.790 --> 00:42.580
We'll learn how to build a business type of upside in the upcoming section.

00:42.590 --> 00:43.310
Okay.

00:43.340 --> 00:44.960
And then we'll be working up for that.

00:44.960 --> 00:50.390
So this is a complete course and this will teach you each and everything that what things you can do

00:50.660 --> 00:53.630
with your WordPress website OK.

00:53.660 --> 00:57.490
So now we will stop this and we will be working with a new Web site.

00:57.500 --> 01:01.820
We will be building a website for a business.

01:01.820 --> 01:02.300
OK.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.880
So for that we basically need a domain name.

01:04.990 --> 01:05.350
OK.

01:05.390 --> 01:06.660
And we need to work on it.

01:06.710 --> 01:08.300
So we will do that.

01:08.900 --> 01:17.450
I'm just going to go to if you go to the home page and then we go to basically to see Vanel then you

01:17.450 --> 01:22.250
can see that we have one single domain name that is Aitan Ziel dot com.

01:22.370 --> 01:22.850
Okay.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.500
That was automatically registered.

01:24.500 --> 01:32.480
We have registered from Skidder OK but if we want to add one more domain name to it how we are going

01:32.480 --> 01:33.220
to add it.

01:33.230 --> 01:36.380
So basically we want to register that domain name.

01:36.380 --> 01:36.880
Okay.

01:36.890 --> 01:42.050
And I will register a domain name and then I will assign that to this hosting package that I can use

01:42.440 --> 01:47.390
that domain name for my more websites that I want to build.

01:47.390 --> 01:52.850
So this is the Web site that I personally want to build and now I want to I want to just register a

01:52.850 --> 01:57.910
domain name so that I can use that domain name for my testing website.

01:57.920 --> 01:58.400
OK.

01:58.490 --> 02:01.550
So I just need basically a domain name.

02:01.550 --> 02:06.970
So what I'm wanting to do I just want to go to domain names and let's go ahead and get assigned that

02:06.970 --> 02:08.610
one domain name so that we can create.

02:08.730 --> 02:09.890
And then there are second maps.

02:09.910 --> 02:10.480
OK.

02:10.490 --> 02:15.290
So we will basically be creating subdomain names you have two options if you want.

02:15.290 --> 02:22.670
If you don't want to just buy a new domain name then you can create subdomain names and test your own

02:22.690 --> 02:23.270
website.

02:23.430 --> 02:24.000
OK.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.140
How we're going to do that.

02:25.250 --> 02:28.890
You just have to go to the subdomain names.

02:28.940 --> 02:29.350
OK.

02:29.510 --> 02:35.850
And then you have to create a name of domain names that will be like my Web site one or another and

02:35.840 --> 02:38.470
say dot dot dot com.

02:38.540 --> 02:38.900
OK.

02:38.900 --> 02:41.330
And then you have to select the document Trude.

02:41.480 --> 02:47.020
OK you can just leave it as it is and then you can create it and then you can install WordPress in it.

02:47.090 --> 02:49.510
I'll show you later on in the next video.

02:49.550 --> 02:51.200
How can you do that.

02:51.370 --> 02:53.960
But first I'll be just moving on with a domain name.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.190
I'll just create a new domain name.

02:56.240 --> 03:02.150
OK I'll just register the new domain name and then I will add that here so that if I want to create

03:02.270 --> 03:08.920
a new or another say OK for like myself or for an other company so I'll just going to come here.

03:08.930 --> 03:13.380
I'm just going to click register a domain name in the domain section of portal.

03:13.460 --> 03:13.850
OK.

03:13.910 --> 03:19.970
And then it's going to take me to the website the page where I want to create where I want to register

03:19.970 --> 03:20.550
a domain name.

03:20.660 --> 03:24.890
So I'm just going to uncheck this because I don't want domain privacy and I want to just come here and

03:24.890 --> 03:30.080
I going to search create W.P..

03:30.400 --> 03:30.670
OK.

03:30.740 --> 03:33.940
So I just want to register them create a.

03:34.070 --> 03:35.700
And I'm just going to hit search.

03:35.750 --> 03:36.720
OK let's search.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.350
Create a W.P. dot com.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.210
So if I want to search this domain name it's going to search this domain name.

03:41.210 --> 03:43.810
Let's check if we can get a demeaning.

03:44.300 --> 03:52.310
So I'm just going to be buying a normal domain name that is costing me just like a single dollar so

03:52.310 --> 03:53.540
that I can teach you everything.

03:53.660 --> 04:01.610
OK so this is the this is on sale you can see it's original price is $15 and it is for 0.9 5.

04:01.640 --> 04:05.170
So I think I can go with this one so is create a site.

04:05.270 --> 04:06.030
OK.

04:06.200 --> 04:11.720
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit EC2 card so you can see that this is now added to my

04:11.730 --> 04:14.940
card OK.

04:15.290 --> 04:19.220
I just don't want to go with the dot com domain name you can see Congratulations your domain name is

04:19.220 --> 04:21.250
available create a WP dot com.

04:21.410 --> 04:26.870
So I didn't think so if I need this domain name but I'll be just going up for this one the normal one

04:26.870 --> 04:29.820
created WB site created to Lupi that site.

04:29.840 --> 04:30.420
OK.

04:30.440 --> 04:33.240
I'm just going to cancel this and I'm just going to go with this one.

04:33.350 --> 04:35.460
So this domain name will be buying.

04:35.540 --> 04:39.620
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to continue to check out an hour ago you can see that the same

04:39.650 --> 04:40.850

04:41.030 --> 04:47.360
And here I want to assign this domain name to my hosting package which is under this iTunes dot com

04:47.360 --> 04:48.660
that we registered.

04:48.680 --> 04:49.160
OK.

04:49.160 --> 04:53.780
So it is going it is so to use a credit gotten file.

04:53.780 --> 04:57.980
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit this and add privacy protection.

04:57.980 --> 05:02.260
No I don't want to add enter your online presence habitus county code so me.

05:02.300 --> 05:06.810
I'm already getting a discount on there so you can just buy a domain name for a single buck.

05:06.810 --> 05:11.360
Host gator mostly runs domain promotions so you can check that out which is for a single buck and then

05:11.360 --> 05:12.420
you can just buy it.

05:12.500 --> 05:12.760
OK.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.060

05:26.770 --> 05:32.090
the customer pool and then I can assign that domain name to my hosting package so that I can manage

05:32.090 --> 05:32.480
it.

05:32.570 --> 05:33.620

08:32.360 --> 08:33.630
This will be my subdomain name.

08:33.640 --> 08:35.960

10:40.020 --> 10:41.150
WordPress in it.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.260

10:42.270 --> 10:48.360
So we will be installing Wordpress and this right now but we will be moving on with another subdomain

10:48.420 --> 10:50.500
