00:27.690 --> 00:33.090
it is now matching our things so we don't have to add an orange image right here.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.160

02:32.880 --> 02:39.630
So I'm going to come here and I think basically we should not very we should not change the size of

02:39.630 --> 02:46.500
it so we should make it to normal client reviews OK.

02:46.630 --> 02:48.020
Or just change it.
