00:00.420 --> 00:04.140
What does a guy who's a walking Max an hour in this video will be working at the affiliate product.

00:04.140 --> 00:05.310
OK so let's just come here.

00:05.310 --> 00:11.450
Let's just go to the dashboard right here and I can see that if I want to sell any of the product I'm

00:11.490 --> 00:14.770
OK and that I do not on here.

00:14.880 --> 00:23.130
But I wanted to just tell them just send them to their side and then get commissions like if Amazon

00:23.550 --> 00:27.860
is a company OK how Amazon works is that Amazon has the affiliations.

00:27.870 --> 00:28.600
OK.

00:28.770 --> 00:36.180
And this means that if you just say just send the customers to Amazon with your link your specific link

00:36.310 --> 00:39.420
then you are going to get a sale or you are going to get a commission.

00:39.420 --> 00:43.400
So here should be it should be here OK.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.070
This one become an affiliate.

00:45.170 --> 00:52.580
OK you can just go here to affiliate program unturn person advertising fees with the trusted e-commerce

00:52.580 --> 00:52.940
leader.

00:52.940 --> 00:54.570
So how you can do you can join.

00:54.800 --> 00:59.890
You can advertise it and then you can earn 10 percent of the commission from them.

00:59.960 --> 01:06.150
OK so this is how this Amazon affiliate products were so let's suppose that I am now joined here.

01:06.170 --> 01:07.680
I want to advertise here.

01:07.700 --> 01:10.880
So what what I'm going to do I'm just going to go to Amazon right here.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.730
And let's suppose that I need a hoodie.

01:12.770 --> 01:13.180
OK.

01:13.310 --> 01:16.660
And then what I'm going to do I'm just going to go to the array here.

01:16.700 --> 01:17.920
I'm just going to church.

01:18.170 --> 01:18.560
OK.

01:18.560 --> 01:22.480
And then I basically want to get this one.

01:22.520 --> 01:22.970
OK.

01:23.020 --> 01:24.660
I want to pummel this one.

01:25.790 --> 01:30.290
That's one let's just come here and here and this one I'm just going to go ahead.

01:30.320 --> 01:31.790
I'm going to download this image first.

01:31.820 --> 01:33.960
I'm just going to save it yes OK.

01:34.130 --> 01:37.480
And then I'm going to come here and I'm going to save right now so you can see this I mean just right

01:37.490 --> 01:39.380
here and I'm just going to go to dashboard.

01:39.380 --> 01:43.820
I'm going to go to the products and then I'm going to go to I said that I can add an affiliate products.

01:43.820 --> 01:48.400
How does affiliation work is that you have to send Amazon customers.

01:48.640 --> 01:49.290
OK.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.350
And then you'll get a share.

01:51.410 --> 01:57.300
If someone buys the product from your keyword you will be getting a reference ID.

01:57.410 --> 02:01.880
OK you just have to sign them them is sign up to Amazon and then you will get that.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.150
So and then you have to add that.

02:04.150 --> 02:10.130
So let's suppose that this is my favorite reference Heidi that RDF is equal to s underscore I sort of

02:10.130 --> 02:11.270
underscore one underscore.

02:11.270 --> 02:14.920
So if someone buys this product from this link.

02:16.760 --> 02:20.570
OK then it is going to download the cookie into the browser.

02:20.570 --> 02:22.430
I hope you understand what I am saying.

02:22.730 --> 02:23.030
OK.

02:23.030 --> 02:28.940
Like if someone buys the product from this link this specific link there is a reference link and under

02:32.590 --> 02:32.960
OK.

02:32.990 --> 02:33.770
