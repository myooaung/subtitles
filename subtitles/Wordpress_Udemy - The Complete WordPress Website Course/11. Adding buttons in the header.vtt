00:00.970 --> 00:05.870
What is it guys and welcome x so in this video we're going to be adding to burden's right here.

00:05.890 --> 00:12.300
So the first burden is going to take me to the down of the service that's going to tell me about myself

00:12.310 --> 00:20.050
so I'm going to add a little bit about myself and then the second burden is going to take me to to contact

00:20.050 --> 00:22.790
me or contact us or contact in Ziel.

00:22.900 --> 00:24.670
So you can just create two buttons.

00:24.670 --> 00:25.170
OK.

00:25.210 --> 00:28.050
So for that I want to just click this guy.

00:28.120 --> 00:28.750
OK.

00:28.810 --> 00:33.970
We want to add any element we have to click this guy so I'm going to just say this and you can see that

00:33.970 --> 00:35.050
I am right here.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.420
So I need Dubard.

00:36.520 --> 00:40.890
So that is why I want to add two columns because this is important.

00:41.020 --> 00:43.330
So I'm just going to grab this column's OK.

00:43.510 --> 00:46.620
I'm just going to drag it and drop it right here.

00:46.630 --> 00:47.050
OK.

00:47.110 --> 00:48.760
You can see it is coming great here.

00:48.760 --> 00:49.850
I'm just going to drop it for you.

00:49.870 --> 00:52.830
You can see that inside this column.

00:52.930 --> 00:53.790
This is the column.

00:53.910 --> 00:54.360
OK.

00:54.370 --> 00:56.610
And I can add two buttons right here.

00:56.620 --> 01:00.640
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to go to this guy right here again.

01:00.850 --> 01:01.310
OK.

01:01.510 --> 01:04.210
And you can see that these are the two columns right here.

01:04.240 --> 01:05.990
So I'm just going to go with the burden.

01:06.190 --> 01:08.410
I'm just going to try this and right here.

01:08.620 --> 01:08.980
OK.

01:09.100 --> 01:14.770
And I'm just going to click this guy once again and I'm going to track this button right here so you

01:14.770 --> 01:16.090
can see that this is the burden.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.260
And this is the burden.

01:17.260 --> 01:22.420
So we have two buttons right here and tell you to call them so you can see what I did.

01:22.570 --> 01:30.070
I just added two columns right here first and then I just crack this guy once again and I crack this

01:30.070 --> 01:30.550
burden.

01:30.550 --> 01:35.020
Then I click this guy once again and I cried desperate and then he can see that these two burdens are

01:35.020 --> 01:42.310
here in this column so I can just added this whole section and I can added this even column where I

01:42.310 --> 01:47.980
can add to this column and this is the whole column so you can see inside this column would have one

01:47.980 --> 01:48.870
section.

01:48.970 --> 01:52.540
And inside this section we have two columns.

01:52.540 --> 01:53.560
So this is very easy.

01:53.620 --> 01:56.850
You just have to drag a column and then you have to do it.

01:56.860 --> 02:06.790
So now what I'm going to do I just want to align this to right side so that it basically come closer.

02:06.880 --> 02:11.690
So I'm just going to come here and this I'm just going to have to hit this and it's going to come here

02:11.980 --> 02:13.540
and this is added Button.

02:13.540 --> 02:16.300
So I'm just going to drag it or I'm just going to hit a line right.

02:16.300 --> 02:21.130
You can see that if I just come here click here you can see that these are the two buttons right here

02:21.130 --> 02:23.810
that says Click Me and click me.

02:24.560 --> 02:25.280
OK.

02:25.360 --> 02:31.900
And now here it is going to be I'm just going to make some editing.

02:31.900 --> 02:35.160
I'm going to make these change like amazing and you guys are going to love it.

02:35.170 --> 02:35.610
OK.

02:35.740 --> 02:42.130
So for this I want the text to be about me.

02:42.440 --> 02:42.860
OK.

02:42.990 --> 02:54.130
And for this one the text to be Kahn attacked me or I can even add higher me

02:59.060 --> 02:59.480
OK.

02:59.690 --> 03:01.010
So I have two buttons.

03:01.060 --> 03:03.440
I have about me and then hire me.

03:03.440 --> 03:08.720
So let's just come here and we have the About Me section.

03:08.750 --> 03:11.330
I want it don't just link it to anywhere.

03:11.330 --> 03:16.770
This you can add a hash tag that is going to say that this is that dummy link and it will lot work.

03:16.820 --> 03:17.320
OK.

03:17.330 --> 03:20.870
Until then unless I assign any length so you guys already know about linking.

03:20.900 --> 03:21.290
OK.

03:21.380 --> 03:25.250
Now what I want I want to go to the timing of this.

03:25.250 --> 03:27.960
So I'm just going to go to the style.

03:28.250 --> 03:28.760
OK.

03:28.820 --> 03:35.420
And I don't want to think that I should go with the type graphy but the background color.

03:35.500 --> 03:35.940
OK.

03:35.960 --> 03:41.420
I want to change the background color so the background color is going to be

03:44.490 --> 03:45.310
all right.

03:45.580 --> 03:48.470
I think the background color should be transparent for this.

03:48.550 --> 03:52.930
So I'm just going to go head I'm going to hit this and I want to make this fully transparent so you

03:52.930 --> 03:55.140
can see that the background color is transparent.

03:55.330 --> 04:00.200
And instead I want a border so I want to go with the border and that is going to be the solid.

04:00.270 --> 04:03.180
So it's it is going to be too big.

04:03.180 --> 04:05.200
So OK.

04:05.290 --> 04:07.900
And the border color is going to be black.

04:10.620 --> 04:11.400
It looks cool.

04:11.400 --> 04:16.790
Let's just go with five pixel by pixel is very big.

04:16.990 --> 04:20.680
So I think of one pixel looks cool.

04:20.800 --> 04:21.440
OK.

04:21.770 --> 04:25.280
Now we have the border radius of about a radius I think it should be 25

04:28.190 --> 04:28.890
OK.

04:29.730 --> 04:30.950
Well it's just like this

04:35.110 --> 04:35.520
OK.

04:35.660 --> 04:39.130
You can see how this is looking this is looking very amazing.

04:39.300 --> 04:40.640
OK.

04:40.850 --> 04:41.470
What I want.

04:41.470 --> 04:41.820
Great.

04:41.830 --> 04:44.070
Now here.

04:44.180 --> 04:48.460
This is going to be the we have the border type.

04:48.510 --> 04:50.640
We have the burden right here.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.150
We have the background color.

04:52.290 --> 04:55.700
So I want to go read the Hoover effect.

04:55.710 --> 05:01.920
So for Hoover I want it to be like if I bring my mouse over here this is basically this reference to

05:01.920 --> 05:02.660
the Hoover.

05:02.670 --> 05:08.520
So Hoover means that if you can see that when we were editing the image we went to this style and then

05:08.520 --> 05:10.830
we went to the Hoover animation.

05:10.860 --> 05:19.080
And Hoover like if I just bring my mouse over here this means is upping this I mean just floating basically.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.290
So I'm like this.

05:20.330 --> 05:27.460
I'm just going to come here and I want to go to the style and I want to go to the Hoover section.

05:27.510 --> 05:33.240
So if someone brings his mouse to it then it should change the color so it should change the background

05:33.240 --> 05:35.990
color to be full black and.

05:36.180 --> 05:42.520
And you can see how this is looking cool.

05:42.660 --> 05:47.560
The animation is going to be float.

05:47.640 --> 05:51.000
So I didn't think if this is looking great.

05:51.010 --> 05:51.810
So

05:59.910 --> 06:05.880
now let's just go to Cro now.

06:05.980 --> 06:09.540
I think I don't need any animation because this is looking a bit cheap.

06:09.580 --> 06:11.250
So I think this is looking great.

06:11.500 --> 06:11.900
OK.

06:11.980 --> 06:19.950
And this looks pretty bell about me and that I need to just configure disburden.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.660
So this is going to be the higher me and the higher me is going to be.

06:26.720 --> 06:33.590
Let's just go to the style and I want to go to the background color some background color is going to

06:33.590 --> 06:37.790
be bluish and bluish.

06:37.790 --> 06:39.820
Just make it a bit of cream.

06:40.130 --> 06:43.750
And then just OK those looks cool.

06:45.260 --> 06:45.950
This looks cool.

06:46.050 --> 06:46.880
OK.

06:46.950 --> 06:48.110
I want to go to the water tape.

06:48.130 --> 06:49.500
It's going to be solid.

06:49.870 --> 06:50.560
OK.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.980
I mean the bottom radius is going to be 25 pixel.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.840
So this is looking cool.

06:55.050 --> 06:55.470
OK.

06:55.470 --> 07:02.190
I want a border to be one pixel so and the color is going to be the normal treat.

07:02.820 --> 07:03.450
OK.

07:03.570 --> 07:05.820
And here we go.

07:07.200 --> 07:13.150
So if someone brings his mouse to this then we need a other effect.

07:13.470 --> 07:15.040
And that is going to be.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.580
So I need to bring them out over here.

07:16.580 --> 07:17.640
Hoover OK.

07:17.670 --> 07:23.550
And I need to change the color to be the background color should be changed to transparent

07:26.950 --> 07:27.590
OK.

07:27.610 --> 07:28.680
This is looking so cool.

07:28.790 --> 07:29.450
So

07:35.670 --> 07:43.180
the background colors changing to transparent and the border color is going to be this full so I think

07:43.220 --> 07:46.440
I need more border show for this.

07:46.450 --> 07:52.750
I want to go to pixel.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.560
This looks cool.

07:55.100 --> 08:00.040
I was just come here and you can see that I have two buttons that tell you about me and this is higher

08:00.060 --> 08:00.590
me.

08:00.670 --> 08:10.120
So I think this screen needs to be changed to another color because this is not pretty visible to me.

08:10.130 --> 08:10.780
So

08:15.450 --> 08:19.310
OK I'm just going to go with the normal one and I'm going to change the background color.

08:19.530 --> 08:25.060
So let's just change the background color and test which background color suits us

08:35.570 --> 08:36.010
this one

08:40.140 --> 08:41.180
OK.

08:41.260 --> 08:42.180
This is looking cool.

08:42.340 --> 08:45.340
So we have about me and then we have hired me.

08:45.340 --> 08:47.010
So we have two buttons right here.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.340
OK.

08:48.490 --> 08:49.780
Let's just go to

08:53.390 --> 08:58.610
the Condon area and the space is going to be medium.

08:58.730 --> 09:05.260
So we have two buttons and this one should be all so medium.

09:05.720 --> 09:06.470
OK.

09:06.470 --> 09:07.820
Now this is visible.

09:09.090 --> 09:09.860
About me.

09:09.970 --> 09:10.360
Me.

09:10.410 --> 09:11.720
So this looks cool.

09:11.760 --> 09:12.640
This looks great.

09:12.660 --> 09:13.200
OK.

09:13.320 --> 09:19.180
I think I should change this to be the four

09:30.990 --> 09:39.690
so I think I should make this the full that I'm going to come here and I want to go to the table graphy

09:40.080 --> 09:45.810
and the transformation should be to uppercase So I think this upper case is looking great.

09:45.810 --> 09:50.300
So you can also change the font and weight of these as well if you want to.

09:50.560 --> 09:51.470
OK.

09:51.620 --> 09:55.700
I think it is looking pretty well right here about me and the higher midsection.

09:55.710 --> 09:58.060
So everything is looking great.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.380
So we have this let's just review all of the things.

10:01.380 --> 10:01.720
OK.

10:01.860 --> 10:06.010
So first of all we added this back when we were with the section.

10:06.030 --> 10:06.920
Not this.

10:06.990 --> 10:11.190
But first we then we added this title right here.

10:11.390 --> 10:11.970
OK.

10:12.300 --> 10:16.320
We aligned this title to the center by just clicking this.

10:16.350 --> 10:22.170
And then we went to this alignment and we just kid this so it was then a line to center.

10:22.170 --> 10:22.520
OK.

10:22.620 --> 10:29.000
And then we added an image by just clicking this guy we just dragged that image from here we'll just

10:29.000 --> 10:32.230
drag the tray here and then we chose the thumbnail.

10:32.490 --> 10:36.090
We added the image OK and we aligned this to center.

10:36.090 --> 10:37.980
Then we went to the style section.

10:38.010 --> 10:38.370
OK.

10:38.460 --> 10:44.220
And then we added the water radius at that it turned to circle k because we added the radius.

10:44.220 --> 10:49.870
Then we added the border the border color.

10:50.070 --> 10:55.230
We just just decreased some of the transparency so that it looks great.

10:55.230 --> 10:55.630
OK.

10:55.770 --> 10:58.120
And we also added the border type to be solid.

10:58.200 --> 11:04.400
Then we added the animations so that if anyone brings his mouse you can see that the image is going

11:04.410 --> 11:04.980
above.

11:05.220 --> 11:05.570
OK.

11:05.640 --> 11:09.260
We also added the text shadow to right here.

11:09.300 --> 11:16.950
Then we also added this professional tag line by just dragging this text editor right here.

11:16.950 --> 11:18.260
We edit this.

11:18.330 --> 11:24.240
But if I just click this you can see that I added this content that I went to the style section.

11:24.240 --> 11:27.700
I just change the color to be white and a bit of tree.

11:27.960 --> 11:30.940
I turned on the type of graphy I increase the size.

11:30.960 --> 11:33.810
I chose the font to be open Sans.

11:33.900 --> 11:36.150
And I changed the way to be 300 to that.

11:36.150 --> 11:39.080
It is a bit of thin and it looks great.

11:39.090 --> 11:39.450
OK.

11:39.570 --> 11:42.530
Then I did nothing.

11:42.540 --> 11:42.800
OK.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.110
So then I added the two columns.

11:45.310 --> 11:52.710
OK I just clicked this column I just dragged it under this column right here so that it becomes a whole

11:52.770 --> 11:53.580
section.

11:53.580 --> 11:53.860
OK.

11:53.940 --> 11:57.100
And in this section we have two columns.

11:57.420 --> 12:02.010
So in this one column we added disburden and then we click this guy.

12:02.010 --> 12:07.930
Then we added this button right here and then we just change make the changes say this is very easy.

12:08.010 --> 12:14.010
This elemental plug in is so easy and you guys are going to love it and you guys will start building

12:14.010 --> 12:14.480
a website.

12:14.490 --> 12:16.820
You can see how this is looking.

12:17.330 --> 12:17.830
OK.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.350
So thanks a lot guys for watching this.

12:19.350 --> 12:24.540
Still here in the next video we're going to add a new section and that is going to be about me.

12:24.570 --> 12:25.050
OK.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.710
And then we're going to add some more.

12:26.730 --> 12:28.940
So Stadio owned and bought by.
