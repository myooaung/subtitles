WEBVTT

00:00.520 --> 00:02.110
What is getting engaged and welcome back.

00:02.110 --> 00:07.510
So in this video we're going to create a new page and that will be the higher mean page so if someone

00:07.510 --> 00:13.300
clicks this button or if someone clicks this then he should be redirected to the new page that says

00:13.300 --> 00:14.380
hire me.

00:14.380 --> 00:16.710
So that is going to be fun.

00:16.990 --> 00:19.420
We'll be using this elemental plug in to talk.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.050
OK.

00:20.050 --> 00:22.090
And we're going to be we're coming up with this.

00:22.120 --> 00:29.230
So we need to customization is that if someone clicks this button on computer devices than it should

00:29.230 --> 00:35.710
open up a pop up right here and if someone clicks this hired me button on mobile devices or smaller

00:35.710 --> 00:38.470
devices than it should take them to the page.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.330
So we're going to do that as well.

00:40.360 --> 00:42.820
In this word press OK and it is also easy.

00:42.880 --> 00:47.390
And also one more thing that I would like to say is that if I just decrease the size of my web sites

00:47.390 --> 00:53.950
or if I just come here and if if someone is viewing this website on a mobile device then you will see

00:53.950 --> 00:56.240
that this website will not look good.

00:56.370 --> 00:56.820
OK.

00:56.860 --> 00:57.810
Let me just show you.

00:57.820 --> 01:02.070
You can see how this is coming this is coming really above and this.

01:02.170 --> 01:05.110
This is coming here disburden is right here.

01:05.110 --> 01:06.740
This is the line that is coming.

01:06.760 --> 01:08.140
And this is coming like this.

01:08.170 --> 01:10.030
What I can do is perfect.

01:10.060 --> 01:12.960
Need a professional developer is not looking good.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.100
So I want to I want to just small the fun of this and everything.

01:18.100 --> 01:23.110
So we're going to also do this mobile optimization as well because this is also very important if you

01:23.110 --> 01:25.050
want to create a web site.

01:25.150 --> 01:29.890
And Google really emphasizes on a Web site to be mobile responsive and user friendly if your website

01:29.980 --> 01:34.870
is not user friendly and mobile responsive then Google will not send you traffic and we will not consider

01:34.870 --> 01:38.870
your website to be the best so make sure that you Daddy-O website is mobile responsive.

01:38.890 --> 01:41.550
I'll show you later on said Do not worry.

01:41.590 --> 01:42.220
I'm here.

01:42.220 --> 01:42.490
OK.

01:42.550 --> 01:43.560
So let's get started.

01:43.570 --> 01:48.160
And what we want to do is that we want to create a new page and that is going to be that if someone

01:48.160 --> 01:51.300
clicks disburden on mobile device then it should be taken to that page.

01:51.340 --> 01:58.090
And if someone takes this burden on a normal device or like a computer I am on a computer than it should

01:58.090 --> 02:00.130
open up a pop up right here.

02:00.160 --> 02:03.160
So person can just enter his details.

02:03.160 --> 02:03.540
OK.

02:03.730 --> 02:06.070
So let's get started.

02:06.820 --> 02:10.670
First of all what I have to do I have to just hit save.

02:11.200 --> 02:11.590
OK.

02:11.710 --> 02:14.630
And you can see that this has been saved right here.

02:14.650 --> 02:18.340
I'm just going to go here and I'm going to hit this exit and I'm going to go to the dashboard

02:21.030 --> 02:25.560
and I want to create a new page so we're not totally done with our home page we're going to add some

02:25.560 --> 02:26.290
more stuff.

02:26.290 --> 02:30.670
But in our home page so we'll just add some more stuff later on.

02:30.680 --> 02:36.210
But first I want to build a new hire me page so I'm just going to click here to add Neal.

02:36.330 --> 02:37.720

02:39.990 --> 02:46.800
And I just want to come here to the default template that should be the default template.

02:46.830 --> 02:50.150
And I want to go down word taste to out.

02:50.160 --> 02:57.310
It should be 100 percent full that the headers should be minimal.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.770
So we need to select the minimal right here.

02:59.770 --> 03:03.490
We don't want to select the transparency because we don't want to be transparent.

03:03.490 --> 03:10.270
I'm going to like just to be minimal and I'm going to go down and word to the title I'm going to come

03:10.270 --> 03:11.400

You can see that this is howre pages looking.

03:25.140 --> 03:28.890
The reason is that I haven't made the speech to be transparent.

03:28.890 --> 03:33.400
OK so if you want it to be transparent you can go with that you can go with the default if you choose

03:33.400 --> 03:34.640

06:43.760 --> 06:46.860
And I want to just bring this to center here.

06:48.550 --> 06:50.280
So this is a line center.

06:50.400 --> 06:57.450
When I come here to style I want to come here is this guy right here and let's choose to color to be

06:57.450 --> 06:59.170
white.

06:59.220 --> 07:03.120
Let's come here to the topography let's increase the size

07:06.330 --> 07:14.030
of family and it should be open sounds the fate should be 300.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.490
So here you can see that this is home of absurdest looking.

07:16.560 --> 07:19.220
We have this hire me right here.

07:19.440 --> 07:19.920
OK.

07:19.920 --> 07:20.720
Now what I want.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.740
You can see that this is transparent.

07:22.830 --> 07:23.340
OK.

07:23.550 --> 07:25.290
This is just because it is.

07:25.290 --> 07:27.830
This team is thinking that we have the transparent hatter.

07:27.890 --> 07:30.000
What do we have made the customization there.

07:30.030 --> 07:34.700
So if I just go to and deal dot com and then slash and then hire me

07:39.000 --> 07:41.160
then you will see how my website is looking.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.610
You can see this is on my website.

07:42.750 --> 07:50.300
Again this is not getting the thing that the header to be minimal.

07:50.440 --> 07:55.320
So I'm going to go ahead I'm going to update Basically I wanted the header to be minimal.

07:55.410 --> 07:57.540
So I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit the beach.

07:57.610 --> 07:57.990
Here you go.

07:57.990 --> 08:02.790
This is how my head is looking so if you want your head to look transparent you can go with this but

08:02.790 --> 08:04.860
I think transparency is looking much better.

08:04.890 --> 08:10.270
So I'm just going to I'm here and I'm going to edit page and I'm going to go down.

08:10.300 --> 08:13.200
I want to go to the header and it should be the default one.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.400
So let's go ahead and let it update.

08:15.400 --> 08:19.060
So default one will trap the default settings from the user.

08:19.120 --> 08:22.080
You guys know about the customizes and how the customized works.

08:22.080 --> 08:22.360
OK.

08:22.480 --> 08:26.450
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit view page and this is how my body just looking.

08:26.450 --> 08:31.630
We have a higher me and then I want to add a content section Rahel should be a contact form where people

08:31.630 --> 08:38.150
can just enter his name address his business name and his phone number and then he can hire me for like

08:38.170 --> 08:43.040
ten dollars or something like that so you can sell it later on.

08:43.040 --> 08:44.920
Well we'll be adding a contact form only.

08:44.920 --> 08:45.340
OK.

08:45.430 --> 08:47.730
So we'll be doing that in the next video so stay tuned.

08:47.740 --> 08:48.400
And bloddy.
