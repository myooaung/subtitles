00:00.550 --> 00:05.210
What does a guy and what can accent out in this video we're going to be making up in more sections.

00:05.250 --> 00:05.640
OK.

00:05.650 --> 00:10.670
You can see that in the video we work with this this and this and that.

00:10.680 --> 00:16.170
So we added four sections right here and these are making our rooms look so amazing.

00:16.270 --> 00:16.730
OK.

00:16.780 --> 00:20.650
So now here you can see that we can make some changes to the blorb model.

00:20.650 --> 00:21.210
OK.

00:21.220 --> 00:27.260
I'm just going to come here and you can see that if I just go to the design.

00:27.400 --> 00:27.830
OK.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.820
And then I go to the image and icon and you can see

00:35.280 --> 00:36.530
I can just change it.

00:36.760 --> 00:38.700
OK I can change the circle icon.

00:38.730 --> 00:44.550
I told you this and then we have this right here so you can also make your services look like this.

00:44.550 --> 00:50.650
And then you can just increase the size if you want to and make it look like how you want it.

00:50.790 --> 00:53.480
OK but I'll be just going with the normal one.

00:57.300 --> 00:57.730
OK.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.420
And this is how I like it.

00:59.430 --> 01:02.160
So you can change it according to your needs.

01:02.190 --> 01:02.850
OK.

01:02.880 --> 01:09.000
And then we work with this and that so if you don't want any of the background color and if you think

01:09.000 --> 01:11.160
that it is not looking good then it can change it.

01:11.190 --> 01:15.890
What you can do you can just come here you can go to the background right here.

01:16.130 --> 01:16.600
OK.

01:16.620 --> 01:22.380
And then you can click this you can see this is totally gone there there's no background color right

01:22.410 --> 01:23.140
here.

01:26.370 --> 01:27.890
So you can do it like this.

01:27.930 --> 01:28.540
OK.

01:28.590 --> 01:30.630
And I'll be just moving up.

01:30.630 --> 01:35.370
I'll be just entering the Control see because I think I like the way it is.

01:35.610 --> 01:36.000
OK.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.150
And now the next thing that we want tray here beneath it is it should be like how this company works.

01:44.190 --> 01:44.590
OK.

01:44.640 --> 01:50.550
So you can add it pretty well right about here so that below you can add a call to action right below

01:50.550 --> 01:52.470
the call to action if you want to.

01:52.560 --> 01:57.690
OK so I'm just going to come here come here and I'm going to hit this guy right here that he's adding

01:57.730 --> 01:58.300
section.

01:58.410 --> 01:58.910
OK.

01:58.980 --> 02:01.650
I want to click here and here is the regular one.

02:01.710 --> 02:03.280
I want this right here.

02:03.280 --> 02:03.750
OK.

02:03.810 --> 02:11.220
A new section is created so I'm just adding it right below here so we can just tell our users that how

02:11.460 --> 02:13.610
our company works.

02:13.650 --> 02:14.530
So we have a go.

02:14.580 --> 02:21.960
I'm just going to come here I need for this column or a here and then here I want to give

02:24.700 --> 02:25.170
heading.

02:25.210 --> 02:27.400
So for heading we need a text

02:30.060 --> 02:30.950
OK.

02:31.300 --> 02:32.510
Here we go.

02:32.940 --> 02:38.060
And here and he's come here to the visual right here and I need to add the heading.

02:38.160 --> 02:41.700
So this rule is not loading.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.780
So let's him here to the text itself.

02:47.260 --> 02:51.890
OK so I'm going to come here I'm going to hit this gear icon and I need the text right here.

02:51.920 --> 03:04.710
I'm going to come here and I need to hit it so my heading is going to be how we work ok.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.600
I'm going to make it the heading 1.

03:06.650 --> 03:10.490
So if you just come here right here you can see this is now changed to heading 1.

03:10.490 --> 03:14.360
So I'm going to go to that design right here I'm going to go to that text and I'm going to align it

03:14.360 --> 03:15.610
to the center.

03:15.620 --> 03:16.270
There they go.

03:16.280 --> 03:16.670
OK.

03:16.700 --> 03:20.160
I'm going to go to the convent and then I'm going to go to the design itself.

03:20.170 --> 03:21.430
I'm going to just check it.

03:21.530 --> 03:28.930
I'm going to go to the heading text and then here I need the heading for to be the open sands.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.070

Cool.

03:49.880 --> 03:50.200
OK.

03:50.210 --> 03:55.360
Let's choose the fun to be the regular so that it matches this one OK.

03:55.700 --> 03:56.750
And what else we want.

03:56.750 --> 03:57.570
We want to go down.

03:57.590 --> 04:00.510
We want to go down and fan.

04:01.490 --> 04:01.890
OK.

04:01.970 --> 04:07.070
We're totally done with this what we have to do right now is that we need to change the color of this

04:07.070 --> 04:07.620
work.

04:07.880 --> 04:08.820
So I'm going to come here.

04:08.930 --> 04:09.910
I'm going to select it.

04:09.950 --> 04:14.150
I'm going to just bring it from here to here and I'm going to choose the color and my color is going

04:14.150 --> 04:15.680
to be the orange one right here.

04:15.830 --> 04:16.350
OK.

04:16.400 --> 04:18.450
I need a heading so let's come here.

04:18.470 --> 04:20.520
Let's click the plus button right here.

04:20.540 --> 04:23.920
I need to just come here and I need divider right here.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.110
So here we go.

04:25.340 --> 04:27.080
And I want to show the divider.

04:27.200 --> 04:35.330
So my divider deciding that the color should be the orange and the style should be solid and the divider

04:35.330 --> 04:36.380
position is stop.

04:36.470 --> 04:40.850
I want to go to this site using the vaid should be three tree pixel.

04:40.880 --> 04:41.300
OK.

04:41.390 --> 04:43.170
And I want to go ahead David.

04:43.220 --> 04:46.350
So fed is going to be.

04:47.170 --> 04:52.490
Let's bring in descender and let's decrease the bet so let's freeze or decrease or decrease it.

04:52.490 --> 04:54.700
So we get the right position.

04:54.710 --> 04:56.820
So I think it looks cool.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.470
I want to go to the advance tray here.

04:58.490 --> 05:00.420
I'm going to go to that design.

05:00.440 --> 05:05.900
Let's go to this spacing and the margin should be decreased a bit to 15 pixel.

05:06.160 --> 05:10.430
So 15 pixel I didn't think so 10 pixel looks great.

05:10.610 --> 05:13.120
Let's quickly let's just enter and here we go.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.170
You can see we're totally done with this.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.950
Now what we want is that we need to just give a background to deaths.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.070
So Dad it separates it.

05:21.160 --> 05:21.610
OK.

05:21.740 --> 05:26.160
I want to go to let's just give this one the background OK.

EBay eBay EBAY.

05:34.550 --> 05:34.960
OK.

05:34.970 --> 05:40.110
And you can see this is a bit cray and this is right.

05:40.130 --> 05:42.910
So this is totally separating from each other.

05:42.920 --> 05:43.340
OK.

05:43.430 --> 05:48.320
I'm going to come here right here and let's just come here to the how we work section.

OK.

09:28.630 --> 09:30.910
We have to basically now copy it.

09:31.060 --> 09:34.870
But first we have to design this and then we'll just duplicate it and pasted right here.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.360
So I'm going to go to the design right here.

09:36.370 --> 09:40.230

15:33.830 --> 15:39.900
I think we need to give decrease some padding from here but let's increase it from this.

15:43.430 --> 15:45.920
It is managing to increase it more

15:48.740 --> 15:55.300
try to make sure that the distance between this and this is the same don't just increase or decrease

15:55.300 --> 15:56.560
it and to do it like this.

15:56.560 --> 15:56.950
OK.

15:57.010 --> 16:01.840
So you can see the distance between this and this is also same and everything is looking totally OK

16:01.870 --> 16:07.960
if you want to decrease the distance from the Tabari You can also increase and decrease it from the

16:07.970 --> 16:08.600
site as well.

16:08.680 --> 16:09.050
OK.

16:09.100 --> 16:14.100
So you can see everything is looking pretty awesome.

16:14.210 --> 16:14.700
Okay.

16:14.740 --> 16:18.910
And this is our whole web site and this is totally done.

16:18.910 --> 16:21.330
So let's have a look at just how it is looking.

16:21.340 --> 16:25.730
I'm just going to click here and again see how this is looking so you can see that we have the head

16:25.740 --> 16:26.350
array here.

16:26.380 --> 16:28.250
And then we have our services section.

16:28.330 --> 16:29.580
We have a call to action.

16:29.620 --> 16:32.830
We have how we work section and then we have the client tribute.

16:32.830 --> 16:37.930
So this is a perfect home page example and you can see how our Web site is looking.

16:38.480 --> 16:39.020
OK.

16:39.080 --> 16:44.200
Now if we add a little gray here and then we match the color of this letter and then you will see how

16:44.260 --> 16:50.670
amazing it's going to look.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.460
