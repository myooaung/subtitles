00:00.690 --> 00:04.290
What is a guy who's didn't max KMAX now in this video will be working over the tax option.

00:04.290 --> 00:08.650
So it is asking that value be entering the price it's inclusive of tax.

00:08.750 --> 00:11.190
So like that I don't have to manage everything right here.

00:11.190 --> 00:12.030
OK.

00:12.660 --> 00:15.860
The tax will be automatically inclusive.

00:15.870 --> 00:16.340
OK.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.900
No evil enterprise is exclusive of tax.

00:18.900 --> 00:23.050
If I just select it then the tax will be will have to be added in my cart.

00:23.070 --> 00:23.540
OK.

00:23.640 --> 00:30.240
So then we have Kalika text based on customer shipping address customer billing address or Shaw base

00:30.330 --> 00:36.420
address so if you are if you just care about the shop data for whatever product we sell to we have to

00:36.420 --> 00:38.210
sell that 16 person GSD.

00:38.250 --> 00:43.910
If I am in Pakistan and if I am in U.S. I have to send 15 percent if I am in London I have this in 20

00:43.930 --> 00:45.540
person or something like that.

00:45.540 --> 00:52.670
So you can where we can do customer shipping address for the tax as well but I will be moving on with

00:52.670 --> 00:53.900
the shop base address.

00:53.950 --> 00:58.660
OK so Shaw base address will be this the cash to calculate tax based on.

00:58.800 --> 01:05.160
And then in the standard range we have to define that if someone is in Pakistan and then he will be

01:05.160 --> 01:10.240
charging him 15 percent or something like that and then we have shipping tax Clontz.

01:10.260 --> 01:18.060
So this is shipping tax clause based on card items so then we have standard used 0.

01:18.140 --> 01:19.630
So you can select only one.

01:19.630 --> 01:21.590
And then you have to stick on it okay.

01:21.620 --> 01:26.300
So it is going to be selecting the standard because the shipping tax clause is going to be like this

01:26.300 --> 01:33.050
so you can you can shipping next clause based on current items so you can define that later on in the

01:33.050 --> 01:40.020
product that that this tax will be applied to this class so you can basically create three classes okay

01:40.040 --> 01:45.350
and four more Biola you can go over this to produce three trees or four something like that.

01:45.360 --> 01:49.050
If so if you're sending to government or something like that then you can go and see it or they create

01:49.220 --> 01:49.930
something like that.

01:49.930 --> 01:50.470
OK.

01:50.520 --> 01:53.140
So but I will be moving up with the standard rate here.

01:53.240 --> 01:58.070
Okay because I will be moving up the standard rates and this will be applied to all of the customers.

01:58.070 --> 01:59.860
Every tax is the same.

01:59.960 --> 02:00.410
Okay.

02:00.440 --> 02:03.790
And then we have consolidated to be like customers shipping address.

02:03.800 --> 02:04.350
Okay.

02:04.370 --> 02:09.630
And then we have the rounding around at subtotal level instead of rounding per line.

02:09.770 --> 02:14.690
What is there is that when it will generate an invoice in the card section.

02:14.720 --> 02:19.970
Okay so let's just go to our store right here and then let's add a product okay to the card.

02:20.210 --> 02:20.510
Okay.

02:20.510 --> 02:26.650
And on product you can see Ajax is rake here I click view card and then you can see that it will round

02:26.660 --> 02:28.170
per line the tax year.

02:28.280 --> 02:34.890
So instead of this I want to add this check out the subtotal just something like that.

02:34.970 --> 02:38.550
So you can just select this and this will be around at the subtotal level.

02:38.660 --> 02:43.910
Okay then we have the additional tax classes you can add the tax classes right here and they will be

02:43.910 --> 02:44.930
added right here.

02:44.990 --> 02:50.630
Okay so I will be just removing them because I don't want them I just want these standard rates and

02:50.630 --> 02:52.230
this will be applied to everything.

02:52.300 --> 02:52.730
Okay.

02:52.760 --> 02:58.160
And then we have display play appraise in the shop so this will be including tax excluding tax.

02:58.220 --> 03:04.130
I'm just going to have excluding tax so that I get more sales and then we have display more pract display

03:04.130 --> 03:06.390
prices D-ring card and check out.

03:06.410 --> 03:12.270
So you have to hit including tax because I'm doing card and checkout.

03:12.270 --> 03:17.230
You have to show the tax but you can also select and excluding tax and it will be only available right

03:17.230 --> 03:17.640
here.

03:17.700 --> 03:18.460
Tax options.

03:18.460 --> 03:18.980
OK.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.220
And then we have price displaced suffixed so you can add like and what is this like here you can add

03:24.920 --> 03:25.880
NCVS.

03:25.930 --> 03:27.890
This means that inclusive of tax.

03:27.900 --> 03:29.640
So you can't add a suffix right here.

03:29.790 --> 03:30.270
OK.

03:30.350 --> 03:31.970
But I will leave it as default.

03:32.080 --> 03:37.000
OK and then we have the displayed tax totals so it is going to be itemized not as a single total.

03:37.000 --> 03:37.540
OK.

03:37.630 --> 03:42.040
So let's just come here and lotted save for a here and you can see these two will be deleted because

03:42.040 --> 03:47.310
we have removed them from here and now let's go to the standard rates and let's add some tax rates right

03:47.320 --> 03:47.590
here.

03:47.680 --> 03:51.740
Okay I'm going to go here I'm going to get into it Carol and then I'm going to add the country code

03:51.740 --> 03:54.120
to this is going to be OK for my country.

03:54.130 --> 03:58.360
And then we have the state court I have to leave this as Treyc so that it will be applied to all of

03:58.360 --> 03:58.970
the countries.

03:58.980 --> 04:03.820
And then I have to also leave this stretch so that it will be applied to all the postcodes I have to

04:03.820 --> 04:08.470
leave it as it is so that it does apply to every city and then I have this right here.

04:08.470 --> 04:10.400
So this is going to be person data.

04:10.420 --> 04:15.340
I'm going to add 16 person and the tax name is DSD Gorman's sales tax.

04:15.340 --> 04:19.540
And this is going to be priority and I'm going to had shipping so it's going to be applied to shipping

04:19.540 --> 04:22.380
and then I'm going to hit save changes right here.

04:22.450 --> 04:22.930
OK.

04:23.020 --> 04:30.430
I'm going to come here I'm going to hit refresh right now and you can see that DSD is now added instead

04:30.430 --> 04:31.300
of GSD.

04:31.330 --> 04:36.620
You can add it like 80 and the V8 the name is going to be added so Same like this.

04:36.760 --> 04:37.930
Exactly same.

04:37.960 --> 04:42.300
And when I come here and I just refreshed it you're going to see this right here.

04:42.600 --> 04:43.070
OK.

04:43.120 --> 04:48.250
So you can add one more and this here would be the country with a two digit Kundry go to example us

04:48.250 --> 04:49.910
leave to apply to all.

04:49.990 --> 04:55.050
So for us I'm going to I'm going to charge them sorry for UK.

04:55.220 --> 04:57.350
Just go with us for us.

04:57.370 --> 05:02.700
I'm going to charge them to 200 person tildes that's ok.

05:03.040 --> 05:03.870
Just kidding OK.

05:03.970 --> 05:09.100
I'm going to I'm here I'm going to hit refresh right now and you can see that I'm not in the US.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.800
That is why this is coming right here.

05:10.870 --> 05:17.230
If I am in the U.S. or if I use any sort of VPN to go the U.S. So it lets me just come here and let

05:17.230 --> 05:18.820
me select to the U.S. right now.

05:18.820 --> 05:19.200
OK.

05:19.330 --> 05:20.000
Let me get him here.

05:20.020 --> 05:24.580
Let me Slyke to you as you can see us is selected and then I come here and then I refresh this you're

05:24.580 --> 05:29.510
going to see that it full Krabbe the location of my shipping address.

05:29.530 --> 05:34.670
And then it also tell me that I'm in the U.S. and then it will charge me 200 percent text.

05:34.690 --> 05:35.020
OK.

05:35.020 --> 05:35.870
Let me come here.

05:35.950 --> 05:40.330
Let me select us from here because it is not just give.

05:40.480 --> 05:46.550
It has first got the IP address and then it is right here in the cache.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.820
So I have to just search for United States.

05:49.320 --> 05:49.880
OK.

05:49.930 --> 05:53.890
And then I come here I just said this and again see and then on clicking update totals you're going

05:53.890 --> 05:56.600
to see it is going to change to 200 percent.

05:56.620 --> 05:57.810
So here you go.

05:57.910 --> 05:59.190
So this is out going to work.

05:59.200 --> 06:05.660
OK I'm going to come here I'm going to switch it off let's come here and here you can see that you can

06:05.690 --> 06:12.080
also add a default category like if someone is not in Pakistan if someone is not in us then this will

06:12.080 --> 06:12.620
be applied.

06:12.620 --> 06:18.360
So if someone is not in any of them than we will charge them zero percent of debt.

06:18.380 --> 06:18.780
OK.

06:18.890 --> 06:22.780
So let's go ahead and let's say OK and then let's come here.

06:22.860 --> 06:29.980
And if someone is in like let's suppose if someone is UAE and then I hit a day total you're going to

06:29.980 --> 06:31.810
see no tax will be here.

06:31.900 --> 06:32.500
OK.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.070
So this is how it is working.

06:34.090 --> 06:36.590
This is how this tax works so you have to enter the country.

06:36.730 --> 06:40.420
And then you have to integrate that how you want the rate to be and then it will be added.

06:40.420 --> 06:45.780
So thanks a lot guys for watching this and as you can see that we're done with the tax tab as well.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.700
In the next video we will be working up the shipping tab.

06:48.820 --> 06:49.600
So stay tuned.

06:49.600 --> 06:50.200
And Bob.
