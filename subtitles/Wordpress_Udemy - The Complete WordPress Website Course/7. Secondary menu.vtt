01:47.390 --> 01:50.550
Let's have a look at our Web site and you're going to love the look of this.

01:50.580 --> 01:55.480

02:02.170 --> 02:05.860
So now we're totally done with this and this what you're going to be working on with the sidebars So

02:05.860 --> 02:11.430
let's just go to the dashboard and let's have a look at a sidebar so you guys already know about it.

02:11.450 --> 02:16.450
But I'm just telling you about it so I'm going to go to the tray here and here we can manage the sidebar

02:16.780 --> 02:22.830
so let's open this up in a new tab as well to see our life changes so what we're doing.

02:22.830 --> 02:23.780
I'm going to come here.

02:24.040 --> 02:26.190
And first of all let's delete everything.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.460
I'm going to go search right here I'm going to delete it.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.720
I'm going to go to a recent post.

02:30.730 --> 02:31.870
I'm going into it laded.

02:31.900 --> 02:37.390
I'm going to go to recent comments and I'm also going to delete it so it's deletes everything from here.

02:37.930 --> 02:41.180
OK here we go.

02:41.200 --> 02:48.430
Also one thing that I want to show is that make sure that you guys audio API key and the extra team

02:48.460 --> 02:52.710
option so that you can update your theme if any update releases.

02:52.720 --> 02:58.250
OK you go to updates right here you can see here would be your a name of the elegant things.

02:58.360 --> 02:58.710
OK.

02:58.840 --> 03:02.180
Let's go to the elegant right now here would be your name for that.

03:02.320 --> 03:02.780
OK.

03:02.800 --> 03:07.210
And then here would be the key that you have to grab it from the account.

03:07.330 --> 03:11.890
You have to go to the account right here and then in the key section here would be your IP.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.460
You have to get that EPA key and then you have to paste it.

03:14.590 --> 03:19.790
So how this will work is that if any update gets released you can update your theme and make sure that

03:19.790 --> 03:24.220
you keep updated because this is also important for your security and your everything.

03:24.330 --> 03:24.740
OK.

03:24.850 --> 03:28.870
Not just like if any of decreases you just you just don't have to update it.

03:28.900 --> 03:35.470
Then you have to wait for like one week so that that that is like a Wii you can also read reviews and

03:35.470 --> 03:40.610
make sure the Wii evade at least vuln week before updating or theme and updating avoid process.

03:40.620 --> 03:41.750
Well this is the tip.

03:41.830 --> 03:42.700
Make sure to do that.

03:42.700 --> 03:43.200
OK.

03:43.270 --> 03:44.820
Now you just did it right there.

03:44.910 --> 03:45.390
