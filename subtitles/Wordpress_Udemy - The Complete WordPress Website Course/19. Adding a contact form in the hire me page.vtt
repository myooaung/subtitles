00:01.820 --> 00:03.320
What is up guys and walk a mile.

00:03.330 --> 00:06.830
So in this video we are going to be adding a contact form.

00:06.880 --> 00:10.350
OK let's just come here and refresh this page

00:14.490 --> 00:14.960
Okay.

00:14.960 --> 00:20.180
And here you can see that we cannot add a form from this tab.

00:20.180 --> 00:23.050
You can see that we don't have the option to add a form.

00:23.210 --> 00:23.600
OK.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.910
So we basically want to go with a plug in.

00:26.000 --> 00:26.380
OK.

00:26.420 --> 00:29.690
And that plug in will have different styles and the form.

00:29.690 --> 00:33.450
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit adenine section and let's add

00:33.470 --> 00:34.060
this.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.420
And so here we want to install a plugin.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.720
OK what do you have to do we have to just go to I.

00:38.770 --> 00:40.630
And Zele dot com.

00:40.910 --> 00:44.020
And then it will take you to new page here we go.

00:44.090 --> 00:47.360
You can see and then I have to go to the dashboard.

00:47.780 --> 00:49.250
And then I have to go to the plug ins.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.990
And now we have to hit add Neal.

00:51.020 --> 00:56.750
So we basically need to add a plug in and that plug in would be a contact form so that I can add a contact

00:56.750 --> 01:01.070
form and if someone enters his information that contact form will send me an email.

01:01.070 --> 01:02.690
So here you go.

01:03.050 --> 01:07.710
Contact from.

01:07.910 --> 01:12.020
So this is the plug in that I personally use that I use for all of my clients.

01:12.020 --> 01:19.010
OK so that is why I used this plug in for all of my kind so I'll be going up at this plug in.

01:19.010 --> 01:25.250
You can go with any of the plug in that you want to but conduct phone 7 is the most used plug in.

01:25.310 --> 01:26.930
And I would recommend you to go with this.

01:26.930 --> 01:27.350
OK.

01:27.410 --> 01:33.020
Let's go ahead and let's after installing You have just said activate and you can see that this plug

01:33.020 --> 01:34.850
in will be activated.

01:34.850 --> 01:37.630
There you go you can see that it takes contact form 7.

01:37.670 --> 01:41.950
The elementary notion extra plug in everything is installed and activated.

01:42.080 --> 01:50.300
So this blue line this is coming this shows that the plug in is the normal plug and you can see everything

01:50.300 --> 01:51.340
is coming right here.

01:53.470 --> 01:54.300
OK.

01:54.490 --> 02:00.670
Now what I have to do I have to just come here to settings you can just come here or you can directly

02:00.670 --> 02:03.980
come here to the contact and you have to hit contact forms.

02:04.000 --> 02:04.660
OK.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.640
And then you can see that it sees the contact from one.

02:07.690 --> 02:09.670
So we don't want to add this.

02:09.670 --> 02:11.160
We just want to add a new form.

02:11.170 --> 02:13.230
We have to just add Neal.

02:13.360 --> 02:13.820
OK.

02:13.900 --> 02:17.290
And there we can see that it says and title here we have the label.

02:17.350 --> 02:19.100
We have the text area.

02:19.270 --> 02:20.510
We have e-mail.

02:20.770 --> 02:22.730
We have the subject.

02:22.750 --> 02:24.400
And then we have the message.

02:24.400 --> 02:28.760
So what I want I want here.

02:28.760 --> 02:34.120
So it would be your name then the label would be or email and everything.

02:34.140 --> 02:36.200
So I wanted a title here.

02:36.270 --> 02:46.650
The title was going to be higher me from OK and here should be your name should be your e-mail address

here should be an e-mail address and there should be the subject and it should be the message.

02:51.630 --> 02:57.600
So what I want right now on this subject for this subject I want to hear this and instead I want to

02:57.630 --> 02:59.180
add a text area.

02:59.370 --> 02:59.920
OK.

03:00.090 --> 03:07.750
And on the text area I want to ask the client to enter his business information or his business name.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.140
So I'm going to select this and I'm going to hit text.

03:10.230 --> 03:10.680
OK.

03:10.830 --> 03:13.680
And this text area can be required field.

03:13.800 --> 03:19.380
And this this name is going to be USA any SS business name.

03:19.500 --> 03:23.580

We can make this field required if we want to.

03:53.370 --> 03:54.780
