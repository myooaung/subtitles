00:02.180 --> 00:06.590
Now in this video we will be very king up with the About page ok so I'm just going to go ahead.

00:06.600 --> 00:08.620
I'm going to hear about Krait now.

00:08.820 --> 00:09.200
OK.

00:09.200 --> 00:13.830
And in here I want to just add that to lay out so I'm just going to go ahead.

00:13.830 --> 00:17.460
I'm going to hit that page right now and then here I'll be taken there.

00:17.490 --> 00:17.790
OK.

00:17.790 --> 00:21.090
And then I have to upload that so I'm just going to go to d'Este right now.

00:21.330 --> 00:25.860
And then here it is to use the builder and then I have to hit load from library.

00:25.860 --> 00:26.640
I have to.

00:26.820 --> 00:28.790
So we have predefined layouts as well.

00:28.800 --> 00:32.400
So if you want to use this as well you can also use this.

00:32.520 --> 00:37.740
You don't have to just add anything you don't have to add any of the juice on file and you just have

00:37.740 --> 00:39.350
to upload it like that about us.

00:39.490 --> 00:39.890
OK.

00:39.990 --> 00:40.770
And this is right here.

00:40.770 --> 00:46.020
And then when you click used a visual builder you'll see how it is going to look so it will just upload

00:46.020 --> 00:51.600
the predefined layout that comes of it so you can see this is how your website the look.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.300
This is Preedy Finally old you don't have to add anything.

00:54.390 --> 00:58.140
You don't have to add any of the chase Ansal so you can see this is how it is located.

00:58.200 --> 01:02.770
Does our story is this is how the team member one is and everything.

01:02.790 --> 01:04.270
OK so this is the pre-define Leo.

01:04.290 --> 01:05.910
Basically I'm just going to go ahead.

01:05.910 --> 01:08.670
I'm going to come here and I am going to

01:14.190 --> 01:17.490
load from library and from library.

01:17.910 --> 01:21.900
So here I want that the thing that we added to.

01:21.930 --> 01:23.010
I just won that team.

01:23.010 --> 01:24.570
I just want to focus on that.

01:24.750 --> 01:28.570
So make sure that you replace the existing gone dead which is destroyed here.

01:28.710 --> 01:30.660
And I want the About page.

01:30.690 --> 01:31.900
This is about it.

01:31.920 --> 01:32.600
Yes.

01:32.610 --> 01:37.110
When did start about take and see this is right here and this has been added to you can see how this

01:37.110 --> 01:41.030
is looking awkward is the new new We're just the new you.

01:41.250 --> 01:43.010
So you can see this effect.

01:43.110 --> 01:44.200
It just goes up.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.970
This is seamlessly.

01:46.320 --> 01:46.980
I just love it.

01:46.980 --> 01:47.450
OK.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.440
I am just going to show you how this is made today.

01:49.440 --> 01:54.790
You don't get confused ok if I just come here and I just click here you can see this is the settings

01:54.800 --> 01:56.360
so this is that it was sitting right here.

01:56.370 --> 02:00.210
And if we go to design the backbone then I can see nothing easier.

02:00.270 --> 02:01.250
If I just come here.

02:01.290 --> 02:05.490
You can see nothing is here OK.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.940
But if we go to the column to Bactrim This is like this.

02:08.990 --> 02:09.440
OK.

02:09.710 --> 02:16.520
So column 2 this is the column to OK and column one back from just like this so you can see how this

02:16.520 --> 02:17.600
is looking.

02:17.810 --> 02:23.330
This is looking like we just have the column to crown and we don't have anything pretty well in this

02:23.660 --> 02:26.300
column do background image to be set to beat X.

02:26.300 --> 02:32.540
We can also choose it to beat any you can see column do on image Plen can be multiplied it can kinda

02:32.540 --> 02:34.850
like dark can or something like that.

02:34.850 --> 02:41.330
So if I just come here and I just click here then you can see we have a module and if we go to background

02:41.950 --> 02:42.470
and see

02:47.250 --> 02:53.380
let's just come here and let's click this guy right here so that we should switch on the grid module.

02:53.460 --> 02:53.800
OK.

02:53.890 --> 02:55.460
You can see how this is looking.

02:55.690 --> 02:56.380
OK.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.060
If I just come here and

03:03.900 --> 03:04.890
let me just click here.

03:04.920 --> 03:10.340
This guy I want to go to background this this

03:16.690 --> 03:17.490
this one

03:20.690 --> 03:21.240
face.

03:21.330 --> 03:22.700
This has got this one.

03:22.740 --> 03:24.710
I want to just go with this one.

03:24.870 --> 03:26.060
OK let's get him here.

03:26.070 --> 03:30.150
Let's go down and call him 1 1/2 disarray here

03:35.110 --> 03:36.990
OK I don't know why this is not working here.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.090
Let's just come here and let's just work for this.

03:39.160 --> 03:42.890
If I just come here you can see this is the whole background image OK.

03:43.030 --> 03:44.980
You can see this is the whole bar code name is like this.

03:44.980 --> 03:46.540
This is the whole background image.

03:46.780 --> 03:47.710
And then they go down.

03:47.750 --> 03:51.340
Then I have the column one Bactrim which is to call them 1.

03:51.510 --> 03:54.100
So you can see call one is this whole this.

03:54.370 --> 03:55.850
OK this is set to color.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.160
OK this is set the color if I just decrease it.

03:58.300 --> 04:03.320
If I just make it transparent you can see how this color is looking OK but I'm going to make it full.

04:03.460 --> 04:03.800
OK.

04:03.910 --> 04:07.410
And then we go down and then we have the image right here.

04:07.510 --> 04:07.840
OK.

04:07.960 --> 04:12.490
So this is the image.

04:12.670 --> 04:16.780
If it does go to a library and then I go down.

04:16.780 --> 04:22.430
This is the image basically you can see this image is set to transparent.

04:22.450 --> 04:24.360
If I just tried to open this image up.

04:24.370 --> 04:24.890
OK.

04:25.150 --> 04:27.900
Let me just open this image first.

04:28.330 --> 04:32.060
I'm just going to I'm here I'm going to copy to you or L and I'm going to paste it right.

04:32.410 --> 04:32.770
OK.

04:32.920 --> 04:36.690
And then I come here and I just open it up you can see how this is looking OK.

04:36.820 --> 04:41.690
If I want to make the background image like black I can also make it what I'm going to do.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.410
I'm just going to save this image first.

04:43.530 --> 04:44.000
OK.

04:44.110 --> 04:47.860
I'm going to open this up right here and then I'm going to open this up in Photoshop so I'm going to

04:47.860 --> 04:48.900
open this up in Photoshop

04:51.810 --> 04:55.650
let's just click here and it'll automatically be opened up in the show because I've said my piece in

04:55.650 --> 04:59.940
the image just opened up in a photo shop so this will be opened up enough for the shop and then I have

04:59.940 --> 05:02.520
to select this color and I have to make it black.

05:02.550 --> 05:03.000
OK.

05:03.010 --> 05:06.540
So I'm just going to show you how how what I'm saying.

05:07.110 --> 05:16.550
But first I have to come here I have to just click here and I have to select just one column one Bactrim

05:16.620 --> 05:17.090
OK.

05:17.210 --> 05:21.700
So column one background color should be set to a color that I want to focus on.

05:21.700 --> 05:26.720
So I just want to focus on not this but a bit of the

05:34.110 --> 05:36.560
so let's suppose that I want this image OK.

05:36.890 --> 05:39.510
What I'm going to do right now I'm just going to copy this color code first.

05:39.510 --> 05:40.510
This is important guys.

05:40.530 --> 05:42.360
Just make sure you copy the color.

05:42.750 --> 05:43.830
Then come here.

05:44.040 --> 05:47.720
Then you have to click here and then you have to base the color code here.

05:51.660 --> 05:53.180
Base the color code here.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.480
Just select this one.

06:28.310 --> 06:30.390
OK cool.

06:30.400 --> 06:35.140
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to go down to this one right here and I want to upload the

06:35.140 --> 06:36.950
black one that we have got this.

06:37.060 --> 06:38.020
So I'm going to upload it.

06:38.030 --> 06:42.080
I'm going to select the file and I am going to just selected from here.

06:42.090 --> 06:43.400
So it should be here.

06:44.770 --> 06:48.690
Yes this is the one I'm just going to click here and it can see this image just right here.

06:48.690 --> 06:52.640
So you can just design this image with Adobe Illustrator.

06:52.740 --> 06:53.090
OK.

06:53.190 --> 06:54.800
You can see how this image is looking.

06:54.810 --> 06:55.090
Yes.

06:55.170 --> 06:59.220
Of course this is exactly looking like that that we designed.

06:59.700 --> 07:00.300
OK.

07:00.300 --> 07:01.140
This is how it is looking.

07:01.140 --> 07:02.830
So this is how you can create this image.

07:02.850 --> 07:03.310
OK.

07:03.360 --> 07:07.860
Now if you want to create an image like this you can go with Adobe Illustrator.

07:08.040 --> 07:13.340
OK you should be having a know how often a software if you wanted to go with this effect because they're

07:13.350 --> 07:21.290
designing is basically comes under the graphic designing as well because that is also important.

07:21.300 --> 07:30.600
So now here when you see it obolus Shrader is on you can see here you can basically design this type

07:30.600 --> 07:31.170
of effect.

07:31.170 --> 07:32.540
You just have to go ahead.

07:32.640 --> 07:37.830
You have to select the square or rectangle and then you have to make it down here you have to give some

07:37.830 --> 07:39.140
effect like this.

07:39.180 --> 07:40.230
And then you can design it.

07:40.230 --> 07:45.480
So let me just get in here and let me just close this for shall pray here.

07:48.620 --> 07:49.460
Let me come here.

07:49.610 --> 07:50.530
So I just come here.

07:50.540 --> 07:58.150
I just open up a new file right here and then I want to design it so I can design it.

07:58.160 --> 07:58.750
OK.

07:58.760 --> 08:02.310
It is going slow because the background is also running there.

08:02.480 --> 08:06.110
And also some things I'm going to go to print right now and this should be

08:09.200 --> 08:10.280
let's just go with the print.

08:10.550 --> 08:11.150
OK.

08:11.150 --> 08:12.250
And this should be right here.

08:12.290 --> 08:13.070
I'm just going to go ahead.

08:13.070 --> 08:13.520
I'm going to

08:17.710 --> 08:18.610
this is right here.

08:18.760 --> 08:19.920
I'm going to make it bigger.

08:21.430 --> 08:26.520
And what I'm going to do right now I'm going to go ahead I'm going to grab this quarter OK.

08:26.620 --> 08:27.540
So this is it right here.

08:27.640 --> 08:30.600
OK what I'm going to do right now I'm just going to add this anchor point.

08:30.610 --> 08:33.260
So I'm I'm going to add the anchor point here

08:39.050 --> 08:46.090
let's just click here anchor points so I'm just gonna grab this anchor point this anchor point this

08:46.240 --> 08:48.470
anchor point in this point.

08:48.950 --> 08:51.370
And this.

08:51.820 --> 08:53.040
Ok now I'm going to come here.

08:53.080 --> 08:59.280
I'm just going to drop this rag here and I'm going to drag it so you can see this is how you can create

08:59.280 --> 09:00.540
these type of effect.

09:01.990 --> 09:06.510
And this is all all created with after so sorry this Adobe Illustrator.

09:06.520 --> 09:12.340
So you can see how this is looking if I just come here and I just add the anchor point here and I'm

09:12.340 --> 09:14.140
going to grab this phrase here.

09:15.150 --> 09:16.820
So you can see how this is looking.

09:17.430 --> 09:17.960
OK.

09:18.060 --> 09:21.810
I can now just bring it any where I can now just drag it right here.

09:21.960 --> 09:30.090
And this is how it's looking so I can just save it as a BNZ I can just open this up in Photoshop and

09:30.090 --> 09:31.010
then I can work with it.

09:31.020 --> 09:35.650
I can dismiss save it as it Binjie and then I can add a background image and then I can upload it there.

09:35.850 --> 09:39.040
So this is how you basically create this type of effect.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.580
But for this you have to focus on the illustrator.

09:42.600 --> 09:47.430
I would recommend you not to go into here just first Lunda web development and then go in the graphic

09:47.430 --> 09:52.530
designing to not go into graphic designing right now because this is not necessary right now.

09:52.560 --> 09:56.060
So this is we're about this is looking I'm just going to I'm here I'm going to change the look of this

09:56.060 --> 09:58.130
and I'm just going to change the color of this too.

09:58.130 --> 09:59.490
All right.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.560
I'm going to change the color of this white

10:07.970 --> 10:08.330
OK.

10:08.330 --> 10:10.040
You can see how this is looking.

10:10.220 --> 10:11.790
Everything looks great here.

10:13.310 --> 10:14.550
Old is the new new.

10:14.570 --> 10:18.760
And this testimonials fray here you can see this is the image we have.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.750
This is the actual Five-Star of you

10:23.540 --> 10:29.200
and Artane section is right here and get the news about sealed in new products so you can see there's

10:29.240 --> 10:33.190
so many things that you can do to create a website OK.

10:33.320 --> 10:37.850
And you can design any type of website I didn't show you this effect just because you guys don't know

10:37.850 --> 10:43.130
about graphic designing and I do not want to confuse you but I just wanted to show you how this is created

10:43.430 --> 10:47.540
so that you do not be like oh my god we can not create this you guys can do that.

10:47.540 --> 10:49.590
Seriously guys you can do that.

10:49.610 --> 10:51.400
You just learn live web development first.

10:51.460 --> 10:51.950
OK.

10:52.040 --> 10:57.670
And then you'll be good enough then you can go to the lowest trader effects.

11:00.230 --> 11:02.650
OK you can see that we're totally done with this.

11:02.690 --> 11:05.820

I'm going to go to this.

11:31.130 --> 11:35.980
An ad from library.

11:36.070 --> 11:43.200
So this is loading all the effects all the pre-made layouts that we have in the library and I need contact.

11:43.610 --> 11:44.010
Here we go.

11:44.010 --> 11:47.170
This is all the contact us pages headquarters warehouse.

11:47.190 --> 11:49.530
E-mail us and everything.

11:49.530 --> 11:56.220
So if you want to change the look of this if you want to get the different vibe of the website for this

11:56.220 --> 11:59.670
like if you want to change the background for this you can do go with that.

11:59.670 --> 12:00.560
You can do change it.

12:00.570 --> 12:06.540
I have showed you guys so now you can do it with the color scheme but I would highly recommend you not

12:06.600 --> 12:10.700
to go to colors just school with the shades of one single color.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.490
You can go over that tree.

12:12.510 --> 12:13.960
For sure you can go with that.

12:14.050 --> 12:19.350
We don't use many colors and you say that that was your shape a not look at so you can see that we have

12:19.440 --> 12:23.430
all the pages set up you can see everything is totally ok.

12:23.430 --> 12:26.640
Everything is cool and now in the next video we'll be working in the shop.

12:26.670 --> 12:28.040
This is so important guys.

12:28.050 --> 12:32.280
I'm going to show you how this is going to work if I just exit the visual builder and then I open up

12:32.280 --> 12:36.020
my shop page to see how bad it looks.

12:36.050 --> 12:40.500
And sorry guys but you can see I want to change this.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.550
How will they change this.

12:41.550 --> 12:45.630
