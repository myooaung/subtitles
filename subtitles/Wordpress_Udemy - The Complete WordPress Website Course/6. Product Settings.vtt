WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:01.650
What is up guys it won't come out.

00:01.650 --> 00:06.980
So now in this video we will be setting working up a web that generate all of the product setting.

00:06.990 --> 00:07.560
OK.

00:07.560 --> 00:11.070
So we have a general display and Rountree and downloadable products.

00:11.070 --> 00:13.100
OK so let's just go with the general right now.

00:13.230 --> 00:14.870
OK we have the vaid unit.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.960
This is the K.G. you can select Pound's if you want to.

00:18.090 --> 00:18.520
OK.

00:18.540 --> 00:23.010
But we will be going up to the cage and the dimensions unit is going to be sending me her.

00:23.040 --> 00:23.660
OK.

00:23.740 --> 00:29.580
So this will help you in controlling the shipping rate and everything like if the estate is to K.G.

00:29.580 --> 00:31.950
you can add one more shipping in that.

00:31.950 --> 00:32.500
OK.

00:32.520 --> 00:36.280
So you can add that OK and then we have the Enable reviews.

00:36.300 --> 00:36.810
OK.

00:36.840 --> 00:42.860
So how this is going to work if I just come here you can see that people can review my product from

00:42.930 --> 00:44.350
here that we at it.

00:44.400 --> 00:51.660
So and this is this is showing that you can enable the reviews show varified owner label on customer

00:51.660 --> 00:59.240
reviews what they mean is that if someone has bought this product right here and then he leaves the

00:59.240 --> 01:07.020
review then it will show a verified owner in the bad crown in the brackets that this person has basically

01:07.350 --> 01:09.660
bought this specific product.

01:09.690 --> 01:17.340
So this I mean OK so you can just show it and you can also just check it that reviews can only be left

01:17.610 --> 01:26.150
by verified owners if I just selected and save the changes and then I come here and refresh this.

01:26.290 --> 01:31.480
You can see that I haven't bought this product so I cannot add the preview.

01:31.480 --> 01:36.500
You can see is only customers who have protégées this product Meleager view.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.290
This is coming.

01:37.330 --> 01:44.620
Since I haven't purchased this product since this product is not under my account page and under the

01:44.620 --> 01:48.730
orders section since I don't have made any order yet.

01:48.850 --> 01:52.930
That is why I can not add Live View review right here.

01:52.930 --> 01:53.360
OK.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.610
So this is what they mean.

01:54.670 --> 01:59.770
OK and then we have the Enable star ratings and then we have the star rating should be required not

01:59.800 --> 02:00.430
optional.

02:00.430 --> 02:00.830
OK.

02:00.940 --> 02:03.950
So this is really very important because we meaning to add this story.

02:03.970 --> 02:06.640
So reviews can be left by varified owners.

02:06.640 --> 02:11.890
I'm just going to uncheck this but I would highly recommend you to check this out because reviews should

02:11.890 --> 02:14.070
only be left by varified owners and other ways.

02:14.100 --> 02:15.940
What is the reason of the revues man.

02:16.060 --> 02:20.380
Seriously if no one has bought the product then they would be fake reviews and something like that and

02:20.380 --> 02:22.570
your company's name would go down.

02:22.570 --> 02:27.330
So make sure that its Check this one this is really important and OK and then we have to go to the display

02:27.330 --> 02:30.230
array here and in the display we have the show page.

02:30.860 --> 02:32.010
OK.

02:32.140 --> 02:37.630
The shop page displays show products you can show the categories and show the categories and the products

02:37.990 --> 02:38.990
in the shop page.

02:39.030 --> 02:39.360
Okay.

02:39.370 --> 02:42.040
And then we have the default category display.

02:42.040 --> 02:46.690
So its going to show the products show subcategories show subcategories and products.

02:46.690 --> 02:47.140
Okay.

02:47.260 --> 02:51.000
So what they mean basically I mean to explain you everything.

02:51.250 --> 02:53.220
So this is basically the shop page.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.920
If we go to all pages.

02:56.110 --> 02:57.140
Okay.

02:57.970 --> 03:02.580
And then here we go to shop right here so you can see these pages are default.

03:02.630 --> 03:03.430
Create it.

03:03.670 --> 03:06.660
If we go to shop page right here and there we just said it

03:10.270 --> 03:12.640
then you can see who does nothing.

03:13.550 --> 03:15.490
Okay there's nothing coming.

03:15.710 --> 03:17.830
But this is the view commers shop page.

03:17.830 --> 03:21.130
This space is a special archive that list your product.

03:21.140 --> 03:21.780
OK.

03:21.920 --> 03:26.530
So I'm just going to come here and you can see shop page is my space.

03:26.540 --> 03:30.300
I can choose any other page to be my shop page as well.

03:30.310 --> 03:36.410
By the bye if this is created this is created the shop I just created why would I need to add any other

03:36.410 --> 03:41.110
product I had any other product associated that to the shop.

03:41.200 --> 03:41.590
OK.

03:41.660 --> 03:47.270
So then we have the shop page display the shop page will only display the products.

03:47.270 --> 03:51.220
It will not display the categories otherwise it would look a mess.

03:51.230 --> 03:51.680
OK.

03:51.830 --> 03:58.700
You can design your home page but your shopping should only show all the products that has been added

03:58.730 --> 03:59.880
to your site.

04:00.070 --> 04:00.480
OK.

04:00.590 --> 04:07.310
So if I just select If I select the shop and show categories and then I come here and then I refresh

04:07.310 --> 04:13.820
my site you're going to see instead of this here will be a category and this is showing t shirts.

04:13.880 --> 04:14.610
OK.

04:14.690 --> 04:16.000
I'm just going to come here again.

04:16.040 --> 04:22.370
I'm going to select my shop page show the product if I select shop and show categories and products

04:22.640 --> 04:24.400
then I'm going to show both the things.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.700
OK let's just come here.

04:26.720 --> 04:29.560
You been see T-shirts and T-shirts from men.

04:29.750 --> 04:34.170
So it is so all so confusing so make sure that you select only one.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.320
Otherwise it totally depends upon you what settings you want to go with.

04:37.350 --> 04:40.820
Then we have to show products the fall category display.

04:40.880 --> 04:46.130
If I just come here and I open this up you can see that here I have the T-shirts.

04:46.160 --> 04:49.390
This is basically called the default category.

04:49.430 --> 04:56.330
If I come here you can see it is showing default category display products only you can show subcategories

04:56.330 --> 04:58.160
we can assign subcategories.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.520
You already know about it.

04:59.660 --> 05:04.580
So you can also show subcategories and you can also show subcategories and products.

05:04.580 --> 05:10.360
But since we can't this is the default one so this will all be applied to all the categories.

05:10.370 --> 05:15.970
We can make some categories that we're going to work with and we're going to add to be like.

05:16.100 --> 05:19.830
These categories will only show subcategories only.

05:19.920 --> 05:20.350
OK.

05:20.480 --> 05:24.860
I'm going to show you that how can you create those categories that only show the subcategories and

05:24.860 --> 05:27.080
not the products associated with it.

05:27.080 --> 05:27.890
OK.

05:28.400 --> 05:33.150
And then we have the fall product starting this is like custom ordering and the name.

05:33.210 --> 05:39.480
So like it they'll be like how the product will start on the page right here.

05:39.510 --> 05:44.730
If I just go to shop page right here you can see that my products are basically sart sordid.

05:44.760 --> 05:45.140
OK.

05:45.210 --> 05:45.930
I'm just going to come here.

05:45.930 --> 05:49.790
I'm going to show products and then I'm going to hit CVS right now because I want to show the products

05:49.790 --> 05:54.630
in here so I'm going to refresh right now and you can see this is great coming

05:58.000 --> 06:05.260
so this is like how you want the song to be so I can like the popularity those products that has the

06:05.260 --> 06:06.850
most sales.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.040
They will come on top.

06:08.110 --> 06:13.540
So you can like sword and love and like that's OK you can also Google like evidence reading show the

06:13.540 --> 06:15.010
most recent.

06:15.220 --> 06:17.800
But you must go with a custom ordering it.

06:17.940 --> 06:18.850
OK.

06:18.880 --> 06:23.140
So like it will come with the name and then it will come with a custom ordering So if you want to bring

06:23.170 --> 06:26.220
any product to the top you can do the custom ordering as well.

06:26.370 --> 06:26.620
OK.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.750
And then we have two card behavior.

06:28.940 --> 06:32.780
It is like when someone adds a product to the card.

06:32.860 --> 06:39.050
OK so if I just hit add to cart what it's going to do enable the ejects card add two card Brydone on

06:39.050 --> 06:44.510
archives redirect the card page after successful edition What is this.

06:44.530 --> 06:48.580
Let me just come here and you can see that if I just click here the Ajax is going to work.

06:48.580 --> 06:54.310
Ajax means that the page will not be loaded and the product will be automatically sent to my shopping

06:54.310 --> 06:55.690
cart which is this.

06:55.690 --> 06:59.760
So if I just click here just see this that this quantity will be increase.

07:00.040 --> 07:03.030
This will be set to one item in this pricing movie.

07:03.070 --> 07:04.580
Here let me click here.

07:06.410 --> 07:07.160
We go.

07:07.170 --> 07:09.260
This is right here the page load.

07:09.270 --> 07:14.040
So this is we call it jacks and if I click here you can see this will be removed.

07:14.040 --> 07:14.990
Let me come here.

07:15.030 --> 07:16.240
Let me just click here.

07:16.410 --> 07:16.740
OK.

07:16.740 --> 07:23.470
On and on clicking this and and then I hit save and then I come here and then I freeze fresh my page.

07:23.790 --> 07:24.380
OK.

07:24.420 --> 07:30.560
And then you are going to see that if I click here it's going to redirect me to my card tray here and

07:30.560 --> 07:35.890
it takes T-shirt for men has been added to your card and now you can update your card.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.830
Or you can go to proceed to checkout.

07:37.830 --> 07:40.510
We have also added the shipping rate as well.

07:40.670 --> 07:41.070
OK.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.470
So this is how it's going to work.

07:42.660 --> 07:47.520
These settings are really very important and make sure that you understand each and everything if nothing

07:47.520 --> 07:49.410
is clear to you.

07:49.410 --> 07:52.580
Make sure to ask in that due to me question for him.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.640
OK you guys already know about it how you can ask.

07:55.650 --> 07:56.130
OK.

07:56.250 --> 07:59.760
Let me uncheck this and if I just uncheck this and then I hit save.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.020
Then you can see that the jacks will not work.

08:02.040 --> 08:02.600
OK.

08:02.730 --> 08:07.650
So if I just add two card displays reload and then the product will be added to my card.

08:07.650 --> 08:08.630
So let's just hit.

08:08.970 --> 08:13.470
You can see the page is loaded and then it is gumming that your product was added to the card.

08:13.500 --> 08:13.960
OK.

08:14.040 --> 08:17.990
So I would recommend you to go with the index because this is really important.

08:17.990 --> 08:23.040
And this is the new functionality so why are you just being like I don't want to use it or something

08:23.040 --> 08:23.630
like that.

08:23.870 --> 08:24.410
OK.

08:26.000 --> 08:26.790
So here we go.

08:26.870 --> 08:30.500
I'm just going to go I'm here I'm going to go down and then I'm going to hit save changes.

08:30.530 --> 08:32.940
And now we're totally done with this display.

08:33.020 --> 08:39.170
Where else so here in the catalog images this is basically called the catalog in the shop page is called

08:39.170 --> 08:43.390
Catalog So it's going to show 300 by 300 pixel images only.

08:43.480 --> 08:48.770
So make sure that you leave it as default unless you want to just have your own settings and you are

08:49.070 --> 08:55.550
just being so designing that you want to everything to be perfect and everything should be of this size

08:55.550 --> 08:56.300
and this size.

08:56.510 --> 08:57.980
Then you can manage them.

08:57.980 --> 09:03.530
But we will be doing this later on and we will build our professional based Web site to do not worry.

09:03.620 --> 09:04.040
Okay.

09:04.130 --> 09:08.620
And then we have the inventory system this is also really very important words in mentary.

09:08.760 --> 09:10.900
Okay let me just basically explain you.

09:11.170 --> 09:17.750
You can see that if I have this product tray here if I just open this up and this product I have only

09:17.750 --> 09:20.620
this product and trendy in my house.

09:20.630 --> 09:20.990
OK.

09:21.110 --> 09:26.380
So what I'm going to do right now I'm going to go to Edit product and then in there I've mentioned some

09:26.380 --> 09:32.010
mirror that I have only 20 in my stocks and that this will appear right here.

09:32.060 --> 09:33.080
People understand this.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.190
We will understand this later on.

09:34.190 --> 09:38.060
I'm just telling you that this is the auction and you can do it and we'll show you how you can do it

09:38.060 --> 09:40.460
later on when you'll move side by side OK.

09:40.490 --> 09:43.870
So this is like enabled the stock management.

09:43.940 --> 09:45.150
This is basically a fringe.

09:45.150 --> 09:48.280
They say that how many products you have it's going to manage everything.

09:48.290 --> 09:54.910
And even if the products reaches that they if all the 20 are sold then no one can buy from it and it

09:54.910 --> 09:57.730
will be automatically hidden from my shop page.

09:57.770 --> 10:00.050
OK so this is how this will commerce work.

10:00.140 --> 10:01.700
Everything is right here.

10:02.030 --> 10:02.720
Hold stock.

10:02.720 --> 10:06.180
Minutes hold stock for unbathed orders for X minutes.

10:06.260 --> 10:10.680
When the limit is reached the pending order will be Kancil leave blank to disable.

10:10.720 --> 10:14.050
OK so this is like four pending orders.

10:14.270 --> 10:18.910
If we don't we have the products left OK like we haven't shipped the product.

10:18.920 --> 10:23.560
If we have got a product right here and the customer hasn't paid us.

10:23.620 --> 10:24.100
OK.

10:24.200 --> 10:27.150
So then his auditor will be left.

10:27.200 --> 10:27.740
OK.

10:27.860 --> 10:33.200
For 60 minutes and after that his order will be canceled and we can ship that product to somebody else.

10:34.300 --> 10:34.920
OK.

10:35.070 --> 10:35.950
So this is what I mean.

10:35.960 --> 10:41.730
And his product will be automatically his order will be automatically removed from the panel and make

10:41.730 --> 10:45.700
sure that you add that in your terms and conditions because they are really very important.

10:45.720 --> 10:50.500
And if you don't mention that then any of your customers can sue you for this.

10:50.510 --> 10:55.160
Not not to what anyone can say that they are like this and we don't trust you.

10:55.200 --> 11:00.000
So make sure you just explain each and everything in your terms and conditions based terms and conditions

11:00.000 --> 11:02.320
are really very important.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.560
Many people say that no one reads this work especially the girls.

11:05.580 --> 11:07.520
Even my sister reads every.

11:07.520 --> 11:12.000
Terms and conditions she says Dad why don't you read the Terms and Conditions whenever you want to buy

11:12.000 --> 11:13.120
something for anyone.

11:13.140 --> 11:16.330
You will read the whole terms and conditions like this.

11:16.410 --> 11:21.000
So make sure that you added because some people who do read the terms and condition and make sure that

11:21.000 --> 11:27.240
you are some of you also must be reading the terms and conditions to make sure that you mention that

11:27.270 --> 11:27.790
OK.

11:27.930 --> 11:30.780
And then we have the notification recipient.

11:31.170 --> 11:36.020
If any order is re here OK then the email will be sent to this like.

11:36.030 --> 11:41.150
If the products two products are left then an email will be sent to my email address.

11:41.190 --> 11:42.870
Hurry up you have two products left.

11:42.870 --> 11:49.920
Please get them or adjust and update your products and the settings and update that you have so much

11:49.920 --> 11:50.920
quantities left.

11:50.960 --> 11:56.020
OK so then we have a low stock notifications enable low out-of-stock notifications.

11:56.030 --> 11:59.570
These notifications will be sent to this email address.

11:59.700 --> 12:05.540
Then we have low stock thresholds so this is like when introduced to the low stock notification they'll

12:05.550 --> 12:07.920
be sent to this out of stock.

12:07.950 --> 12:12.800
So this is zero when a zero notification will be sent to this email address.

12:12.990 --> 12:13.560
Out-of-stock.

12:13.560 --> 12:14.250
Visibility.

12:14.250 --> 12:14.960
Hide.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.290
Out of stock I.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.490
Them from the catalog.

12:17.490 --> 12:18.990
This is what I'm saying right now OK.

12:19.110 --> 12:26.340
So if I have 25 products and all of them are sold OK then I want to hide the product.

12:26.340 --> 12:29.530
Obviously I don't want to show it in my catalog.

12:29.580 --> 12:31.930
You can show that out-of-stock is here if you want.

12:31.940 --> 12:33.170
If you just hide it.

12:33.420 --> 12:38.720
If you just uncheck it then the title will appear that it is out of stock and no one can buy it but

12:38.720 --> 12:43.000
it will still be appearing in the catalog of yourself so you can do that if you want to.

12:43.020 --> 12:44.830
It is not a problem.

12:45.340 --> 12:47.620
And then we have stock display far made.

12:47.760 --> 12:54.050
All this show quantity remaining in stock like example 12 in stock only Shaquanda the remaining in stock

12:54.060 --> 12:55.070
van law.

12:55.110 --> 12:57.270
Example only two left in stock.

12:57.270 --> 13:03.180
Never a sure quantity intermeeting stock so if I just come here and I have twenty five in my stock then

13:03.180 --> 13:05.650
it is going to show that 25 are in stock.

13:05.670 --> 13:08.180
You have to mention that I will show you how you can manage it.

13:08.190 --> 13:09.890
Don't be confused but let me show you.

13:09.900 --> 13:11.730
Let's just go to Edit product frais here.

13:11.960 --> 13:16.240
OK and then let's go down and let's go to in mentary right here OK.

13:16.320 --> 13:21.180
And then we have the stock managed stock I just click here and I have the stock quantity.

13:21.180 --> 13:26.880
I'm going to select here like I have 20 in my stock and then I hit a day right now.

13:27.390 --> 13:28.190
OK.

13:28.200 --> 13:33.360
And then let's go ahead and let's review the product so you can see that it is showing it is showing

13:33.360 --> 13:35.120
20 in stock right here.

13:35.130 --> 13:38.740
So if someone buys it it will be fun less if someone buys it.

13:38.880 --> 13:43.890
So I can also do like if only show the remaining low.

13:44.070 --> 13:47.220
So we have low threshold is said to do.

13:47.250 --> 13:56.170
So that if the trend if it is set too low and this limit is reached then it will only show that.

13:56.350 --> 13:59.630
Only 2 left in stock and red alert will be like here.

13:59.760 --> 14:04.470
So you can also do it like that and you can also show that no never showed a quantitative meaning in

14:04.470 --> 14:08.960
stocks if I just come here and I'll rephrase this you will see that it will not be appearing.

14:09.180 --> 14:09.640
OK.

14:09.690 --> 14:12.970
It is coming in stock but it is not coming.

14:13.060 --> 14:18.090
That twin beanstalk stock or something like that so you can also show it to just increase the credibility

14:18.360 --> 14:23.910
like no one can know what is a contadino if I just come here and I just go I cannot go beyond 20 because

14:23.910 --> 14:28.970
I do not have more if I just come here and I add 25 and then I try to hit Add to Cart.

14:28.980 --> 14:34.300
You can see value must be less than or equal to 20 because we have 20 in stocks.

14:34.300 --> 14:37.180
This way commerce is really clever guys.

14:37.380 --> 14:38.220
OK.

14:38.220 --> 14:42.420
So I'm just going to go ahead I'm going to hit this all this the quantity remaining in stock.

14:42.420 --> 14:45.560
I'm going to hit this and you can see everything is totally up and running.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.760
And now the last thing we have is the downloadable products.

14:48.870 --> 14:50.730
So you can see a file download mattered.

14:50.730 --> 14:55.470
It is going to be forced download if you have any of the product that is the software and if someone

14:55.470 --> 14:58.170
purchases it then it will be automatically downloaded.

14:58.170 --> 15:02.930
You don't have to go in the download page and find the link to download the forced download means and

15:02.940 --> 15:07.770
it'll be automatically downloaded axil X will read it and redirect only it will redirect you to the

15:07.770 --> 15:14.090
link and then it'll download so you can choose that how you want it to be downloads required log in.

15:14.580 --> 15:21.610
OK so what you have to select because the people the person has to log in and then he can download.

15:21.630 --> 15:22.300
OK.

15:22.320 --> 15:27.550
Guaran granted access to downloadable products after being unable this option to grant access to downloads

15:27.560 --> 15:31.230
when orders are processing rather than completed.

15:31.500 --> 15:37.910
OK so you have to check this one because this is also important and you can also check this one if you

15:37.950 --> 15:45.050
are like selling some software then then people can log in to your site and then they can download from

15:45.050 --> 15:47.400
this my account panel and then that.

15:47.450 --> 15:48.600
OK so you can also.

15:48.780 --> 15:49.800
So like this one.

15:49.850 --> 15:51.910
So now it is wholly done.

15:52.100 --> 15:55.280
Everything in the products and in the next video will be working a bit.

15:55.280 --> 15:59.940
Tax shipping and everything so Stadio and Babai.
