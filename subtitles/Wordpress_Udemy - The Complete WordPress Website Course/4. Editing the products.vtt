00:00.330 --> 00:01.580
What is it guys I want kmax.

00:01.600 --> 00:07.230
Now in this video I'll be just showing you that how we added this home products the products in here

00:07.550 --> 00:11.650
because I just thought that you guys must be having confusing confusion.

00:11.660 --> 00:13.440
That how it is created.

00:13.440 --> 00:16.630
OK so you just have to go to visual billig now.

00:16.950 --> 00:17.250
OK.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.370
And then you'll be taken there.

00:18.390 --> 00:23.330
So you have to just work with that you have to make some changes there so that it works properly.

00:23.330 --> 00:26.580
OK you can see I'm sorry to hear that is it being loaded.

00:26.760 --> 00:27.030
OK.

00:27.030 --> 00:31.560
And I have some products that are being shown but I want to show you how they're being shown.

00:31.560 --> 00:35.630
So you can see this is a label that we have.

00:36.050 --> 00:36.320
OK.

00:36.330 --> 00:39.240
And in here we have a shop module.

00:39.320 --> 00:39.740
OK.

00:39.870 --> 00:40.940
This is the shop module.

00:40.940 --> 00:45.570
We have product Koun and we have call them by number and the order by is 3.

00:45.660 --> 00:49.590
So I'm going to show you how this is going to look so if you just come here you can see that we have

00:49.590 --> 00:53.190
the column selected is this and then this.

00:53.190 --> 00:56.220
So here we have a shop module which is this.

00:56.210 --> 00:58.720
So let me show you everything from start.

00:58.740 --> 01:00.680
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to delete it.

01:00.950 --> 01:01.520
OK.

01:01.590 --> 01:03.660
And I'm deleting you can see that this is right here.

01:03.660 --> 01:06.050
So we have all products and nothing else.

01:06.210 --> 01:09.730
I'm just going to come here and I am going to just add new shop modules.

01:09.750 --> 01:11.700
I'm going to come here I'm going to go down.

01:11.910 --> 01:15.590
And here you can see that we should be having a sharp tap.

01:15.600 --> 01:21.720
So this is the shop tab that we have right now and I am going to show you the recent products you can

01:21.720 --> 01:24.580
see all the products are coming here.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.240
And so I don't want it.

01:26.280 --> 01:30.270
I just want to show just to sell products.

01:30.860 --> 01:31.330
OK.

01:31.380 --> 01:37.170
So you told just to sell products or the popular products so for popular products I think it should

01:37.170 --> 01:40.830
be best selling products best selling products means popular products.

01:40.830 --> 01:41.240
OK.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.530
So I'm just going to show popular products from here.

01:43.620 --> 01:43.940
OK.

01:44.070 --> 01:46.500
And the products count is going to be three.

01:46.590 --> 01:47.610
OK not more than that.

01:47.610 --> 01:51.120
So then it will show you only of the three products right here.

01:51.180 --> 01:53.290
You can see this is how it is looking OK.

01:53.340 --> 01:57.230
And then we have the column numbers of column numbers going to be three maximum.

01:57.270 --> 02:02.510
You can just check it out and you can see this will be a default is also 3 basically.

02:02.520 --> 02:07.680
But you can also go for columns if you want four columns and for Column B here and then in the product

02:07.680 --> 02:09.030
count you have to just add four.

02:09.030 --> 02:11.950
So it will show four products right in here.

02:12.030 --> 02:12.660
OK.

02:12.810 --> 02:16.140
You can see how this is looking but I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to choose a default one

02:16.140 --> 02:19.410
that is the 4 3 and just choose just three from here.

02:19.410 --> 02:22.740
And then we have the Otterbein This is called the fold sorting.

02:22.740 --> 02:31.230
You can also order by oldest to newest or sort by price to like low to highest so low price will be

02:31.230 --> 02:34.280
here and the high price will be on the left side right.

02:34.350 --> 02:36.430
So you can see this is the lowest This is right here.

02:36.450 --> 02:37.850
This is right here.

02:38.490 --> 02:46.970
OK so this is how it works now here we have the elements so you can show the page anation if you want

02:46.970 --> 02:47.480
to.

02:47.780 --> 02:48.140
OK.

02:48.140 --> 02:53.870
Then it will show all the products in here you can see all the products are coming here and it is creating

02:53.860 --> 02:56.760
a mess so then we have in the background image great here.

02:56.870 --> 02:58.540
It can also work for the background.

02:58.730 --> 02:59.170
OK.

02:59.330 --> 03:02.200
We have the admin label and everything.

03:02.240 --> 03:04.710
So you can see how this is looking.

03:04.790 --> 03:06.200
We have the

03:09.610 --> 03:14.530
design right here and in here we have the sale bag so you can change the seal beach color.

03:14.650 --> 03:15.210
OK.

03:15.220 --> 03:18.330
You can move it to be like the brown that we always use.

03:18.340 --> 03:19.520
I'm just going to make it proud.

03:19.680 --> 03:20.860
OK.

03:20.890 --> 03:26.340
Now here I want to go with image so you can also go with the image box shadow if you want to give it

03:26.350 --> 03:32.200
can see how this shadow is looking so you can make it like where you want it to be like this.

03:32.210 --> 03:34.000

03:52.890 --> 03:57.090
We can also give it a shadow if you want to but I don't want to give the shadow here we have the title

03:57.090 --> 04:01.650
text we can make it a little much bigger in size so that it is visible.

04:01.690 --> 04:03.660
OK you can see how this is looking.

04:03.960 --> 04:04.470
