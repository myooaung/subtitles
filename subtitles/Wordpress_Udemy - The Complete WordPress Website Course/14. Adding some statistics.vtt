01:17.310 --> 01:17.640
OK.

01:17.650 --> 01:18.570
Here is a table.

01:18.660 --> 01:27.260
So this title is going to be responsiveness 24/7 support 24 7 support.

01:27.840 --> 01:31.890
And the person is going to be 98 percent OK.

01:32.010 --> 01:33.440
And I want background so.

01:33.530 --> 01:36.090
So here's the background.

01:36.570 --> 01:45.510
I don't think I need to add any background but me add to it to be the black and let's go to the design

01:45.510 --> 01:47.620
right here the bar counter color.

02:59.470 --> 03:00.510
Let's just click here.

03:00.520 --> 03:04.000
So everything is OK and editable from here.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.620
So this is going to be

03:10.580 --> 03:11.800
packaging I think

03:15.360 --> 03:16.710
what is happening.

03:16.720 --> 03:16.950
OK.

03:16.980 --> 03:17.640
I want to come here.

03:17.670 --> 03:19.490

03:19.810 --> 03:20.220
OK.

03:20.370 --> 03:24.910
And then I want to just refresh this because this is making some stuff here.

03:25.020 --> 03:26.890
So let's go ahead.

03:27.200 --> 03:27.470
OK.

03:27.480 --> 03:28.260
It is safe.

03:28.260 --> 03:28.520
I'm going to.

03:28.530 --> 03:30.780
I'm here and I'm going and just refreshed this right now.

03:30.930 --> 03:32.210
So this is just dumb.

03:32.220 --> 03:34.810
Doing some stuff I don't know what is happening to this.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.780
Let's let's just refresh this so that everything looks OK.

03:42.650 --> 03:44.960
So I'm going to come here to discover here.

03:45.060 --> 03:46.000
Let's just come here.

03:46.010 --> 03:47.180
Let's click here again.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.450
And here we want to do this.

03:51.450 --> 03:59.820
I'm going to come here to the settings right here 24/7 support is going to be packaging package and

03:59.820 --> 04:00.660
this is going to be

04:04.320 --> 04:05.620
86 percent.

04:05.950 --> 04:07.090
OK.

04:07.460 --> 04:08.050
Now we're done.

04:08.150 --> 04:08.540
OK.

04:08.600 --> 04:13.940
So let's just get in here and let's just manage this as well let's come here and let's change this to

04:13.940 --> 04:15.770
be 24/7 support.

04:15.770 --> 04:16.910
So it is going to be

04:23.150 --> 04:33.550
products our creativeness.

04:33.690 --> 04:34.710
And this is going to be

04:37.530 --> 04:39.300
72 percent.

04:39.330 --> 04:39.930
Here we go.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.660
I'm just going to click here and I'm going to hit this right here.

04:42.850 --> 04:43.530
ALEX Kim here.

04:43.530 --> 04:44.180
Analysts say that

04:47.510 --> 04:50.690
so you can see that we're also done with this.

04:50.750 --> 04:58.380
I think we need a call to action right here below so that it separates it because it is it is it is

04:58.380 --> 05:05.270
just matching this or we can do one more thing but we can do we can just bring it here and bring this

05:05.270 --> 05:08.870
right here so that it doesn't match with each other.

05:11.210 --> 05:12.720
We can do it like that as well.

05:12.870 --> 05:14.450
But let's add a call to action right here.

05:14.450 --> 05:15.870
Let's click regular.

05:15.880 --> 05:16.350
OK.

05:16.490 --> 05:20.930
And let's just add this guy right here and here we need to add a called Watch in.

05:20.990 --> 05:25.340
So I'm going to click here I'm going to come here and I want to click this guy right here.

05:25.340 --> 05:31.440
So now I'm going to go to the design background and here I'm going to choose an image right here.

05:31.460 --> 05:32.770
I'm going to choose any image.

05:32.840 --> 05:35.520
Let's add this image OK.

05:35.630 --> 05:36.560
I'm going to click here.

05:38.290 --> 05:39.040
And here we go.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.440
This image is coming right here.

05:40.600 --> 05:46.260
I want to use use the parallax effect so that if we if I just move my page you can see that the image

05:46.270 --> 05:47.110
is moving.

05:47.110 --> 05:51.070
But if you want to appear like effect then you have to do one thing and that is make sure that when

05:51.070 --> 05:57.340
you add the image you added tray here you add an overlay before applying it to how you can add overlay

05:57.640 --> 05:58.200
what you can do.

05:58.210 --> 06:03.210
You can just come here and then you can do you have to just click add new layer.

06:03.280 --> 06:07.640
OK so this layer is going to appear you have to just press alter and backspace.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.140
OK and this is coming.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.330
This is coming right here.

06:10.420 --> 06:16.720
So what I'm going to do right now I'm just going to come here and I'm going to click here to fill and

06:16.730 --> 06:17.720
I wanted to create a bit

06:20.670 --> 06:21.700
ok like this.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.540
And again see this is like this.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.020
So you have to just save it then.

06:25.080 --> 06:30.150
And then you can just add a tray here and then you can apply the parallax effect.

06:30.150 --> 06:33.260
So here I'm going to add anything.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.140
I'm going to come here

06:36.730 --> 06:45.310
and we'll be adding some more stuff in here in the next video so you can see about this page is already

06:45.610 --> 06:46.450
looking amazing.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.510
So thanks a lot guys who are watching this still here.

06:48.550 --> 06:49.930
Stadion and by.
