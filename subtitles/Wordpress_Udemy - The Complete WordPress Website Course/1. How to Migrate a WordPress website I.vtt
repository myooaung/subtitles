Hey what is up guys and welcome back.

00:02.190 --> 00:08.010
So now in this video I'm going to show you how can you migrate your WordPress website into a live server.

00:08.010 --> 00:12.300
Ok so this is going to be so amazing you guys already know about the Web Hosting.

00:12.300 --> 00:12.740
OK.

00:12.810 --> 00:18.150
So if you want to learn about web hosting then make sure to go and check out my first video where I

00:18.150 --> 00:20.770
showed you how to sign up and get a web hosting.

00:20.880 --> 00:22.380
And then how to work for that.

00:22.470 --> 00:22.950
OK.

00:23.010 --> 00:28.800
So basically I have also given a coupon code there that you can enter there in the host skater dot com

00:29.070 --> 00:33.960
and you can get 60 percent off guys to make sure to go ahead and watch that video and then you will

00:33.960 --> 00:38.910
learn how to basically get housing and then might create your WordPress website so you basically need

00:38.910 --> 00:39.240
this.

00:39.240 --> 00:43.240
Basically this Zahm works on your local computer.

00:43.380 --> 00:48.670
You can not make it live if you want to make it life you need a lot of big servers with big speed internet

00:48.690 --> 00:54.870
speed and so much and that will cost you a lot but you can just do it for just three point nine five

00:54.870 --> 00:55.600
per month.

00:55.830 --> 00:57.420
So this is Sochi.

00:57.420 --> 01:02.510
Seriously this is so cheap and you can just get like 60 percent off and it is more cheaper.

01:02.570 --> 01:06.920
So make sure to just go ahead and just just get this hosting.

01:07.030 --> 01:11.820
It takes five point nine five you can get 60 percent off and it will be exactly same amount.

01:12.060 --> 01:17.100
OK so after you have got the web hosting and after you are totally done with everything you just have

01:17.100 --> 01:21.880
to go to the portal and now hear what you have to do you have to just log in.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.900
So here you have your entry your credentials guys.

01:23.920 --> 01:24.720
OK.

01:24.820 --> 01:29.650
And here you can see that it is loading our customer portal and we will be taking to the customer portal

01:29.650 --> 01:32.840
page where we have to just go to the see battle and then more.

01:32.850 --> 01:36.910
So herein be your domain name your main domain name that you have here.

01:36.910 --> 01:42.220
So lets suppose that you will be having your domain name here you just have to go ahead and you have

01:42.220 --> 01:48.070
to hit launch see battle and on clicking this you will be taken to the sea battle base where you have

01:48.070 --> 01:53.110
to just enter your details or you or your subpanel they'll be loaded here.

01:53.280 --> 01:53.760
OK.

01:53.860 --> 01:54.780
So let's see

02:00.790 --> 02:06.580
here guys in the domain stop and you will see your domain name that you have registered and host gator.

02:06.730 --> 02:11.760
OK so let's suppose that I have registered domain name that is.

02:11.830 --> 02:13.260
Let's wait till this is done.

02:13.450 --> 02:13.960
OK.

02:13.960 --> 02:18.020
You can see that I am here in the sea battle and this is how most people look.

02:18.030 --> 02:19.750
So this is my domain name.

02:19.750 --> 02:21.180
Create a W.P. dot site.

02:21.190 --> 02:21.580
OK.

02:21.730 --> 02:27.070
And this is here it says N.S. and this is a line to my hosting package.

02:27.100 --> 02:33.190
OK everything is here if I just go to name servers then you can see it is automatically a.

02:33.190 --> 02:35.210
And this is said to my hosting back.

02:35.210 --> 02:37.040
So I'm just going to go to.

02:37.390 --> 02:40.780
You can see that here you will see your loot domain name.

02:40.930 --> 02:41.340
OK.

02:41.530 --> 02:45.130
So I am basically installing the host.

02:45.130 --> 02:47.350
The word press on an ad on a domain name.

02:47.350 --> 02:53.260
So you guys must know what an add on domain domain is like the extra domain name that you get at so

02:53.500 --> 02:55.670
mystically my domain name root for.

02:55.690 --> 02:58.930
Is this add on domain slice create a WPA type.

02:59.020 --> 02:59.390
OK.

02:59.560 --> 03:03.030
So what I have to do I basically have to go to the files right here.

03:03.370 --> 03:03.930
OK.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.890
And then I have to see this one file manager.

03:07.900 --> 03:14.800
I just have to open this up and now here you can see it here here would be my every detail is what you

03:14.800 --> 03:15.580
have to do.

03:15.580 --> 03:19.590
You have to just go to the public underscore each TMLC file.

03:19.690 --> 03:20.260
OK.

03:20.350 --> 03:24.060
And here would be all your files here would be nothing basically.

03:24.160 --> 03:24.610
OK.

03:24.730 --> 03:29.340
But I have to go into the add on domain file which is this.

03:29.480 --> 03:30.570
And your.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.530
Let's suppose that this is my web site.

03:32.600 --> 03:32.870
OK.

03:32.890 --> 03:37.270
This is how your public underscore h t m l folder it looks like.

03:37.270 --> 03:41.290
So this is your domain root folder basically in other words you can say OK.

03:41.350 --> 03:46.420
So if you do not know about the add on domains then go above and make sure to just go and watch the

03:46.420 --> 03:51.880
video and also watch the video of the hosting that how we set up the hosting website because this is

03:51.880 --> 03:53.150
so important guys.

03:53.230 --> 03:58.840
And once you understand everything then you guys are going to learn how to migrate basically a WordPress

03:58.840 --> 04:04.930
website so you can see this is where nothing is coming so this is be this will be like my public underscore

04:05.120 --> 04:13.030
team folder will be I have to basically grab the files of all the word press from the HD box.

04:13.230 --> 04:13.530
OK.

04:13.540 --> 04:14.840
These are the files.

04:15.760 --> 04:22.570
What I have to do I have to just select all the file I have to come here and now here I have to just

04:22.750 --> 04:23.960
add to archive.

04:24.190 --> 04:28.040
OK so just clicking this you can see this is right here.

04:28.140 --> 04:32.010
What I have to do I have to just add zip and I have to open this up.

04:32.050 --> 04:32.330
OK.

04:32.350 --> 04:34.750
So you can see this is archiving all the files.

04:34.900 --> 04:38.840
So once everything is archived it's going to be like Lupica Idzik.

04:38.890 --> 04:43.820
So now what we have to do is that we have to upload all the files here.

04:44.110 --> 04:45.710
OK we have to wait for sometime.

04:45.730 --> 04:51.190
Let's let's just wait and see how after we have uploaded we have to extracted then and then you will

04:51.190 --> 04:54.750
see that all the files when we need it.

04:54.850 --> 04:56.840
So you can see everything is right here.

04:56.870 --> 04:57.600
Is going to come here.

04:57.610 --> 04:59.620
And this is my file.

04:59.620 --> 05:02.900
I have to come here and I have to applaud it.

05:02.950 --> 05:06.520
And now here you can see Ahmed Saiz maximum file size.

05:06.550 --> 05:07.710
So this is 500 m.

05:07.900 --> 05:09.300
I just have to select the file.

05:09.520 --> 05:10.940
And here I have two

05:13.620 --> 05:14.560
go to the Sci-Fi.

05:14.610 --> 05:16.060
OK let's just drop the file.

05:16.080 --> 05:16.610
OK.

05:16.710 --> 05:23.810
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to just drag it and let's just drop it here so you can see

05:24.230 --> 05:24.980
it's being uploaded.

05:24.980 --> 05:26.840
So what this is applauded.

05:26.840 --> 05:29.980
I'll show you how can you just extracted on your local server.

05:30.170 --> 05:31.760
Ok so you can see this is completed.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.500
I'm just going to go back.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.380
So it is now taking me back to this.

05:35.630 --> 05:37.760
And this is how my web site is looking.

05:37.760 --> 05:41.110
If I just open up my web site you just created the Lupi site.

05:41.270 --> 05:42.950
So create

05:46.050 --> 05:49.840
blue the dark side is basically my domain name.

05:49.940 --> 05:50.410
OK.

05:50.460 --> 05:52.670
If I just open this up you can see.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.880
Here is W.P. Dodd Cyp.

05:54.900 --> 06:00.990
So this is a this is basically the Apache server running inside Port and everything is exactly same

06:01.530 --> 06:02.220
as this.

06:02.220 --> 06:06.960
This is the local host so but this is applied to as a domain name.

06:07.080 --> 06:07.410
OK.

06:07.410 --> 06:08.490
And this is online.

06:08.520 --> 06:12.160
I can access it anywhere any computer or even to access off the Internet.

06:12.300 --> 06:15.740
What I'm going to do right now I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit it shut.

06:16.200 --> 06:21.830
And I'm just clicking extract I just click extract files so you can see these are extracted.

06:21.990 --> 06:22.410
OK.

06:22.530 --> 06:24.990
What I have to do I have to just delete this WPA zip.

06:25.080 --> 06:25.740
OK.

06:26.100 --> 06:30.510
And it's just sits and trash and I'm going to get confirmed so you can see these are the files that

06:30.510 --> 06:31.280
are here.

06:31.380 --> 06:37.080
And once I click it it's just going to give me an error that says error to establish a database connection.

06:37.110 --> 06:40.070
You can see this is giving an error.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.450
Thanks a lot guys.

06:41.580 --> 06:47.420
Basically Congratulations guys because you have made through the part of copying you can see that WordPress

06:47.430 --> 06:48.960
is totally up and running.

06:48.960 --> 06:53.910
And now we have to just work with the database and we will be doing with the database in the next video

06:53.910 --> 06:58.350
guys so stadium guys for that and make sure to pay attention to that section because that section is

06:58.350 --> 07:00.570
so much important.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.170
OK so in the next video you'll be working up at that.
