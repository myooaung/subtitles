00:00.620 --> 00:02.220
What is a guys inbox Max.

00:02.220 --> 00:05.930
Now in this video I'm going to be showing you that how can you for but the fidgets.

00:05.990 --> 00:06.580
OK.

00:06.590 --> 00:11.840
Where did the visits and why are they used for so now you can see that side bar.

00:11.870 --> 00:13.220
That is coming.

00:13.250 --> 00:16.050
This is the show this is showing some stuff.

00:16.070 --> 00:17.490
You can see we have the search.

00:17.750 --> 00:20.380
I have recent post recent comments and stuff.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.380
So they are basically called the fudge.

00:23.420 --> 00:23.890
OK.

00:23.990 --> 00:29.320
Midgets are necessary for you if you want to add the blog functionality.

00:29.490 --> 00:29.870
OK.

00:30.050 --> 00:36.200
But if you do not want to add the blog functionality then widgets are not recommended to use and the

00:36.200 --> 00:40.650
About page in these because about pages do not have to not use that.

00:40.760 --> 00:48.590
So the blogs mostly have the video so that anyone can just reading this and he sees a new thing like

00:48.750 --> 00:50.140
categories a feature.

00:50.300 --> 00:54.260
OK so he'll just go there and he'll just OK I just want to go ahead and I want to open up.

00:54.350 --> 00:58.310
So how you can just edit the sidebar and how you can work for the Brigitte's.

00:58.460 --> 01:02.290
What are the widgets how to add them and how to just work with it.

01:02.330 --> 01:05.730
Let's just go ahead and let's just go to dashboard right now.

01:06.040 --> 01:06.580
OK.

01:06.830 --> 01:11.960
I'm going to go to the appearance and then I'm going to go to visit trade now and any here I can manage

01:12.140 --> 01:14.510
every widget that has on my screen.

01:14.510 --> 01:19.270
So we have the blog sidebar foot Erwan and footer too.

01:19.430 --> 01:19.910
OK.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.250
So let's just work the blog sidebar.

01:22.440 --> 01:22.720
OK.

01:22.730 --> 01:26.620
And then I'm going to tell you that for about the for her to later on.

01:26.660 --> 01:29.590
So you can see that we have these currently right here.

01:29.630 --> 01:36.480
If I just open this up in my new top then you can see me go down and we have this blog one right here.

01:36.480 --> 01:41.400
So let's open this up and you can see that we have the sidebar even if he finish up any of the post.

01:41.450 --> 01:43.100
This is same.

01:43.250 --> 01:43.710
OK.

01:43.880 --> 01:46.250
So you can add that if you want to.

01:46.430 --> 01:47.210
How are you going to do that.

01:47.210 --> 01:49.220
You can just pretty well change stuff.

01:49.220 --> 01:51.020
You can pretty well do anything.

01:51.020 --> 01:56.510
So let's suppose that I don't like this meta tags like it's a site admin log out entries are a Says

01:56.570 --> 01:59.870
word pre-start Oregon these messages that I don't like this.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.190
I just want to remove it.

02:01.220 --> 02:03.130
I'm just going to go here and I'm going to hit delete.

02:04.040 --> 02:08.870
That's all this is removed and then I just come here and I will just refresh you will see that this

02:09.590 --> 02:10.920
will be gone.

02:11.120 --> 02:14.290
Let's refresh gun.

02:14.390 --> 02:17.450
I can see that this is how our it is looking now.

02:17.450 --> 02:18.610
We have our search.

02:18.830 --> 02:20.250
We have a recent post.

02:20.300 --> 02:25.030
We have a recent Commons in these are these are default Lee added by Word Press.

02:25.160 --> 02:25.610
OK.

02:25.730 --> 02:30.590
You can see we have archives as well what are the archives it's going to show the date like when the

02:30.590 --> 02:37.430
post was published and something like that so if I just hope in January 2019 initial all the post that

02:37.430 --> 02:44.230
has the month January 2010 so show all the posts that were posted on this date.

02:44.390 --> 02:51.020
So now what I'm going to do I'm just going to tell you that how can you add these available vergence

02:51.290 --> 02:52.300
into here.

02:52.500 --> 02:57.230
OK so let's suppose that I want to add the text.

02:57.320 --> 02:57.820
OK.

02:57.830 --> 03:03.900
Like I want to add the text about welcoming so that can be like welcome to our block.

03:04.010 --> 03:04.420

Welcome to our blog.

03:14.480 --> 03:15.110
OK.

03:15.150 --> 03:18.530
So I'm just giving you an example like how can you add it.

03:18.680 --> 03:25.830
And I'm going to keep it to be like bold OK like I want to make it bold and I want it to be like we

03:35.740 --> 03:37.030
Let's refresh this.

03:37.110 --> 03:44.350
OK refresh this page here you can see it says Welcome to our blog and we welcome you.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.310
So let's suppose that I don't want to add the title.

03:46.340 --> 03:47.860
I just want to add this.

03:48.110 --> 03:49.170
I'm going to come here.

03:49.370 --> 03:52.900
I'm going to remove this and I'm going to come here and I'm going to save it all.

03:53.270 --> 03:57.140
And I have to come here and I have to refresh this and refreshing you can see it.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.490
We welcome you.

03:58.520 --> 04:01.920
So you can see how great it is looking.

04:02.270 --> 04:04.720
I can bring this text to the top.

04:05.290 --> 04:05.920
OK.

04:05.990 --> 04:09.570
And this is right here and I'm going to add it to be like.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.560
Welcome you to our blog

04:15.500 --> 04:18.000

04:18.120 --> 04:18.460
OK.

04:18.480 --> 04:24.870
It will give a great impression it can see days while we've commute to our blog.

04:24.870 --> 04:26.260
So this is the tykes.

04:26.290 --> 04:31.200
It is set that is coming and then we have the search and these right here that are coming here so you

04:31.200 --> 04:35.130
can pretty well go ahead and edit them as well.

04:35.400 --> 04:41.240
Like let's suppose that I want to show the recent post to be like the count of three.

04:41.450 --> 04:41.910
OK.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.250
I just wanted to show three recent posts little.

04:44.450 --> 04:44.800
OK.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.130
I'm going to come here are two recent posts and I'm going to show here it to be like number of polls

04:49.130 --> 04:52.030
to show and I'm going to keep keep it like two.

04:52.150 --> 04:52.470
OK.

04:52.470 --> 04:53.950
It's a toolbox that's all.

04:54.000 --> 04:54.620
It doesn't.

04:54.660 --> 04:57.380
I don't want to show three or four.

04:57.510 --> 04:57.740
OK.

04:57.750 --> 05:01.570
I'm going to I'm here and I'm going to hit refresh and I can see how this is showing.

05:01.590 --> 05:03.190
Two recent polls.

05:03.420 --> 05:04.030
That's all.

05:04.140 --> 05:04.730
OK.

05:04.750 --> 05:11.260
I'm like this I can go here to the recent comments and in here that I want to show him to show your

05:11.300 --> 05:13.730
comment like I want to remove the comment.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.970
I don't want to show to show that he can't.

05:15.990 --> 05:20.280
I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit it fresh and I can see no commentary here since we have

05:20.280 --> 05:24.720
deleted that since there are no comments that is why this is not coming.

05:24.780 --> 05:29.370
Now let's just go ahead and let's work for the categories you can see that we have the category right

05:29.370 --> 05:29.930
here.

05:30.450 --> 05:37.850
If I want to come here and you can see it is display as drop down Show post count show as you don't

05:37.860 --> 05:38.970
know how to pronounce this.

05:39.090 --> 05:41.370
So let's just go ahead and let's just say I like this.

05:41.370 --> 05:41.740
OK.

05:41.820 --> 05:46.500
So I looked at this and I just go ahead and I just said Save and I just come here and I just refresh

05:46.500 --> 05:51.180
this you can see till the eyes drop down so if I just like to be like category to be news then it's

05:51.180 --> 05:54.610
going to refresh and is going to show the category of the news.

05:54.630 --> 06:00.640
So this is a pretty good way to just choose the category show Post count.

06:00.660 --> 06:01.010
OK.

06:01.140 --> 06:05.800
So just clicking yes let's just go ahead Alex refresh.

06:05.970 --> 06:09.680
Now you can see this is the showing the post count that how many post we have.

06:09.690 --> 06:15.200
So for a feature it's a show to post I can see two posts are coming here.

06:15.690 --> 06:20.490
And then we have the show this so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit save.

06:20.690 --> 06:23.080
Let's have a look at this.

06:23.210 --> 06:26.610
OK we have to uncheck this and let's have a look at this.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.140
And let's say this.

06:28.310 --> 06:32.410
And now we have all refreshed she will see the look will be changed a bit.

06:32.720 --> 06:33.380
So you can see it.

06:33.440 --> 06:36.560
It is like this feature news press release and everything.

06:36.560 --> 06:40.870
So this is how it is looking guys and it works pretty cool right now.

06:40.880 --> 06:44.640
So now you can see that we are totally done with a vengeance.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.410
I know you might have understand this.

06:46.430 --> 06:47.080
OK.

06:47.210 --> 06:50.170
I know it might be so confusing to you right now.

06:50.570 --> 06:51.000
OK.

06:51.050 --> 06:56.230
But we will understand when we will work for their projects for them more projects like when we will

06:56.230 --> 06:58.970
build professional blog and stuff.

06:59.060 --> 07:01.070
Then you will understand it much better.

07:01.070 --> 07:01.570
Guys.

07:01.670 --> 07:01.910
OK.

07:01.910 --> 07:03.110
So do not worry about this.

07:03.110 --> 07:05.170
If you are just like I want to learn more.

07:05.320 --> 07:05.530
OK.

07:05.550 --> 07:09.710
And we will build a different type of projects and you will understand different type of things.

07:09.710 --> 07:14.450
That is why I'm telling you not to just leave this course and build your own website you can practice

07:14.480 --> 07:19.460
on the sidebar that is recommended by me even but do not be like that.

07:19.470 --> 07:23.380
OK I know WordPress now and I don't want any lecture and I'm done.

07:23.420 --> 07:30.440
Don't be like that guys because there are so many things even that are new to me but I just watching

07:30.800 --> 07:35.750
searching on Google and these when I am doing a research I find so many things to be like new when I'm

07:35.750 --> 07:38.770
like Coquet is also done with wordpress.

07:38.780 --> 07:39.100
OK.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.600
And I call myself an expert and that's all.

07:41.790 --> 07:42.130
OK.

07:42.230 --> 07:45.890
So now you can see this is how it works.

07:45.920 --> 07:49.010
So now I'm going to show you how to work for the footer.

07:49.160 --> 07:49.710
OK.

07:50.430 --> 07:54.920
So before I get adding anything I want to tell you what is a footer.

07:54.930 --> 07:55.470
OK.

07:55.500 --> 08:01.170
If you just come here to our website and can see the footer is basically called a footer area of the

08:01.170 --> 08:01.540
website.

08:01.530 --> 08:05.530
So this is this is the area down side is called the footer.

08:05.580 --> 08:10.230
If I just want to add anything on the footer which is not recommended but I just wanted to tell you

08:10.230 --> 08:17.510
that advocates appear in the footer so let's suppose that I want to add about my test company.

08:17.630 --> 08:17.930
OK.

08:17.940 --> 08:19.260
Which is like I deal.

08:19.350 --> 08:23.790
I mean they come here and I'm going to and this and I'm going to add like about us.

08:24.090 --> 08:24.490
OK.

08:24.520 --> 08:27.350
And then I want to add the Lauren ipsum.

08:27.670 --> 08:28.330
OK.

08:28.390 --> 08:31.500
And I need it to be small not very big.

08:32.790 --> 08:34.670
That's it was and I need it like this.

08:34.840 --> 08:35.060
OK.

08:35.080 --> 08:38.720
That's all I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit save for now.

08:39.150 --> 08:39.640
OK.

08:39.730 --> 08:41.250
I have I did that in the sidebar.

08:41.260 --> 08:45.440
But I want to just try and drop it right here in the next day.

08:45.680 --> 08:54.290
Now let's go ahead and let's refresh so I can see that this is how it is coming inside here in the footer.

08:54.290 --> 08:59.240
And mostly people do have the footer mostly websites.

08:59.240 --> 08:59.810
OK.

08:59.810 --> 09:01.750
Let me show you the examples.

09:01.790 --> 09:09.800
Even you to me has that OK if I just open up my profile and then I go down he can see this is the area

09:09.860 --> 09:13.360
that we have is basically called the footer.

09:13.520 --> 09:13.940
OK.

09:14.140 --> 09:18.310
So and like this if I just open up Apple.

09:18.380 --> 09:20.200
Let's open up the plug.

09:20.550 --> 09:21.320
OK.

09:21.440 --> 09:26.050
And then I go down go down and you can see this is the area that we have for Apple.

09:26.210 --> 09:29.720
So they have used menus right here same like this you can use the menu.

09:30.020 --> 09:34.630
OK for a foot or two you can show a menu.

09:34.760 --> 09:35.190
OK.

09:35.420 --> 09:36.970
Let's see if we have a menu.

09:38.410 --> 09:39.740
Navigation menu.

09:40.220 --> 09:40.530
OK.

09:40.540 --> 09:43.560
I'm going to add this to for two and I'm going to add the widget.

09:43.720 --> 09:44.100

09:44.230 --> 09:47.310
And then I have to select the menu to the menus that way.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.350
So let's suppose that I want to add a new menu.

09:49.510 --> 09:53.750
Let's just go to the menu right here and I want to create that menu to be like for menu.

09:53.770 --> 09:58.660

I'm going to come here and I'm going to refresh this and you can see how it is looking.

11:12.390 --> 11:15.760
Home About Us law conduct this and everything.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.970
So I'm going to select the title to be like

11:21.410 --> 11:24.460
need help need help.

11:25.100 --> 11:25.550
OK.

11:25.730 --> 11:28.030
And so you can keep it like a menu.

11:28.340 --> 11:33.100
All pages or the site map or anything.

11:33.100 --> 11:38.400
So let's go ahead and let's just save it and let's have a look at this OK.

11:38.400 --> 11:42.470
You can see our Web site now looks kind of professional.

11:42.540 --> 11:47.980
Not very much professional but it looks kind of professional so you can see it size about us.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.520
All pages and everything.

11:49.530 --> 11:51.900
But I don't think so.

11:51.900 --> 11:57.600
If the footer is looking cool so I'm going to go to this and I'm going to remove this

12:00.550 --> 12:01.870
and remove it from here.

12:01.940 --> 12:02.520
That's all.

12:02.720 --> 12:08.700
Let's go ahead and let's refresh and you can see that there is no footer and or side.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.520
Now looks much better.

12:10.630 --> 12:11.470
Instead of that.

12:11.620 --> 12:17.580
