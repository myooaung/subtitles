00:00.770 --> 00:06.320
What is up guys and what Kamarck so you can see that now our domain has been propagated and it's been

00:06.320 --> 00:08.770
like only 30 minutes not more than that.

00:08.930 --> 00:12.550
And you can see that if I refreshed this you can see that this page is being loaded.

00:12.590 --> 00:13.520
So this is how it works.

00:13.580 --> 00:17.010
If I want to add anything right here this will appear OK.

00:17.090 --> 00:18.620
So let's just check this OK.

00:18.620 --> 00:21.580
If I want to add a file I'm just going to come here.

00:21.710 --> 00:27.630
I'm going to add file and the file name is going to be.

00:27.830 --> 00:31.260
Hello dot h t m l.

00:31.370 --> 00:37.300
OK I don't want to create new file so you can see that it says hello HVM mail.

00:37.430 --> 00:44.920
I want to edit this edit OK and edit.

00:45.040 --> 00:50.590
So here now you can see that I added this whole mail and then let's see how this file is going to look

00:50.590 --> 00:52.070
so I want to add.

00:52.140 --> 00:56.410
Hello walde.

00:56.850 --> 00:59.770
And I'm going to hit Save now.

01:00.180 --> 01:03.830
So now let's go ahead and let's view our page here.

01:03.870 --> 01:10.820
And I want to hit this so here if I now refresh rate this page here again to see how this is going to

01:10.820 --> 01:11.030
look.

01:11.030 --> 01:13.390
You can see that haloed on each team is coming.

01:13.490 --> 01:19.720
And if I open this up you can see this is coming hello world so this is how our this domain is propagated

01:19.730 --> 01:22.170
and this is basically called Root editor.

01:22.200 --> 01:25.110
OK I'm just going to come here and I'm going to delete this file.

01:25.390 --> 01:26.550
Ok I'm going to come here.

01:26.570 --> 01:28.220
I'm going to hit delete.

01:28.220 --> 01:28.880
There we go.

01:28.910 --> 01:32.770
Now what I want I want to install would present this.

01:32.780 --> 01:34.670
OK so how I'm going install this.

01:34.670 --> 01:38.590
So we know the first method that how a word press is installed.

01:38.630 --> 01:45.140
You just have to go to the building you would say OK and

01:55.640 --> 01:57.890
then you have to select your domain name.

01:58.010 --> 02:02.300
OK so our domain name would be complete double course dot com.

02:02.530 --> 02:08.420
OK and I want to just hit next and the word press will be installed in my this directory.

02:08.450 --> 02:15.560
So this directory is basically referring to this home or root directory and this root directory is basically

02:15.560 --> 02:16.340
this one.

02:16.340 --> 02:19.990
OK so what you have to do you have to then just hit next.

02:20.150 --> 02:26.690
And then you have to hit block title admin user first name last name and admin email and then press

02:26.910 --> 02:29.050
will be installed on this.

02:29.090 --> 02:32.760
But instead we will be using a different method today.

02:32.780 --> 02:34.550
I'm going to show you how this is going to look.

02:34.720 --> 02:38.300
OK so what you have to do have to just close this when there right now.

02:38.300 --> 02:44.900
OK you have to go to the host get to the main panel OK and you have to come here and we basically need

02:44.900 --> 02:46.670
to install WordPress in it.

02:46.670 --> 02:48.190
So how were you going to do this.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.760
Let me close all these tabs

02:52.480 --> 02:52.820

03:40.310 --> 03:44.720

We need to reload and again see that every file is right here.

05:19.940 --> 05:22.330

And there we go.

05:48.440 --> 05:48.900
You can see.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.690
Welcome to WordPress before getting started.

05:50.690 --> 05:52.600
We need some information on the database.

05:52.620 --> 05:55.500
You'll need to know the following items before proceeding.

05:55.520 --> 06:00.410
So I want to know the database name that I mis use a name that is passed for a database host and table

06:00.410 --> 06:01.310

06:01.340 --> 06:04.210
So what I want to do I want to just go click Let's go.

06:04.400 --> 06:11.330
And here I am in the Wordpress database so that my wordpress database name is going to be OK.

06:11.390 --> 06:13.540
We need to basically create a database.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.090
Now how are you going to do that.

06:15.230 --> 06:20.910
We're going to go down and here it takes my admin my ask Cuil databases.

06:20.930 --> 06:30.900

06:45.180 --> 06:46.260
I'm going to go back

06:48.970 --> 06:52.200
and here we go you can see that database has been created.

06:52.240 --> 06:58.250
Now I want to assign this database a user so that database user is going to be my own user.

06:58.270 --> 07:01.000
I'm going to add my own name that is going to be Tanz.

07:01.180 --> 07:03.540
I want to enter the password right now.

07:03.820 --> 07:04.630
So

07:10.320 --> 07:15.900
here we go.

07:16.030 --> 07:17.470
The password has been entered.

07:17.470 --> 07:24.080
Now what I want to do I want to hit create user so the user should be created right now.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.340
OK the user has been created.

07:26.500 --> 07:34.930
Now I want to go back OK and I want to go down and you can see that I have these users right here said

07:34.940 --> 07:42.280
this was the user that was automatically created when we installed would PRAST from that site essentially.

07:42.280 --> 07:47.050
OK so now what we want to do is that we want to add the user to the database.

07:47.060 --> 07:49.610
I want to add this user to this.

07:49.620 --> 07:51.920

07:51.920 --> 07:58.640
I want to hit add and you can see that I want to hit all privileges and I want to hit make changes.

08:00.650 --> 08:01.270
Here we go.

08:01.310 --> 08:02.230
I want to go back now

08:05.370 --> 08:07.400
and now here you can see that database.

08:07.400 --> 08:12.230
Is this the privileged user is this and everything is totally OK.

08:12.240 --> 08:18.480
So I want to copy my database name right now I want to come here to this database name and I want to

08:18.480 --> 08:20.560
paste it ok.

08:20.740 --> 08:21.850
I want to seem like this.

08:21.850 --> 08:25.630
I want to enter the user name so my user name is going to be

08:30.670 --> 08:32.840
here and we need to copy this username.

08:33.050 --> 08:33.720
OK.

08:34.060 --> 08:39.750
Copy come here and paste seemed like this will want to enter the password

08:45.750 --> 08:51.330
OK and database host is going to be localhost and the table Prefect's.

08:51.330 --> 08:56.520
So if you want to run multiple WordPress installation in a single database change this.

08:56.520 --> 09:02.100
So if you want to run a lot of multiple WordPress installation like if you want to install three or

09:02.100 --> 09:08.450
four Boy press you will be creating subdomain names here and we will be moving on with this.

09:08.460 --> 09:13.840
So I just wanted to add a prefix to BWP mean OK.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.850
Sloopy main underscore.

09:16.020 --> 09:16.690
And then this.

09:16.710 --> 09:21.800
OK so what I have to do I have to now hit submit and again see

09:25.130 --> 09:26.730
OK let's try again.

09:26.780 --> 09:27.980
So there is a problem.

09:28.190 --> 09:29.520
OK.

09:32.390 --> 09:35.240
I want to come here and want to make this to be

09:39.590 --> 09:42.230
OK let's go ahead and let's try to enter this.

09:42.270 --> 09:44.290
Musically I entered the wrong password.

09:44.300 --> 09:45.910
That is why it gave me an error.

09:45.910 --> 09:49.580
Now let's hit submit and I can see that everything is done.

09:49.610 --> 09:54.740
Now what I have to do I have to just run the install so you can see that the installation has been completed

09:54.980 --> 10:00.440
and now we have to enter the site title username password email and search engine visibility.

10:00.440 --> 10:10.060
OK so now you can see that our insider WordPress database if I just tried to open up the HP my admin

10:10.460 --> 10:14.340
you can see that here would be all my wordpress database files.

10:14.530 --> 10:15.300
OK.

10:15.340 --> 10:16.790
It is redirecting me.

10:16.950 --> 10:22.360
Let's wait and see in this panel.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.790
I have seen of course.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.400
So I have no tables found in this right now.

10:27.580 --> 10:33.160
But once I entered that information I want to enter the information to my type site title is going to

10:33.160 --> 10:34.990
be complete

10:38.390 --> 10:42.450
w p course OK.

10:42.620 --> 10:48.370
My user name is going to be my name and who should be my password.

10:48.370 --> 10:48.660
So

11:00.220 --> 11:03.030
and I want to enter my e-mail address.

11:03.570 --> 11:03.920
OK.

11:03.930 --> 11:07.200
And I want to hit install We dress.

11:07.250 --> 11:11.260
OK so let's say this and again see that word press has been installed.

11:11.300 --> 11:18.830
And now when I refresh this you will see that all the press installation is done here in this database.

11:18.830 --> 11:25.320
So I'm basically telling you that one is the back end of word press Howard press is used Howard press

11:25.320 --> 11:27.200
has made and order everything.

11:27.210 --> 11:33.530
So you can see that in this table I mean in this career options I have these my you or our home blog

11:33.530 --> 11:38.110
name blog description admen email and everything right here.

11:38.110 --> 11:41.510
So this is our words this is basically the loop and the scroll options.

11:41.540 --> 11:46.800
This is the blue and the school users would have allowed every user right here or I will have my password

11:46.800 --> 11:53.020
safe and everything so everything is saved and this is actually my school password OK.

11:53.090 --> 11:54.440
So this is how it is working.

11:54.620 --> 12:02.060
If I just come here and I just basically hit log in let's say log in and again see.

12:02.060 --> 12:06.980
Now I want to add to this my this and I want to also add the password

12:10.380 --> 12:13.740
OK here we go you can see that I am in the dashboard.

12:13.920 --> 12:16.390
I can now just hit Please update now.

12:18.040 --> 12:19.410
So you need to update it.

12:19.450 --> 12:20.910
I'm just going to hit update now.

12:22.790 --> 12:25.000
And it is of the day.

12:25.790 --> 12:29.160
You can see that word plus four point nine point one has been updated.

12:29.270 --> 12:31.200

12:31.220 --> 12:35.870
We have a complete course dot com up and running totally.

12:35.990 --> 12:45.130
OK so you can see so this will be basically we will create our complete B course and information about

12:45.130 --> 12:45.370

12:48.470 --> 12:49.080
But we will.

12:49.090 --> 12:53.540
