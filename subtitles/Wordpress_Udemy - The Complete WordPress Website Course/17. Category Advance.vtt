WEBVTT

00:00.340 --> 00:01.490
What is a guy use and what kmax.

00:01.530 --> 00:05.910
Now in this video you'll be working up with the categories section OK so you can see that if I just

00:05.910 --> 00:13.020
go to the men McCraven in the category of the T-shirts you can see that we have two subcategories that

00:13.020 --> 00:15.050
is men and the other one is women.

00:15.060 --> 00:22.350
So if I want to show the subcategories here instead of these products here in this category what I want

00:22.350 --> 00:28.260
to do what I have to do I have to just go to this added category section right here or I can just go

00:28.260 --> 00:30.830
to display here I can go to the dashboard OK.

00:30.960 --> 00:34.700
And then here I can go to the appearance and then categories.

00:34.700 --> 00:37.350
OK so try the products and then category.

00:37.350 --> 00:39.410
So here we can work with it.

00:44.700 --> 00:48.590
So here what I have to do I have to just click here edit.

00:48.760 --> 00:49.330
OK.

00:49.410 --> 00:51.630
It will take me to the edit page.

00:51.690 --> 00:54.800
The next thing what you can do is that you can just click click here.

00:54.900 --> 00:55.880
Added category.

00:56.070 --> 00:56.820
OK.

00:56.820 --> 01:01.670
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to come here to the display type and then I have to select subcategories.

01:01.680 --> 01:02.200
OK.

01:02.340 --> 01:07.660
Because the display type is the products is what it was default to default.

01:07.680 --> 01:11.760
OK so default is just going to show the products.

01:11.850 --> 01:12.270
OK.

01:12.360 --> 01:16.970
So if we choose products it's going to show the products default is basically product itself.

01:17.130 --> 01:20.270
And if we choose some categories here and there may be updated.

01:20.370 --> 01:20.920
Okay.

01:20.970 --> 01:26.610
And then I just come here and I just refresh this then he will see will show subcategories like in the

01:26.660 --> 01:28.980
T-shirt it is showing that men.

01:28.980 --> 01:33.150
So if I just click here in the man then he can see that man is here.

01:33.150 --> 01:37.190
And then I have three products and that is men.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.070
So this is how the category works.

01:39.150 --> 01:45.510
And if I just choose that it should show both of the things then I have dated and then I come here and

01:45.510 --> 01:46.980
then I refresh this.

01:46.980 --> 01:53.310
Then you will see that men is coming here and the products as well are also coming so do not use the

01:53.310 --> 01:54.260
bolts one.

01:54.310 --> 01:58.310
OK you can go with the normal one that means that the subcategories will only show.

01:58.310 --> 01:59.800
It will show the subcategories.

01:59.860 --> 02:04.530
It all works like a charm so that if you just add a moment then here would be the form in itself as

02:04.530 --> 02:04.920
well.

02:05.060 --> 02:05.490
OK.

02:05.580 --> 02:06.590
But do not.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.230
Who said that.

02:08.340 --> 02:12.680
OK so I'll be just going up the default one because I want to show all the products in it.

02:12.690 --> 02:15.150
I don't want to show the navigation here.

02:15.390 --> 02:22.260
I can instead I can create a menu for that for that like men and the form in itself in the morning section

02:22.260 --> 02:28.930
OK so you can see everything is up and running and everything is totally coming here on my website.

02:29.100 --> 02:29.540
OK.

02:29.640 --> 02:33.010
So now we're a bit down the category section.

02:33.030 --> 02:36.430
OK you guys have the knowledge of everything.

02:36.500 --> 02:40.530
And you guys can now understand how everything works.

02:40.560 --> 02:41.240
OK.

02:41.790 --> 02:45.740
So now we will be working up for the checkout stuff OK.

02:45.780 --> 02:50.650
We will be working over that check out that how a person can check out and how a person can fit it in.

02:50.680 --> 02:53.540
But before doing that we want to work for them anyway.

02:53.550 --> 02:56.620
So let's just go to the menu we're a here and let's just work to the menu.

02:56.640 --> 03:00.110
I'm going to show you that how can you create a menu for your e-commerce based Web site.

03:00.120 --> 03:01.410
So let's just say it many one

03:04.280 --> 03:08.830
OK let's just create minium and then we can see there is right here.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.550
You need to add the home first.

03:10.770 --> 03:11.370
OK.

03:11.550 --> 03:14.110
This is where I want to assign this to primary menu first.

03:14.150 --> 03:19.560
OK so now let's go ahead and let's see if our menu is up and running.

03:19.560 --> 03:20.030
Here we go.

03:20.040 --> 03:20.900
This is wrong.

03:21.180 --> 03:22.210
Now let's come here.

03:22.230 --> 03:25.900
The first thing we have to do is that we need to add a shop.

03:25.920 --> 03:35.370
We need to add a cart and then we need to add the My Account as well and the checkout card is already

03:35.370 --> 03:40.260
here so we don't want to show it let's come here and let's just sit at too many and you can see that

03:40.290 --> 03:41.290
it is already here.

03:41.310 --> 03:44.450
So I need to bring the shop under this.

03:44.580 --> 03:48.950
OK we have my account and my checkout should be below here.

03:49.260 --> 03:50.710
So let's just say it saved money.

03:50.910 --> 03:55.140
If you don't want to show the check out just remove it because a person can just go to card and then

03:55.140 --> 03:57.390
check it out so you don't have to show it.

03:57.390 --> 04:01.870
So we just have the home shop and the My Account page.

04:01.890 --> 04:02.350
OK.

04:02.430 --> 04:03.740
So everything is up and running.

04:03.750 --> 04:10.500
If I just click here the card and if anything is in the card then the person can directly click and

04:10.500 --> 04:14.370
he will be taken to the Cziko page itself so you don't have to add that.

04:14.400 --> 04:20.640
But first what we have to do is that Vieni to create a page where they would show all the categories

04:20.640 --> 04:21.460
that we have.

04:21.560 --> 04:22.010
OK.

04:22.140 --> 04:23.430
So how are you going to do that.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.550
Just have to come here to dashboard.

04:25.900 --> 04:26.410
OK.

04:26.520 --> 04:27.670
And then we need to create it.

04:27.780 --> 04:32.550
So the page that I want to create is that I will name it as all categories.

04:32.550 --> 04:33.050
OK.

04:33.150 --> 04:36.390
So let's just say it all and then listed all categories

04:41.770 --> 04:44.540
this page is going to show all the categories that we have.

04:44.560 --> 04:48.760
But we need to add a code here so that it crab's the category.

04:48.760 --> 04:49.440
What does it go to.

04:49.440 --> 04:54.030
You just have to come here and then you have to head if you commerce short gourdes.

04:54.180 --> 04:54.620
OK.

04:54.790 --> 05:00.280
And then you have to click here and then this is the here they can see that this is how it is coming

05:00.280 --> 05:01.690
so I'm just going to click here.

05:02.670 --> 05:05.720
OK let's just click this one this link instead of that

05:10.450 --> 05:13.970
let's go back let's just click here and we have the official view commoner's.

05:13.990 --> 05:14.500
OK.

05:14.560 --> 05:17.150
So this this court is going to show the card.

05:17.230 --> 05:21.040
This court is going to show the check out this court is going to show them my account page and this

05:21.040 --> 05:25.070
show is going to show the order tracking form.

05:25.360 --> 05:26.310
So let's go back.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.830
Let's go down let's go down and we have the products one right here.

05:29.890 --> 05:30.520
OK.

05:30.520 --> 05:37.540
So now let's go down let's go down till we have the categories so you can see will display a specified

05:37.540 --> 05:38.590
product category.

05:38.640 --> 05:42.360
OK best selling will display the best selling products.

05:42.740 --> 05:45.810
OK show featured products you can show it like this.

05:45.810 --> 05:47.590
Visibility's equals featured.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.510
And these are the short gourds that we can add.

05:50.920 --> 05:51.310
OK.

05:51.490 --> 05:54.480
So first let's just come here.

05:59.950 --> 06:06.520
And we want to go to the product category will display a specified product categories and display all

06:06.520 --> 06:10.840
your product categories so I just want to add the categories all the categories so I'm just going to

06:10.850 --> 06:14.110
come here I'm going to copy this and I'm going to come here and I'm going to paste it.

06:14.110 --> 06:19.090
So this is the chord that is going to show all the categories that my page has.

06:19.090 --> 06:20.260
And I'm going to hit publish.

06:20.620 --> 06:26.370
And now if I just go here to view this page and then you can see how all the categories are coming.

06:26.380 --> 06:33.400
So we have non-super Hoodie's super Hoodie's T-shirts man and hoodies and everything is coming here

06:33.670 --> 06:37.470
so you can see everything is totally up and running.

06:39.020 --> 06:41.650
So now this is the thing that we have to focus on.

06:41.650 --> 06:47.170
And this is the attribute how you can how you can design this thing according to this.

06:47.290 --> 06:48.970
OK I'm going to explain you right now.

06:48.980 --> 06:53.660
But first what I have to do I just want to come here and I want to remove the sidebar so I don't want

06:53.660 --> 06:57.740
to show the sidebar here so I'm just gonna click full of it and I'm going to hit update trade now.

06:57.740 --> 07:00.470
And you can see that this trial bar should have been removed.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.080
If I just come here and then you can see this.

07:03.110 --> 07:07.100
There is no sidebar but we have the four columns instead.

07:07.250 --> 07:09.440
I want to show five column so what I'm going to do.

07:09.530 --> 07:13.640
I'm just going to come here and you can see that it's these columns so this is the attribute that I

07:13.640 --> 07:15.630
can add in my category.

07:15.650 --> 07:15.890
OK.

07:15.890 --> 07:19.080
I'm just going to click edit bays and let's open this up in a new tab.

07:19.310 --> 07:24.090
Ok then here I want to add a column C or L U M and S.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.360
Ok let's check the spelling from here.

07:27.290 --> 07:27.860
OK.

07:28.070 --> 07:30.930
And then here we have to add an is equal to.

07:31.040 --> 07:31.660
OK.

07:31.670 --> 07:35.360
And then let's see if we also have to add the double quotes here.

07:35.420 --> 07:37.340
So we have to add the double.

07:37.350 --> 07:39.410
OK let's just come here and

07:42.110 --> 07:46.200
Gollum's and then we have to add the double quotes double codes.

07:46.360 --> 07:46.890
OK.

07:46.910 --> 07:48.600
And then here we have to add five.

07:48.650 --> 07:53.180
So now let's go ahead and let's get up date and let's see if this works or not.

07:53.210 --> 07:53.720
OK.

07:53.720 --> 07:54.590
I'm just going to come here.

07:54.590 --> 07:59.600
I'm going to come here and I'm going to every first this so you can see this is totally up and running.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.390
This is coming exactly.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.490
Now we have the order by.

08:03.620 --> 08:09.820
We have the S-K use we have that category and then we have the class so add adds and then each team

08:09.820 --> 08:15.860
old Reppert clus you can modify the specific output that customs uses on sale at best selling and top

08:15.860 --> 08:16.430
rated.

08:16.670 --> 08:22.060
So you can see you can just customize it if I want to order.

08:22.160 --> 08:22.480
OK.

08:22.490 --> 08:29.390
So orders states are the product ordering is ascending or descending using the third set an order by

08:29.480 --> 08:31.180
default to accept.

08:31.200 --> 08:36.980
So if you wanted to order any of the product by the data you need the manual ordered the popularity

08:37.550 --> 08:38.210
and the random.

08:38.210 --> 08:43.080
So if I just select it to be like order by and random then you will see if I just refresh.

08:43.100 --> 08:46.960
You can see that this is coming like non-super Hoodie's on top and everything is this.

08:47.000 --> 08:53.570
But if I just come here and I just come here and I just said order by is equal to do.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.000
And then this And then I want to add the random.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.530
So let's just see what is the random This is Rand.

08:58.550 --> 08:59.150
OK.

08:59.180 --> 08:59.980
I'm just going to come here.

08:59.990 --> 09:02.380
I'm going to hit this and I'm going to hit enter and.

09:02.420 --> 09:04.200
OK and now let's hit a beat.

09:06.520 --> 09:11.220
So now let's come here and let's refresh this and you'll see these categories will be randomly assigned.

09:11.230 --> 09:11.820
OK.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.180
Here we go.

09:13.240 --> 09:17.040
If I just refresh it again these categories will be randomly assigned.

09:17.500 --> 09:21.970
OK if I just refresh it here again this is how it works.

09:22.180 --> 09:22.770
OK.

09:22.900 --> 09:24.750
This is Autor by Rand.

09:24.790 --> 09:25.390
OK.

09:25.390 --> 09:31.390
And then we have the reading so you can reading but this will not be applied to the categories.

09:31.390 --> 09:33.570
OK so the categories are different.

09:33.570 --> 09:38.070
You can just work with the columns you can work with the limits but you can not break with these Otterbein

09:38.070 --> 09:39.130
by stuff much.

09:39.190 --> 09:41.390
So I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit move.

09:41.410 --> 09:45.520
OK so these these will work perfect for the product itself.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.980
So for products you can just so for the products.

09:48.040 --> 09:48.630
OK.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.540
And then you have to select like ID.

09:51.610 --> 09:52.980
And then there you can show it.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.850
So this is how it's going to work.

09:54.850 --> 09:59.960
Now let's come here and here you can see that we also want to add this page.

09:59.980 --> 10:03.770
Let's just come here and let's see we also want to add this speech to our menials.

10:03.790 --> 10:04.640
I'm going to go here.

10:04.640 --> 10:07.450
I mean it's just going to refresh my mind you were here.

10:07.450 --> 10:08.700
OK.

10:08.890 --> 10:13.150
And then here you will see if I just click view all this is the all categories page.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.200
I also want to add this.

10:15.250 --> 10:18.850
So this is here I'm just going to drag it right above any can see this is here.

10:18.970 --> 10:23.800
OK what I want to do right now I want to add Devu commerce categories so

10:26.780 --> 10:28.060
OK.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.250
We'll see if we have product categories.

10:38.250 --> 10:38.460
OK.

10:38.460 --> 10:42.840
This is the one you have to just come here to the screen options and then you have to select the product

10:42.840 --> 10:45.760
categories and this will appear right here.

10:45.870 --> 10:49.510
I'm going to come here I'm going to click here and now I'm going to drag these categories from here.

10:49.530 --> 10:54.050
So first I need the in all categories I need all one.

10:54.050 --> 10:57.020
So let's just select all and too many them.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.680
So these must be added to the menu.

10:58.680 --> 11:04.980
You can see OK what I want to do right now I want to just print your tray here.

11:04.980 --> 11:06.870
This is the subcategory.

11:07.140 --> 11:08.820
And then I want to bring the men here.

11:08.820 --> 11:16.730
This is more some of this I wanted to bring the zipper Hoodie's here and the non-Labor Hoodie's here.

11:17.020 --> 11:18.550
OK let's just say it all.

So I also wanted the Hoodie's sections.

11:20.950 --> 11:22.090

And everything is totally up and running so I'm going to come here.

11:48.090 --> 11:49.490
I'm going to hit Savery now.

11:50.100 --> 11:53.260
And you can see that if I just come here and I just click here.

11:53.700 --> 11:54.990
Then you will see how this is going to look.

11:54.990 --> 11:56.340
So we have all categories.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.040
We have two categories coming.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.470
We have T-shirts and then we have the men and women.

12:00.630 --> 12:05.790
And then we go down to Hoodie's we have this like this so you can pretty well create categories like

12:05.790 --> 12:06.080
this.

12:06.090 --> 12:12.450
If you have a big e-commerce online store like if we go to Amazon you have like men and we have shirts

12:13.410 --> 12:18.900
like accessories Banse and something like that so you can create it yeah you just have got the idea

12:19.200 --> 12:23.690
that I was going to marry it and if I just go to all categories and it's going to show all the categories.

12:24.120 --> 12:25.030
So this is how it works.

12:25.080 --> 12:25.430
OK.

12:25.440 --> 12:29.320
And if you don't want any page right here you just want a sub menu.

12:29.350 --> 12:30.590
Then how can you work with it.

12:30.630 --> 12:31.260
OK.

12:31.290 --> 12:33.230
What you have to do you have to just come here.

12:33.430 --> 12:33.970
OK.

12:34.260 --> 12:41.790
And then you have to say you have to come here to the custom legs.

12:41.830 --> 12:42.270
OK.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.730
And then the customer thinks you need a hash only.

12:44.800 --> 12:45.250
OK.

12:45.250 --> 12:48.860
And then you have to click all categories.

12:49.400 --> 12:49.970
OK.

12:50.050 --> 12:52.630
And then what you have to do you have to just sit at two men.

12:52.950 --> 12:53.580
OK.

12:53.590 --> 12:59.910
And then here you need to bring this right above here.

13:00.160 --> 13:05.860
And then I have to just come here and I have to move this so you can see everything is right here.

13:05.860 --> 13:10.060
I'm going to bring this up here and I'm going to bring this here so you can see now this is the custom

13:10.060 --> 13:10.840
link.

13:10.900 --> 13:11.480
OK.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.920
And no one can click here.

13:14.020 --> 13:14.630
OK.

13:14.650 --> 13:19.810
Like this if I just come here and I just threw Frances and you can see this is not a sign if I just

13:19.810 --> 13:20.470
click here.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.880
Nothing works.

13:21.880 --> 13:25.060
But this is basically a menu right here.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.820
So this is how it works.

13:26.830 --> 13:31.180
OK so now you can see that we are also done with the menu of the category.

13:31.180 --> 13:32.690
This is totally up and running.

13:32.710 --> 13:34.740
We can just worry that a short gorges.

13:34.750 --> 13:40.330
Well OK and we can work with them so we can show the product category we can show that featured products

13:40.660 --> 13:45.980
we can show that some sale products and we can also show the best selling products in everything.

13:46.310 --> 13:46.930
OK.

13:47.020 --> 13:51.000
So here you can see that everything is totally up and running OK.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.530
Now here OK.

13:53.730 --> 13:55.980
What if we've designed this ourselves.

13:55.990 --> 13:56.890
OK.

13:58.900 --> 14:02.920
If I want to design this page myself how I am going to do this.

14:02.950 --> 14:03.550
OK.

14:03.550 --> 14:05.450
If you don't want to use the default one.

14:05.590 --> 14:07.560
OK we can design this ourself.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.090
We don't have to buy the pro version we can just go with this.

14:10.090 --> 14:14.830
We're going to show sell products again just come here and then we can show the sale products and we

14:14.830 --> 14:16.930
can add the heading on sale in the next video.

14:16.930 --> 14:23.530
I'm going to show you how can you design your home page yourself and how can you not use this one.

14:23.590 --> 14:23.840
OK.

14:23.890 --> 14:27.380
So this will basically give you an experience that how can you work with it.

14:27.520 --> 14:29.420
And then we'll be working up at the checkout Deb..

14:29.620 --> 14:31.380
So Stadion guys and goodbye.
