00:00.800 --> 00:05.100
Hey all the guys and welcome back so now in this video we will be working out what the sidebar right

00:05.130 --> 00:08.130
now so you can see the site where it looks not good.

00:08.280 --> 00:12.180
OK and obviously we have to design this sidebar so that red tape looks good.

00:12.240 --> 00:16.350
I'm just going to get a dashboard right now and I want to go to the appearance and then I'm going to

00:16.350 --> 00:19.160
go to that vigil right now so when you

00:22.510 --> 00:23.200
have everything.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.230
So I'm just gonna remove the search first.

00:25.390 --> 00:25.960
OK.

00:26.020 --> 00:31.450
I want to remove the recent boast the recent Commons

00:36.260 --> 00:39.120
elytra move so much things so I'm just going to come here.

00:39.140 --> 00:44.820
I'm going to remove the categories and the men as well.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.350
So here we need to show something so this will be like you can add the VB press forum search you can

00:51.670 --> 00:52.940
press for him list.

00:53.190 --> 00:55.660
OK you can have the press log in budget.

00:55.890 --> 00:57.880
You going have to rescind replies.

00:57.900 --> 01:01.560
Recent topics topics Krups and log in.

01:01.560 --> 01:08.760
So first I think I should show the log in I'm sure log in farm logged our visitors log out link to those

01:08.760 --> 01:09.390
who are locked in.

01:09.390 --> 01:10.800
So this is like here.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.430
So it will show like if I am logged in.

01:13.470 --> 01:13.760
OK.

01:13.790 --> 01:15.820
And then then it will show a log out.

01:15.840 --> 01:21.540
So if I wanted to log out then I can just log out from here so you can see it is just my profile and

01:21.540 --> 01:23.210
I can just log myself out.

01:23.370 --> 01:25.020

So.

01:40.260 --> 01:43.490

01:50.520 --> 01:55.700
We have the players we have the members and so we have side by side no notices.

01:55.980 --> 02:02.760

03:45.600 --> 03:51.670
In the who's on line tab it should show like Lindsay is also online and who's all linked up so there's

03:51.670 --> 03:52.540
a way to get to work.

03:52.790 --> 03:53.270
OK.

03:53.370 --> 03:55.140
We have to refresh this page.

03:55.430 --> 03:55.940

03:55.940 --> 03:58.360
I want to refresh.

03:58.480 --> 03:58.950

04:05.680 --> 04:06.730
So this is how it is looking.

04:06.730 --> 04:08.940
I can just Also message myself.

04:08.950 --> 04:16.210
I can also just send him a public message like I can post on his wall so posting on the wall is basically

04:16.270 --> 04:21.760
all the public message that will appear on the activity of our Web site so an activity it's just going

04:21.760 --> 04:22.420
to appear here.

04:22.420 --> 04:24.720
So this is how this body press works.

04:24.760 --> 04:30.120
And I just love it guys if you want to just build a social networking site within the word president

04:30.120 --> 04:31.670
and see how a does it.

04:31.670 --> 04:36.490
Look we have activity profile they have no notifications and messages.

04:36.490 --> 04:36.720
OK.

04:36.720 --> 04:37.760
We have friends.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.200
No friending friend of.

04:39.310 --> 04:44.530
And we also have group settings and everything so the person can also just go to settings general delete

04:44.530 --> 04:45.720
account and profile.

04:45.850 --> 04:48.200
And so he's just going to go to general right now.

04:48.420 --> 04:48.670
OK.

04:48.670 --> 04:53.560
And then he can just move around around with his settings email and everything so he can change anything.

04:53.650 --> 04:55.680
And then he can change it like safe change.

04:55.690 --> 05:01.200
So this is how this works and this is pretty valid and see that he has this techie back he is his user

05:01.200 --> 05:01.560
name.

05:01.570 --> 05:05.710
This is coming and he has this e-mail profile visibility.

05:05.710 --> 05:11.470
So in the profile of his ability he can check and in the crops like he can just say like that if a new

05:11.470 --> 05:16.670
member send him a message he should send him an email an e-mail is sent.

05:16.690 --> 05:22.390
Basically guys so and the profile his ability he can select name will be visible to all of the members

05:22.390 --> 05:24.900
and he can even delete his account if you want to.

05:24.910 --> 05:25.990
So who is to select this.

05:25.990 --> 05:30.910
And he has suggested delayed account and deleting her account nosebleed all of that content to have

05:30.910 --> 05:36.610
to deleted his will it will be undiscoverable so you can see how our social networking Web site is looking.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.670
