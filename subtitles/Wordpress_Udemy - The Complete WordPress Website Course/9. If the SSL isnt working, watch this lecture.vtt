00:00.330 --> 00:03.940
OK so now guys we're totally done with our speed optimization.

00:03.940 --> 00:06.050
All right SSL and everything.

00:06.120 --> 00:06.420
OK.

00:06.420 --> 00:09.670
Now I want to thank you all for being part of my course.

00:09.790 --> 00:14.230
Ok I seriously inside teaching you guys.

00:14.310 --> 00:14.700
OK.

00:14.730 --> 00:20.360
Now I want to say one thing and that is if there's SSL is not working OK.

00:20.370 --> 00:22.380
If there's a cell it's still not working.

00:22.480 --> 00:28.650
If this SSL is giving you an error or anything then make sure to just go to dashboard and just use these

00:28.650 --> 00:30.600
type of plug ins that I'm telling you right now.

00:30.660 --> 00:31.180
OK.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.150
Just go to plug ins.

00:32.160 --> 00:37.150
Just go to adenine and then go to SSL or just search for SSL.

00:37.200 --> 00:37.730
OK.

00:38.130 --> 00:40.630
So you can just come here or you can just click here.

00:40.920 --> 00:45.990
And then what you're going to do we're going to just you can choose forward press as it should be.

00:46.020 --> 00:46.780
OK.

00:46.800 --> 00:51.050
So intended to be all in one solution using SSL on wordpress.

00:51.060 --> 00:51.360
OK.

00:51.360 --> 00:58.700
This is like force HD PBS like if you have any HDTV it will force that to be like a CBS.

00:58.710 --> 00:59.110
OK.

00:59.220 --> 01:04.490
And if you have SSL secure content then it's going to do the job as well.

01:04.560 --> 01:07.520
So you can choose any type of plug in.

01:07.610 --> 01:08.060
OK.

01:08.160 --> 01:13.190
You can read that document and then you can find the bug that vair anything is causing.

01:13.230 --> 01:13.640
OK.

01:13.770 --> 01:17.550
And you can see that if the screen padlock is not coming.

01:17.550 --> 01:22.320
OK then what you have to do you have to just right click you have to click inspect element and you have

01:22.320 --> 01:23.420
to go to console.

01:23.430 --> 01:23.830
OK.

01:23.910 --> 01:25.250
So then you will see that.

01:25.290 --> 01:25.610
OK.

01:25.620 --> 01:26.730
This is the console.

01:26.730 --> 01:29.450
Here is a problem and it will give you an error.

01:29.550 --> 01:32.130
Then you have to look into that matter and then you can do that.

01:32.130 --> 01:33.870
So this is so easy guys.

01:33.960 --> 01:34.500
OK.

01:34.740 --> 01:40.290
Mostly people what they do if they get an error they just hire a developers developer only to see OK

01:40.530 --> 01:40.950
the code.

01:40.960 --> 01:45.070
So everybody does not know where the function is causing the issue.

01:45.140 --> 01:52.470
Make sure to go to console and then see where your problem is to not hire a developer for just this

01:52.470 --> 01:53.610
type of small task.

01:53.660 --> 01:56.610
Were going to charge you like a hundred dollars for this.

01:56.910 --> 01:57.340
OK.

01:57.540 --> 01:58.860
So I hope you get it.

01:59.100 --> 02:00.600
So thanks a lot guys for watching this.

02:00.630 --> 02:02.450
I hope you enjoyed my discourse.

02:02.460 --> 02:03.670
OK.

02:03.780 --> 02:05.970
I'll be updating my course in future.

02:05.970 --> 02:09.060
OK so thanks a lot and bye bye.
