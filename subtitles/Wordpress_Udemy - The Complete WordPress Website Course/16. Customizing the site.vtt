03:11.010 --> 03:16.110
And if I just go to visit my site and then you can see what I want to do right now.

03:16.140 --> 03:18.640
I just want to edit this whole thing.

03:18.660 --> 03:23.840
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to go to the customized right here OK and let's see that what

03:23.840 --> 03:25.750

03:25.790 --> 03:32.110
We have site identity we have the header footer background buttons layout menus and everything.

03:32.990 --> 03:36.290
But we cannot edit this home page.

03:36.700 --> 03:37.340
OK.

03:37.370 --> 03:39.130
So how we going to edit it.

03:50.990 --> 03:53.650
So this is the plug in that we have to get.

03:54.140 --> 03:55.130
OK.

03:55.160 --> 04:01.610
In order to just work so you can see if I just open this up you can see it say store for an extension

04:01.610 --> 04:03.100
bundle or pay.

04:03.140 --> 04:08.160
This means storefront is a free initiated team for newcomers.

04:08.180 --> 04:14.230
Make it your without touching the code of storefront extension bundle so you can just work that this

04:14.240 --> 04:15.380
you can work with this.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.380
You can just optimize everything.

04:17.480 --> 04:20.180
You can keep your store running in shape OK.

04:20.270 --> 04:23.810
And then we have this one right here so it get started today.

04:23.900 --> 04:29.000
But I would not recommend you to work for this tour friend because this team is not professional at

04:29.000 --> 04:29.600
all.

04:30.580 --> 04:31.460
Yes sorry.

04:31.590 --> 04:34.680
I'm sorry but this team is not really professional.

04:34.770 --> 04:40.110
We're just working with this team so that we can have the basic understanding.

04:40.240 --> 04:40.760
OK.

04:40.800 --> 04:45.200
And again see that we have already got the basic understanding of this is how this thing works.

04:45.360 --> 04:48.430
And I would not recommend you to move this thing.

04:48.550 --> 04:49.000
OK.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.640
So we are just going to be working over the custom I.S. store front.

04:52.680 --> 04:59.510
Used to have a stick estimate so that we can vary these changes but it is not letting us work that this

04:59.510 --> 05:00.510
section right now.

05:00.690 --> 05:01.550
So I'm just going to go ahead.

05:01.560 --> 05:06.040
I'm going to go to customize and then we're going to customize the look and feel of our.

05:06.070 --> 05:10.780
So let's just start from scratch let's just go from the site identity to the CSA.

05:10.800 --> 05:14.540
So what we have to do we have to go to say that entity and Hurby have a tagline.

05:14.540 --> 05:23.120
So I'm going to add a tag in my tagline is going to be the best online store and hey I want to add a

05:23.120 --> 05:23.560
logo.

05:23.570 --> 05:25.420
So it's just come here to the logo.

05:25.490 --> 05:32.440
I just upload files and select the files so the logo that I want to add right now.

05:32.440 --> 05:34.840
So I'm just going to go to this.

05:35.530 --> 05:36.630
And let's add a logo.

05:36.630 --> 05:38.810
So I'm just going to add this one over.

05:38.970 --> 05:39.580
OK.

05:39.610 --> 05:41.210
This should be added right now.

05:41.290 --> 05:45.340
This is here and it's going to hit select right now and you can see that I need to crop the image.

05:45.340 --> 05:50.850
So let's just increase the size of it and let it drop.

05:51.320 --> 05:54.810
So you can see this is right here and this should be coming here.

05:54.980 --> 05:55.640
OK.

05:55.640 --> 05:56.450
This is like this.

05:56.450 --> 06:00.340
This is the logo that has been added and this is the home blog and everything.

06:00.440 --> 06:00.980
OK.

06:00.980 --> 06:02.580
So you can see that we're done with the logo.

06:02.580 --> 06:04.030
Now let's go to the head right here.

06:04.160 --> 06:09.380
So you can add a header back image if you want to you can add a header background image but I will not

06:09.380 --> 06:11.260
be moving with the header background image.

06:11.500 --> 06:15.410
OK I just want the background colors show the background color to be

06:19.000 --> 06:22.390
the blue gray.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.100
You can see how this is looking.

06:24.280 --> 06:24.940
OK.

06:25.130 --> 06:27.740
I can also go with the red one.

06:27.890 --> 06:29.830
So the back Chrome is going to be red.

06:29.840 --> 06:30.590
OK.

06:30.980 --> 06:33.300
I will be going up for the full block version.

06:33.410 --> 06:39.830
OK so you can see that my head is turned to block the text color is going to be white so it will be

06:39.830 --> 06:40.880
turned to white.

06:41.180 --> 06:41.450
OK.

06:41.450 --> 06:43.340
And the link color which is these.

06:43.340 --> 06:43.610
OK.

06:43.640 --> 06:47.990
I'm going to select this to be right as well so you can see this will be turned white as well see so

06:47.990 --> 06:49.470
how are you looking.

06:49.520 --> 06:52.500
I pray you can see everything is looking totally ok.

06:52.550 --> 06:53.350
Awesome.

06:53.630 --> 06:55.220
I'm going to go down and we have the footer.

06:55.250 --> 06:57.350
So we're going to customize the footer here as well.

06:57.350 --> 07:02.450
I'm going to choose the background colors to be the same block so that we match the header and footer

07:02.450 --> 07:04.040
site everything.

07:04.340 --> 07:10.000
We have the heading color it should be worried the text scores should be filed in a bit of gray and

07:10.040 --> 07:12.620
then color should be saying

07:15.860 --> 07:18.580
OK let's go ahead let's hit publish and let's go back.

07:18.580 --> 07:21.150
So now we have the background which is this one.

07:21.220 --> 07:26.380
OK so you can add a Bactrim image if you want to but I will be moving up with a code and that will be

07:26.440 --> 07:30.060
eBay eBay EBAY so that it turned a bit of gray.

07:30.280 --> 07:31.010
Not before.

07:31.030 --> 07:33.760
So now you can see that this is hole visible.

07:33.760 --> 07:40.170
This is not the full light so I'll be moving up this knowledge to go back and we have the topography.

07:40.180 --> 07:45.580
So you can just change the heading color text color and the link color as well.

07:45.970 --> 07:48.270
I'll be moving up in the default setting right here.

07:49.620 --> 07:52.710
Text color and the link exent color everything is looking great.

07:52.710 --> 07:53.980
Now we have the burden.

07:54.120 --> 08:01.540
So for Button I need to fit the background color so my background color will be blue.

08:02.130 --> 08:04.830
So you can see the blue has been added.

08:05.040 --> 08:09.680
Now here I need to text ticklers so my text color is going to be right.

08:09.840 --> 08:10.130
OK.

08:10.140 --> 08:11.730
And my alternate background color.

08:11.760 --> 08:15.410
So you can have these select the alternate background color if you don't want to add the blue.

08:15.540 --> 08:17.670
So for this I need to add the purple.

08:18.020 --> 08:18.350
OK.

08:18.410 --> 08:22.030
And the alternate background text color would be this one as well.

08:22.350 --> 08:24.420
Let's just go back and we have the layout.

08:24.590 --> 08:25.220
OK.

08:25.230 --> 08:29.010
So here we can select that variable on the sidebar.

08:29.010 --> 08:30.850
You guys already know about it.

08:31.130 --> 08:31.350
OK.

08:31.350 --> 08:36.360
And then we have the menus so you can also work with the menus you can create a main menu right here

08:36.750 --> 08:37.990
and you can work with it.

08:38.130 --> 08:38.580
OK.

08:38.760 --> 08:41.150
So now let's go back to the veggie tray here.

08:41.210 --> 08:44.830
We will be breaking up the digits later on in the upcoming videos.

08:45.030 --> 08:50.070
And now you can see that we're totally done with the styling of our website and our website is totally

08:50.100 --> 08:51.100
new looking.

08:51.120 --> 08:51.760
OK.

08:51.780 --> 08:58.500
So if we just compare the previous version and the new version you will see how great it is it looks

08:58.500 --> 08:59.080
right now.

08:59.180 --> 08:59.600
OK.

08:59.700 --> 09:05.850
So if I also go to the shop page right now you can see how my shop page is and everything.

09:05.930 --> 09:11.060
So you can work with this pretty well and you can design your own e-commerce site like this but this

09:11.060 --> 09:12.780
is not professional OK.

09:12.830 --> 09:14.610
This is just used for learning purposes.

09:14.630 --> 09:21.560
You can build your e-commerce site on this theme if you want to store Fronde is mostly used by so many

09:22.340 --> 09:23.650
commerce based Web site.

09:23.750 --> 09:24.190
OK.

09:24.200 --> 09:29.510
But I would not recommend you if you need professionality in your site if you want to buy the complete

09:29.540 --> 09:31.540
protrusion of the storefront.

09:31.550 --> 09:34.270
You can go you can see that I would but I would not recommend.

09:34.430 --> 09:39.080
So you can see that we're totally done with this in the next video we'll learn about the categories

09:39.080 --> 09:43.550
default section which are the section that we want to show.

09:43.610 --> 09:49.870
And after that we will learn about the checkout things that how a person can check out at our website

09:50.330 --> 09:53.590
and then we will move forward to stadium guys and goodbye.
