00:00.270 --> 00:03.810
What is it guys and what can I say now and this video we're going to be doing the tablet and the mobile

00:03.810 --> 00:04.730
optimization.

00:04.740 --> 00:05.140
OK.

00:05.220 --> 00:08.090
So let's just start and you can see that we are already in the device builder.

00:08.130 --> 00:13.950
I'll show you that how can you optimize your take for mobile and tablet for the home page you can do

00:13.950 --> 00:16.650
that for every of your page that you have right now.

00:16.680 --> 00:17.250
OK.

00:17.250 --> 00:17.880
So let's get started.

00:17.880 --> 00:21.990
First of all what you have to do you have to just come here and he can see that here are three columns

00:21.990 --> 00:25.800
right here the same tablet mode and the SES the mobile mode.

00:25.830 --> 00:29.090
This is how Arab state is going to appear on tablet and mobile.

00:29.100 --> 00:29.580
OK.

00:29.580 --> 00:33.570
So first of all they have to look at the tablet and how it is looking on the tablet mode they can see

00:33.570 --> 00:35.050
that we have that title.

00:35.070 --> 00:36.630
Everything looks cool.

00:36.660 --> 00:37.460
We go down.

00:37.500 --> 00:41.710
This looks cool this looks cool and everything looks cool right here still here.

00:41.730 --> 00:42.250
OK.

00:42.330 --> 00:44.600
And then we have the request a free consultation.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.420
You can see this is not looking cool.

00:46.440 --> 00:47.870
We have to customize it.

00:48.120 --> 00:48.660
OK.

00:48.690 --> 00:50.500
And then we have to customize.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.190
No this is looking already cool.

00:52.200 --> 00:58.880
We go down we have events we have done we have to customize this but I think it is looking cool.

00:58.900 --> 01:03.630
We go down we have declined reviews options so let's go ahead and let's just customize those things

01:03.630 --> 01:04.870
which are not cool.

01:04.920 --> 01:08.410
So I'm going to come here I'm going to come here to request a free consultation right here.

01:08.460 --> 01:21.360
I'm going to go to the design right here and here in this Guyra here I want.

01:21.590 --> 01:29.380
So here I think that for this image right here we don't want this image on to show the tablet because

01:29.690 --> 01:32.340
it is OK to shoot it without the tablet.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.440
Because why this is I mean just not looking cool here.

01:35.480 --> 01:39.410
So I'm just going to double click here and I'm going to go to the advance right here and I'm going to

01:39.410 --> 01:41.980
go to the visibility and I'm going to disable this on tablet.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.830
So this will be disabled on the tablet.

01:44.960 --> 01:45.870
OK.

01:46.070 --> 01:47.390
This is great coming here.

01:47.550 --> 01:49.190
This will be disabled on the tablet mode.

01:49.190 --> 01:49.730
OK.

01:53.260 --> 01:54.670
So let's just come here.

01:54.700 --> 01:57.060
Let's just go down go down.

01:57.250 --> 01:58.510
And here we have this.

01:58.540 --> 01:59.900
Everything looks cool here.

01:59.980 --> 02:03.890
We have discarded here so let's see if we can make some changes to this.

02:04.120 --> 02:05.730
So I'm going to go to the design right here.

02:05.740 --> 02:06.700
I'm going to go to

02:14.110 --> 02:16.740
I think everything looks cool right here.

02:16.780 --> 02:18.000
Everything looks cool.

02:18.010 --> 02:19.710
This is coming is for.

02:19.870 --> 02:24.320
So if he cannot manage this we cannot add this much right here.

02:24.430 --> 02:28.070
But I think it is totally OK so you can manage to

02:33.670 --> 02:34.820
the image.

02:35.290 --> 02:37.060
Let's go down let's go down

02:45.190 --> 02:46.220
the sizing.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.540
So here you can pretty well manage the sizing for the tablet.

02:49.590 --> 02:50.700
So I'm just going to come here.

02:50.700 --> 02:55.950
I'm going to decrease it a bit to create a bed till we get to 4 for economy here.

02:56.250 --> 02:58.850
OK we're not getting the for a column here.

02:59.190 --> 03:01.610
This is still sticking to the three column.

03:01.710 --> 03:05.410
But if you go to the Desmonte you can see there are four calls right here.

03:05.580 --> 03:12.900
So what we're going to do we're going to just come here and let's just click here let's come here and

03:12.900 --> 03:15.040
let's just click this guy right here.

03:15.090 --> 03:15.590
OK.

03:15.690 --> 03:24.660
So I'm going to go to the site using and equalize column height and the

03:27.330 --> 03:32.940
alignment center this right here.

03:35.650 --> 03:39.250
Now we this is just showing the tree right here.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.980
So we cannot work with this.

03:41.010 --> 03:41.920
We cannot work this.

03:41.940 --> 03:45.210
We have added this one right here so we cannot reach for this.

03:45.210 --> 03:45.950
This is added.

03:46.020 --> 03:46.700
This is added.

03:46.710 --> 03:47.780
This will appear like this.

03:47.790 --> 03:48.260
OK.

03:48.390 --> 03:51.100
So you cannot read with it.

03:51.780 --> 03:56.100
You can control the sizing right here if you wanted to control the sizing but you can only control the

03:56.100 --> 03:56.660
spacing.

03:56.760 --> 04:02.880
OK I'm going to I'm just if I just make it like this like this you can see three columns are coming

04:03.180 --> 04:09.200
I don't know why they must have a fix on this so that it will look great you can see on mobile devices

04:09.220 --> 04:10.270
this is how it is looking.

04:10.460 --> 04:11.600
I felt so decrease it.

04:11.600 --> 04:15.460
You can see only fun column is coming.

04:15.590 --> 04:17.520
So we cannot work for this.

04:17.870 --> 04:31.380
We have the border right here as well the box Shatto the filters and the layout overlay M.H. No I can

04:31.380 --> 04:37.080
not break for this OK so I'm going to go down I'm going to come here to this tablet.

04:37.150 --> 04:39.570
And you can see everything looks cool in this.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.570
So we don't have to work on it more.

04:41.590 --> 04:42.010
OK.

04:42.100 --> 04:42.750
I'm going to come here.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.180
I'm going to hit the mobo one.

04:44.340 --> 04:44.770
OK.

04:44.830 --> 04:46.550
So let's see the mobo one.

04:46.750 --> 04:51.920
First thing is this that we want to work with this guy right here we want to change the text of it.

04:52.000 --> 04:59.800
We want to make it a little bit more.

04:59.900 --> 05:04.340
So I'm going to come this come here and I'm going to select this guy right here and then I'm going to

05:04.340 --> 05:07.760
shift to mobile because I don't know why it is not shifting me to move.

05:07.940 --> 05:11.170
I'm going to go to the design right here I'm going to go to that title text.

05:11.330 --> 05:14.970
And here I have this guy right here to make sure that mobile is selected.

05:14.970 --> 05:18.530
You have to just make sure that you change the size of it.

05:18.530 --> 05:21.860
So I'm going to change the size to be thirty four pixels

05:26.070 --> 05:26.640
OK.

05:26.700 --> 05:31.980
Everything looks cool everything looks cool here as well but these burdens are just coming like this

05:31.980 --> 05:36.480
if I just remember I was sure you can see the sizes increasing and this burden is going down.

05:36.480 --> 05:40.020
So I'm going to go to the Burton one as well and I'm going to go to

05:51.480 --> 05:59.530
Biden a buttonhole where blogger radious So Barton and Bonhoeffer to the letter spacing only show icon

05:59.570 --> 06:00.430
for buddy of mine.

06:00.470 --> 06:00.870
So

06:05.750 --> 06:11.020
you can see that if he remove the icon this will be applied to every one.

06:11.180 --> 06:11.560
OK.

06:11.570 --> 06:12.880
Every single post.

06:12.920 --> 06:15.420
If I just removed from here and then I go to the.

06:15.440 --> 06:18.670
This morning you can see that this is not even applying to this stuff.

06:18.800 --> 06:24.650
So we need to show that icon but dumb this for what we can do is that we can just come here.

06:24.650 --> 06:31.930
We can go to the Texas and we can decrease it to 16 pixels or if I just springless I can see everything

06:31.930 --> 06:33.070
looks cool.

06:33.340 --> 06:35.370
So we can just come here to the 16.

06:35.380 --> 06:36.560
So from Mobile.

06:36.910 --> 06:41.170
OK I'm going to go to the burden Turei here down below.

06:41.170 --> 06:43.600
So mobile optimization is going to take some time.

06:43.600 --> 06:48.610
OK because you have to focus on everything you have to see that what you can do to achieve everything.

06:48.630 --> 06:49.450
I'm going to choose

06:55.010 --> 06:56.930
what is the one that we chose in here.

06:56.930 --> 07:02.390
So this is 20 pixel or but into

07:09.190 --> 07:14.680
to make it more smaller 16 so 16 looks cool here.

07:14.690 --> 07:16.000
OK.

07:16.400 --> 07:16.870
Here we go.

07:16.970 --> 07:21.230
What I'm going to do right now I'm going to save so you can see about the burdens of same size right

07:21.230 --> 07:23.520
now and everything is coming totally ok.

07:23.720 --> 07:27.210
I'm going to go down here we have the our services section everything looks cool.

07:27.230 --> 07:30.550
I'm going to come here to the divider and make it a little bit more bigger.

07:30.590 --> 07:37.490
I'm going to go with the sizing right here and the video should be for a smartphone must be bigger so

07:37.550 --> 07:39.330
it should be like still here.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.300
OK.

07:40.610 --> 07:41.270
Here we go.

07:42.700 --> 07:46.270
What I'm going to do right now I'm going to go to I'm going to go down go down.

07:46.270 --> 07:50.150
Everything looks cool everything looks school here and here we have this.

07:50.160 --> 07:53.810
I also want to remove this from this as well.

07:53.860 --> 07:57.340
So I'm going to come here I'm going to go to the design right here because I don't want to show image

07:57.340 --> 08:01.640
right here in this tab because this is not looking good.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.070
I'm going to go to the advanced lab.

08:03.070 --> 08:07.190
I'm going to go to the visibility and it is going to be disabled on the phone as well.

08:07.300 --> 08:07.900
OK.

08:08.050 --> 08:10.170
So let's go to discovery here.

08:10.220 --> 08:11.580
Looks like this divider.

08:11.620 --> 08:12.610
I'm going to go to the design.

08:12.610 --> 08:21.370
I'm going to go to the sizing and I'm going to come here and I'm going to increase it.

08:21.550 --> 08:22.900
OK let's go down.

08:23.050 --> 08:24.700
And we have this one right here.

08:24.730 --> 08:26.400
I'm going to also change this to be right here.

08:26.410 --> 08:29.550
You can see that it is totally ok.

08:32.640 --> 08:39.330
Optimization for the Wii is totally OK we just have to do some stuff and everything is already optimized

08:39.330 --> 08:41.290
so you can basically make some changes.

08:41.310 --> 08:43.080
This is used for make some making some changes.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.180
Everything is already optimized for mobile.

08:45.180 --> 08:50.470
You can see have this guy right here this is coming totally big so I'm going to go I'm here.

08:55.140 --> 08:56.950
I'm just going to I'm here I'm going to go to.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.080
I'm going to click here.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.310
And let's just click this gear icon.

09:00.370 --> 09:03.230
I want to go to the site is right here.

09:03.480 --> 09:10.730
And the rest of this should be a little bit smaller and like to line this to center.

09:10.730 --> 09:11.330
OK.

09:11.450 --> 09:12.830
So everything is a to center.

09:12.830 --> 09:16.730
I'm also going to align the text to the center right here.

09:22.060 --> 09:23.140
I used to center.

09:23.470 --> 09:24.760
OK.

09:24.820 --> 09:26.900
Let's see if we go to this step.

09:26.920 --> 09:29.810
Here is it applying to everything.

09:29.830 --> 09:30.270
OK.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.140
So we have to just make a left.

09:32.230 --> 09:33.130
OK.

09:33.520 --> 09:36.640
I'm going to go to discovery here again.

09:36.640 --> 09:43.170
Let's go down let's go down let's go down and we have this divider right here.

09:43.270 --> 09:45.630
I'm going to double click here and again see this is right here.

09:45.640 --> 09:46.780
I'm going to go to the design.

09:46.900 --> 09:57.390
I'm going to go to any mission and I'm going to change the sizing and I want to add the vet for mobile

09:57.390 --> 10:00.840
should be still here.

10:02.290 --> 10:06.680
Let's let's go down let's go down and everything is totally OK.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.700
So you can see everything is all OK.

10:08.700 --> 10:13.480
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit save so you can see everything is saved.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.320
Everything is totally up and running.

10:16.750 --> 10:17.400
OK.

10:17.410 --> 10:19.180
So thanks a lot guys for watching this.

10:19.180 --> 10:21.610
Now we are done with the mobile optimization.

10:21.620 --> 10:23.160
We're also done with everything.

10:23.170 --> 10:28.210
This image is not looking good that is why we have removed this image this image will not appear on

10:28.210 --> 10:31.310
the mobile and the tablets or everything pretty well looks cool

10:35.490 --> 10:38.900
if you also want to remove this event.

10:39.300 --> 10:47.630
And mobo tap because I don't know if it would look much better in that mobile optimization because no

10:47.630 --> 10:52.220
one is ready to see the portfolio in Mobile so I'm going to go to the advanced tab and I'm going to

10:52.400 --> 10:55.800
move this one forward because I don't want this on phones.

10:55.820 --> 11:00.050
I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit tapes so you can see this is now turning like this so this

11:00.050 --> 11:02.310
will not appear on the phone.

11:02.390 --> 11:02.750
OK.

11:02.780 --> 11:04.450
I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit Savery.

11:04.460 --> 11:09.280
Now let's have a look at a Web site so I'm going to come here.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.960
I want to open up my web site here.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.160
Let's just refresh this.

11:14.260 --> 11:14.900
OK.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.570
And here we are going to decrease the size of it.

11:17.590 --> 11:19.240
And let's see how it looks.

11:19.240 --> 11:24.460
I'm going to come here and say this is how it is going to change it to the mobile one.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.730
So this is how the mobile app take the look.

11:26.770 --> 11:29.430
You can see however many like this.

11:29.680 --> 11:36.140
We go down we have the burdens shortened burdens we have the size we have everything looking cool.

11:36.340 --> 11:39.880
We go down you can see no images coming.

11:39.940 --> 11:41.830
Everything is looking cool here.

11:41.980 --> 11:45.360
Everything is looking well here and the portfolio is also gone.

11:45.370 --> 11:50.880
So this is looking well let's just increase the size and you can see portfolio is right here.

11:51.040 --> 11:51.600
OK.

11:51.980 --> 11:53.180
We go up we go up.

11:53.180 --> 11:57.000
No I mean just right here increase the size.

11:57.380 --> 11:58.220
And here we go.

11:58.280 --> 12:00.340
This is the full width for this top.

12:00.410 --> 12:02.830
So now you can see everything is totally up and running.

12:02.840 --> 12:06.070
And every state is fully optimized for mobile.

12:06.080 --> 12:07.290
So this is very important.

12:07.280 --> 12:13.030
Make sure that you optimize your bitrate for mobile because this is really important for you and stuff.

12:13.250 --> 12:14.850
So thanks a lot guys for watching this.

12:14.850 --> 12:15.630
Stay tuned.

12:15.680 --> 12:16.580
And by.
