00:00.820 --> 00:02.190
What is up guys and welcome back.

00:02.190 --> 00:07.830
So now in this video I'm going to be showing you that how can you choose your web hosting wisely.

00:07.900 --> 00:08.350
OK.

00:08.350 --> 00:14.050
So if you are if you have chosen word oh sorry the web hosting from the housekeeper you have chosen

00:14.050 --> 00:19.790
the best for hosting but if you have if you are using that free web hosting that is the easiest and

00:19.820 --> 00:25.760
X-Com even if you are using the ad on the main no problem but if you are using a free web hosting those

00:25.760 --> 00:29.010
that don't have the ninety nine point nine percent uptime.

00:29.310 --> 00:29.740
OK.

00:29.860 --> 00:33.770
So then your web site is in danger.

00:33.910 --> 00:39.670
OK because you take my go down sometimes you save the load very slow some time and everything.

00:39.670 --> 00:40.600
So these might happen.

00:40.630 --> 00:51.200
So if this is happening then you have to just like focus on changing your web host so you can go.

00:51.420 --> 00:57.410
The blue host my friend uses that blue ghost and he says that it is good.

00:57.620 --> 01:01.350
I have got the great reviews about the site ground as well.

01:01.640 --> 01:09.610
And also the TMD hosting so I personally use word that housekeeper and I just really like it a lot.

01:09.770 --> 01:13.120
If you want to go with the VPM as well you can go over to veeps.

01:13.190 --> 01:19.550
So we pay servers are also a great option but obviously they are very costly so I don't think so because

01:20.160 --> 01:22.490
it will cost a lot.

01:22.490 --> 01:26.230
So that is why you can go over the shared web hosting PBS will cost you a lot.

01:26.450 --> 01:32.480
But if you want to start a very big brand name and you think that you will get a lot of traffic.

01:32.690 --> 01:33.210
Okay.

01:33.260 --> 01:39.800
And you need these cores of CBO these rounds so you get a different server okay like a virtual private

01:39.800 --> 01:43.150
server that you can use and then you can work for that.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.590
So it totally depends.

01:44.650 --> 01:44.930
OK.

01:44.930 --> 01:49.850
Like me I want to go over the VPN you can get the idea like if you want to start a very big project

01:50.240 --> 01:51.870
then you should be going up for the CPS.

01:51.890 --> 01:56.480
But if you want to just start a normal business like what everybody do then you can go over the web

01:56.480 --> 01:58.250
hosting that is a shared plan.

01:58.430 --> 02:01.350
OK so they are the shared plans.

02:01.490 --> 02:09.500
So basically we are done with the domain name and the web hosting tips and now here we will be moving

02:09.500 --> 02:14.510
on with the word press that what we can do to our site to make sure that you have the best brand name

02:14.510 --> 02:15.410
of your domain name.

02:15.590 --> 02:21.340
If you are doing your business locally then your country extension should be in your domain.

02:21.560 --> 02:26.750
Let's just go ahead and lets log into our Web site and let's just work with some things and you will

02:26.750 --> 02:28.020
love it.

02:28.120 --> 02:32.860
So I think I just remember the password.

02:33.220 --> 02:38.190
Oh yes let's try I hope it works because.

02:38.300 --> 02:40.330
It's like maybe a month.

02:40.350 --> 02:41.880
I just installed word pressing it.

02:42.040 --> 02:45.220
And I always forget my password OK.

02:45.530 --> 02:53.960
I just keep it here in some notepad or word but I don't know where that file is so I always forget things.

02:54.400 --> 02:59.080
So now you can see that we are here in this and I'm going to be showing you that what you can do to

02:59.080 --> 03:02.860
avoid press from site to make it or it can masing.

03:02.980 --> 03:03.320
OK.

03:03.460 --> 03:08.030
So the number one thing that you have to do is that make sure that you have all your pages.

03:08.200 --> 03:11.290
OK make sure that your domain name is perfect and everything is perfect.

03:11.380 --> 03:17.550
And now in this video I'm going to be showing you that how can you install an ACL plug in which plug

03:17.550 --> 03:21.570
in you should install and how that plug and fill in one your website.

03:21.820 --> 03:22.280
OK.

03:22.450 --> 03:28.560
So let's start first before we have to just go to the plug ins and then they have to go to add Neal

03:28.570 --> 03:38.950
So this plug in is going to help us a lot in getting a lot of traffic or just getting more page results.

03:38.970 --> 03:41.200
Ok so I'm going to be searching for the CEO.

03:41.290 --> 03:43.070
That's all you have to search here.

03:43.320 --> 03:48.370
And let's see which plug ins comes on the top so this one is right here it says Yost as CEO and it has

03:48.370 --> 03:50.670
one plus million active installations.

03:50.680 --> 03:51.150
OK.

03:51.340 --> 03:53.760
This is also here but it has lowest reviews.

03:53.770 --> 03:54.410
OK.

03:54.550 --> 04:02.500
People say that all 11 pack is very easy to use and Yost is now also very easy to use so why not just

04:02.500 --> 04:06.850
go with this because I personally use use Tassimo.

04:06.970 --> 04:09.100
I haven't used this all in one pack.

04:09.130 --> 04:10.070
I just install it.

04:10.100 --> 04:15.100
But I was like No I don't want to go with this I just want to go where they used to see you because

04:15.820 --> 04:24.280
when I was 13 years old I just think I was using WordPress and I don't know which and I just used for

04:24.280 --> 04:25.000
the ACL.

04:25.210 --> 04:28.910
But I think he was to see old Phil help you.

04:29.110 --> 04:29.860
I don't know.

04:29.860 --> 04:30.920
I don't know personally.

04:31.060 --> 04:35.200
I don't know how all in your PAC board most people use this and this.

04:35.230 --> 04:36.820
So but I will.

04:36.820 --> 04:42.800
I have used deals to see you and your CSU has pretty used some results on that.

04:42.820 --> 04:47.950
So that is why I will be going up at this let's just go ahead and let's install this sand they tend

04:47.950 --> 04:49.240
to be installed right now.

04:49.240 --> 04:53.620
So after this is installed I mean to show you how this was plug and how this plug in is going to work

04:53.950 --> 04:59.620
and how it's going to change everything to the upside and how it's going to work.

04:59.620 --> 05:06.040
So let's just go ahead and let's hit activate OK you can see this plug in is now activated.

05:06.090 --> 05:08.230
So just plug it in.

05:08.270 --> 05:09.300
A date is also available.

05:09.300 --> 05:11.470
I just installed it and there's a saying of that.

05:11.480 --> 05:16.860
Now OK let's just go ahead and let's have date and let's also update this plug in that we have here.

05:17.010 --> 05:22.590
So now you can see it creates a window and here it is dashboard church console and the premium.

05:22.620 --> 05:29.460
So let's just go ahead and let's just go to the dashboard now here we're going to be working up wed.

05:29.580 --> 05:36.230
Our optimization of the CEO will work for some of the things that Howard optimizer say.

05:36.390 --> 05:37.010
OK.

05:37.350 --> 05:42.430
I'm not going to do that but I'm going to just give you the hint that how you are going to do it.

05:43.450 --> 05:51.450
Make sure I'm telling you again that you have all those main pages that I told you before I'm sorry

05:51.960 --> 05:53.430
that I told you before.

05:53.430 --> 05:53.870
OK.

05:53.910 --> 05:59.050
So I'm sure that you have all those pages and in the next video you'll be working up the custom of the

05:59.310 --> 06:02.450
itemization of the CEO for this plug in.

06:02.520 --> 06:03.480
So goodbye.
