00:01.010 --> 00:02.270
What does a guy and welcome back.

00:02.280 --> 00:04.800
So in this area where are you going to be moving on.

00:04.810 --> 00:07.960
Read the section and the home page section and everything.

00:08.120 --> 00:11.360
So basically we need to customize this.

00:11.360 --> 00:13.610
We don't have to move onto it just right now.

00:13.610 --> 00:18.500
I'll show you later on how the videos work when we build designer Sayville design everything.

00:18.710 --> 00:20.090
OK then we'll be moving on.

00:20.090 --> 00:22.050
You guys already knew a little bit about it.

00:22.070 --> 00:24.930
If I just come here you can see that it sees the right side bars.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.440
This is basically referring to that if I just come here to Ray Tabor they can see that here are the

00:30.440 --> 00:31.730
vignettes that are coming.

00:31.730 --> 00:34.720
So if I want to delete any widget I can delete it.

00:34.870 --> 00:38.930
I showed you guys at how widget works OK we deleted that.

00:40.000 --> 00:40.700
Me today.

00:40.740 --> 00:47.760
So if I want to add a video trade here I can just come here and I can add a vegetable so that visit

00:47.760 --> 00:49.790
is going to be meta.

00:50.070 --> 00:50.540
OK.

00:50.610 --> 00:55.080
So you can see that the meta tags are going to appear here like this so you can add any of the vision

00:55.410 --> 00:57.650
in the right sidebar if you want to OK.

00:57.690 --> 01:03.390
So let's go back and not come here to home base settings.

01:03.420 --> 01:10.320
So we basically need to assign our home page to be the home page that we have created.

01:10.350 --> 01:10.920
OK.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.860
So how are we going to do this.

01:12.870 --> 01:18.930
We have to just skim here we have a static page from here or if you don't want to go here you can go

01:18.930 --> 01:19.830
to the dashboard.

01:20.010 --> 01:24.610
You can go to then settings and then reading.

01:24.710 --> 01:25.300
OK.

01:25.380 --> 01:28.920
And you guys now know how this works so you can select it.

01:29.100 --> 01:33.420
The home page is going to be the home and the Post page is going to be about Page 3.

01:33.600 --> 01:36.400
The blog page so we have to create a blog page right now.

01:36.490 --> 01:39.720
I'm going to go ahead I'm going to save changes right here.

01:39.720 --> 01:41.970
I'm going to go to the pages right here.

01:41.970 --> 01:45.700
I'm going to go to add Neal and I'm going to name this as blog.

01:45.890 --> 01:46.520
OK.

01:46.560 --> 01:50.980
And I'm going to hit publish.

01:51.010 --> 01:55.870
Let's go to the settings again and the reading section right here.

01:55.930 --> 01:57.950
Let's choose the blog section from here.

01:58.030 --> 01:58.840
The blog page.

01:58.990 --> 02:01.800
OK I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hate save.

02:01.920 --> 02:02.610
And there we go.

02:02.610 --> 02:03.480
We're totally done.

02:03.510 --> 02:08.400
Now if I just come here and view my web site you can see that this is the home page which is coming

02:08.400 --> 02:14.550
right here instead of the blog page and the blog page we can add a blog section into the menu section.

02:14.550 --> 02:17.700
So if I just come here and I just select the main menu.

02:18.060 --> 02:24.610
OK and I selected Dan I want to add a blog section here as well so I'm just going to read this and I'm

02:24.610 --> 02:25.740
going to hit out to menial.

02:25.850 --> 02:26.960
So it is added here.

02:26.990 --> 02:29.260
I want this to be right here.

02:29.420 --> 02:30.630
OK.

02:30.920 --> 02:31.550
Cool.

02:31.610 --> 02:37.290
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to save right now and let's come here let's refresh this.

02:37.550 --> 02:41.250
So here we go you can see that it says Home Services Block contact.

02:41.470 --> 02:41.900
OK.

02:41.990 --> 02:44.670
If I just go to blog it's going to take me to the blog page.

02:44.690 --> 02:45.790
And now you can see this.

02:45.800 --> 02:46.580
Hello world.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.910
The Borst are coming like this.

02:48.920 --> 02:50.030
So this is how it works.

02:50.030 --> 02:50.580
OK.

02:50.600 --> 02:55.570
I'm going to go to I'm going to click this my name and it has taken me to here as well.

02:55.670 --> 02:59.420
OK so basically I need to create an eye catching logo for myself.

02:59.420 --> 03:01.620
I can just sign a can create.

03:01.640 --> 03:08.280
I can just add a sign right here a signature or a cool logo right here so that it looks amazing.

03:08.420 --> 03:12.110
OK so I'll be using Photoshop a few.

03:12.260 --> 03:15.420
You can also use an online one if you want to create a board for you.

03:15.590 --> 03:24.100
Or you can just go with Logo creator so you can create a free logo.

03:24.470 --> 03:30.520
OK freeflow designed Freedia more words free so you can create your own free will and then you have

03:30.520 --> 03:31.470
to upload it.

03:31.540 --> 03:36.340
So I'll be using the Photoshop and I'll create a logo I'll just uploaded trate here and then I'm going

03:36.340 --> 03:38.690
to also work with top manual.

03:38.710 --> 03:43.800
I'm going to change the color of this a bit so that it looks amazing and then worked on.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.490
So thanks a lot guys for watching this.

03:45.490 --> 03:48.790
In the next video I'm going to be moving on with the header section.

03:48.970 --> 03:49.440
OK.

03:49.600 --> 03:54.130
