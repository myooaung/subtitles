WEBVTT

00:00.560 --> 00:03.860
What is up guys and welcome back so it's not like much time.

00:03.870 --> 00:04.330
OK.

00:04.440 --> 00:09.990
So I want to be just clicking recheck name servers to see if my domain name is working or not.

00:09.990 --> 00:15.000
So I'm going to be clicking recheck names hers and let's see if this is done so you can see it's a zone

00:15.020 --> 00:17.430
of verified and this is now turned to green.

00:17.430 --> 00:21.420
So it's been like maybe 30 minutes not more than that.

00:21.420 --> 00:28.650
And you can see the status is active and this Web site is now active on cloud flare so you can see now

00:28.650 --> 00:32.730
whenever I visit my website you'll see that my website will be totally up and running.

00:32.730 --> 00:35.440
There will be no issues to my website.

00:35.460 --> 00:35.940
OK.

00:35.940 --> 00:38.200
So I can see that CloudFlare is integrated.

00:38.220 --> 00:41.860
And let's see if there is some change in our website.

00:41.880 --> 00:44.860
So we're if we have to test everything is okay.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.520
So our website was on 77 before and now let's see the mobo optimization has increased.

00:51.540 --> 00:52.970
And this is still here.

00:52.980 --> 00:56.290
But mobile optimization is a big increase.

00:56.290 --> 01:02.440
So you can see the SSL is also right here that we will be covering in the next video.

01:02.470 --> 01:07.830
Let's just come here to analytics so the optics here are going to be seeing the analytics said how much

01:07.870 --> 01:12.750
HTP request has been generated and the rendering and everything from here.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.950
But we don't have to work on it.

01:15.030 --> 01:18.070
We have to go to the speed.

01:18.470 --> 01:18.960
OK.

01:19.170 --> 01:22.670
So in the speed you can see it has auto modify.

01:22.860 --> 01:24.810
So we have to just check this.

01:24.810 --> 01:28.090
We have to check this and we also have to check this.

01:28.220 --> 01:28.840
Okay.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.290
And then we have to go down.

01:30.420 --> 01:33.170
We have to go down and.

01:33.600 --> 01:34.710
Yes.

01:35.040 --> 01:35.580
OK.

01:35.790 --> 01:38.890
So now we have to come here to the caching.

01:39.150 --> 01:39.640
Okay.

01:39.900 --> 01:44.420
And then we have this purge cache caching level.

01:44.540 --> 01:45.110
Okay.

01:45.140 --> 01:54.260
And we have browser Kangxi expirations So we're going to be setting this to like two months.

01:54.270 --> 01:54.780
Okay.

01:54.870 --> 02:00.540
So this me like I'm CloudFlare instructors of those blobs are the cash you filed here in this period

02:00.840 --> 02:03.870
the browsers loads the file from its local cache.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.200
Speeding up the page load.

02:05.200 --> 02:10.490
So this is exactly like the Loveridge browser caching that we have selected right now.

02:10.640 --> 02:13.240
OK so now we're done with this.

02:13.350 --> 02:18.260
OK we have to just come here and we have to go to this right now.

02:18.380 --> 02:24.760
I'm going to be clicking analyzed again and let's see if there is much difference or it's still there.

02:24.900 --> 02:25.320
OK.

02:25.530 --> 02:26.800
Let's see.

02:26.910 --> 02:28.160
So this is 35.

02:28.170 --> 02:29.520
This is 74.

02:29.520 --> 02:30.750
So this is a bit dull.

02:30.920 --> 02:32.160
OK.

02:32.190 --> 02:39.480
This is this is this has gone down a bit because there might be some issues with the hosting and everything.

02:39.480 --> 02:40.860
So it might go down.

02:41.040 --> 02:41.910
OK what you have.

02:41.910 --> 02:45.660
You can read try that again to see if that is working or not.

02:45.660 --> 02:49.160
Let's just go ahead and let's just refresh everything.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.580
The Web site.

02:50.770 --> 02:51.340
OK.

02:51.360 --> 02:56.000
And then we have to just come here as well we have to analyze it again.

02:56.010 --> 03:06.180
So guys I want to say one thing and that is make sure that you try everything because trying will keep

03:06.180 --> 03:08.390
the speed go more huge.

03:08.520 --> 03:09.120
OK.

03:09.120 --> 03:16.300
You can see that my speed for mobile is now turn to the optimization to be the medium.

03:16.470 --> 03:16.990
OK.

03:17.250 --> 03:20.040
And everything is going amazing.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.410
We go to desktop and that is also medium.

03:22.410 --> 03:32.790
So on working with the Cdn you can see that my server responding is basically gone totally and my server

03:32.790 --> 03:34.520
responding is good.

03:34.580 --> 03:35.050
OK.

03:35.060 --> 03:38.600
It responded to second due to this CloudFlare.

03:38.610 --> 03:42.110
So CloudFlare just increased my website.

03:42.260 --> 03:43.120
OK.

03:43.140 --> 03:48.470
You can see that everything is now in the medium side and we just change some thing.

03:48.480 --> 03:49.470
OK and that's all.

03:49.500 --> 03:50.770
So you have to try things.

03:50.790 --> 03:53.700
Ok maybe the speed will not work.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.820
OK maybe you don't have to mean it fired.

03:55.980 --> 03:58.850
Maybe you don't have to work on some things and something like that.

03:59.010 --> 04:00.720
OK so you have to try different things.

04:00.750 --> 04:05.820
If it doesn't work maybe double treatable gace plugging it might work or something like that.

04:06.030 --> 04:06.400
OK.

04:06.570 --> 04:09.470
So you have to try try and try.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.060
Depending on the hosting environment.

04:11.070 --> 04:14.700
But post gator hosting environment works pretty cool.

04:14.700 --> 04:18.060
What this turns the room on site.

04:18.150 --> 04:20.940
OK so maybe it will now go down and go above.

04:21.240 --> 04:22.080
Or something like that.

04:22.080 --> 04:25.480
So let's see a case and this is now going down.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.540
OK so but still this is lying here.

04:28.710 --> 04:32.630
So server response time is dependent on the web hosting.

04:32.790 --> 04:33.300
OK.

04:33.420 --> 04:39.920
But our CloudFlare they'll work they'll try to make it much better.

04:40.020 --> 04:40.450
OK.

04:40.560 --> 04:45.600
So now you can see that we're totally done with the Cdn.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.720
Okay make sure tetch you just rely on this.

04:48.720 --> 04:52.230
OK not the mobile one the mobile optimization should be good.

04:52.230 --> 05:01.800
OK your site should be responsive that's all but your desktop speed should be above 65 or 60 or 50.

05:01.980 --> 05:02.450
Okay.

05:02.580 --> 05:06.610
So now the next video I'll show you how can you work with the SSL.

05:06.700 --> 05:07.140
Okay.

05:07.260 --> 05:10.190
If I just come here and I just add the SSL right now.

05:10.270 --> 05:13.940
Okay I just add the SSL that I referred shed.

05:14.070 --> 05:19.730
Again it is not secure where your connection is not private.

05:19.980 --> 05:26.910
OK so this is giving me an error but if I just go ahead and you just want to let topos open up a file

05:26.910 --> 05:27.340
here.

05:27.530 --> 05:29.030
OK.

05:29.880 --> 05:31.640
Let's see if this is the file.

05:32.000 --> 05:32.450
OK.

05:32.670 --> 05:36.830
And I just opened this up and the HDD beeps OK.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.400
This is also not secure.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.630
So we have to work on it.

05:39.690 --> 05:44.350
I'll show you how can you work with the SSL here how you can switch it on.

05:44.360 --> 05:51.480
And then how your site will work with the SSL so stadium guys and in the next video will be working

05:51.480 --> 05:53.370
up with the SSL goodbye.
