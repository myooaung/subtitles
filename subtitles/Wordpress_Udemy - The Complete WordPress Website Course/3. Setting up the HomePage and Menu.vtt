00:00.760 --> 00:02.590
Hear what is up guys and welcome back.

00:02.590 --> 00:08.440
So now in this video I'm going to be showing you that how can you basically work for the menus.

00:08.770 --> 00:09.230
OK.

00:09.400 --> 00:15.070
And then how can you make your home page actually the home page so you can see that this is if I just

00:15.070 --> 00:22.060
visit my home page in a new job that you can see it say's Aitan Ziel dot com slash home which I want

00:22.060 --> 00:25.240
to make my actual home page so that it should be my home page.

00:25.390 --> 00:26.960
If I just visit this.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.880
It should be the homepage.

00:28.900 --> 00:29.260
OK.

00:29.470 --> 00:32.380
I want it to be the home page Despain should not be coming.

00:32.560 --> 00:37.030
So for that what I have to do I have to just go to the settings.

00:37.120 --> 00:37.500
OK.

00:37.690 --> 00:40.030
And then I have to go to Reading.

00:40.200 --> 00:40.690
OK.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.460
Just don't mess with anything.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.160
They will be working up for the settings and everything.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.850
Later on we will discuss it.

00:46.960 --> 00:47.360
OK.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.820
But first do as I'm saying.

00:49.830 --> 00:50.330
OK.

00:50.350 --> 00:56.450
And it says your home page displays a static page or your latest post.

00:56.650 --> 00:58.140
So you have to select this.

00:58.180 --> 01:02.790
OK you have to select this option and here it says Select your home page.

01:02.950 --> 01:03.360
OK.

01:03.490 --> 01:04.460
I want to select it.

01:04.600 --> 01:09.670
And here are all the list of pages that we have in the list of pages.

01:09.780 --> 01:10.120
OK.

01:10.270 --> 01:16.930
So if you just go to all pages it is grabbing the list of all the pages in this here and it has to select

01:17.140 --> 01:20.120
that which page you want your homepage to be.

01:20.290 --> 01:24.880
So let's suppose that I want to select my homepage because I want my home page to be my actual home

01:24.880 --> 01:25.300
page.

01:25.420 --> 01:25.850
OK.

01:25.990 --> 01:26.980
That's all you have to do.

01:26.980 --> 01:28.200
You have to just come here.

01:28.210 --> 01:31.120
And then you have to hate save and change save changes.

01:31.120 --> 01:31.550
OK.

01:31.630 --> 01:35.380
And now what you have to do when we go visit our home page.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.460
Now let's see our Web site.

01:37.840 --> 01:40.070
OK you can see this is how it's looking.

01:40.090 --> 01:45.360
And now here it is showing the home page instead of the post that it was coming.

01:45.580 --> 01:49.930
And now here you can see everything is coming and this is our actual home page and it is not showing

01:50.230 --> 01:51.920
slash home.

01:51.970 --> 01:58.450
So if you just go to the list of all pages right now then you will see it say's front page that we have

01:58.510 --> 02:02.220
assigned or this home to be the front page.

02:02.260 --> 02:04.780
And now we are totally done with the pages.

02:04.780 --> 02:10.780
We now know everything about the pages we know how to create a page it page and assign that page as

02:10.780 --> 02:11.380
the home page.

02:11.380 --> 02:13.200
So congratulations guys.

02:13.240 --> 02:16.340
Now we have to work on the menu side as well.

02:16.420 --> 02:16.820
OK.

02:16.840 --> 02:20.560
Like how to create a menu and how to add that menu because menu is important.

02:20.760 --> 02:21.230
OK.

02:21.310 --> 02:28.660
So let's just go ahead and here in the appearance you can see we have teams we have customized we have

02:28.660 --> 02:31.690
widgets and then we have the menus right here.

02:31.690 --> 02:38.530
So you have to select here and here you will see a new window that will say like edit your menu below

02:38.560 --> 02:39.950
or create a new menu.

02:40.090 --> 02:42.320
So we basically want to create our menu.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.820
And let's just name it as the menu one.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.240
So I'm going to name it as the menu one.

02:48.340 --> 02:54.460
And now I'm going to go ahead and I am going to just create menu so I can see that this menu will be

02:54.460 --> 02:55.090
created.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.850
And here you can see everything is totally right.

02:57.850 --> 03:03.970
So I'm just going to add the list of pages so that I want to add in my bed so I want to add this home

03:03.970 --> 03:04.760
page.

03:04.870 --> 03:06.560
I want to add this about page.

03:06.630 --> 03:08.780
I don't want to add this conduct does it.

03:08.800 --> 03:12.770
And I'm going to hit our two menu and you can see there right here.

03:12.790 --> 03:18.040
So what I can do I can just bring this to top add to make it like the first page and then I can bring

03:18.040 --> 03:23.230
this about to talk to make it like the second one and let's just go ahead and let's save the manual.

03:23.300 --> 03:28.390
Let's see if this manual appears we have to do another thing as well so I'm just going to come here

03:28.420 --> 03:30.320
and I'm going to refresh this.

03:30.430 --> 03:30.890
OK.

03:30.970 --> 03:33.970
You can see that menu is not appearing.

03:33.970 --> 03:40.470
The reason and the reason is that we haven't assigned the location that we want the menu to be displayed.

03:40.480 --> 03:45.900
So we have the options display location to be like top menu or these so Schillings many.

03:45.910 --> 03:51.790
So I want to select the top menu because we are creating a main menu and I'm going to hit save menu.

03:52.030 --> 03:54.540
Let's just go ahead and let's save it.

03:54.670 --> 03:55.770
Let's rephrase this.

03:55.960 --> 04:02.650
And now you can see how the menu is looking so here you can see we have this home about us and they

04:02.650 --> 04:08.770
contact us and the menu is coming exactly so you can see how crazy it is looking if I just click here

04:09.100 --> 04:12.480
about us you can see it takes us to the About Us page.

04:12.490 --> 04:16.970
We have the title here and we have the whole whole content right here.

04:17.080 --> 04:19.490
And we have also the Contact Us page.

04:19.490 --> 04:23.000
So if you just select Contact us again see Tay's contact us.

04:23.050 --> 04:28.530
We have the phone number and we have the address and we have the domain address as well.

04:28.600 --> 04:35.260
So let's just go ahead and let's copy our this page and let's open this in our private window so that

04:35.260 --> 04:36.670
we can have a look at this.

04:36.790 --> 04:43.170
OK let's just press control shift and and again see it opens up the private window.

04:43.270 --> 04:45.060
And here we have to paste the link.

04:45.220 --> 04:46.490
And let's open this up.

04:48.710 --> 04:49.300
OK.

04:49.540 --> 04:52.060
So now you can see how it is looking at the title.

04:52.060 --> 04:56.220
There is no Tabar and that is just another WordPress website.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.090
We have three main pages.

04:58.210 --> 05:02.620
If you just click here it takes us down and we have the title here that is the home.

05:02.860 --> 05:05.050
And we have the whole concentrate here.

05:05.050 --> 05:07.430
So you can see how great it is looking.

05:07.600 --> 05:07.960
OK.

05:08.080 --> 05:11.880
It is not looking much great I know but we will just customize later on.

05:11.920 --> 05:17.110
I just wanted to show you how to create betas and how to set up your basic website with the dummy content

05:17.110 --> 05:17.730
right here.

05:17.850 --> 05:18.260
OK.

05:18.460 --> 05:22.010
So let's just open up the About page about pages like this.

05:22.120 --> 05:28.450
And the contact page and the contact pages like this so you can see that our Web site is kind of like

05:28.510 --> 05:29.870
looking like a web site.

05:30.070 --> 05:31.010
OK.

05:31.170 --> 05:32.950
It is looking like a professional web site.

05:33.130 --> 05:35.000
But it is just a basic web site.

05:35.110 --> 05:40.570
OK we haven't done anything we just created two pages and then we assigned our home page to be the home

05:40.570 --> 05:45.760
page and then Mafi did we just created a new menu and then we just use that as this.

05:45.790 --> 05:47.220
And that's all we have done.

05:47.260 --> 05:50.040
And you can see that web site creation is very easy.

05:50.160 --> 05:50.520
OK.

05:50.590 --> 05:55.480
If I show you the actual code behind this then you will see how hard it is to create a website.

05:55.600 --> 05:59.820
But thanks to this WordPress that it has given us everything.

05:59.950 --> 06:03.310
OK so I want to open up the inspect.

06:03.970 --> 06:04.670
On just prickling.

06:04.690 --> 06:07.650
And you can see that this is the code behind this page.

06:07.690 --> 06:14.290
You can see how everything is we have this scored for everything everything is right here.

06:14.380 --> 06:17.720
You can see so this is what we call.

06:17.750 --> 06:19.390
As you can and.

06:19.760 --> 06:26.720
