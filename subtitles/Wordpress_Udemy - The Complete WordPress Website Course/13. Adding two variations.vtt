We have variable product as selected.

01:56.570 --> 01:56.870
OK.

01:56.870 --> 02:00.470
We have the inventory and we have an added message to start from here.

02:00.470 --> 02:02.780
We will be since we are adding the variable product.

02:02.780 --> 02:05.540
That is why we are not managing the complete stock from here.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.920
Every product would be having a different stock.

02:07.990 --> 02:08.300
OK.

02:08.450 --> 02:09.140
Let's just come here.

02:09.140 --> 02:10.400
Let's just go to the variations.

02:10.430 --> 02:11.930
Let's just go to the attributes first.

02:11.930 --> 02:13.790
Okay let's add two attributes.

02:13.790 --> 02:16.720
I'm just going to add first click and I'm going to hit one more.

02:16.760 --> 02:18.710
OK so we have two right here.

02:18.720 --> 02:21.930
The first one is going to be the color and the third one.

02:21.950 --> 02:23.800
Second one is going to be the size.

02:24.030 --> 02:24.620
Okay.

02:24.680 --> 02:35.150
And then we have that color so I'm just going to add gray blue and the red gray now here and for the

02:35.150 --> 02:39.860
size I to small medium

02:44.150 --> 02:49.840
exhale hey this is this this will be used for variations and this will also be used for Asians.

02:49.840 --> 02:53.020
I'm going to see that tribute and I'm going to go to the variations right here.

02:53.080 --> 02:58.570
So let's just click the variations here we have to select all the variation from all the attributes.

02:58.570 --> 02:59.960
I'm going to go right now and I'm going to.

02:59.980 --> 03:00.410
OK.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.290
So you can see that all the variations will be added.

03:02.290 --> 03:04.000
So we have a nice variation at it.

03:04.030 --> 03:05.030
OK.

03:05.230 --> 03:06.400
Don't get confused.

03:06.640 --> 03:10.120
I will explain it to you and you will also understand that you will see all the radiation.

03:10.120 --> 03:10.630
OK.

03:10.840 --> 03:12.730
So one two three go.

03:15.140 --> 03:15.570
Here we go.

03:15.580 --> 03:21.750
You can see that if someone is selected it has selected three and as if someone has selected three and

03:21.750 --> 03:26.890
a size small and then we all charge this and if someone is selected blue and so small and really selective

03:26.940 --> 03:31.700
that and if someone is selected read then and it's just small then we will be choosing different traits.

03:31.700 --> 03:32.920
So this is how it's going to work.

03:32.930 --> 03:33.500
OK.

03:33.560 --> 03:37.850
And then what Also you can do is that a default value.

03:37.850 --> 03:42.340
So you can also just go with from default values just like Krey.

03:42.470 --> 03:45.650
And then I hit if the default value is 3.

03:45.680 --> 03:46.200
OK.

03:46.220 --> 03:51.030
And then I can just set a record regular phrases for all agree.

03:51.140 --> 03:52.200
OK.

03:52.250 --> 03:53.700
I'm going to show you how this is going to work.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.840
But first just know the full color.

03:55.910 --> 03:59.530
Let's just come here and add the price.

03:59.530 --> 04:07.350
So if the size is small OK if the size is more then we need to add a prize for all these small size.

04:07.480 --> 04:08.400
OK.

04:08.440 --> 04:13.960
We don't care about the color we will fuel the customer again change the color but we're not charging

04:13.960 --> 04:16.960
them for the size you're just charging them for the size.

04:16.960 --> 04:17.360
OK.

04:17.410 --> 04:19.300
I hope you understand what I'm saying.

04:19.840 --> 04:23.220
You will understand it better and I will show you how this product is going to look.

04:23.260 --> 04:27.910
I'm just going to I'm here I'm going to hit said drug prices.

04:27.910 --> 04:30.290
So here we go and it's going to go OK.

04:30.340 --> 04:36.510
And now here I have to value and this will be applied to all those small sized but the default color.

04:36.550 --> 04:38.760
OK so they don't care about the color.

04:38.830 --> 04:40.390
It will be applied to all this.

04:40.390 --> 04:40.840
OK.

04:41.130 --> 04:43.650
And for the small size I'm just going to use $25.

04:43.740 --> 04:44.100
OK.

04:44.170 --> 04:44.510
I'm going to.

04:44.530 --> 04:46.010
OK.

04:46.060 --> 04:47.670
OK.

04:48.070 --> 04:48.800
This will be applied.

04:48.820 --> 04:50.990
And let's see how this is applied.

04:51.100 --> 04:52.800
I'm just going to come here.

04:52.910 --> 04:58.010
You can see this is small and this has been applied so this is changed to 25 if I just come here and

04:58.010 --> 04:58.970
I just click here.

04:58.970 --> 05:01.480
You can see this is also changed.

05:01.500 --> 05:04.620
This should be applied to this but this is also applied here.

05:04.890 --> 05:08.540
And this is also applied here.

05:08.650 --> 05:09.730
So it is also applied here.

05:09.730 --> 05:13.490
If I just skim here I just sit medium right here and that nobody full color.

05:13.540 --> 05:14.000
OK.

05:14.140 --> 05:15.340
So I'm just going to come here.

05:15.340 --> 05:17.020
I'm going to hit add a variation.

05:17.020 --> 05:20.990
So here I won the struggle price so for medium.

05:21.100 --> 05:27.670
I want to add a set at a very low price so I'm just going to add for medium.

05:27.670 --> 05:30.470
It should be too.

05:30.790 --> 05:31.330
OK.

05:31.570 --> 05:32.010
OK.

05:33.130 --> 05:35.310
So let's see if we have got the changes.

05:35.320 --> 05:36.400
It should not be applied here.

05:36.410 --> 05:39.090
So it is applying to everything I think.

05:39.660 --> 05:40.220
OK.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.120
This is not working.

05:41.170 --> 05:41.440
OK.

05:41.440 --> 05:45.490
I hope they fix a tune because it is not working.

05:45.490 --> 05:46.600
So I'm just going to come here.

05:46.600 --> 05:50.230
I'm going to hit expand and I'm going to make the changes to everything.

05:50.560 --> 05:51.350
OK.

05:51.820 --> 05:55.220
So for small size want to charge them 25.

05:55.280 --> 06:05.730
OK let's just close everything and for a small blue I want to charge them 30 ok and force more.

06:05.810 --> 06:08.160
I want to charge them 25 for all the smalls.

06:08.180 --> 06:12.620
I'm just going to click here again and they're going to select the small from here again.

06:12.650 --> 06:14.300
I'm going to add 25.

06:14.420 --> 06:15.200
OK.

06:15.380 --> 06:15.940
So here we go.

06:15.950 --> 06:17.650
You can see that everything is light.

06:17.690 --> 06:19.720
So this Medtner did not work.

06:19.730 --> 06:21.230
This method works like a charm.

06:21.230 --> 06:24.290
Guys seriously I don't know why it's not very clear.

06:24.290 --> 06:27.770
It might be a fix that they need to do it.

06:27.770 --> 06:29.420
So I'm just going to go ahead to the medium right here.

06:29.420 --> 06:30.640
I'm going to select here.

06:30.710 --> 06:31.090
OK.

06:31.220 --> 06:36.030
And then here I need to add for the medium so medium is already applied you can see.

06:36.130 --> 06:36.610
OK.

06:36.680 --> 06:39.840
I'm just going to come here and this is also applied.

06:40.610 --> 06:44.520
Now let's send you to the exile's so axil will be 450.

06:44.540 --> 06:45.120
OK.

06:45.140 --> 06:46.830
We have to apply it to all the exile's.

06:46.850 --> 06:47.900
I'm just going to go here.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.480
I'm just going to I'm here I'm going to hit 54 All-Access.

06:51.700 --> 06:52.270
OK.

06:52.520 --> 06:55.330
Now here I want 50 for all the axle.

06:55.380 --> 06:58.920
So you can see that are prizing variations has been changed.

06:58.920 --> 06:59.340
OK.

06:59.430 --> 07:01.370
Let me show you what I wanted for.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.470
I am saying to you guys OK.

07:03.570 --> 07:06.460
If I just come here and I just hit publish right now.

07:06.960 --> 07:07.620
OK.

07:07.620 --> 07:12.270
And then you can see this is going to be published Let's wait till this is published and now I'm going

07:12.270 --> 07:14.220
to open this up.

07:14.240 --> 07:18.640
OK so here you can see this has been opened.

07:21.590 --> 07:21.770
OK.

07:21.780 --> 07:26.010
I need to publish this post page.

07:26.040 --> 07:30.000
You can see this is how I got to know that this product is still in draft.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.370
Now this product is published.

07:31.380 --> 07:31.890
OK.

07:31.890 --> 07:34.920
So if I just rephrase this you will see a poor fellow up here.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.440
This is a tip that I'm giving you.

07:36.450 --> 07:36.890
OK.

07:36.960 --> 07:40.930
This is how it is working so we have T-shirts from men by Nike.

07:41.220 --> 07:46.050
If I just choose this color so I choose the color to be gray doesn't matter.

07:46.080 --> 07:51.830
OK but the size probably matters if I choose any color you can see the price is remaining sane.

07:52.200 --> 07:58.080
OK if I choose any color but if I change the size 18 to be medium you can see that this is changing

07:58.090 --> 08:04.170
if I decide to be too small you can see this is changing to 25 if I decide to excel it will be changed

08:04.170 --> 08:05.140
to $50.

08:05.150 --> 08:06.260
So this is how it works.

08:06.280 --> 08:06.660
OK.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.770
And for color women dish change the image.

08:09.810 --> 08:10.200
OK.

08:10.260 --> 08:12.250
So I'm going to go to the variations right here.

08:12.390 --> 08:12.900
OK.

08:12.990 --> 08:14.520
And then I'm going to add the colors.

08:14.520 --> 08:19.620
So if someone selects a blue color ok and someone likes blue color then we want to change the image

08:19.620 --> 08:21.300
so I'm going to go to upload file.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.300
I'm going to crab.

08:22.320 --> 08:23.530
I hope this is the blue one.

08:27.960 --> 08:28.400
Yes.

08:28.530 --> 08:28.860
OK.

08:28.900 --> 08:32.110
I'm going to set variation in age if I just go down.

08:32.110 --> 08:33.440
And then I like this one also.

08:33.450 --> 08:39.380
I'm just going to add the various image and this one will also be the variation in age.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.100
So here we go.

08:42.300 --> 08:47.170
And you're going to come here I'm just going to click here and click here you can see blue has been

08:47.170 --> 08:47.630
added.

08:47.650 --> 08:49.270
We have to add for the red.

08:49.270 --> 08:53.590
So I'm just going to I'm here I'm just going to click here and he's going to click here and here.

08:53.860 --> 08:54.200
OK.

08:54.340 --> 08:55.240
I'm going to come here.

08:55.270 --> 08:56.060
I'm going to click here.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.120
I'm going to click here and I'm going to play with it.

08:58.960 --> 08:59.490
OK.

08:59.620 --> 09:00.640
And then I'm going to come here.

09:00.670 --> 09:03.760
I'm going to click here I'm going to click here and I'm gonna upload it.

09:03.790 --> 09:05.310
So radiation has been added.

09:05.800 --> 09:06.520
Now let's see him here.

09:06.550 --> 09:12.660
Let's just hit update and have a look at his site so you can see that.

09:12.670 --> 09:18.490
Now if I change the color if I change the color you can see that image will also be changed.

09:18.520 --> 09:23.340
So for blue it will be turned blue for red.

09:23.370 --> 09:24.870
It'll be turned red.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.100
So we did one mistake.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.300
We didn't added the red color.

09:32.300 --> 09:33.870
OK let's just come here.

09:34.100 --> 09:37.250
Let's go down let's go down and we have to select just one red.

09:37.250 --> 09:39.020
So I'm just going to I'm here I'm just going to drag it.

09:39.020 --> 09:43.480
I'm just going to come here and I need to drag and drop this red one right here.

09:43.580 --> 09:46.860
I this one should be added and then I can add the set variation to me.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.260
So I'm just gonna come here.

09:48.570 --> 09:49.440
OK.

09:49.570 --> 09:52.000
And for this one read as well and just get across it.

09:52.010 --> 09:52.780
I'm going to click here.

09:52.790 --> 09:53.670
I'm going at it.

09:53.900 --> 09:55.590
So I'm just going to hit set variation.

09:55.630 --> 10:01.310
So make sure that when ever you add a product guy is seriously just go ahead and double check it because

10:01.970 --> 10:03.680
there might be something that you have missed.

10:03.680 --> 10:04.220
OK.

10:04.280 --> 10:09.730
And it happens it happens seriously it happens even if you are a professional developer.

10:10.010 --> 10:17.420
It will happen because you are a man and you it is not possible that you will not do mistakes and mistakes

10:17.450 --> 10:18.100
will happen.

10:18.110 --> 10:18.600
OK.

10:18.770 --> 10:21.190
So for color gray is still cray.

10:21.250 --> 10:24.490
The blue is blue gray and the red one is red right now.

10:24.590 --> 10:25.970
So this is how is working.

10:25.970 --> 10:28.610
So now we're totally done with this.

10:28.640 --> 10:34.020
I hope that you have enjoyed this and I hope that you have got an idea of how the variable product for

10:34.020 --> 10:34.430
it.

10:34.430 --> 10:38.930
