00:00.750 --> 00:04.500
What is it guys want KMAX an hour in this video we'll be reviewing all the things.

00:04.550 --> 00:05.070

00:05.070 --> 00:06.630
That comes in the product.

00:06.650 --> 00:09.190
OK so we're going to review all of these right here.

00:09.410 --> 00:09.800
OK.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.040
And then we'll move forward.

00:11.060 --> 00:13.600
OK so let's just add a product tray here.

00:13.670 --> 00:16.410
I'm going to add super hoodies.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.220
OK.

00:17.360 --> 00:25.110
I'm just going to I'm here I'm just going to search for zipper booties OK.

00:25.140 --> 00:31.140
And then here I also want to options to select if you want it for men or if you want it for them and

00:31.170 --> 00:35.970
so I'm also going to show you how this is going to work mystically I'm going to show you how variable

00:36.000 --> 00:38.670
products work and we will also be reviewing them.

00:38.760 --> 00:39.160
OK.

00:39.210 --> 00:40.020
So let's just come here.

00:40.050 --> 00:40.830
Let's just add

00:44.030 --> 00:48.720
delirium ipsum duck so I'm just going to go to Lipscombe Dotcom's Lancefield slice each team male and

00:48.720 --> 00:51.110
I'm going to copy all of the thing from here.

00:51.220 --> 00:54.720
OK let's just copy let's just come here and let's face it.

00:54.720 --> 00:59.850
In the long description then let's come here like spaced some in the short descriptions I'm just going

00:59.850 --> 01:00.570
to get here.

01:02.810 --> 01:06.970
I'm going to drag it from here till here OK.

01:07.080 --> 01:08.420
I'm going to come here and I'm going to get this.

01:08.430 --> 01:12.850
So here we have the show a long description and then we have a short description.

01:13.110 --> 01:18.440
And now here the most important thing starts so what we have to do is that we need to add an image.

01:18.450 --> 01:19.790
We will be adding this later on.

01:19.950 --> 01:20.270
OK.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.950
But first let's just come here and let's look at it.

01:22.970 --> 01:23.670
Think these things.

01:23.670 --> 01:24.110
OK.

01:24.270 --> 01:29.580
So basically this is called the regular praised this is called a seal price you guys already know about

01:29.580 --> 01:29.860
it.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.570
You guys also know about the virtual and the downloadable.

01:32.580 --> 01:33.080
OK.

01:33.150 --> 01:38.640
And then we have the deck status so if you want this product to be nontaxable so that if we add it into

01:38.640 --> 01:41.550
the card then the tax will not be applied.

01:41.550 --> 01:45.160
OK so taxes will be applied to shipping only and tax will be applied to none.

01:45.180 --> 01:48.270
So you can just select that if someone buys this product.

01:48.270 --> 01:50.030
We will not charge him the tax.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.070
So you can just click here.

01:51.150 --> 01:51.470
OK.

01:51.570 --> 01:55.050
And clicking this not we don't have to select any of the text clause.

01:55.080 --> 01:55.540
OK.

01:55.560 --> 01:59.010
Stex clause is the standard that we chose in here.

01:59.010 --> 02:00.850
If I just go to settings right here.

02:01.130 --> 02:01.570
OK.

02:01.620 --> 02:07.210
And then I go to the shipping the tax the tax one and then you can see that we added cost basically

02:07.380 --> 02:11.280
OK if I just go to tetch right here then you can see that we have just write this.

02:11.310 --> 02:16.280
So this is the one that is this stripping tax class and this is just said to standard and this is 10

02:16.280 --> 02:16.870
or so.

02:16.920 --> 02:22.950
That is why this is coming if we add more class like four different type of things like for mobile phones

02:22.950 --> 02:28.290
there should be more tax so we can create a shebeen class for mobile specific mobile and for mobile.

02:28.290 --> 02:30.120
It would charge them like 20 percent.

02:30.300 --> 02:36.310
And for just normal shirts it would charge them for 15 percent so you can create a classes like this.

02:36.330 --> 02:37.480
OK.

02:37.680 --> 02:40.000
Now let's come here and let's go to the inventory.

02:40.020 --> 02:40.500
OK.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.290
This is called Mon mace.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.400
Most important thing.

02:43.410 --> 02:45.810
OK I showed you how the stock status work.

02:45.930 --> 02:46.330
OK.

02:46.410 --> 02:48.670
This is called basically stock keeping unit.

02:48.810 --> 02:49.460
OK.

02:49.680 --> 02:50.630
This is unique.

02:50.820 --> 02:51.380
OK.

02:51.450 --> 02:55.980
You can assign it to any product so since this is the zipper who is just going to go ahead I'm going

02:55.980 --> 02:59.860
to hit the zipper Hoodie's OK.

02:59.880 --> 03:03.990
And this is then you can add a color like zipper.

03:03.990 --> 03:04.590
Who do you read.

03:04.670 --> 03:05.190
OK.

03:05.250 --> 03:06.160
Or something like that.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.010
So you can see that this is.

03:08.060 --> 03:14.280
Now I have given a short name or a short ID to a specific product.

03:14.280 --> 03:19.290
I cannot add this one to any other product so I have given a short ID.

03:19.320 --> 03:25.740
Now how this will work is that if this product is low on stock then it will give me this idea what I

03:25.740 --> 03:26.160
can do.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.100
I can just copy this ID I can go to all products.

03:29.100 --> 03:29.580
OK.

03:29.610 --> 03:34.860
And then what I have to do I have to base that ID in the search to that it just Krabbe the post.

03:34.980 --> 03:41.940
It describes that from that ID that specific ID you can see filter products by category folder products

03:41.940 --> 03:43.210
by product type.

03:43.230 --> 03:43.750
Okay.

03:43.770 --> 03:49.290
And then here in the search I'm just going to paste that category page that code basically which is

03:49.290 --> 03:49.890
this.

03:49.890 --> 03:50.310
OK.

03:50.340 --> 03:55.500
And then it's going to grab that core that product and then it's going to give me you can see this is

03:55.500 --> 04:02.900
the I.D. but we are assigning it a letters letter based ID bracelet of this is outworks.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.870
Now we have the message.

04:05.030 --> 04:05.630
OK.

04:05.760 --> 04:10.490
So you guys already know about the Manage stock I have 20.

04:10.670 --> 04:12.380
OK now we have the back Otter's.

04:12.390 --> 04:12.970
What is this.

04:12.990 --> 04:18.220
If I just bring my mouse here let's see if managing stock this controls whether or not bank orders are

04:18.260 --> 04:21.300
out if unable start Kennedy can go below zero.

04:21.420 --> 04:28.560
OK how this will work if that's if your stock is like out of stock OK.

04:28.590 --> 04:34.530
And then back Otter's is allowed then people can still buy from your site.

04:34.680 --> 04:39.750
And I would recommend you not to take this because why would you allow them to buy if your product is

04:39.750 --> 04:40.930
not in stock.

04:41.130 --> 04:42.750
OK so this is really very important.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.290
Do not allow this.

04:45.300 --> 04:45.750
OK.

04:45.750 --> 04:50.400
You can also choose it to be like allow but notify customer that we are low in stock.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.860
We do not we don't know if we get the product or not.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.650
OK so if we did not get the product you will refund your amount so something like that okay.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.010
But just choosing Do not allow.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.300
We've just updated if you have more products.

05:03.300 --> 05:03.820
Okay.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.940
So now we have sold individually.

05:06.060 --> 05:10.400
What this mean is that a person cannot buy two products at once.

05:10.410 --> 05:10.860
OK.

05:10.860 --> 05:12.880
So he can not buy two quantities OK.

05:12.930 --> 05:18.960
So if I just check in the person I don't have the option to choose like he wants to products.

05:18.960 --> 05:19.430
OK.

05:19.530 --> 05:26.010
So he just have to buy it only one so you can call it like one single item per single user.

05:26.070 --> 05:27.550
OK this is what I mean.

05:27.660 --> 05:32.830
Now we have the shipping so we have the vaid K.G. like if you charge on a rate basis then you can sit

05:32.830 --> 05:33.240
like that.

05:33.240 --> 05:39.070
This is too K.G. so do K.G. will be applied.

05:39.090 --> 05:43.890
Then we have the dimension so if you have like a big product you can charge them more for that so you

05:43.890 --> 05:45.450
can just choose it in the shipping tab.

05:45.450 --> 05:49.130
If I just go to Carmouche and then I go to settings right here.

05:49.560 --> 05:50.030
OK.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.030
And then I go to shipping right here.

05:52.090 --> 05:58.860
So in the shipping I can just tell them OK if I just added this one right here then you can see that

05:58.860 --> 06:00.020
we have this right here.

06:00.040 --> 06:00.650
OK.

06:00.660 --> 06:07.220
I can just come here I can edit it and you can see that the cost is right here is right here and calculation

06:07.220 --> 06:08.660
is everything is right here.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.720
So you can just change them anything.

06:11.060 --> 06:11.590
OK.

06:11.750 --> 06:13.730
We have this is the shipping cost.

06:13.730 --> 06:15.050
This is the medium products.

06:15.230 --> 06:17.130
This is the cost that we have here.

06:17.360 --> 06:17.870
OK.

06:17.870 --> 06:21.820
So quantity number the cards minimum fees and taxes and fees and everything.

06:21.950 --> 06:24.950
So then we have the products shipping class right here as well.

06:25.360 --> 06:28.570
OK you can go to many medium products minimum products.

06:28.590 --> 06:28.960
Okay.

06:28.970 --> 06:34.980
And then we have the shipping options and everything right here.

06:35.170 --> 06:37.720
So you can basically control everything from here.

06:37.720 --> 06:38.040
Okay.

06:38.050 --> 06:39.980
I just go to minute shipping mattered.

06:40.460 --> 06:40.910
Okay.

06:40.930 --> 06:43.860
And then come here and I just add a shipping method.

06:43.950 --> 06:44.200
Okay.

06:44.200 --> 06:48.970
And that is going to be a local pick up free shipping so I can also add the free shipping local pick

06:48.960 --> 06:50.200
up and everything from here.

06:50.200 --> 06:54.280
I'm just going to come here I'm going to hit Ed. And you can see that this is the cost and this is like

06:54.280 --> 06:54.480
this.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.090
This is the calculation right.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.030
Okay.

06:57.100 --> 06:59.010
So this is how it works.

06:59.170 --> 07:02.180
I'm just going to come here I'm just going to I'm here and again see these are the shipping class.

07:02.200 --> 07:06.800
I can select expensive products I can select medium products and they're going to charge them more.

07:06.820 --> 07:08.200
So this is what I'm talking about.

07:08.350 --> 07:08.950
OK.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.130
Now we have dueling products.

07:11.170 --> 07:11.600
OK.

07:11.770 --> 07:13.330
How this selling product is going to work.

07:13.360 --> 07:16.110
I'm going to tell you later on OK.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.530
And we will be doing that checked out.

07:17.540 --> 07:17.870
OK.

07:17.920 --> 07:24.910
What is up so Apso means that if we just go to this product and it's going to show some related products

07:24.960 --> 07:25.860
blowdown.

07:25.960 --> 07:33.840
So this is called upswell and the cross sales mean that if a product is added to the cart yes if a product

07:33.840 --> 07:40.630
is added to the card then in the card it will show them that you might also like section.

07:40.650 --> 07:45.190
People can also buy related products from them so you can just go with this link products.

07:45.360 --> 07:51.750
They help a lot to help a lot if if if you want to if you want your customers to buy more you can add

07:51.750 --> 07:52.510
Dilling products.

07:52.530 --> 07:55.310
And most of the companies uses their strategies.

07:55.380 --> 07:58.120
Even Amazon if you just go to Amazon right here.

07:58.290 --> 07:58.810
OK.

07:58.830 --> 08:03.680
And then we open up any of the products and then the below section it's going to tell.

08:03.750 --> 08:06.820
So if I just open up blue.

08:07.320 --> 08:11.170
OK if I just open up this for a here and then I open up this.

08:11.250 --> 08:11.730
OK.

08:11.940 --> 08:17.650
If I just open this up and it's going to go down you can see I'm frequently bought together.

08:17.670 --> 08:24.380
This is called cross-sell and this is called basically cross-sell and this is called upswell OK.

08:24.480 --> 08:28.020
So you can also create a great product and then you can add it in the cross-sell.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.310
I'm also going to show you how you can create a product.

08:30.330 --> 08:31.900
This is basically a good product.

08:31.920 --> 08:32.580
OK.

08:32.580 --> 08:36.300
So I hope that everything is understandable to you.

08:36.530 --> 08:36.800
OK.

08:36.810 --> 08:41.980
And this is called the upswell so you can see sponsored more products related to this item.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.720
OK so this is how it works.

08:44.730 --> 08:46.310
So in the next.

08:46.320 --> 08:49.960
So now we have the next section and that is the attributes and the advance.

08:50.010 --> 08:50.790
OK.

08:50.910 --> 08:55.920
So the advance section isn't always like this you can send a protégées note to the customer that we

08:55.920 --> 08:57.100
have.

08:57.140 --> 09:02.670
We have got your order and your orders being processed and if you need to if you need anything else

09:02.670 --> 09:05.110
who can I suggest you can contact us you can e-mail us.

09:05.130 --> 09:05.650
OK.

09:05.670 --> 09:11.280
And then we have the manual auto show custom ordering position so like how it will work is that you

09:11.280 --> 09:15.370
can just go with the sorting of the product and then in the sorting it's going to show that.

09:15.450 --> 09:18.480
And then we have the last one and that is the Enable review.

09:18.480 --> 09:23.490
So this should be checked because while you want to disable to review every product has the views of

09:23.550 --> 09:25.600
every website uses the reviews.

09:25.690 --> 09:28.320
OK you can see Amazon also uses.

09:28.650 --> 09:34.250
So what I'm going to do right now I be going to basically understand variable products right now so

09:34.290 --> 09:37.200
if I just go ahead I just add a product my.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.150
OK.

09:38.220 --> 09:40.330
I'm just going to add a product image right now.

09:44.180 --> 09:46.210
OK let's grab that product.

09:46.210 --> 09:46.410
Me too.

09:46.420 --> 09:49.830
I'm just going to go to pick a made up column and then I'm going to grab that one.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.320
So let's just search for.

09:51.500 --> 09:51.900
OK.

09:51.910 --> 09:53.780
And we need a full hoodie.

09:53.980 --> 09:56.090
So this is the zipper based hoodie.

09:56.170 --> 09:56.770
This one.

09:57.070 --> 09:57.640
Yes.

09:57.790 --> 09:59.160
Zipper zipper hoodie.

09:59.310 --> 09:59.680
OK.

09:59.680 --> 10:00.490
I'm just going to come here.

10:00.490 --> 10:04.770
I'm just going to grab this one OK and then I'm going to hit this debt load.

10:04.780 --> 10:06.120
So this is being downloaded right now.

10:06.130 --> 10:06.960
I'm just going to come here.

10:06.970 --> 10:09.300
I'm going to hit this and I'm going to upload it.

10:11.380 --> 10:14.940
You can see this is uploaded and you're going to get said product image.

10:15.310 --> 10:21.520
And this is right here let's just publish this post and let's just open this up.

10:21.680 --> 10:21.940
OK.

10:21.950 --> 10:25.240
I'm just going to hit a few products right now and you can see this is out.

10:25.260 --> 10:26.760
So we have zipper hoodies.

10:26.990 --> 10:29.330
We have this right here and we have everything

10:33.090 --> 10:34.900
OK but we cannot buy this.

10:34.920 --> 10:40.480
OK the reason is that I think we haven't added the product quantities that how much product we have.

10:40.650 --> 10:41.360
I'm just going to come here.

10:41.370 --> 10:48.290
I'm going to edit products and I hope if that is said to OK we basically haven't added the price so

10:48.300 --> 10:49.500
that is why the add two card.

10:49.550 --> 10:50.720
And it's not right here.

10:50.880 --> 10:51.810
So I'm just going to come here.

10:51.810 --> 10:53.580
I'm going to add 25 bucks.

10:53.580 --> 10:54.580
OK.

10:54.630 --> 10:59.130
And now I'm going to hit a trade now and let's open this up OK.

10:59.250 --> 11:02.740
So this is how you can see that a product is looking OK.

11:02.800 --> 11:08.680
We have this we have 20 in stock and we have everything coming.

11:08.860 --> 11:13.980
If I just come here I go down and then I go to the shipping Oh sorry in mentary and then I choose a

11:13.990 --> 11:17.100
zero right here because we don't have anything in this stock.

11:17.290 --> 11:20.610
I'm just going to update it and I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit refresh.

11:20.620 --> 11:20.890
OK.

11:20.890 --> 11:23.670
I'm just going to refresh this.

11:23.820 --> 11:28.680
Is it eight.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.880
Let's go now let's go to the inventory.

11:31.000 --> 11:31.520
OK.

11:31.520 --> 11:32.870
I I use the eight.

11:32.890 --> 11:33.240
OK.

11:33.270 --> 11:36.830
I'm just going to I'm here I'm going to hit zero and I'm going to update it right now.

11:37.120 --> 11:40.380
So let's just come here and let's refresh this.

11:40.380 --> 11:44.530
You can see this is out-of-stock and the two card it is not appearing.

11:44.530 --> 11:45.970
So this is how it works.

11:46.000 --> 11:46.720
OK.

11:46.930 --> 11:47.850
I'm just going to come here.

11:47.860 --> 11:51.770
I'm just going to go down and let's add some in the inventory.

11:51.830 --> 11:55.810
Because I want 25 in my stock.

11:55.810 --> 11:59.980
So now we will be talking about how variable product works.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.950
What is a variable product variable product.

12:01.950 --> 12:07.290
It's like if I am a guy OK then I want to select a main product.

12:07.300 --> 12:07.720
OK.

12:07.840 --> 12:12.700
And if I am moving in that I'm going to select that I want it for like fulfillment.

12:12.780 --> 12:13.190
OK.

12:13.300 --> 12:18.330
So I'm like this if I won the cream color Elssler green if I want blue color I'm going to select blue.

12:18.430 --> 12:19.810
So we want to show the options.

12:19.810 --> 12:20.260
OK.

12:20.260 --> 12:24.640
So many of the Web sites uses this even Eby also uses this.

12:24.670 --> 12:25.490
Let me show you.

12:25.650 --> 12:26.070
OK.

12:26.140 --> 12:27.020
I'm just going to come here.

12:27.040 --> 12:37.450
I'm going to hit this right now and let's just search for Hootie.

12:37.540 --> 12:40.150
You can see these are related tags coming right here.

12:40.150 --> 12:44.900
And then if I open any of them right here let's just open this one.

12:45.400 --> 12:46.050
OK.

12:46.060 --> 12:46.510
Here we go.

12:46.510 --> 12:48.970
You can see that we have color.

12:49.050 --> 12:49.630
OK.

12:49.660 --> 12:53.330
And then we have this size and then we have the quantity.

12:53.440 --> 12:53.810
OK.

12:53.980 --> 12:55.540
So this is how this type of work.

12:55.540 --> 12:58.300
So I want to add these type of options to my website.

12:58.300 --> 13:01.870
So how can people select the size how can people select the color.

13:02.040 --> 13:02.380
OK.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.810
So we'll be doing that in this video OK.

13:05.830 --> 13:11.330
So let's just come here and let's select it to be the video product because we want to add the variations.

13:11.350 --> 13:11.880
OK.

13:11.980 --> 13:15.880
And what is the variation of variations are called Basically them like that.

13:15.880 --> 13:17.260
The variable productus.

13:17.280 --> 13:20.470
So if it's like black you can see the black is appearing.

13:20.470 --> 13:24.550
And if you select this to XXL the price is also increasing.

13:24.670 --> 13:27.290
OK so we can vary the product from them.

13:27.310 --> 13:28.580
OK I'm just going to come here.

13:28.660 --> 13:35.510
I'm just going to come here and first of all I have to come here to attribute the variations of the

13:35.510 --> 13:36.090
attribute.

13:36.110 --> 13:41.540
And then here I want to add the custom product attribute make sure that this is right here.

13:41.550 --> 13:43.350
I'm just going to click ad right now.

13:43.440 --> 13:43.830
OK.

13:43.910 --> 13:46.380
And then here I'm going to choose the name.

13:46.430 --> 13:54.420
So the name is going to be like color ok the color and then we have used for variations.

13:54.440 --> 14:00.020
Make sure that this is checked so that we can go to the variation in SAP and we can add them in that

14:00.020 --> 14:01.640
like vich colored they want.

14:01.670 --> 14:05.640
I'm just going to hit this and then we have the colors show first colors green to be blue.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.640
OK let's just choose the first colors to be green.

14:09.070 --> 14:09.570
OK.

14:09.650 --> 14:11.740
And then we have the blue.

14:11.990 --> 14:13.970
And then we have the Chri.

14:13.980 --> 14:16.340
So make sure that that you choose just like this.

14:16.340 --> 14:23.280
You have to add this separator to separate every of the category or the very variation right here.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.750
So is going to hit save attributes right now.

14:25.990 --> 14:26.500
OK.

14:26.540 --> 14:29.260
And then I have to go to the variations step.

14:29.270 --> 14:32.130
Make sure to understand this guys because this is so easy.

14:32.270 --> 14:36.800
But I know it will be so confusing to you even it was confusing to me when I just started this plug

14:36.800 --> 14:38.460
in and I was just working with it.

14:38.460 --> 14:43.130
So that is why I'm telling you that you have to come up so you have to just select you have to click

14:43.130 --> 14:49.440
Create variation from all the attributes because you want to create the variation for this this this.

14:49.460 --> 14:51.030
And the main would be this.

14:51.050 --> 14:51.420
OK.

14:51.530 --> 14:55.550
So I'm just going to I'm here I'm going to hit to the variation and then I'm going to hit create variation

14:55.550 --> 14:56.540
from all the attributes.

14:56.660 --> 15:02.510
I can also select a variation on I can hit go but I need the variations from the attributes that we

15:02.510 --> 15:03.180
have at it.

15:03.200 --> 15:06.880
I'm just going to hit go and on the go it is showing that.

15:06.890 --> 15:08.690
Are you sure you want to link all variations.

15:08.690 --> 15:09.520
I'm going to hit OK.

15:09.530 --> 15:14.130
I just want to add it OK and I can see three variations has been added.

15:14.360 --> 15:18.020
So here would be the variations I have green blue and gray.

15:18.020 --> 15:18.360
OK.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.740
So first one is green and the second one is blue and the third one is great.

15:21.740 --> 15:26.870
So I'm just going to expand right now and you can see everything is expanded so I can also just click

15:26.870 --> 15:30.920
close and I can expand that myself and my mouse right here if I want.

15:30.920 --> 15:31.930
What's up.

15:32.120 --> 15:34.680
Let's just come here and let's expand it individually.

15:34.790 --> 15:42.700
So here we have like you can see that we have three separated products created by the are now in here.

15:42.740 --> 15:47.690
So that person can select and we can also change the product image for a green color.

15:47.720 --> 15:50.970
We can also change the regular price for the color.

15:50.990 --> 15:56.340
They can also change the in-stock like we can also change that how many we have in stock.

15:56.370 --> 15:59.230
They can also change the base and everything from here.

16:00.950 --> 16:04.660
So let's just come here and you can also select manage stock in this quantity.

16:04.660 --> 16:05.630
We'll be right here.

16:05.810 --> 16:08.720
So give like the regular price from here.

16:08.720 --> 16:12.550
So for green we would charge them $20.

16:12.560 --> 16:12.990
OK.

16:13.220 --> 16:16.530
And for like if I just click here.

16:16.550 --> 16:18.160
You can also change the image.

16:18.170 --> 16:19.770
I'm going to show you how it's going to work.

16:19.820 --> 16:20.070
OK.

16:20.090 --> 16:21.240
And for Blue.

16:21.330 --> 16:22.310
OK.

16:22.400 --> 16:26.280
I need different price.

16:26.310 --> 16:32.970
So here I need the regular price to be like we have chosen here $20 show for this and it's a regular

16:32.970 --> 16:33.930
price to be 25.

16:33.930 --> 16:37.340
Because Blue is a great color or something like that.

16:37.560 --> 16:43.980
Or so for this I need the image to be changed so if someone chooses the blue then we want to show him

16:44.010 --> 16:47.250
this guy because this guy is also wearing a hoodie not a hoodie.

16:47.250 --> 16:48.070
He's wearing a shirt.

16:48.240 --> 16:53.200
But we want to tell them that this is the hoodie that you're going to get.

16:53.220 --> 16:53.810
OK.

16:54.120 --> 16:59.580
Now I'm going to go down and begin also at a sale price to it like if you buy the blue we are selling

16:59.580 --> 17:01.660
it to you for $50.

17:01.680 --> 17:02.500
OK.

17:02.550 --> 17:03.360
I'm just going to come here.

17:03.360 --> 17:05.000
I'm just going to go to the one right here.

17:05.010 --> 17:08.080
And the gray is basically out-of-stock.

17:08.150 --> 17:09.280
OK.

17:09.360 --> 17:11.400
We have the price for it but this is out of stock.

17:11.430 --> 17:11.770
OK.

17:11.850 --> 17:14.410
So this is like $30 OK.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.930
And we can also add an image so far.

17:16.990 --> 17:19.890
Trey I think really is this one.

17:20.130 --> 17:21.660
It's just sheer variation.

17:21.660 --> 17:25.560
So I'm just going to get hit save changes and now everything is changed.

17:25.560 --> 17:30.360
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit a dog right now so you can see that the product has

17:30.360 --> 17:30.960
been updated.

17:30.960 --> 17:31.910
I'm just going to go ahead.

17:31.920 --> 17:35.210
I'm going to get the product in the new tab and let's have a look at her.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.980
Say you can see that we have these colors right here.

17:38.010 --> 17:43.440
We have super hoodies and these are the product from variations that we have a sale product that is

17:43.500 --> 17:50.250
if I just go through the variations again and again see that the blue one is 415 and the green one is

17:50.250 --> 17:56.190
for 20 and this one which is out of stock but this is still added and this is 230.

17:56.190 --> 18:01.890
So if I just come here and I just said choose options you can see that we have green twenty five in

18:01.890 --> 18:04.210
stock and $20.

18:04.300 --> 18:04.690
OK.

18:04.700 --> 18:12.630
The colors say if I just liked blue you can see 15 in stock and the image is also changed.

18:12.680 --> 18:13.660
OK 20.

18:13.820 --> 18:16.970
$15 sorry $25 is the original price.

18:16.970 --> 18:17.690
OK.

18:17.840 --> 18:21.810
And if we select gray You can see this is right here.

18:21.940 --> 18:22.500
OK.

18:22.580 --> 18:27.510
But this is showing 25 in stock.

18:27.880 --> 18:28.350
OK.

18:28.510 --> 18:30.470
What I have to do I have just come here.

18:30.730 --> 18:32.140
I'm just going to go to the inventory.

18:32.290 --> 18:34.120
Let's just click here and let's just hit this.

18:34.150 --> 18:34.550
OK.

18:34.660 --> 18:39.400
We don't have to select the product from here and it's going to go to the variations right here and

18:39.400 --> 18:40.580
let's select it from here.

18:40.600 --> 18:41.260
OK.

18:41.260 --> 18:43.620
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit up Detroit now.

18:45.700 --> 18:46.800
So let's have a look at this.

18:46.810 --> 18:49.460
Let's just refresh this OK.

18:49.610 --> 18:54.110
And if I just come here and I just sit this you can see this is added but we chose that.

18:54.110 --> 18:57.210
We don't have anything in the product so let's just come here.

18:57.230 --> 18:58.100
Let's just go down.

18:58.130 --> 18:59.660
Let's just go to the variations.

19:00.050 --> 19:02.960
OK again let's just go here to the tree OK.

19:03.020 --> 19:06.080
We have selected the this is in-stock OK and then choose the out-of-stock.

19:06.080 --> 19:09.190
I'm just going to select it and I'm going to hit a date right now again.

19:09.440 --> 19:13.080
OK so gray is basically out-of-stock.

19:13.140 --> 19:13.380
OK.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.200
I'm just going to come here.

19:14.210 --> 19:17.280
I'm going to rephrase this right now.

19:17.300 --> 19:18.140
Here we have this.

19:18.170 --> 19:22.340
If I choose this you can see out-of-stock and I cannot buy it.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.630
This is what I wanted to show.

19:23.740 --> 19:29.660
So you can see every time I change the color the image is also changing and everything is changing.

19:29.970 --> 19:36.020
OK so now we have also learned that how can we create variations for different type of products.

19:36.050 --> 19:36.840
OK.

19:36.980 --> 19:38.510
You can also create two editions.

19:38.510 --> 19:44.060
I'm going to show you how can you create two variations in the next video so stadium guys and in the

19:44.060 --> 19:46.940
next one you will begin to learn how to create two variations.

19:46.940 --> 19:51.020
And then we're also going to learn what are the products how can be added for products and then we're

19:51.020 --> 19:52.230
going to design the site.

19:52.390 --> 19:52.750
OK.

19:52.760 --> 19:56.720
And then we're going to add some dumb products into a website and then we're going to move forward to

19:56.730 --> 19:57.250
CD.

19:57.290 --> 19:57.680
And good.
