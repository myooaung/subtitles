00:00.440 --> 00:01.940
What is up guys and welcome x.

00:01.940 --> 00:04.860
Now in this video we're going to be working up what the Cdn.

00:04.860 --> 00:10.650
OK that is content delivery network and going to be showing you how that CDN feels romantically improve

00:11.520 --> 00:13.700
the speed of the site.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.780
OK not very much but it will help you a lot.

00:16.980 --> 00:17.430
OK.

00:17.430 --> 00:24.060
So after that I'll also show you how can you work with the SSL sort of the gate that you can get for

00:24.060 --> 00:24.800
free.

00:24.810 --> 00:26.460
So let's get started.

00:26.460 --> 00:30.680
First of all what you have to do is that you need to go to CloudFlare dot com.

00:30.810 --> 00:38.710
So this is a Web site that is that gives you the free CDN service and the SSL service as well.

00:38.730 --> 00:44.330
Now this website is personal used by me if I want to go with the free plan.

00:44.420 --> 00:44.980
OK.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.990
So let's just go ahead and let's just go to the log in.

00:48.990 --> 00:54.330
Since I'm already logged in here that is why I will go to log in but you have to sign up here with your

00:54.330 --> 00:58.260
e-mail and your password and you can then log yourself in.

00:58.260 --> 00:58.670
OK.

00:58.740 --> 01:06.540
So once you click log in and once you log yourself in or once you have signed up at CloudFlare you basically

01:06.540 --> 01:10.000
have to add your website to the CloudFlare.

01:10.100 --> 01:10.410
OK.

01:10.440 --> 01:16.370
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to click here and type I have to just click here and it's going

01:16.370 --> 01:18.020
to open up this Web site.

01:18.030 --> 01:27.210
This pop up or this box and I am in here CloudFlare dot com slash a slash and dash site here I have

01:27.210 --> 01:28.350
to enter the euro.

01:28.460 --> 01:28.760
OK.

01:28.830 --> 01:30.240
I'm going to copy this.

01:30.240 --> 01:30.960
You are ill.

01:31.140 --> 01:31.610
OK.

01:31.620 --> 01:36.050
And then I get to come here and I'm going to paste it right here and I'm going to click Add side.

01:36.090 --> 01:37.340
That's all you have to do.

01:37.380 --> 01:42.510
And then CloudFlare vild attacked that you're creating your business record.

01:42.540 --> 01:44.430
OK I'll just have to click next.

01:44.490 --> 01:48.170
You will be taken to a new page pretty we'll ask you to select a plan.

01:48.210 --> 01:50.440
So I'm going to be selecting the free plan.

01:50.490 --> 01:54.150
OK so it does have the global CDN.

01:54.210 --> 01:59.940
The unretired migration to us and the free shared SSL certificate.

02:00.150 --> 02:04.830
So I'm going to be clicking here and I'm going to be clicking confirm plant that's all you have to do.

02:04.830 --> 02:07.450
You are in here in a tastiness query.

02:07.470 --> 02:09.460
So here everything will be here.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.290
You don't have to do anything.

02:11.310 --> 02:14.130
You just have to come here and you have to continue.

02:14.120 --> 02:15.450
That's all you have to do.

02:15.450 --> 02:20.860
And now you have to just copy the name servers so how you're going to do that.

02:20.940 --> 02:24.290
You just have to log into the portal off your domain name.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.430
OK the portal off the host gator.

02:26.430 --> 02:29.570
Basically you just have to go to Portlock host gator dot com.

02:29.610 --> 02:33.770
You have to enter the e-mail address there and then you have to log yourself in.

02:33.950 --> 02:34.400
OK.

02:34.500 --> 02:35.810
Let me show you.

02:35.870 --> 02:40.100
You just have to log in there and then you have to just copy the name servers.

02:40.140 --> 02:40.610
OK.

02:40.740 --> 02:48.090
So if you have registered your domain name from another registrar and like go daddy or change name cheaper

02:48.090 --> 02:53.640
anywhere else you can then change your name from name servers from there as well so you have to just

02:53.640 --> 02:54.760
click domains.

02:54.780 --> 02:55.430
OK.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.740
And then you have to just see all these domains.

02:58.740 --> 03:06.750
So let's suppose that if my domain name is on this one OK if my domain name is creator of P-doc site.

03:06.760 --> 03:09.790
OK but since I'm working with NZL I have to change it.

03:09.930 --> 03:10.290
OK.

03:10.290 --> 03:13.140
So if let's suppose that this is your domain name.

03:13.140 --> 03:15.290
You just have to go to the name servers.

03:15.300 --> 03:21.650
That is right here and you have to click change and then you have to paste this name server.

03:21.720 --> 03:23.420
Ok you have to just copy this.

03:23.460 --> 03:24.680
You have to just copy this.

03:24.780 --> 03:26.400
And then you have to paste that.

03:26.400 --> 03:32.310
So once you just add your name servers you just have to click Save name servers and then you have to

03:32.310 --> 03:35.020
come here and you have to hit continue.

03:35.040 --> 03:40.430
So I'm going to be changing my name servers for I NZL dot com that I am applying for.

03:40.530 --> 03:41.100
OK.

03:41.100 --> 03:42.310
So I'm just pausing my video.

03:42.390 --> 03:45.060
I'll change my name servers and then I'll be back.

03:45.060 --> 03:47.120
So guys I have added my name servers.

03:47.160 --> 03:51.960
Once again make sure that in the end it's six.

03:52.290 --> 03:53.770
Go host Geter dot com.

03:53.790 --> 03:54.830
This should be here.

03:54.870 --> 03:55.290
OK.

03:55.290 --> 03:57.110
This one should be here.

03:57.120 --> 04:03.180
This change to this and this one which is this one should be changed did this.

04:03.210 --> 04:03.650
OK.

04:03.750 --> 04:08.700
So once you do that you just have to click continue and that's all you have to do.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.150
Your web site.

04:10.170 --> 04:15.240
They'll be in the DNS modification pendek so it will take some time.

04:15.360 --> 04:18.800
OK like five hours maximum.

04:18.810 --> 04:19.420
OK.

04:19.500 --> 04:25.990
And once your domain name is done you just have to go ahead you just have to click recheck name servers.

04:26.070 --> 04:26.510
OK.

04:26.520 --> 04:27.660
And then it will be done.

04:27.660 --> 04:33.140
So I'm just stopping my video right now and in the next video we'll just continue that how our Web site

04:33.420 --> 04:34.520

04:34.790 --> 04:36.140
