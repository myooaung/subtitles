OK so the coupon will work is that if you want to run a sale or if you want to deduct the tax or if

00:10.190 --> 00:14.260
you want like free shipping or something like that then how we can do that.

00:14.310 --> 00:14.790
OK.

00:14.790 --> 00:20.180
So let's just go to dashboard right here and I just want to create a coupon.

00:20.190 --> 00:25.050
So let's just go ahead let's just create a coupon and then we'll be opening this whole Web site and

00:25.050 --> 00:26.880
the private tab and then we'll work.

00:26.970 --> 00:27.420
OK.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.890
So let's just go to the Commerce and then we have to go to the coupons right here OK.

00:31.890 --> 00:36.820
And then here we need to create a coupon that will be applied to all of the products.

00:36.840 --> 00:37.400
OK.

00:37.440 --> 00:40.420
So let's just wait till this is done.

00:42.370 --> 00:42.730
OK.

00:42.790 --> 00:46.990
What I have to do I haven't just said ad coupon and you can see it's going to take me to the new window

00:47.210 --> 00:51.740
where I have to enter the coupon code so my coupon code is going to be like.

00:52.060 --> 00:59.230

01:00.190 --> 01:07.770
So since this is my coupon code OK and then I'm giving a fixed card discount like I can offer them for

01:07.780 --> 01:08.480
fixed card.

01:08.490 --> 01:13.080
So that means that I won them $10 discount so they buy anything.

01:13.090 --> 01:14.830
They get $10 discount.

01:14.980 --> 01:21.110
I can also just tell them that fix product discount like they buy anything that will be cost like coupon

01:21.160 --> 01:23.710
amount so that the $10 will be less.

01:23.740 --> 01:29.060
OK so now we have the person daj discount.

01:29.060 --> 01:34.800
I basically want that the person daj discount so I wan the person daj to be like 50 percent.

01:35.030 --> 01:35.420

01:56.480 --> 01:57.200
This is not here.

02:22.180 --> 02:23.250
We have this and this.

02:23.740 --> 02:26.030
I want to come here I want to hit it here.

02:29.530 --> 02:31.320

02:54.820 --> 02:55.240
OK.

02:55.300 --> 03:02.430
So if someone has a valid free shipping coupon then I'll just give him the free shipping.

03:02.440 --> 03:03.180
So here we go.

03:03.190 --> 03:03.740
OK.

03:03.790 --> 03:06.410
I'm just going to hit save so you can see this is already saved.

03:11.950 --> 03:18.800
So if someone enters new year 2000 and 18 then he will get a 50 percent off.

03:18.880 --> 03:22.480
And also he will be getting a free shipping method.

03:22.480 --> 03:23.000
OK.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.420
And then we have the usage restrictions so this means that the person has to minimums man like $10 OK.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.050
And then he will use you can also select this debt.

03:32.050 --> 03:34.140
This coupon will be visible to all.

03:34.140 --> 03:42.290
They'll be appliable to only one user of IP or one user account or something like that excludes them

03:42.420 --> 03:44.250
so you can also exclude the sale items.

03:44.290 --> 03:44.740
OK.

03:44.860 --> 03:49.100
You can also include a product or you can just exclude a product.

03:49.300 --> 03:54.660
You can work the product category so to select any category that it will be applied to any of the category.

03:54.910 --> 03:57.130
You can also just exclude any category.

03:57.130 --> 04:03.070
And we have that e-mail restrictions like you can restrict some of the users of the e-mail to like they

04:03.070 --> 04:05.080
cannot use this.

04:05.080 --> 04:06.880
Then we have the usage limits.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.730
So this is I mean that how much use is limited by a coupon.

04:09.730 --> 04:10.950
So what this means.

04:10.990 --> 04:13.700
How many times this coupon can be used before it's white.

04:13.700 --> 04:19.750
So like you're giving 5000 coupons like 5000 coupons per abuse limit usage to x items.

04:19.780 --> 04:20.380
OK.

04:20.530 --> 04:26.020
The maximum number of individual items coupon can be applied when using a product discount leave blank

04:26.020 --> 04:27.260
to apply to all color.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.730
So we just want to apply to anyone.

04:29.890 --> 04:32.480
And then we have a huge age limit.

04:32.550 --> 04:33.250
But you user.

04:33.280 --> 04:33.830
OK.

04:33.850 --> 04:36.550
This means that a user can use that one.

04:36.580 --> 04:44.740
Like if a guy has an I.D. then from that I.D. He can just use only one coupon or 10 coupons maximum.

04:44.730 --> 04:46.920
It's not he can not go beyond that.

04:46.930 --> 04:47.870
So this is it's going to work.

04:47.950 --> 04:48.450
OK.

04:48.610 --> 04:52.840
So what I'm going to do right now I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit publish and this should

04:52.930 --> 04:54.000
be published.

04:56.370 --> 04:59.960
So now what we have to do is that we need to test if this is working or not.

05:00.000 --> 05:06.250
The person the coupon code is this new year 2018 I'm going to go to site right now.

05:09.970 --> 05:12.850
And here I want to add a product in my card.

05:12.850 --> 05:14.990
And then after that I have to apply that coupon.

05:14.990 --> 05:15.480
So.

05:15.650 --> 05:20.800
So let's suppose that I liked this one.

05:21.000 --> 05:21.680
OK.

05:21.890 --> 05:22.650
I like this one.

05:22.670 --> 05:25.220
I am going to just slide the Exel one.

05:25.520 --> 05:26.010
OK.

05:26.060 --> 05:29.060
And then I have to choose an option that will be great.

05:29.210 --> 05:30.320
I'm going to hit too card.

05:30.320 --> 05:35.060
This project is going to be added to my card right now and then I'm going to hit that take me to my

05:35.060 --> 05:35.590
shopping cart.

05:35.600 --> 05:40.960
So I'm just going to hit this and is going to pretend I was already here and I'm going to get a checkup.

05:40.970 --> 05:45.420
So let's just go to the card first because we are going to apply the coupon here.

05:45.470 --> 05:48.230
So I'm just going to add new year

05:51.970 --> 05:53.060
2019.

05:53.370 --> 05:53.710
OK.

05:53.860 --> 05:57.170
I'm going to apply coupon and you can see this coupon will be applied.

05:58.760 --> 05:59.320
So here you go.

05:59.320 --> 06:05.770
You can see that a coupon has been applied but also you can see this is giving 25 50.

06:05.790 --> 06:09.790
It has given us the 50 percent off and it is also giving the free shipping.

06:09.950 --> 06:10.480
OK.

06:10.520 --> 06:13.570
Which means that we we have the free shipping Stex.

06:13.700 --> 06:14.740
It won't be applied to decs.

06:14.750 --> 06:15.200
OK.

06:15.320 --> 06:16.440
We have this right here.

06:16.460 --> 06:21.320
And if I choose the country to be like Oman if my country is a man and then I come here then you can

06:21.320 --> 06:27.260
see that the free shipping will not be here because free shipping option is not added in that country.

06:27.260 --> 06:31.830
Oman and we haven't added in other countries like Pakistan.

06:31.850 --> 06:36.930
We will only apply free shipping to the Pakistan users only.

06:37.100 --> 06:42.260
That means that it would cost us a lot if someone is just using a coupon gourd.

06:42.290 --> 06:45.470
And also we gave them the free shipping then it would cost us a lot.

06:45.470 --> 06:46.380
So they're divided.

06:46.430 --> 06:47.570
This is what I mean.

06:47.570 --> 06:47.810
OK.

06:47.810 --> 06:49.380
And then we have the 29.

06:49.390 --> 06:54.520
This is our total and we have to proceed to checkout and it will take us to the new age we have to enter

06:54.530 --> 06:57.570
details and we can see that everything is right here.

06:57.680 --> 07:01.500
Our coupon code section is already created here.

07:01.720 --> 07:02.220
OK.

07:02.300 --> 07:03.310
So this is outworks.

07:03.380 --> 07:06.990
So now you can see that we are totally done with the e-commerce functionality.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.650

We'll move on with Step-By-Step things okay.

07:14.030 --> 07:14.850

07:17.810 --> 07:18.580
What is this.

07:18.620 --> 07:20.460

07:28.590 --> 07:29.720

07:29.750 --> 07:34.040
So you can see everything is totally up and running and in the next video we will be working up and

07:34.050 --> 07:39.440
