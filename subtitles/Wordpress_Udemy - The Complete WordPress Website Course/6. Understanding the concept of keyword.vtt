00:00.950 --> 00:02.490
What does a guy isn't welcome x.

00:02.490 --> 00:06.940
Now in this video I'm going to be showing you how to write a post and how to write pages.

00:06.960 --> 00:09.960
OK so basically I'm going to be giving you the tips.

00:10.020 --> 00:10.790
OK.

00:10.890 --> 00:15.150
That you have to implement and you will see that your post will come on the top of the Google.

00:15.150 --> 00:21.900
So basically how the post comes and how we will understand that the post is related to the post that

00:21.900 --> 00:22.550
you are writing.

00:22.620 --> 00:23.560
OK.

00:23.970 --> 00:24.870
It makes sense OK.

00:24.870 --> 00:29.830
Like if you want to write a post like how to create a void Press website.

00:29.910 --> 00:31.170
OK so this is right here.

00:31.320 --> 00:37.660
Now how to google will understand that this is related to the wordpress site creation.

00:37.830 --> 00:45.240
Ok so Google basically take your word and just break it.

00:45.320 --> 00:45.570
OK.

00:45.570 --> 00:51.020
Like if I just go to my title page you can see how to create a W.P. site.

00:51.530 --> 00:52.230
OK.

00:52.440 --> 00:55.050
So Google is going to create to break this.

00:55.050 --> 00:58.980
OK like how to create a W.P. site.

00:59.100 --> 00:59.610
OK.

00:59.820 --> 01:04.940
And Google is going to make sure that the that is a keyword and a site is a keyword.

01:05.070 --> 01:07.270
So Google will mark it as a cured.

01:07.410 --> 01:07.800
OK.

01:07.830 --> 01:17.590
And if this W.P. and this site is appearing on your home page or on any of your weight on your page.

01:17.700 --> 01:22.160
Ok then Google will mark that as the post related to that keyword.

01:22.290 --> 01:22.670
OK.

01:22.770 --> 01:27.520
So let's suppose that I just go here and I just search for word press didor Hills.

01:27.890 --> 01:28.650
OK.

01:29.130 --> 01:32.430
That's all I just search for this.

01:32.430 --> 01:39.970
Now here you can see Tay's way it Torrijos thousand two hundred plus Step-By-Step tutorials right here.

01:40.210 --> 01:46.980
We have so many right here and I can see everything is coming here and saying WordPress Dorio.

01:47.200 --> 01:50.440
So I just open it up and I just open it up.

01:50.440 --> 01:57.490
You can see that here in this page if I look for Wordpress than this page would be having so many word

01:57.490 --> 01:58.030
passwords.

01:58.030 --> 01:58.420
OK.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.570
Let's just press control and then F..

02:00.610 --> 02:01.050
OK.

02:01.210 --> 02:03.740
And now here I'm going to be searching for WordPress.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.870
I can see how many times Wordpress is mentioned here.

02:06.870 --> 02:11.890
So Wordpress is mentioned here eighty five times you can see if I just click here it's going to take

02:11.890 --> 02:16.900
me down to so many times that the word press is being mentioned.

02:16.900 --> 02:17.320
OK.

02:17.500 --> 02:26.760
So this is how basically Google has placed this tablet beginner onto the top result.

02:26.950 --> 02:28.010
And this is how it is working.

02:28.140 --> 02:28.380
OK.

02:28.390 --> 02:32.410
This is the ad so we're going to be leaving this but this is the organic one.

02:32.440 --> 02:38.710
So you can see it has Woj press here as well as W.P. here and everything is here.

02:38.890 --> 02:40.500
So that is why we're pressed.

02:40.510 --> 02:45.890
Dorri Olds is ranking on the number one page result.

02:45.910 --> 02:51.610
So now if you just go to the word pressure Durrell in the site drowne you can see that here should also

02:51.610 --> 02:56.620
be WordPress like it should be mentioned so many times if I just click here and I can see if I just

02:56.620 --> 02:59.770
press control f then I just search for word press.

02:59.950 --> 03:03.050
OK this search here you can see how many times Wordpress is here.

03:03.180 --> 03:08.410
It's just so small repressors so many times like this there's this this this this and these are all

03:08.410 --> 03:10.170
the links so links matter a lot.

03:10.180 --> 03:16.690
OK if you have a link to your next post or to your other post then Google will mark that page to be

03:16.690 --> 03:21.510
like so great because you are interlinking your different pages and you have so many times where you

03:21.520 --> 03:22.120
press used.

03:22.120 --> 03:29.040
OK I have this there's this there's this and you can see this is how this site is being ranked on the

03:29.080 --> 03:29.770
Google.

03:29.800 --> 03:36.040
So it totally depends upon the keywords said how much you use how you plan your keyboard and where to

03:36.040 --> 03:37.390
put a key word here.

03:37.540 --> 03:39.420
They're here or anywhere.

03:39.580 --> 03:47.140
So if you're choosing your keywords wisely OK then you will see that your website full of crow.

03:47.140 --> 03:47.880
Huge.

03:47.890 --> 03:49.990
OK your Web site will come in the top of the page.

03:49.990 --> 03:50.590
OK.

03:50.590 --> 03:52.890
No doubt this site round is a famous company.

03:53.040 --> 03:53.570
OK.

03:53.590 --> 03:57.320
That is why it is coming but also the key word matters as well.

03:57.460 --> 04:00.980
OK so every company's start from the ground.

04:01.240 --> 04:03.060
OK like this is inside out.

04:03.130 --> 04:05.280
So this was also started from the crown.

04:05.440 --> 04:05.930
OK.

04:06.070 --> 04:09.210
No company is for is a huge company.

04:09.310 --> 04:09.470
OK.

04:09.490 --> 04:12.700
You have to start from the ground and then you go huge.

04:12.730 --> 04:14.030
OK so keep that in mind.

04:14.080 --> 04:18.720
OK because if you are creating a business if you're doing a business and you are creating a website

04:18.760 --> 04:20.770
for it and you think you can not do it.

04:20.770 --> 04:24.360
Trust me guys you can do it if you think you can do it.

04:24.790 --> 04:32.690
OK so you will be able to do it and I know I know that you will be able to round up say to the number

04:32.690 --> 04:33.690
one page result.

04:33.980 --> 04:35.640
What these type of keyword stuffing.

04:35.660 --> 04:36.040
OK.

04:36.200 --> 04:43.590
So now I think that you have got the idea of how keyword works and what is a key word basically.

04:43.610 --> 04:45.890
Now I don't think so if I have to explain anything.

04:45.890 --> 04:48.360
So this Wordpress is basically a keyword.

04:48.520 --> 04:49.030
OK.

04:49.160 --> 04:54.340
Now physically how do you check which key word is being Sewer's.

04:54.650 --> 04:57.040
Mike Moore OK how healthy chicken.

04:57.160 --> 04:57.600
OK.

04:57.770 --> 05:01.280
So Google gives you a free service that is called Trents.

05:01.280 --> 05:07.970
OK if I just search for Google Trends then they can open this up transcon Google dot com slash outruns

05:07.970 --> 05:14.690
So you have to open this up and then you can search for the topics that were mostly searched.

05:14.840 --> 05:18.360
OK so if I want to write about iPhone 10.

05:18.970 --> 05:23.620
OK and if I want to write a blog post about iPhone 10 then let's see.

05:23.630 --> 05:24.050
So

05:26.840 --> 05:30.490
OK is not showing the results.

05:30.560 --> 05:39.000
Let's just go back a search for a WordPress tutorial so WordPress tutorial is being served so many times

05:39.000 --> 05:43.660
you can see interest the word dime it from the person I think.

05:43.870 --> 05:45.230
OK so 82 percent.

05:45.250 --> 05:47.370
And I can see how it is growing.

05:47.800 --> 05:54.330
OK we go down and you can see Paul is on the number one that we have the Bangladesh we have in Nigeria

05:54.360 --> 05:59.990
Philippines and in the five we have Pakistan we go there and we have Sri Lanka.

06:00.350 --> 06:02.120
There's these countries right here.

06:03.370 --> 06:06.160
Serbia India S..

06:06.730 --> 06:09.650
I don't know how to pronounce this Halina probably.

06:09.790 --> 06:10.300
OK.

06:10.300 --> 06:18.400
So here you can see then if you just search for a specific keyword this Google Trends is even more specify

06:18.400 --> 06:18.670
it.

06:18.850 --> 06:19.230
OK.

06:19.240 --> 06:20.360
And it's going to give you here.

06:20.380 --> 06:25.240
So let's suppose that it is right here where you press child in the Tauriel is searched so many times.

06:25.240 --> 06:25.750
OK.

06:26.020 --> 06:32.770
WordPress tutorials thousand seventeen has heard so many times OK like it's nine fifty times a WordPress

06:33.550 --> 06:40.500
plugin development Tauriel step by step is also search so many times to free schools of storm surge

06:40.510 --> 06:41.440
so many times.

06:41.620 --> 06:46.800
OK we have word presi Doyle Portuguese and we have very pristine development team for us.

06:46.810 --> 06:47.990
What is WordPress.

06:48.190 --> 06:51.220
OK we have related topics here as well.

06:51.280 --> 06:57.940
OK Shopify my ask who well and these type of religious topics the way this trend is going to give you.

06:58.030 --> 07:06.430
OK so now you can compare this WordPress tutorial with OK like if I just search for a logger tutorial

07:06.750 --> 07:08.610
I'm going to be seeing that.

07:08.970 --> 07:16.250
Blogger being more surprised by the way so Wordpress is searched most of the time.

07:16.450 --> 07:23.300
OK you can see it just giving the interest by region and interest by region here in the blogger.

07:23.410 --> 07:32.600
OK so now we come here and we just change it to be like how you use Blogger or just love her.

07:32.790 --> 07:33.240
OK.

07:33.450 --> 07:39.970
But search for this so you can see that I have basically I am using a one single keyword right here

07:40.530 --> 07:41.620
and this is very depressed.

07:41.620 --> 07:42.700
Now what is this.

07:42.790 --> 07:48.200
What I'm trying to explain is a two word keyword is more specified.

07:48.460 --> 07:48.900
OK.

07:49.030 --> 07:50.920
And one word keyword.

07:51.100 --> 07:51.560
OK.

07:51.610 --> 07:53.350
Is not more specified.

07:53.860 --> 07:58.600
So I would highly recommend you to rank two or keyword.

07:58.600 --> 08:05.710
The reason is that because when you are ranking two word keyword into your site and if your website

08:05.740 --> 08:08.940
is not like huge company.

08:09.080 --> 08:13.140
Ok so many is two key words you get a lot of traffic.

08:13.720 --> 08:18.850
But if you use one single keyword so many times OK and you make that as a primary keyword and you think

08:18.850 --> 08:23.020
OK you will get results on the basis of that you won't get it.

08:23.320 --> 08:23.890
OK.

08:24.830 --> 08:32.120
So that is why you have to make sure you use the word keep it if I just make it smaller.

08:32.340 --> 08:34.150
And I just search for voyde press that's all.

08:34.250 --> 08:41.060
OK Wordpress and the blogger they can see that WordPress searched more time so I can think that WordPress

08:41.210 --> 08:46.090
is a topic that I should be posting instead of the blogger because word processors.

08:46.140 --> 08:53.310
OK most of the time then I have to make sure that I make it more specified like Wordpress tutorial 2018.

08:53.540 --> 09:03.260
Since this is 2008 right now I can just make it more unspecified OK like Wordpress is a 2017 I can make

09:03.260 --> 09:11.600
it OK I can make it like Wordpress Dharker it's DP 5 fundraised and make sure to just keep your title

09:12.230 --> 09:17.870
and your main key word as the two word keyboard on a t shirt.

09:18.010 --> 09:20.830
OK don't go for a one single keyword.

09:20.990 --> 09:28.880
If your website is not a huge company OK because your website rank higher because those companies are

09:28.890 --> 09:32.620
those blogs that are on the number one page result already.

09:32.630 --> 09:35.270
They will come because of the page rank.

09:35.300 --> 09:43.710
Every web site has a page rank that it consists of OK and you have to make sure that you do look at

09:43.710 --> 09:44.460
it.

09:44.940 --> 09:46.680
So now we're done still here.

09:46.960 --> 09:54.930
OK this was so important this was so important to basically tell you this because it will help you a

09:54.930 --> 09:55.560
lot now.

09:55.650 --> 09:55.980
OK.

09:56.010 --> 10:01.410
Now then we will be understanding how to write a post and how to make sure that every key word is there.

10:01.530 --> 10:03.490
And here they are anywhere.

10:03.570 --> 10:08.120
Then you will understand why is it so important.

10:08.460 --> 10:15.510
OK so now we are done telling here now I'm going to be showing you that how you have to write a post

10:15.930 --> 10:16.530
or a page.

10:16.530 --> 10:20.430
So in the next video I'll be probably showing you how to.

10:20.550 --> 10:23.960
You can just write a post and how you have to choose a keyword.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.460
So you have chosen a Cuba I suppose that you have chosen like how to build a site with wordpress.

10:29.640 --> 10:30.190
OK.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.780
2018.

10:32.370 --> 10:39.260
This is the keyword that I want to focus that I will show you like Wordpress to 2018 as my main keyword.

10:39.630 --> 10:41.780
OK then I will show you how to work with it.

10:42.480 --> 10:45.910
So in the next video you'll be working up at that.

10:45.930 --> 10:46.920
Good bye guys.
