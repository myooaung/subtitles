00:00.720 --> 00:05.640
What is up guys and what KMAX So in this video we're going to be adding some demo content to a website

00:05.700 --> 00:09.870
because we don't have much time to add so much content to this.

00:09.870 --> 00:10.250
OK.

00:10.320 --> 00:14.570
So what we will be doing will be getting a plug in OK and we will be installing that.

00:14.580 --> 00:18.020
OK so we basically want to search that which plug in suits.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.740
So I'm going to add them all

00:23.250 --> 00:28.750
post for Wordpress plugin.

00:28.820 --> 00:34.490
OK so we want to add some demo posed to a Web site so you can see that we have so many plug ins it says

00:34.690 --> 00:41.690
will be posted soon will be example content of the demo demo data creator of the latest post and fake

00:41.720 --> 00:43.750
Press and one click them on board.

00:43.970 --> 00:50.020
So I think this faker press has so many votes here and it's just create random meta information or is

00:50.020 --> 00:52.800
made out for users post derms and comments.

00:52.870 --> 00:58.330
Take a Princeville allow you to generate custom dummy content for all four of a 20 type of data.

00:58.370 --> 00:59.330
So I'm just going to go ahead.

00:59.330 --> 01:00.740
I'm going to install the Figler press.

01:00.740 --> 01:01.860
I'm going to hit add Neal.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.640
Let's close the Sabb and let's work that this plug in.

01:04.640 --> 01:09.200
So basically basically I already showed you the what are the plug ins plug into.

01:09.290 --> 01:14.610
Call apps apps means that you can add different type of functionalities like there are so many apps

01:14.690 --> 01:16.460
so many apps for photo editing.

01:16.460 --> 01:20.200
If you want to edit photo if you want to do anything you have you have to install app.

01:20.270 --> 01:23.700
So I'm just going to go ahead I'm going to install faker press.

01:23.990 --> 01:28.290
I'm going a search basically.

01:28.700 --> 01:29.860
And here we go.

01:29.870 --> 01:36.830
I'm going to hit install now and let's see if this is working perfectly.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.490
This is being installed right here and it is installed.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.540
I'm going to go ahead I'm going to activate to activate this plug in.

01:42.920 --> 01:43.700
OK.

01:43.700 --> 01:44.870
And there we go.

01:44.870 --> 01:45.430
Here we go.

01:45.430 --> 01:46.910
You can see it is coming right here.

01:46.910 --> 01:49.010
I'm going to go to the press right here.

01:49.030 --> 01:50.910
I want to go to the settings right here.

01:50.960 --> 01:51.750
I want to add some.

01:51.860 --> 01:56.550
So it says erase fake or data delete the call never bothered me.

01:56.550 --> 02:01.860
I have to raise all the data just generate it just type let it go.

02:02.320 --> 02:02.790
OK.

02:02.840 --> 02:07.310
And IP is setting up an API for an optional application can you make key

02:10.340 --> 02:11.920
will not respect.

02:12.050 --> 02:19.060
Ok so I want to go to Ray here to get the API setting up 5000 API.

02:19.310 --> 02:21.050
Connection is fully optional.

02:21.050 --> 02:24.220
So it is fully optional but if you want it you can add that.

02:24.230 --> 02:25.890
So what is it.

02:26.030 --> 02:28.350
It will grab some images.

02:28.370 --> 02:29.470
OK.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.550
It will crap's and images and add that.

02:31.550 --> 02:34.370
So this is basically a marketplace.

02:34.400 --> 02:40.760
This is alternatve to splash dot com if you want to add images as well and you need to add these API

02:40.760 --> 02:41.300
as well.

02:41.300 --> 02:43.800
So let me show you how the featured image works first.

02:43.910 --> 02:44.260
OK.

02:44.330 --> 02:50.190
And then we will be adding that.

02:50.220 --> 02:53.760
So let me show you how the featured image is works on the post.

02:53.790 --> 02:55.650
Let's go to the polls right here.

02:55.650 --> 02:57.610
And that led to ads and featured images.

02:57.660 --> 03:00.810
I'm going to go to this one.

03:00.910 --> 03:03.340
Dell releases a new core 7.

03:03.610 --> 03:07.690
OK so I'm going to open this up.

03:07.840 --> 03:08.590
OK.

03:08.780 --> 03:10.560
I'm going to hit view.

03:10.580 --> 03:11.120
OK.

03:11.150 --> 03:13.360
And you can see that this is a normal post.

03:13.370 --> 03:14.630
We don't have any image right here.

03:14.630 --> 03:15.290
I'm going to hint at it.

03:15.290 --> 03:19.770
Post and we're going to add a featured image right here.

03:21.750 --> 03:22.470
Right here.

03:22.470 --> 03:23.020
OK.

03:23.100 --> 03:29.190
So we're going to get an image from Splash dot com or let's add that the normal image that we have in

03:29.190 --> 03:30.020
the gallery.

03:30.060 --> 03:34.840
I'm going to go to the media library and you can see no way found.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.560
OK we want to upload a file.

03:36.570 --> 03:38.450
I'm going to go to the desk so pray here.

03:38.460 --> 03:41.870
And I want to get to this one.

03:41.910 --> 03:44.260
So this is also the normal laptop.

03:44.490 --> 03:49.090
I'm going to hit set featured image right now and you can see that this should be added.

03:49.110 --> 03:52.330
So I'm going to hit a day trade now and I'm going to view my post now.

03:52.350 --> 03:54.230
So let's see how this is gonna look.

03:57.420 --> 03:57.830
There we go.

03:57.830 --> 04:04.350
You can see that this is the featured image that we have right here is coming like this so you can basically

04:04.350 --> 04:09.280
completely ended this whole debate with the elementary.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.570
If you want Lewisville I'm going to show you later on.

04:11.730 --> 04:16.500
And if I also go to the Dell right here you can see this is coming like this.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.350
Dell releases a new core a seven laptop.

04:19.350 --> 04:21.100
And here is everything.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.140
And then here it takes.

04:22.140 --> 04:28.700
Continue reading so this is by me and then it is December 9 and then it says that Dell's flash laptops

04:28.710 --> 04:29.780
into a comment.

04:29.790 --> 04:31.740
So this is how the featured images work.

04:31.800 --> 04:38.880
And I would highly recommend you to add featured images because the featured images works a lot in your

04:38.880 --> 04:39.540
blog post.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.110
OK.

04:40.110 --> 04:45.330
To make sure that you add feature to mate for every of your blog posts you will understand later on

04:45.780 --> 04:47.760
why they are so important.

04:47.760 --> 04:54.170
OK so we basically want to create an account here just to get these images.

04:54.180 --> 04:55.530
OK.

04:56.190 --> 05:00.340
Setting up 500 peaks API connection is fully optional.

05:00.570 --> 05:01.680
OK.

05:02.370 --> 05:02.830
OK.

05:02.850 --> 05:07.320
I'm going to come here and I'm going to go to continue with Google.

05:07.620 --> 05:10.950
Let's come here and I want to continue with Google.

05:10.950 --> 05:16.880
So I'm going to select my account allow.

05:17.960 --> 05:18.960
And here we go.

05:19.070 --> 05:21.200
You can see it's going to take me in.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.040
And here it is.

05:22.040 --> 05:22.530
Got it.

05:22.580 --> 05:27.280
I create the idea for an app and it says for just for your application.

05:27.290 --> 05:28.040
So what I want to do.

05:28.040 --> 05:31.460
I'm just going to come here and tease the application name and everything.

05:31.460 --> 05:34.900
So I'm going to go ahead and this is going to be my site name.

05:34.940 --> 05:41.650
So this is basically s2 s2 s2 complete P of course.

05:41.780 --> 05:42.150
OK.

05:42.260 --> 05:51.600
And the description I have my test site application you are Rael is this.

05:51.660 --> 05:58.980
So I'm going to copy this this whole you are real and I'm going to paste it call back or L should be

05:58.980 --> 06:04.660
this OK javascript SDK supported you are real.

06:04.790 --> 06:05.000
OK.

06:05.010 --> 06:06.830
Just do this.

06:06.830 --> 06:07.180
OK.

06:07.190 --> 06:09.330
And we have support all developers e-mails.

06:09.350 --> 06:14.240
We can have the developers e-mail and I'm going to have to accept and I'm going to hit rich right now.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.140
So here is this.

06:16.610 --> 06:17.400
OK.

06:17.810 --> 06:19.830
You can see this is coming right here.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.400
I am going to.

06:21.440 --> 06:22.640
This is my.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.160
Basically the API.

06:24.410 --> 06:30.290
So I want to go to I want to find the API C application details here we have the consumer key consumer

06:30.320 --> 06:31.410
create and everything.

06:31.580 --> 06:41.180
I'm going to grab this consumer akey copy and come here and paste and let it take any I can see that

06:41.180 --> 06:42.890
this has been saved right here.

06:42.890 --> 06:46.560
So Abdy did five great pics consumer application settings.

06:46.670 --> 06:49.580
I'm going to go to this right here in the users.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.540
And here we have the user.

06:51.590 --> 06:55.860
So Metta field rules and we have the Qanta D.

06:55.960 --> 07:03.170
How many users should be generated use both fields to set to get a randomized number of users when given

07:03.170 --> 07:03.650
a range.

07:03.680 --> 07:08.910
So you can choose three to 12 or 5 to 16 users.

07:08.960 --> 07:16.160
We need this users to be generated use HDMI on your randomise user description and rules so rules would

07:16.160 --> 07:21.030
be Autor OK sampling rules to be liked.

07:21.140 --> 07:26.000
Metafile rules select a field type and this is going to be.

07:26.420 --> 07:30.190
So I don't think so if we want to add some users to here.

07:30.380 --> 07:31.800
We just wanted to post only.

07:31.930 --> 07:32.210
OK.

07:32.330 --> 07:34.780
So let's go to the post and let's grab some post.

07:34.790 --> 07:45.780
So I think I want the balls to be like 50 post two hundred fifty two hundred post should be generated.

07:45.800 --> 07:46.130
OK.

07:46.130 --> 07:51.000
And the date should be this week.

07:52.370 --> 07:53.110
OK.

07:53.260 --> 07:54.790
We can also use this either.

07:54.820 --> 07:57.430
So date date would be generated from this to this.

07:57.450 --> 08:04.480
The post would be post the period would be this the common status was with this image provider can be

08:04.480 --> 08:07.530
placeholder and splashed out.

08:07.680 --> 08:12.090
Lauren pixel and five hundred pixel that we have added our account right here.

08:12.140 --> 08:14.320
OK so image will be added from this.

08:14.540 --> 08:15.140
Okay.

08:15.190 --> 08:21.350
And then we have the author right here so all Tourville be this the only user that I am right here.

08:21.590 --> 08:24.150
OK here's some itching in my notes.

08:24.160 --> 08:24.870
I don't know why.

08:24.940 --> 08:31.790
So it might be so you know I'm confusing to you and you it might be so irritating as well.

08:31.930 --> 08:33.370
So I'm sorry for that.

08:33.850 --> 08:39.350
OK let's come here and we have the taxonomies tags and categories which terms can be used.

08:39.490 --> 08:50.980
OK so we have the category and right we have our computers we have the category HTC and we have these.

08:50.990 --> 08:57.770
So I think these can be used in the categories section.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.540
So these categories will be automatically assigned.

09:00.740 --> 09:05.630
And so you'll see how this how this plug in is going to work.

09:05.630 --> 09:08.090
Basically you guys are going to love it totally.

09:08.110 --> 09:11.140
OK.

09:11.460 --> 09:13.990
I'm just going to grab all the categories.

09:19.900 --> 09:20.990
Category Del.

09:21.190 --> 09:26.520
And the last one is the category windows so that we have the rate pression days rate of post that will

09:26.530 --> 09:31.630
have the terms generated for mobile so 85 that we have for how many terms will be selected from 1 to

09:31.630 --> 09:32.200
4.

09:32.230 --> 09:36.800
So maximum I think two categories can be selected.

09:36.910 --> 09:37.380
OK.

09:37.390 --> 09:38.410
Or let's go for it three

09:41.390 --> 09:48.710
that we have the metafile rules attachment would be thumbnail ID an attachment can be formed placeholder

09:48.740 --> 09:55.550
and splash Lauren pixel 500 pixel and then we have the pixels so if you need some pixel of your thing

09:55.550 --> 09:56.980
that you can also generate it.

09:56.990 --> 09:59.940
But I don't think I want it to be.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.450
I want you to leave it as default.

10:02.450 --> 10:04.150
I'm going to come here and I'm going to generate generator.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.390
It's going to generate all these posts.

10:06.410 --> 10:10.320
You can see this is coming right here and it's going to generate it.

10:10.520 --> 10:15.810
Since we are generating so many posts right here you can see 50 to 100 posts.

10:15.890 --> 10:18.850
This is going to take some time I think.

10:18.860 --> 10:20.560
Maybe an hour.

10:20.690 --> 10:23.750
Or maybe just it would take not much time.

10:23.750 --> 10:27.120
So I'm just pausing the video and when it is done I'll be back.

10:28.930 --> 10:34.050
So it is showing me an error and this is saying get big time out OK because we have selected that 60

10:34.050 --> 10:37.760
Minutes or sorry 60 seconds can be the max.

10:37.760 --> 10:42.250
So let's see how many post this plugin has generated.

10:42.940 --> 10:43.700
OK.

10:43.740 --> 10:45.520
It has generated so many.

10:45.660 --> 10:47.490
We have 17 post-trade here.

10:47.490 --> 10:47.870
OK.

10:48.060 --> 10:51.360
Let's just come here again and let's just choose this to be

10:54.700 --> 10:57.700
five from 5 to

11:04.220 --> 11:09.060
from 10 Why you asking me like this.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.010
OK let me rephrase this.

11:11.020 --> 11:11.480
OK.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.510
I want to come here.

11:12.570 --> 11:21.120
I want it to be five to so let's create these post.

11:21.260 --> 11:23.040
OK.

11:23.540 --> 11:25.170
I want to come here and I want to head chattery.

11:25.250 --> 11:28.750
So it is generating we need so many right here.

11:28.820 --> 11:29.290
OK.

11:29.450 --> 11:31.630
So when this is generated I'll be back

11:54.440 --> 11:54.890
OK.

11:54.890 --> 11:55.460
There we go.

11:55.470 --> 11:57.000
It's vague so many.

11:57.140 --> 12:01.280
I'm just going to I'm here I'm going to have this again because I want so many post-trade here

12:05.420 --> 12:07.350
OK let's wait.

12:07.630 --> 12:08.420
And there we go.

12:08.650 --> 12:11.570
So we also need some comments as well.

12:11.650 --> 12:18.000
So I'm just going to come here and type these default post-time should be posed to Qanta should be five

12:18.010 --> 12:19.690
to 15.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.640
So don't use a very large number OK.

12:22.660 --> 12:25.240
Otherwise it's going to take some time and something like that.

12:25.750 --> 12:30.390
That we have select a field types so let's use this to be the default one.

12:30.760 --> 12:31.210
OK.

12:31.330 --> 12:36.950
Let me just come here and say is generate.

12:37.490 --> 12:41.450
OK I want to come here I want to refresh this page Okay.

12:41.590 --> 12:45.870
And then we have this way here I want to get in here and I want to generate.

12:45.940 --> 12:48.130
So we also need some

12:51.420 --> 12:54.320
5 to 15 comments.

12:54.490 --> 12:55.000
OK.

12:55.230 --> 13:00.170
I'm going to generate right now and these comments should be generated so it has generated these comments.

13:00.210 --> 13:03.540
It generated more let's generate let's say generate.

13:03.540 --> 13:06.260
So we need some more commentary here.

13:10.340 --> 13:13.580
And it has generated some commentary here.

13:13.910 --> 13:17.390
Let's go to comments and let's see if the Commons has been generated.

13:17.440 --> 13:18.860
OK this is going good.

13:20.960 --> 13:21.640
Cool.

13:21.650 --> 13:26.900
Now let's go to few web site and let's have a look at our plot books.

13:27.060 --> 13:27.290
OK.

13:27.300 --> 13:29.850
I want to go to slash all post

13:33.340 --> 13:34.620
vego.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.820
We have this this this this this.

13:37.920 --> 13:40.630
So we have some images coming right here.

13:40.980 --> 13:42.000
Some not.

13:42.020 --> 13:44.510
Not every post has these images.

13:44.580 --> 13:45.280
I don't know why.

13:45.690 --> 13:46.950
But bozo has it.

13:51.400 --> 14:01.940
OK that school case and I can see this is how our blog post is looking OK I want to go to the dashboard

14:01.940 --> 14:03.230
right here.

14:04.590 --> 14:14.660
I want to go to the all post and I want the post to be added that featured image.

14:14.700 --> 14:15.160
OK.

14:15.210 --> 14:16.330
Just leave that.

14:16.410 --> 14:20.940
So what I want to do I just basically want to edit our home page.

14:21.000 --> 14:21.350
OK.

14:21.390 --> 14:27.690
And now you can see that are all post high is showing all the post-up we have on a blog page.

14:27.690 --> 14:33.300
So if a company tells you that we need that they need their blog page to be there.

14:33.300 --> 14:35.640
Then you need to create something like this.

14:35.640 --> 14:36.130
OK.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.020
You need to create it.

14:37.020 --> 14:39.300
Basically you can see this is how it is looking.

14:39.300 --> 14:44.760
This is what is coming we have continue reading we have this we have this and every post is coming right

14:44.790 --> 14:45.410
here.

14:45.450 --> 14:49.500
If I just go to the new page 2 you can see how this is coming

14:53.600 --> 14:54.220
OK.

14:54.420 --> 15:00.510
If I just open this up you can see this is coming like this.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.990
So we have you might also like and this is under the computers category.

15:06.520 --> 15:07.870
So this is how it is looking.

15:08.230 --> 15:08.890
OK.

15:08.920 --> 15:12.260
I want to go to a plug right here again.

15:12.760 --> 15:13.570
OK.

15:13.570 --> 15:18.400
And we basically want to just work with it.

15:18.520 --> 15:22.270
So I don't think so if this is this plug in is working great.

15:22.270 --> 15:26.890
I don't know why it because this plugin did not added the featured images to all the things.

15:26.920 --> 15:30.980
So what I want to do I just want to go to the fake press.

15:31.000 --> 15:37.690
I want to go to the settings right here and I want to just let it go to raise all generated type let

15:39.450 --> 15:42.070
it go.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.080
Exclamation mark.

15:43.260 --> 15:47.860
Let's delete and delete all the content because I think I'll just wait for some time.

15:47.870 --> 15:52.970
I'll pause my video and I'll just add these to get my own featured images so that you may understand

15:53.090 --> 15:55.070
everything easily.

15:55.100 --> 16:00.320
Ok so now what I'm going to do I'm just going to pause my video right now and I'm going to add these

16:00.320 --> 16:00.580
balls.

16:00.590 --> 16:06.200
You can see that all the post must be deleted now that be added using that plug in I can see.

16:06.290 --> 16:06.870
Oh my God.

16:06.950 --> 16:09.460
Every post is deleted now so.

16:09.910 --> 16:10.960
OK no problem.

16:11.090 --> 16:13.190
OK so we have to do everything from scratch.

16:13.400 --> 16:13.700
OK.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.110
These are created.

16:15.110 --> 16:16.450
These are not so easy to tango.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.050
Well guess you have to do everything from scratch.

16:18.050 --> 16:20.200
I'll just post every post.

16:20.210 --> 16:20.560
OK.

16:20.570 --> 16:24.570
And it featured image just because featured images are really very important.

16:24.710 --> 16:25.070
OK.

16:25.070 --> 16:31.010
And the design is based on the images so that is why I think we need to feature images out post every

16:31.010 --> 16:36.350
post with the featured images and then we will be working up at that designing the blog based on how

16:36.560 --> 16:38.780
can we design the blog page.

16:38.780 --> 16:43.620
Basically now it would be very easier for you to understand that how blog page works OK.

16:43.820 --> 16:46.110
But we will be working over that design in the next video.

16:46.160 --> 16:50.500
So Stadion guys and in the next video I'll just be adding samples and then we'll be working up for that

16:50.800 --> 16:51.120
goodbye.
