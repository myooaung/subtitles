OK.

00:07.140 --> 00:09.800
So this is a team that we will be using right now.

00:09.800 --> 00:14.580
OK we first have to understand that how basically e-commerce works.

00:14.610 --> 00:15.010
OK.

00:15.060 --> 00:19.880
And then when people understand each and everything then we will move that design.

00:19.920 --> 00:20.330
OK.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.930
So do not Google it right now.

00:21.930 --> 00:22.690

00:22.830 --> 00:24.970
We will be moving on the plug in.

So let's just go ahead let's just head dashboard and you can see that we are here.

00:43.380 --> 00:46.740
The first thing that we have to do is that we need to install the plug in.

00:46.740 --> 00:48.890
So let's just go ahead and lotted add new.

00:49.020 --> 00:51.350
And you can see that here we have the plug ins right here.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.080
But before adding the plug ins.

00:53.100 --> 00:58.050
Let's just go to the permalink Ray here and let's set up permalink because this is the most important

00:58.050 --> 00:59.930
thing that we have to do always.

00:59.930 --> 01:00.430
OK.

01:00.570 --> 01:04.350
You have to hit post name right now and then you have to hit save changes and you can see that we're

01:04.350 --> 01:05.040
done.

01:05.040 --> 01:13.250
So let's just go to this right here and let's search for popular plugins so popular a thing that here

01:13.260 --> 01:14.200
should be that plug in.

01:14.200 --> 01:14.900

01:14.910 --> 01:18.930

OK so this is by WordPress itself.

01:27.990 --> 01:28.600

01:28.650 --> 01:35.730
The automatic company is basically a forward press OK if you just go to Automattic and then you can

01:35.730 --> 01:41.760
see that this is coming as the owner as automatic So if you just go to WordPress dot com This is owned

01:41.760 --> 01:43.410
by automatic.

01:43.410 --> 01:43.920
OK.

01:43.980 --> 01:48.870

02:08.540 --> 02:09.680
Right now I just site.

02:09.750 --> 02:12.200
OK so you can see this is the company behind that.

02:12.200 --> 02:20.600
OK this plug in and this whole WordPress but this WordPress dot org is basically an open source project

02:20.610 --> 02:21.200
nonprofit.

02:21.200 --> 02:21.710

02:54.650 --> 02:57.480
So let's just go ahead and let's just clear this OK.

02:57.600 --> 03:02.090
I'm going to go ahead I'm going to select my store base so you have to select your own country.

03:02.240 --> 03:08.060
Since I have so many students from United States I think I can also go with the United States as well.

03:08.060 --> 03:10.010
So I'm just going to be using United States

03:12.770 --> 03:14.700

03:14.850 --> 03:22.550
I'm going to choose my own country this way here I'm going to add the address I'm going to add the city

03:30.170 --> 03:31.290
You can so I did it.

03:31.310 --> 03:41.070

03:41.370 --> 03:42.670
Dollar way.

03:42.830 --> 03:43.760
It is not right here.

03:43.770 --> 03:46.400
I'm going to search the United States.

03:46.820 --> 03:48.830
OK here we have the United States dollar.

03:48.830 --> 03:50.190
I'm going to select this one.

03:50.190 --> 03:52.710
And what type of product do you want to sell.

03:52.710 --> 03:58.590
It is asking so you can sell physical and digital products so let's just discuss the what is a physical

03:58.620 --> 04:02.450
and digital physical Our products are those that needs to be shipped.

04:02.540 --> 04:09.020
OK so let's suppose that it just I ordered the iPhone case in the premise video.

04:09.070 --> 04:11.300
OK that was the physical product.

04:11.340 --> 04:16.830
And if I just protégées anything online for I like a software or anything.

04:16.830 --> 04:17.630
OK.

04:17.670 --> 04:24.230
Or if I want to buy an image like here from ebay OK if I want to protégées their membership.

04:24.270 --> 04:25.650
This is called a digital.

04:25.770 --> 04:27.760
OK so they cannot be shared.

04:27.770 --> 04:28.000
OK.

04:28.020 --> 04:29.090
But they can be bought.

04:29.100 --> 04:31.240
So you can just call it like this.

04:31.250 --> 04:32.670
OK.

04:32.850 --> 04:36.540
So let's just come here and I plan to sell both.

04:36.560 --> 04:41.370
And then just also you can select for physical and digital I plan to sell but just make sure to select

04:41.370 --> 04:41.460

05:11.250 --> 05:16.040
So let's just continue right now and then we have the shipping Tabaret here.

05:16.140 --> 05:23.680
So we have the shipping zone that in Pakistan we can just add the shipping charges so for.

05:23.720 --> 05:30.430
But in Pakistan I will charge $10 an hour or in anywhere around the world I will charge $50.

05:30.450 --> 05:30.930
OK.

05:30.990 --> 05:32.610
So this is what they mean.

05:32.730 --> 05:33.220
OK.

05:33.270 --> 05:35.670
So we will be discussing later on.

05:46.500 --> 05:47.600
So leave it as it is.

05:47.670 --> 05:50.210
We will be discussing each and everything in depth.

05:50.270 --> 05:50.720
OK.

05:50.790 --> 05:56.060
So now it is saying recommended extras your team is not compatible with commerce.

05:56.130 --> 06:01.950
We recommend you to switch to a storefront a free were pristine built and maintained by the makers of

06:02.130 --> 06:02.610

Because you will be creating a Commerce website on this team.

06:13.860 --> 06:20.430
So let's just it continue and you can see this team should be automatically installed on our site pay

06:20.550 --> 06:21.600
and then we have the jet pack.

06:21.600 --> 06:26.520

06:50.490 --> 06:54.360
OK so this team is specially designed for e-commerce based Web site.

06:54.360 --> 06:59.580
You can see that we have a shopping cart trade here and then we have the card page check out page my

06:59.580 --> 07:05.310

07:49.500 --> 07:55.950
So this is a showing that create a home page using your friend's home page ad example products so you

07:55.950 --> 08:02.680

OK so let's just go ahead and let's add this OK so we can see that it should be added.

08:29.980 --> 08:35.140
It's going to take some time because it is adding some products and it is also setting up the home page.

08:35.220 --> 08:38.390
So when it is done you have to see how it's going to look.

08:40.710 --> 08:44.930

10:00.540 --> 10:02.310
But we did not publish.

10:02.310 --> 10:05.370
OK that is why the dummy content is not added yet.

10:05.490 --> 10:09.660
And if we go to the products you're here you can see two times has been added.

10:09.780 --> 10:15.270
