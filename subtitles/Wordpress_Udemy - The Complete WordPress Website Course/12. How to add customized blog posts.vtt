00:00.750 --> 00:02.100
What is it guys and welcome back.

00:02.100 --> 00:08.880
So in this video we're going to be adding a new post and that would be our elementary base.

00:08.880 --> 00:13.170
OK what I'm going to do I'm just going to bring them out here and then I'm going to hit Posa that it's

00:13.170 --> 00:16.500
going to take me to the new window that will be at new post here.

00:16.530 --> 00:16.950
I'm going to do.

00:16.950 --> 00:18.800
I'm just going to enter the post-Idol.

00:18.960 --> 00:22.140
So the poorest title that I'm going to be entering would be

00:26.820 --> 00:38.860
US has some bugs that need to be fixed.

00:39.240 --> 00:39.970
OK.

00:40.600 --> 00:41.170
There we go.

00:41.290 --> 00:47.170
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to select iOS and then here I can add any of the tags if I

00:47.170 --> 00:47.590
want to.

00:47.590 --> 00:52.580
So I'd be just adding a U.S. box.

00:52.850 --> 00:54.160
Apple.

00:54.430 --> 00:54.830
OK.

00:54.930 --> 00:57.770
I'm going to hit enter and you can see these tags are right here.

00:57.810 --> 01:03.450
I'm just going to go to the content and the content is going to be 100 percent full width and margins

01:03.540 --> 01:04.850
should be disabled.

01:04.860 --> 01:09.380
I'm going to go to the title right here and the title should be disabled as well.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.030
OK.

01:10.230 --> 01:15.140
And then I can also go to OK.

01:15.270 --> 01:21.060
Yes so you can pretty much all of the customization from here shard chord before tab bar and you can

01:21.060 --> 01:22.470
go with the header as well.

01:22.560 --> 01:26.710
You can also go with the menu title of footer and the post section.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.520
OK so you can move on to this.

01:28.540 --> 01:30.790
OK what I'm going to do I'm just going to go ahead.

01:30.810 --> 01:32.870
I just basically need a featured image.

01:33.140 --> 01:33.630
OK.

01:33.690 --> 01:40.110
So my feature to me is going to be this image right here and it's going to set feature to me so you

01:40.110 --> 01:41.990
can see what I'm going to do right now.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.640
I'm just going to hit publish and let our page.

01:44.640 --> 01:50.860
So on viewing this page you will see that here would be an image that I don't want to add.

01:50.910 --> 01:52.950
So you can see this image is pretty big.

01:53.070 --> 01:54.500
And I don't want this to be added.

01:54.510 --> 01:56.950
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to go to the customized right here.

01:56.970 --> 02:02.010
And I wanted to remove the featured image section from these posts because if you want to show these

02:02.010 --> 02:07.750
feature images you can show them if you do not want to show them because we want to add this.

02:07.890 --> 02:13.950
We basically want to add these featured images and we just basically want to remove this from the feature

02:13.950 --> 02:14.590
section.

02:14.610 --> 02:16.320
There should be no images.

02:16.650 --> 02:17.090
OK.

02:17.240 --> 02:24.840
So so here you have to come here and then you hear what you have to do you need to go to the log section

02:24.930 --> 02:27.870
and then you have to go to the single post right here.

02:27.960 --> 02:28.860
Here you can manage it.

02:28.860 --> 02:30.360
So basically evil.

02:30.380 --> 02:35.100
Remove the featured images and from this section right here I'm just going to click this and you can

02:35.100 --> 02:41.140
see that this feature that image will be removed from all the post that we will publish.

02:41.250 --> 02:43.130
K. You can see this.

02:43.170 --> 02:44.790
This is how it is working.

02:44.850 --> 02:49.860
If you don't want that you just click here and then you will publish it and you will see that the featured

02:49.860 --> 02:52.260
image will be still coming right here.

02:52.260 --> 02:56.790
What I'm going to do I'm just going to click edited elementary and you will see that it will take me

02:56.790 --> 03:04.500
to an elementary page and then here you go you can see this is how it is coming we have the title right

03:04.500 --> 03:05.140
here.

03:05.220 --> 03:08.710
We have this right here and then here we can add anything.

03:08.850 --> 03:12.090
So you have to focus on only one thing either.

03:12.180 --> 03:18.090
You want everything to be added or if you want to end with everything from scratch totally scratch then

03:18.090 --> 03:23.640
you have to focus on that what you have to do you have to just come here and then you have to add everything

03:23.640 --> 03:28.160
from here or you have a new option if you just remove the stuff.

03:28.290 --> 03:34.690
OK what is going to happen is that it will be applied to all the block post-edit you have.

03:34.710 --> 03:39.420
So if you don't want to apply it to all the blog posts what you have to do you have to just click this

03:39.420 --> 03:41.480
and then you have to hit go to dashboard.

03:41.650 --> 03:42.000
OK.

03:42.060 --> 03:49.210
And then you have to go down Ritchies the template you have to select elementary canvas.

03:49.380 --> 03:49.780
OK.

03:49.860 --> 03:56.050
You have to just update and then you have to hit it with elementary

04:00.140 --> 04:06.420
so one here would be a total blank screen where you have to do everything from scratch.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.060
You can add pretty well everything.

04:08.200 --> 04:08.630
OK.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.270
Let's see if we have a better

04:24.070 --> 04:29.720
You can select it to the left and you can see here if I just apply it it's going to appear right here.

04:30.040 --> 04:30.460
OK.

04:30.580 --> 04:38.920
You can also go with the custom custom header navigation you can just bring a tray here and then here

OK.

07:31.800 --> 07:32.130
OK.

07:32.130 --> 07:41.430
I think I missed that so I'm going to go above right here and because elements are used to give us the

07:41.430 --> 07:42.420
blog thing.

07:42.450 --> 07:47.550
The block template they used to have that but I don't know I cannot see it.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.780
Basically I think

07:52.270 --> 07:54.360
OK so they don't have it.

07:54.820 --> 07:55.720
So what I'm going to do.

I'm just going to design it myself.

07:57.340 --> 08:00.000

08:00.040 --> 08:03.700
So I'm just going to grab this tray here and want a feature tomato.

08:03.710 --> 08:06.800

08:06.880 --> 08:08.320
I want to add the titles.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.130

I want to go to the style I want to go to if a bag grown so a back room is going to be an image OK.

08:18.040 --> 08:22.030
I want to add that image this image because we have used that image as a feature to image.

08:22.120 --> 08:28.440
So this image attachment should be three.

08:28.470 --> 08:31.550
The attachment should be fixed and the size should be covered.

08:31.640 --> 08:36.950
So I'm going to go to this whole section right here and I want to go to the layout and I want to go

08:36.950 --> 08:41.550
to height so my height should be minimum height.

08:41.810 --> 08:44.230
OK this is fine.

08:44.240 --> 08:47.970
I'm going to assign a border or a bag from right here.

09:06.590 --> 09:08.970
and wanted to create this white opacity.

09:09.620 --> 09:10.200
