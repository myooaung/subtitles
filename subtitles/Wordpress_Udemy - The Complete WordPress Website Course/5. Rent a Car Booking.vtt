00:00.610 --> 00:05.470
What is up guys and what KMAX are now in this video we'll do working up that booking of the car.

00:05.460 --> 00:12.640
So if you want to run a car booking system like you want to give your car on rends Ford Mukalla hotel

00:12.640 --> 00:16.450
people those who are coming to stay in that he can do that as well.

00:16.630 --> 00:20.030
So what you have to do you have to just come here and then you have to hit add Neal.

00:20.530 --> 00:21.080
OK.

00:21.130 --> 00:24.660
And in here you have to select bookable product.

00:24.670 --> 00:29.810
So now here is the product name is going to be rent a car.

00:30.330 --> 00:30.830
OK.

00:31.090 --> 00:34.480
And here is going to be the product description is going to be the Shard description.

00:34.480 --> 00:35.920
And then here we need the product image.

00:35.920 --> 00:38.260
So product demand is going to be a car image.

00:38.290 --> 00:43.560
I'm going to go to pixelate outcome to just grab an image and then I'm going to upload it.

00:43.570 --> 00:45.820
So I'm just watching the video and I'll do this in a minute.

00:46.700 --> 00:49.580
So this is the car that I have just got this.

00:49.610 --> 00:49.870
OK.

00:49.880 --> 00:50.680
I'm just going to come here.

00:50.680 --> 00:52.990
I'm just going to drag this and it right here.

00:53.120 --> 00:56.140
So this will be uploaded and then I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to had said product image.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.130
I said to the product image and this is a rental car.

00:58.130 --> 00:59.530
So this is the words fool.

00:59.540 --> 01:01.090
It doesn't relate to the person.

01:01.100 --> 01:01.370
OK.

01:01.370 --> 01:06.250
Obviously this will do just to our and we're just hiring a car.

01:06.410 --> 01:13.970
And that is so it has the resources or so for resources it can be like a basic car like if we just have

01:13.970 --> 01:19.120
used Uber then for Uber they have that uber uber go Bre-X beleft or something like that.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.580
So we're taxi as well.

01:20.700 --> 01:26.850
So there's so many thing that you can add in the resources so for resources it can be like to see two

01:26.850 --> 01:32.790
or four seater sports car normal car or something like that so you can charge them.

01:32.800 --> 01:35.660
We will charge them on the basis of the resources basically.

01:35.830 --> 01:36.190
OK.

01:36.350 --> 01:40.130
So I'm going to come here and I'm going to come here to the costs so we will not charge them on the

01:40.130 --> 01:41.230
basis of the cost.

01:41.450 --> 01:41.860
OK.

01:42.050 --> 01:43.770
We will charge them.

01:43.790 --> 01:45.230
OK so fix BLOCK OK.

01:45.230 --> 01:50.810
This should be the customer to find blocks the minimum duration the customer can keep a car for maximum

01:50.810 --> 01:52.720
10 days he can not go beyond that.

01:52.910 --> 01:53.320
OK.

01:53.510 --> 01:58.580
And unable to calendar rage because customer can just so like that from how many days he want.

01:58.610 --> 01:59.180
OK.

01:59.270 --> 02:02.660
And then we have the costs so we don't want to add anything in the cost.

02:02.660 --> 02:03.170
OK.

02:03.230 --> 02:07.670
And then we have to come here to the resources we have to come here to the types so it should be like

02:07.670 --> 02:11.150
car type OK.

02:11.320 --> 02:21.990
And then we want to add the addling resources so it can be like I just said yes and it can be like Toyota.

02:22.630 --> 02:25.830
So you can also add it like car and it can be like Toyota Corolla.

02:25.960 --> 02:33.550
So the person has to just Toyota Corolla Eltis.

02:34.040 --> 02:34.520
OK.

02:34.520 --> 02:37.580
So Elizabeth that this is a single car that we have right now.

02:37.730 --> 02:38.060
OK.

02:38.060 --> 02:43.840
And they're just going to go ahead and we're going to change this to car to the person who has to select

02:43.960 --> 02:47.140
which car he wants so let's suppose that he wants this car.

02:47.170 --> 02:47.530
OK.

02:47.650 --> 02:54.060
And the blah cost is going to be like $50 per day per day.

02:54.280 --> 02:55.370
So this is the cost.

02:55.390 --> 02:57.530
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to add one more resource.

02:57.550 --> 02:59.260
And this is going to be like Honda

03:02.510 --> 03:08.440
measle And here we want to add the block costs to block cost is going to be

03:12.820 --> 03:15.780
$100 and then we have the Facinelli self

03:19.350 --> 03:20.780
Toyota fortune basically.

03:20.850 --> 03:23.710
OK and this is going to be $150.

03:23.760 --> 03:30.210
And the last one we have is the Land Cruiser Okay.

03:30.330 --> 03:35.610
And then here this is going to cost them $250 per block per day.

03:35.610 --> 03:41.010
So let's just go ahead and let's just publish this up so you can see this is the Rent-A-Car system that

03:41.010 --> 03:41.690
we have added.

03:41.820 --> 03:45.930
So you can just create any type of product that daddy didn't and then you can charge them on the basis

03:45.930 --> 03:46.260
of that.

03:46.260 --> 03:51.960
So you can see if I just come here and the guy sees that he needs rent a car and it's a Toyota Corolla

03:52.020 --> 03:55.920
Eltis it's 50 $150 per day.

03:55.920 --> 04:01.170
If he just if he just liked it like Honda weaselled and it's a hundred dollars per day if he likes far

04:01.170 --> 04:06.900
sooner than it's going to cost him like $150 per day and if he likes land cruiser then it's got to cost

04:06.900 --> 04:09.090
him like $250 per day.

04:09.150 --> 04:13.160
So his is going to select 23 and he needed for the maximum.

04:13.160 --> 04:22.230
If you just come here and he did for four then I can see how he takes from 22 to 4 it I feel just like

04:22.230 --> 04:27.400
five and he goes to Turkey one day and see it's faithed to 31.

04:27.420 --> 04:29.520
He did OK.

04:29.640 --> 04:39.150
So this is how just working so now you can see it is this customer duration the maximum allowed duration

04:39.210 --> 04:40.680
the user can invoke.

04:40.710 --> 04:44.250
So duration is basically set to 1 to 10.

04:44.430 --> 04:45.740
But this is going beyond that.

04:45.750 --> 04:50.700
So I mean if he just selected and let me come here you can see it is the maximum duration is set to

04:50.700 --> 04:51.230
10.

04:51.240 --> 04:52.610
This is not working OK.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.960
If I just come here and I just keep it like till 10 I say no this is still 10.

04:57.210 --> 04:58.180
Yes this is selten.

04:58.260 --> 04:58.560
OK.

04:58.680 --> 05:02.520
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten.

05:02.580 --> 05:08.970
Then he can see if I select from 5 to 14 this is available.

05:09.220 --> 05:14.070
But if I just select it from 5 to 15 then it is not available.

05:14.200 --> 05:14.670
OK.

05:14.680 --> 05:19.330
The maximum duration is this and this is how it very soon if I just choose to Eltis to say that this

05:19.330 --> 05:25.840
is not available so we can rent them a car on the basis of maximum that we can not go beyond that.

05:25.840 --> 05:32.600
So if you if you just come here and say let's suppose that we have a Toyota Corolla.

05:32.890 --> 05:39.640
This is like we have three we have four Honda visitable we have one partner and we have one land cruiser.

05:39.850 --> 05:40.770
So we can also make it.

05:40.780 --> 05:42.280
You guys already know how to do that.

05:42.290 --> 05:44.160
OK you have to just come here to the resource.

05:44.320 --> 05:49.010
You have to just come here to the edit resource for a Toyota Corolla Eltis and it's going to come here.

05:49.990 --> 05:56.630
And then you have to select the available quantity so we have this like for Toyota Corolla Eltis.

05:56.860 --> 06:02.530
We don't have a more Toyota Corolla eldest so let's come here and let's come here to Honda Faizal.

06:02.560 --> 06:08.010
So the Honda measle as I suppose that we have just two Honda Maysville.

06:08.140 --> 06:12.790
So we cannot give three on the easel on the same day.

06:12.820 --> 06:15.340
That is why we just have two available Khanda.

06:15.340 --> 06:16.380
So this is how it will work.

06:16.390 --> 06:19.630
If someone buys it and more than that then it will not work.

06:19.630 --> 06:24.040
So if I just come here and I just come to the Land Cruiser and I just open up the edit resource.

06:24.070 --> 06:26.710
So we have just one line cruiser.

06:26.710 --> 06:26.970
Okay.

06:26.980 --> 06:28.530
I just come here and I just set a date.

06:28.660 --> 06:32.320
So make sure that you come here and you just change the available quantity.

06:32.410 --> 06:37.090
And then I come here and then I just refreshed first is ok so lets suppose that a guy come here and

06:37.090 --> 06:38.890
then he buys land cruiser.

06:38.980 --> 06:40.520
So this is $250 per day.

06:40.570 --> 06:43.480
We just go ahead and he buys it from 22 to target.

06:43.650 --> 06:44.030
Okay.

06:44.140 --> 06:46.380
And then he come here and then he just hit back now.

06:46.390 --> 06:47.870
So this is here.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.000
He's just going to go ahead.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.380
Hes just going to go ahead and he is going to a card and then if he is going to pay him he's just going

06:53.380 --> 06:59.110
to pay me the price so I'm just going to his place her and his place right now.

06:59.110 --> 07:05.590
So then if another person comes the same and he wants to buy the car this is the car you just want to

07:05.590 --> 07:06.280
buy the car.

07:06.310 --> 07:07.210
What he will do.

07:07.270 --> 07:08.480
Just come here.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.350
Just select it to be like 31.

07:10.620 --> 07:11.140
Okay.

07:11.190 --> 07:13.160
And then he come here and hes like Land Cruiser.

07:13.210 --> 07:18.910
Then he says that this is not available from this to this because we have just only one single Land

07:18.910 --> 07:20.880
Cruiser and this is already built.

07:20.920 --> 07:26.090
So you hot you can buy it from 31 and onwards and only then it will apply.

07:26.140 --> 07:31.510
So if you just like it from 31 to just like for it then we can charge it.

07:32.050 --> 07:34.720
So this is how these quantity works and you can see that.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.640
Now we have created Lorenda car.

07:36.760 --> 07:44.760
We have created that thing that we say higher than zero ramón and we just created like to call a hotel

07:44.760 --> 07:47.740
so everything is here and everything is possible.

07:47.790 --> 07:53.520
This guy seriously as of this plug in has so many tremendous functionalities that you can add that you

07:53.520 --> 07:54.550
get in fragmented.

07:54.690 --> 07:57.510
I would recommend you to go ahead and just mess with it.

07:57.510 --> 08:00.250
And also just create these type of products.

08:00.270 --> 08:00.780
Okay.

08:01.020 --> 08:06.960
And one more thing that I want to say is that to not allow that what we say

08:10.250 --> 08:10.880
check payments.

08:10.900 --> 08:11.180
Okay.

08:11.180 --> 08:17.390
Only allow the Pay-Pal so that there is direct transfer or this credit card to not allow check payments

08:17.390 --> 08:23.240
guys Im telling you again again and again so I'm just going to come here and I'm going to go ahead and

08:23.240 --> 08:28.990
I'm going to hit check payments and in here make sure that you just select this and then you go ahead

08:29.030 --> 08:30.070
and you hit save.

08:30.070 --> 08:33.470
So there should be only Pay-Pal visible.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.940
OK so I can see that everything is done.

08:36.090 --> 08:39.480
And now here we're totally done with everything.

08:39.540 --> 08:41.390
This is our website.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.370
This is called a booking website.

08:43.410 --> 08:47.930
So now we can basically just go ahead and then we can create it NZL dot com.

08:48.030 --> 08:48.470
OK.

08:48.510 --> 08:54.660
And in here we can implement it so that if anyone does come here and entire me then it should be a form

08:54.660 --> 09:01.470
that should say this is how you want from Rich time you want to hire a say is that from duration and

09:01.470 --> 09:05.840
the date so he can then go ahead in hire me and then it'll work.

09:06.130 --> 09:07.190
So stadium guys.

09:07.290 --> 09:11.040
And now in the next video we'll be working on the designing of the website how can we design this whole

09:11.110 --> 09:14.570
website and so stadium guys and by.
