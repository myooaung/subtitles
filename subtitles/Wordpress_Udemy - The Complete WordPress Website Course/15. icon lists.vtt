So this should be white and this should be blue OK.

04:02.120 --> 04:07.560
And what I want to do right now is that location should be 30 percent.

04:07.640 --> 04:10.520
So it should be on Tuesday.

04:10.540 --> 04:11.810
OK.

04:11.810 --> 04:16.200
Now what I want I want this to be full of it.

04:16.230 --> 04:18.320
So I wanted this to be stretched.

04:18.440 --> 04:18.830

07:27.590 --> 07:31.640
You can see I want to go to the size should be medium

07:37.650 --> 07:39.310
or just the style.

07:39.380 --> 07:43.930
And let's decrease the size to be this much.

07:44.470 --> 07:44.880
OK.

07:45.020 --> 07:47.430
And then we have the whole it so on.

07:47.430 --> 07:51.230
However it should be bop.

07:51.250 --> 07:54.100
So this is just scary a bit.

07:54.430 --> 07:57.070
So I want to go to the Bob

08:00.580 --> 08:00.820
OK.

08:00.820 --> 08:01.960
This is looking good.

08:01.990 --> 08:08.620
This is just basically crabbing that attention that hey I'm floating or I'm just jumping or something

08:08.620 --> 08:08.980
like that.

08:08.980 --> 08:09.470
OK.

08:09.700 --> 08:18.760
And here I want to add the services so for services I want to go to this section and let's see which

08:18.760 --> 08:25.500
type of thing that we can at so I can an icon list I can add toggle and everything I should an icon

08:25.510 --> 08:26.090
list.

08:26.180 --> 08:30.850
I'm just going to drag it and drop a tray here so you can see right here.

08:30.850 --> 08:35.160
I just want to add the items.

08:35.650 --> 08:36.140
OK.

08:36.200 --> 08:40.690
Well you came here to list item and there should be list item number one.

08:40.690 --> 08:43.540
So this should be web design

08:51.880 --> 08:54.500
web design.

08:54.710 --> 08:59.470
And let's just copy copy copy let's just duplicate it.

09:03.450 --> 09:05.030
So everything is duplicated here.

09:05.040 --> 09:05.930
I'm just going to come here.

09:05.940 --> 09:10.960
And here we have this space that we have the center.

09:11.240 --> 09:12.190
So it should be light.

09:12.260 --> 09:20.970
Here we have icon icon colors should be Plack so you can also add the icon as well.

09:21.160 --> 09:21.450
OK.

09:21.490 --> 09:25.690
And then we have the space so we can also increase the size.

09:25.720 --> 09:33.420
So this is how you can also add the icon list but I don't think so if I should add an icon list instead.

09:38.390 --> 09:42.880
I think I need an icon box.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.720
OK icon box might be the better one.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.900
So I need some columns right here.

I want to come here I want to drag the column and I want it from the tray here.

09:55.890 --> 09:56.250
OK.

09:56.380 --> 10:00.440
So I can not drag and drop the column inside a column.

10:00.880 --> 10:01.720
OK.

10:01.750 --> 10:06.280
So what I can do I can manage the icon box

10:39.610 --> 10:45.010
And this should be set to 20 percent and this should be set to this.

10:45.010 --> 10:46.920
So here we have it here.

10:47.580 --> 10:48.370
OK.

10:48.490 --> 10:53.520
What I can do right now I can change the size of the image to be medium.

You can change it completely.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.310
So this has been deleted.

15:52.390 --> 15:53.380
This is coming right here.

15:53.380 --> 15:54.190
Totally.

15:54.250 --> 15:58.940
And you can just come here to edit section and you can make it the full one.

15:59.050 --> 16:00.730
So I'm just going to go to the backroom.

16:01.120 --> 16:04.700
And for the bag groan I wanted this to be full so you can see how this is looking.

16:04.840 --> 16:12.070
And this should be like come here and just unstretched a section of OK and make it the box so you can

16:12.070 --> 16:13.960

16:13.990 --> 16:17.500
So this is also looking professional and that was also looking professional.

16:17.500 --> 16:23.600
So it totally depends upon you that how you want your website to look.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.170
OK.

16:25.330 --> 16:31.360
One more thing that I want to add here is that I want to come here and I want to come here to divider

16:31.960 --> 16:34.010
and dividers should be right here.

16:34.020 --> 16:38.730
She can see that a divider is right here and it should be solid.

16:38.970 --> 16:41.430
Fate should be this.

16:41.500 --> 16:46.630
OK it's color should be let's just continue to divide it again.

16:46.940 --> 16:50.360
It's colors should be white OK.

16:50.720 --> 16:56.320
And I want it's a good one.

16:56.330 --> 16:57.490
It's to be Center.

16:57.500 --> 17:01.490
But first if I just decrees it you can see that from me here it is decreasing.

17:01.490 --> 17:06.140
But if I just align it as Center and then I decrease it then he can see that it is decreasing from both

17:06.140 --> 17:13.590
sides so you can see that it is used to be sickly add a cord to you say you can see that if I just decrease

17:13.640 --> 17:14.300
the gapping

17:17.450 --> 17:21.550
and I just go to the margin and I want to just bring it more to the top.

17:21.620 --> 17:24.620
So I wanted to be the top three here.

17:25.480 --> 17:29.190
So now came here and you can see how this is looking.

17:29.380 --> 17:36.240
I think this what I can do should also be to do white so that it matches it to everything.

17:36.250 --> 17:42.190
So I'm going to come here to this and I want to change this to be quite ok.

17:42.280 --> 17:45.020
Knology so you can see what I can do.

17:45.280 --> 17:45.860

17:45.920 --> 17:49.130
Let's just decrease the size of this a bit.

17:49.130 --> 17:50.120
So it should be

17:55.570 --> 17:57.600
decrease it and this

18:00.300 --> 18:00.810
OK.

18:00.970 --> 18:01.550
