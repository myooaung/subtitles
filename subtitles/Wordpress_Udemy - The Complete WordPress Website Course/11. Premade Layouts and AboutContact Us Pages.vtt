00:20.250 --> 00:25.900
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to come here and here in the Condon's lay out I have to choose

00:25.900 --> 00:31.320
to 100 percent full with I'm going to go to the title right here and I want to disable it.

00:31.740 --> 00:32.340
OK.

00:32.370 --> 00:40.080
I also want to do one thing is to disable the margins yes.

00:40.080 --> 00:40.430

00:40.560 --> 00:49.920
Let's go ahead and let's get a date in the let's go ahead and let's do this page so here you can see

00:49.920 --> 00:52.020
this is our page right now.

00:52.020 --> 00:52.740
What I'm going to do.

00:52.770 --> 00:55.820
I'm just going to come here to edit page again.

00:56.160 --> 01:04.070
And I want to click that element or OK now you can see that I will be taken to the page where I can

01:04.070 --> 01:05.600
manage this page completely.

01:05.840 --> 01:08.200
So let's see how this is going to work.

01:08.330 --> 01:08.840
OK.

01:08.840 --> 01:14.960
Now here instead of adding a new section and doing everything from scratch I think I'm going to be moving

01:14.960 --> 01:22.250
on with add a template how this will work is that I can add any of the template here and then that is

01:22.250 --> 01:22.730
going to work.

01:22.760 --> 01:25.480
OK so I basically need an about template.

01:25.670 --> 01:29.200
OK so let's go ahead let's move with that template.

01:29.240 --> 01:35.000
What I'm going to do I'm just going to go down go down and here I want to see the about templates so

01:36.850 --> 01:44.010
there should be about template so you can see that you can add any of the About page we have about architecture.

01:44.020 --> 01:50.710
We have about a start up we have about personnel and then we have about calory and the up so you can

01:50.800 --> 01:53.280
and these pages right here.

01:53.470 --> 01:54.010
OK.

01:54.010 --> 01:57.260
We have this as well the landing page mobile app.

01:57.340 --> 02:02.830
We have these pages so what I'm going to do I'm just going to be moving up where I think you can also

02:02.830 --> 02:04.900
add the DCV if you want to.

02:05.150 --> 02:09.200
OK I want to go to this guy right here and answer this one.

02:09.220 --> 02:14.510
So are you just clicking this you can see that it is loading and then it will be added right here so

02:14.560 --> 02:17.210
you can see it is pretty well working.

02:17.260 --> 02:20.310
And now what we want to do is that we need to edit this.

02:20.350 --> 02:21.580
So Harveyville just edited.

02:21.580 --> 02:26.470
I'm just going to come here to edit section and I'm going to go to style right here and I want to go

02:26.470 --> 02:32.380
to the Bactrim overlay and I want to choose this to be Plock black and race stuff because we are choosing

02:32.380 --> 02:34.170
this team to be the blacks.

02:34.180 --> 02:35.990
I want to add the black effect.

02:36.010 --> 02:38.680
I'm going to come here and I'm going to use the Plack one.

02:38.800 --> 02:46.130
And we want to choose it to be this black and this should be another black shade.

02:46.390 --> 02:47.890
So there we go.

02:48.000 --> 02:48.390
OK.

02:48.400 --> 02:51.320
You can give a different shade tray here.

02:52.830 --> 02:53.350
OK.

02:53.420 --> 02:54.740
So this is also looking cool.

02:54.740 --> 02:57.240
This is basically the Karelian not the full color.

02:57.440 --> 02:57.900
OK.

02:57.980 --> 03:00.320
You can choose a different color if you want to.

03:00.630 --> 03:01.760
So anything.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.240
This is looking for.

03:03.290 --> 03:03.820
OK.

03:03.830 --> 03:07.820
I want to go down and I want to change this Facebook color to be Plag as well.

03:08.030 --> 03:11.990
I'm going to go to stayaway here and the primary colors are going to be Plock.

03:11.990 --> 03:19.150
I want to go to the content and in the content the content should also be the full block.

03:19.160 --> 03:19.590
OK.

03:19.740 --> 03:24.610
So I'm like this I want to come here I want to go to style right here and see the icon you can see.

03:24.710 --> 03:30.800
I want to change this to be black and this content should also be changed to black because we have to

03:30.800 --> 03:33.440
focus on this.

03:33.560 --> 03:40.060
This team OK because we want to make sure that our theme is black and white focusing on this.

03:40.210 --> 03:40.520
OK.

03:40.520 --> 03:44.210
I also want to change this Facebook OK.

03:44.630 --> 03:45.350
Let's come here.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.840
Let's come here and we want to change this.

03:47.840 --> 03:55.010
Let's change this to YouTube so you can go to Stein right here and you can change this to be black so

03:55.010 --> 03:59.750
you can see that you can pretty well change as you can pretty well edit this whole.

03:59.810 --> 04:05.350
This is basically the pre made lay out which this team gives which this element it gives.

04:05.350 --> 04:05.860
OK.

04:05.900 --> 04:11.230
We have about as we have this divider and then we have this and then we have this our story section

04:11.240 --> 04:12.510
we have today is in everything.

04:12.680 --> 04:14.250
So I'm going to come here right here.

04:14.300 --> 04:15.550
I'm going to go above.

04:15.710 --> 04:17.370
I'm going to click this guy right here.

04:17.390 --> 04:19.960
I want change just to be a block.

04:20.150 --> 04:21.470
I want to change this to be

04:24.780 --> 04:25.760
a bit of gray.

04:27.840 --> 04:28.360
OK.

04:28.390 --> 04:32.920
And I want to change this color this color to be

04:38.640 --> 04:45.960
Blackey color so it should be full black and this should be a bit of gray.

04:46.040 --> 04:46.730
So there we go.

04:46.730 --> 04:48.860
You can see this is what is coming.

04:48.860 --> 04:54.730
And this since this video is totally the same so we cannot edit this.

04:54.740 --> 04:55.280
OK.

04:55.280 --> 05:00.140
I'm just going to come here and let's see if we can just add or change it.

05:00.140 --> 05:03.430
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to go to style right here.

05:03.460 --> 05:05.530
You can see there's the expect ratio.

05:05.720 --> 05:10.430
We have the auto places just videos play a title action so we can add an image overlay.

05:10.430 --> 05:15.650
I think I'm going to come here to image and you can add any of the image overlay if you want to add

05:15.650 --> 05:16.220
any image.

05:16.250 --> 05:16.750
Really.

05:16.850 --> 05:20.690
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to try to add this image overlay instead of there so here

05:20.690 --> 05:22.340
would be the play option.

05:22.340 --> 05:26.350
Ok so I think this image is pretty well matching this color.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.010
OK.

05:27.110 --> 05:32.420
I have the play icon I have the light box as well so you can see this is all this working if I just

05:32.420 --> 05:36.670
click here you can see this is going to pop up and then the light box is coming right here.

05:36.920 --> 05:42.440
OK so now we go down and we have this kind section this is also the black and white and everything is

05:42.440 --> 05:42.780
pretty well.

05:42.780 --> 05:45.440
Now let's have a look at our Web site are about aspirates.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.720
This is our about this page.

05:46.880 --> 05:52.250
We have this right here we have this and we have these services right here that we want to show anything

05:52.520 --> 05:58.220
we can show pretty well anything and you can see this is basically the shape divider that we have if

05:58.220 --> 06:03.430
I just come here and I just go to the style right here and then I go to the shape divider.

06:03.440 --> 06:06.690
Then you can see in the bottom we have the curve and I can change it.

06:06.710 --> 06:08.110
I can change it to anywhere.

06:08.270 --> 06:12.860
I can change it to before I can do it to be like this and I can change it to be I could change it.

06:12.950 --> 06:14.390
I can also move on with the height.

06:14.390 --> 06:18.470
So if I want to make this zero height you can see this is how the height is.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.850
I can bring it above again change it to be invert like.

06:21.860 --> 06:23.600
You can see this is now inverted.

06:23.690 --> 06:28.420
So I'm just going to click here and I can also bring it to front and if I wanted to.

06:28.870 --> 06:29.410
OK.

06:29.470 --> 06:34.740
And then we have these services so we can change these services we can also remove this if we want to.

06:34.790 --> 06:36.690
So you can see if I just remove it you can see this.

06:36.710 --> 06:42.440
Our story is coming right here and I can even bring this to top if I want to bring this little pray

06:42.440 --> 06:43.210
here.

06:43.220 --> 06:44.860
I can just change the margin.

06:44.870 --> 06:46.260
I can decrease the margin.

06:46.370 --> 06:46.620
OK.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.390
Let me choose.

06:47.390 --> 06:55.900
Let me uncheck this and let me bring the margin to the top so you can see this is how the story is coming.

06:56.020 --> 06:59.530
But this is the background color is said to this guy right here.

06:59.530 --> 07:04.360
See if I just clear it up you can see this is how this is coming to Bactrim caller.

07:04.480 --> 07:11.080
So I think I should just bring this down to the normal because this is not looking much cool.

07:11.080 --> 07:15.630
So I'm just going to go to the advanced auction and I'm going to choose zero from here.

07:15.640 --> 07:16.990
So here we go.

07:17.020 --> 07:17.730
Here we go.

07:17.860 --> 07:20.050
And everything looks pretty cool.

07:20.470 --> 07:25.060
So now we're also done vaid are about page.

07:25.060 --> 07:25.540
OK.

10:32.090 --> 10:34.840

10:36.400 --> 10:39.890
And this to be black gets a little OK.

10:39.910 --> 10:45.700
So you have to basically focus on this totally because this is really very important.

10:45.700 --> 10:46.100
