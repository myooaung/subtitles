00:00.450 --> 00:05.960
Hit what is up guys and what KMAX now in this video I'm going to show you how can you install WordPress

00:06.050 --> 00:11.150
on your own computer if you do not basically want to buy a hosting.

00:11.300 --> 00:14.700
And if he did not basically trust the free web hosting.

00:15.490 --> 00:20.500
If you do not want to buy them at hosting then I would highly recommend you to basically go with this

00:20.510 --> 00:22.930
one the local mentored one.

00:22.970 --> 00:25.370
But if you want to go with a free web hosting you can go with that.

00:25.430 --> 00:28.170
But if you do not want to go with that then I will show you.

00:28.190 --> 00:35.430
How can you basically install Wordpress and run it locally on your computer.

00:35.450 --> 00:42.620
So basically when you run computer basically you run WordPress on your own computer and then this is

00:42.620 --> 00:49.700
the question that can you run Wordpress or counting you trons for your whole WordPress website into

00:49.700 --> 00:51.470
the live server later on.

00:51.620 --> 00:53.640
Yes you guys can do that.

00:53.760 --> 00:54.250
OK.

00:54.350 --> 00:58.020
So this is possible so now let's go ahead and let's see how can we work with that.

00:58.020 --> 01:03.820
So let's get started first before we have to basically install a software that is called ZAHM.

01:03.830 --> 01:08.310
It just has to come here and you have to just go to the browser that you are watching.

01:08.330 --> 01:11.150
I would highly recommend you to go with the Chrome browser.

01:11.390 --> 01:14.580
But if you want to go with any of the browser you're totally good to go.

01:14.660 --> 01:16.280
So now you have to just enter this.

01:16.310 --> 01:19.610
You have to enter like Zahm and you have to download it.

01:19.640 --> 01:22.280
So you have to enter like Zahm download.

01:22.460 --> 01:28.460
And this is right here it Apache friends dot org slash downloads so you can either visit this website

01:28.490 --> 01:29.010
as well.

01:29.030 --> 01:30.240
You just have to click this.

01:30.620 --> 01:33.230
And here you can see it's Zahm for Windows.

01:33.290 --> 01:39.590
And here we have this Zahm for Linux and zem for OSX so if you are using Mac you can't install this

01:39.650 --> 01:44.320
if you're using Linux you can't install this or if you're using a Windows you can go with that.

01:44.340 --> 01:49.250
So let's just go ahead and let's install this so I'm just gonna install the latest version that we have

01:49.750 --> 01:53.510
some issue install the latest version that we have already here.

01:53.540 --> 01:55.480
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to install this.

01:55.490 --> 01:59.200
I'm just going to hit download and it says download success so it will just download.

01:59.210 --> 02:03.230
I have to hit download and he can see this is downloading this.

02:03.230 --> 02:09.860
So once this is done downloading I will just open it up and then I'll show you how can you just install

02:09.860 --> 02:11.540
it on your computer.

02:11.540 --> 02:15.410
And how we're going to the word press and how we're going to install it.

02:15.410 --> 02:18.630
So stadium guys and I'm just pausing my video.

02:18.650 --> 02:20.210
So I'll be back when it is done.

02:21.070 --> 02:24.010
And here we go you can see it is already done here.

02:24.010 --> 02:24.780
Here it is.

02:24.790 --> 02:29.030
I'm just going to go out and I'm going to open up this file so you can see this file will be OK.

02:29.260 --> 02:30.160
OK it's easy.

02:30.280 --> 02:33.850
I just have to just click yes I'm running Windows 10 right now.

02:33.850 --> 02:36.010
So if you're using any windows it'll work.

02:36.050 --> 02:39.420
I'll make sure that you are above Windows 7 or Windows 7.

02:39.550 --> 02:40.560
OK.

02:40.570 --> 02:43.550
So you can see the file is being open.

02:43.570 --> 02:44.870
We have to wait for some time.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.860
And this just coming right here.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.770
This is the company that basically owns this I think.

02:50.200 --> 02:53.010
I don't exactly know here it's going to give you an error.

02:53.020 --> 02:55.780
Important because it activated or deactivated.

02:55.870 --> 02:56.800
You just have to ignore it.

02:56.830 --> 02:57.330
OK.

02:57.460 --> 02:58.540
You just have to hit OK.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.090
OK.

02:59.230 --> 03:01.590
And then we have the Volcom to Zahm Veer-Zaara.

03:01.630 --> 03:02.860
OK.

03:02.860 --> 03:07.150
So what you have to do you have to just click next and it's going to take you to the new page.

03:07.180 --> 03:09.160
And here it takes everything.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.930
So make sure that everything is selected.

03:10.990 --> 03:13.270
If you don't want to install anything you can just uncheck it.

03:13.270 --> 03:18.130
But I would recommend you to make sure that everything is like that you just have to just sit next.

03:18.130 --> 03:20.220
And here we have this so here it stays.

03:20.230 --> 03:22.810
Please choose a folder to install zap.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.470
This is a recommended folder not change it.

03:25.480 --> 03:31.080
Guys unless if you do not have much space in your folder then you can go with it.

03:31.090 --> 03:34.230
But since I already have it you can see that I have so much.

03:34.240 --> 03:40.460
I have 87 G-B so I can just go ahead and install it you just need like to Demitri D.B and that's all

03:40.640 --> 03:41.210
OK.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.950
So I'm going to go with it I'm going to hit next.

03:42.970 --> 03:44.830
And this is right here.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.060
I don't want to learn more.

03:46.090 --> 03:51.580
I'm going to uncheck this OK and I'm going to hit next so you can see set up is now ready to being installed.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.490
Is installing Zahm on your computer.

03:53.560 --> 03:57.850
So you're going to go out and I'm going to hit next and you can see this is unpacking files and this

03:57.850 --> 04:00.660
is basically installing the Zahm onto my computer.

04:00.790 --> 04:05.080
And I have to wait for some time till this is done and when this is done I'll be back.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.120
So I'm just spazzing video right now guys.

04:07.420 --> 04:11.510
So guys you can see Amasias completing the zem set of his art.

04:11.530 --> 04:14.280
OK it is do you want to start to see and allow.

04:14.410 --> 04:15.660
Obviously I want to start it.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.410
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to finish.

04:17.470 --> 04:20.460
And you can see it's going to open up a new window.

04:20.890 --> 04:24.320
So it's easy to select the language you can select your language.

04:24.370 --> 04:31.180
I'm just going to select this one OK and I'm going to save so he can see this is right here and it opens

04:31.180 --> 04:35.800
up a control panel that says Zahm control panel version 3.0 2.2.

04:35.890 --> 04:37.440
You might be running the latest version.

04:37.480 --> 04:38.160
OK.

04:38.650 --> 04:44.860
So now what we have to do is that we have to select Apache and the My School we have to just work with

04:44.860 --> 04:45.880
these two.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.430
These two are not necessary.

04:47.440 --> 04:52.710
OK you just have to come here and you have to hit start and you have to start here as well.

04:52.730 --> 04:58.210
He can see this is right here and everything is totally up and running this is running green and this

04:58.210 --> 04:59.580
is running green as well.

04:59.710 --> 05:05.710
So now you can see that if I just come here and I just open this up localhost

05:08.660 --> 05:09.070
OK.

05:09.280 --> 05:10.580
And I just hit enter.

05:10.900 --> 05:15.140
You can see that a new window will be open and it says a Zahm Apache.

05:15.160 --> 05:19.410
Mario DBP HP portal and everything is totally up and running.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.620
This page is coming.

05:20.800 --> 05:27.310
If this is not working properly then you can see this saves port 80 if I just come here and I just said

05:27.310 --> 05:27.830
stop.

05:27.970 --> 05:35.390
And then I just come here and I just basically entered the local host here again you're going see nothing

05:35.390 --> 05:38.240
is opening and it says the site can't be reached.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.150
This is why this is not running.

05:40.190 --> 05:45.920
So if this doesn't run and if this gives an error then what you have to do is that you have to change

05:45.920 --> 05:46.750
your port.

05:46.820 --> 05:48.410
You have to change it.

05:49.250 --> 05:55.400
You just have to open up the file for your zem is installed like in the Vienneau see you have to go

05:55.400 --> 06:02.260
to the zem and then you have to go to Apache and then you have to go to config and then you have to

06:02.260 --> 06:04.270
go to HTP.

06:04.470 --> 06:05.350
Config.

06:05.470 --> 06:07.750
You have to just come here and it stays at it.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.450
So we have to edit it

06:13.190 --> 06:18.190
I can that this would not bet plus plus but I want to show you that how can you edit this vid like note

06:18.270 --> 06:25.330
by itself since mostly people do not have known better blusterous So I'm just going to go down and here

06:25.330 --> 06:25.980
is the No.

06:26.020 --> 06:30.670
I'm just gonna open it up and hearsays it should be open so you can see this is here.

06:32.200 --> 06:36.980
Now what you have to do you have to just press control and then f.

06:37.100 --> 06:41.010
OK and then you have to enter Alison.

06:41.260 --> 06:41.820
OK.

06:41.950 --> 06:44.180
And then you have to hit find next.

06:44.380 --> 06:46.450
So here this is selected.

06:46.480 --> 06:49.780
Now what you have to do you have to close it and then you have to go down.

06:49.780 --> 06:50.920
And here is the lesson.

06:50.950 --> 06:52.420
Dash 80.

06:52.690 --> 06:58.660
You basically have to change the poor name to like anything else so you have to changes like it like

06:58.720 --> 07:00.550
01 or like 5 0.

07:00.550 --> 07:05.850
So if I just come here and I just change it to be like a zero a zero.

07:06.040 --> 07:11.080
OK so let's suppose that I have changed this to a deal a deal because my Zahm was not working.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.590
I had Skype installed or something like that.

07:13.740 --> 07:14.200
OK.

07:14.230 --> 07:19.020
And then I go down and then I also have to search for one more string and that is server name

07:22.150 --> 07:23.920
and this is right here and it's going to close it.

07:23.920 --> 07:27.380
Now I have to go down in here to say server name localhost.

07:27.520 --> 07:30.680
I'm just going to add it like 8 8 8 0 0.

07:30.940 --> 07:34.630
And now I have to go ahead and I'm going to save it someone is going to come here and I'm going to save

07:35.080 --> 07:36.220
this is saved.

07:36.220 --> 07:39.320
I have to come here and I have to restart design.

07:39.340 --> 07:44.310
So I'm just going to come here and let's just stop it and let's just start it again.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.110
So here it is.

07:47.110 --> 07:49.330
You can see this is coming here.

07:49.330 --> 07:53.140
Now what we have to do is that we have to check if this is running.

07:53.140 --> 07:58.140
So now if this doesn't work then you have to check it again and you will see that it's Villard.

07:58.150 --> 08:00.740
So you have to enter like a deal.

08:01.600 --> 08:08.420
And here you can see this is how it is working its localhost Colan 8 0 8 0 slash dashboard.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.120
And this is working totally up.

08:10.180 --> 08:14.230
If you have skype installed on your computer then this vild create a mess.

08:14.470 --> 08:18.630
And if it does not creating a mass then do not worry guys you don't have to change it.

08:18.640 --> 08:23.620
But if you can change it I would recommend you to change this to a detail because it will help you a

08:23.620 --> 08:28.930
lot because in future you might install Skype and usually Skype creates these problem because Skype

08:28.930 --> 08:30.930
has a default port as a detail.

08:30.970 --> 08:33.610
So that is why it just conflict but it does for each other.

08:33.610 --> 08:35.600
But if you just change it to this it is good.

08:35.620 --> 08:42.490
And I can see that we are done still here and now we have to basically work with the installation of

08:42.910 --> 08:47.710
these I'm sorry the word process how we're going to install Wordpress and do it because you can see

08:48.010 --> 08:52.270
it has created a server onto our Web site like it is working as a web site.

08:52.270 --> 08:52.840
OK.

08:52.870 --> 08:55.280
Again as you see everything is totally up and running.

08:55.630 --> 08:59.880
And now I will show you how can you install WordPress in it.

09:00.100 --> 09:02.680
So you can see everything is up and running.

09:02.680 --> 09:04.220
And this is totally OK.

09:04.270 --> 09:08.200
Now let's just go ahead and let's just go to WordPress dot org.

09:08.380 --> 09:11.320
This is where you have to download the Wordpress file.

09:11.320 --> 09:14.180
This will be downloaded and then you have to upload it here.

09:14.260 --> 09:15.560
I'm going to show you how you can do that.

09:15.580 --> 09:18.300
You just have to go ahead you have to hit download Word Press.

09:18.370 --> 09:18.760
OK.

09:18.760 --> 09:19.810
And it should be downloaded.

09:19.810 --> 09:22.340
So here is WordPress four point nine point one.

09:22.360 --> 09:27.660
So once you download it it should be there under your download section or compress.

09:27.670 --> 09:31.100
And here you can see it should be Word Press four point nine point one.

09:31.090 --> 09:34.720
So let's suppose that this is the file that has been downloaded and is going to go out and I'm going

09:34.720 --> 09:36.260
to make it here to the desktop.

09:37.330 --> 09:38.340
So now here it is.

09:38.350 --> 09:42.960
I'm going to open it up and you can see that here should be a folder that says void press.

09:42.970 --> 09:48.730
So what I'm going to do instead of just taking it to installing directly and just going to go ahead

09:48.730 --> 09:50.290
and I'm going to hit extract here.

09:52.840 --> 09:53.250
OK.

09:53.390 --> 09:56.950
This is the file that is being extracted You can see here.

09:56.950 --> 09:59.740
So once this is extracted I'm just gonna open up this file.

10:00.080 --> 10:00.710
OK.

10:00.710 --> 10:01.700
You have to it for something.

10:01.700 --> 10:02.890
You can see this is extracted.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.760
I'm just going to I'm hearing I'm going to open this up.

10:05.180 --> 10:08.410
And now here I have to select all.

10:08.630 --> 10:15.690
And on selecting all this I have to just click add to archive and here I have dyslexic.

10:15.930 --> 10:17.340
And I have to hit OK.

10:17.550 --> 10:20.910
So you can see all these files will basically compressed again.

10:20.910 --> 10:22.210
So you have to extract it.

10:22.290 --> 10:25.280
You have to just open up this folder and then you have to compress it again.

10:25.290 --> 10:26.500
And it takes WordPress.

10:26.570 --> 10:27.080
Zip.

10:27.300 --> 10:27.780
OK.

10:27.960 --> 10:32.910
And now what I have to do I have to open up the Zahm folder where my files are.

10:32.910 --> 10:35.800
So I'm just going to go to the desktop.

10:35.970 --> 10:41.460
I want to go to this PC and I want to go to the files seat and here is the folder.

10:41.460 --> 10:45.900
So in the zom folder you can see that we have each box.

10:45.900 --> 10:49.720
This is basically the root folder on the main folder of our website.

10:49.740 --> 10:50.230
OK.

10:50.340 --> 10:51.750
This is everything.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.720
This is where our file is.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.220
Here you can see field in the Zahm we have this.

10:56.280 --> 11:00.320
If you open up the ventilator AMG and everything is right here.

11:00.590 --> 11:00.980
OK.

11:01.170 --> 11:07.290
So here now I'm going to show you how you can make it so you can basically delete everything from here.

11:07.560 --> 11:07.860
OK.

11:07.860 --> 11:12.180
And then you can install the word press in here in the root folder.

11:12.180 --> 11:16.880
But I would not recommend you I would recommend you to basically create a folder here.

11:16.890 --> 11:20.280
So here you have to just go ahead and you have to create a folder.

11:20.320 --> 11:23.760
This is going to be like I'm WordPress so I'm going to name it as the.

11:24.030 --> 11:25.320
And here it should be here.

11:25.320 --> 11:33.420
So let's just go ahead and let's open the folder up and I am going to just copy this file and I'm going

11:33.420 --> 11:34.020
to drag it there.

11:34.020 --> 11:35.960
So let's just open this up.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.440
Here's a W.P. and let's try it here.

11:38.460 --> 11:40.690
Drop it here so you can see this is right here.

11:40.710 --> 11:44.970
Now what I'm going going to do I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit extract here so you

11:44.970 --> 11:47.470
can see this is being obstructed everything.

11:47.490 --> 11:54.370
Make sure that you go to zap and then each deduct HD talks mean the home page home index stacks or whatever.

11:54.510 --> 11:55.700
But this is the home page.

11:55.740 --> 11:57.630
And then we have a new folder.

11:57.690 --> 11:59.600
This is called the W.P..

11:59.610 --> 12:01.500
Now we have to just delete this file.

12:01.530 --> 12:06.670
This word proton's if we don't need this so I can see WordPress files are here.

12:06.750 --> 12:08.730
You don't have to change anything here.

12:08.730 --> 12:13.260
Guys please keep that in mind because if you change anything here it's going to create a mess.

12:13.380 --> 12:15.430
Ok until and unless you know that development.

12:15.450 --> 12:18.930
So now let's come here and now let's go to our Web site.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.440
You can see we are currently here in the dashboard.

12:21.450 --> 12:27.060
If you just open up the localhost it automatically redirects us to the dashboard.

12:27.090 --> 12:29.550
What does the dashboard.

12:30.360 --> 12:36.000
If I just come here and I just go to Zahm and HD docks then you can see HD docks we have a dashboard

12:36.000 --> 12:41.600
so it is redirecting us to this page basically But we want to go to the gloopy page.

12:41.610 --> 12:46.050
So instead of this I just want to add W.P..

12:46.310 --> 12:46.880
OK.

12:46.920 --> 12:50.840
And I'm going to hit enter so you can see this should be here.

12:51.030 --> 12:56.970
You can see that here I am in this W.P. dash adman's set up dash config and everything and you can see

12:56.970 --> 13:00.150
this press is coming you're inside this.

13:00.150 --> 13:05.640
So what this says is that it says English United States you have to just click continue and you will

13:05.640 --> 13:08.220
be taken to the new page and it says welcome to WordPress.

13:08.220 --> 13:13.530
Before getting started we need some information database you will need to know the following items before

13:13.530 --> 13:14.030
proceeding.

13:14.030 --> 13:19.010
So it says that a name that is used a name that is password and database host.

13:19.070 --> 13:23.510
So what they are a guy is basically it's a database name database user name that have his password and

13:23.510 --> 13:24.920
database host.

13:25.130 --> 13:31.830
This is basically the database you have to create a database how you are going to create it.

13:31.940 --> 13:34.610
You just have to go to localhost.

13:35.030 --> 13:35.680
OK.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.710
And then you have to enter the etch.

13:37.710 --> 13:41.010
P My E D M I N.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.850
And that's going to redirect you to a new page.

13:44.030 --> 13:46.810
OK let's see how this is going to look.

13:47.990 --> 13:48.990
It is not working.

13:50.990 --> 13:53.210
Let's just stop it again and let's start it again.

13:57.290 --> 13:57.850
It is baiting.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.000
It is taking some time.

13:59.840 --> 14:00.610
And I hope it is done.

14:00.620 --> 14:02.000
Let's just come here to refresh

14:05.200 --> 14:06.250
OK.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.220
This is not working.

14:07.240 --> 14:07.390
Yes.

14:07.420 --> 14:08.200
I'm just going to come here.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.590
I'm going to just take stock.

14:09.750 --> 14:13.600
I'm going to stop and I'm going to close it right now and I'm going to open the zem again.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.780
So let's just open the Zomba game OK.

14:16.850 --> 14:18.390
It will create a mess guys.

14:18.460 --> 14:19.360
It will create a mess.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.600
You just have to come here and have to open this up again.

14:21.910 --> 14:26.170
And let's just start and let's start here.

14:31.330 --> 14:32.530
It can see it is running now.

14:32.590 --> 14:34.180
Let's just come here and let's refresh

14:36.950 --> 14:38.230
localhost.

14:38.280 --> 14:38.610
OK.

14:38.620 --> 14:41.140
We have to add one thing you're missing something guys.

14:41.140 --> 14:47.710
We changed the board so we have to add that we have to enter a zero a zero here because we changed the

14:47.710 --> 14:48.170
board.

14:48.220 --> 14:52.650
OK we have to just hit enter and it's going to work then it should void.

14:52.960 --> 14:56.340
I hope fingers crossed.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.030
OK this is working.

14:58.090 --> 15:00.130
You can see this is right here.

15:00.130 --> 15:05.200
The BHB my admin is working and these are the database that out already created.

15:05.340 --> 15:05.790
OK.

15:05.920 --> 15:09.310
So what you have to do you have to just click new here OK.

15:09.460 --> 15:14.710
And it's going to open up a new database database name call Ishan and everything you have to enter a

15:14.710 --> 15:15.330
database name.

15:15.340 --> 15:17.700
So my database name is going to be happy.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.040
OK and I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit.

15:20.230 --> 15:24.270
Create this is my database name OK.

15:24.320 --> 15:27.930
And now what I have to do I don't have to do anything here guys.

15:27.980 --> 15:29.210
You don't have to do anything here.

15:29.210 --> 15:30.530
I just needed a database name.

15:30.530 --> 15:34.710
I just basically wanted to create a database and the database is created.

15:34.730 --> 15:37.210
I don't have to work that I don't have to do anything here.

15:37.310 --> 15:39.980
I just have to come here and then I have to hit let's go.

15:40.360 --> 15:40.850
OK.

15:40.850 --> 15:44.280
So in the database name I just have to enter like gloopy.

15:44.500 --> 15:44.970
OK.

15:45.020 --> 15:47.310
And then the user name I have to enter who.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.660
So this is basically my user name of this.

15:49.740 --> 15:50.580
OK.

15:50.680 --> 15:55.910
Different of the hosting providers set up the user name so when you will be migrating or WordPress website

15:56.300 --> 15:58.790
into a new life server you'll buy the hosting.

15:58.790 --> 16:00.820
I'll show you how can you just migrate it.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.090
And what is the user name there.

16:02.120 --> 16:05.540
So this Zahm user name is basically true.

16:05.690 --> 16:08.470
And the password is nothing you have to keep it empty.

16:08.780 --> 16:14.540
And we have the database host it says localhost and then we have the table prefix So this is W.P. what

16:14.540 --> 16:18.430
we have to do now we have to just hit submit.

16:18.550 --> 16:24.460
And if you have entered the correct information here then it will work if you have entered the wrong

16:24.460 --> 16:25.090
information.

16:25.090 --> 16:25.930
It will give you an error.

16:25.930 --> 16:30.430
So let's suppose that I am entering wrong information I just enter a wrong username and then I just

16:30.430 --> 16:32.530
go out and I just hit submit.

16:32.530 --> 16:36.560
You can see it says you cannot select the database.

16:36.580 --> 16:36.960
OK.

16:37.090 --> 16:40.020
If I just go do go back and then I change it to route.

16:40.210 --> 16:40.680
OK.

16:41.520 --> 16:46.290
And then I just go ahead and I just hit submit cardkey you have made through this part of installation.

16:46.290 --> 16:50.610
WordPress can now communicate with your database you just have to run the installation.

16:50.640 --> 16:55.070
And here it is you can see that here is the information needed.

16:55.070 --> 17:03.240
So I'm just going to go I'm going to enter the information so the site title is going to be how to create

17:03.730 --> 17:06.610
W.P. site.

17:06.630 --> 17:07.780
OK so.

17:07.810 --> 17:09.270
So let's suppose that this is my title.

17:09.420 --> 17:09.940
OK.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.370
And then I'm going to enter the user name.

17:11.380 --> 17:14.290
So my user name is going to be Zele.

17:14.350 --> 17:15.610
Now I have to enter the password.

17:15.610 --> 17:18.220
I'm just going to hide it and then I'm going to enter the password.

17:18.730 --> 17:23.770
