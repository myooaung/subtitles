01:44.030 --> 01:46.480
I really just selected an end here.

01:46.490 --> 01:51.350
I just want to include the farm table no Schwall fields no

02:06.660 --> 02:07.410

02:08.070 --> 02:10.010
That is farm action.

02:10.020 --> 02:11.780
This is called the action you are l.

02:11.840 --> 02:21.600
We just now play I have to just copy this all and let's just based it somewhere in like a note stop

02:21.610 --> 02:27.060
so I'm just going to open the notepad.

02:27.640 --> 02:28.900
And here I want to paste it.

02:28.900 --> 02:33.500
So in this I want to just grab this form action and you are all OK.

02:33.600 --> 02:36.820
I would just copy this.

02:37.040 --> 02:43.190
And now here I have just come here and I have to paste it so it is MailChimp farm action.

02:43.190 --> 02:44.990
I just have to come here and I have to paste it.

02:45.230 --> 02:47.770
So now I have to just sit.

02:48.340 --> 02:56.480
So now you can see that if someone enters his e-mail address in here then I will receive that in that

02:56.480 --> 02:57.490
section.

02:57.500 --> 02:58.410
So let's just test it.

02:58.510 --> 02:58.830
OK.

02:58.850 --> 03:01.100
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to go to my Web site.

03:01.280 --> 03:01.820
OK.

03:01.820 --> 03:04.580
And then in here I want to enter the e-mail address.

03:04.610 --> 03:08.610
Let's see our list of the old email address after that.

03:08.630 --> 03:09.650
So I'm just going to come here.

03:09.650 --> 03:11.040
I'm just going to enter the e-mail address.

03:11.040 --> 03:15.600
The e-mail address is going to be a different like this and I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to go.

03:15.800 --> 03:20.110
So on clicking go you can see it.

03:20.210 --> 03:21.900
Confirm humanity.

03:21.950 --> 03:28.370
The reason is that because we have selected that thing if we just go to the settings

03:32.430 --> 03:37.560
let's just go to settings list naming defaults and in here we can see recaptcha.

03:37.560 --> 03:40.680
So this is basically telling that it is a recaptcha.

03:40.860 --> 03:46.580
If he did not address if he did not accept that then it will be automatically added to our list.

03:46.590 --> 03:52.230
But if we wanted to just verify the humanities section that he could see it's a subtribe to the list.

03:52.230 --> 03:59.580
And now the person clicked to subscribe and then he Filby subscribed to our list so it's a subscription

03:59.580 --> 04:01.350
confirm your subscription has been confirmed.

04:01.350 --> 04:02.310
Thank you for subscribing.

04:02.310 --> 04:03.970
I can deal this distance.

04:04.060 --> 04:05.950
Add us to your address book.

04:06.090 --> 04:12.940
So you you can just add them to your address book and then continue to our website so continue to our

04:12.990 --> 04:13.390
website.

04:13.390 --> 04:19.770
So it is just taking them to the website itself so I can see that if I just go here if I just come here

04:20.280 --> 04:21.550
and I just go to the list.

04:21.890 --> 04:22.610
OK.

04:22.650 --> 04:27.600
And then in here you can see it says one subscriber.

04:27.780 --> 04:31.650
So I'm just going to open this up and going to see it as you can see.

04:31.650 --> 04:32.560
This is subtribe.

04:32.580 --> 04:36.830
This is the Condren trading in everything and this is totally running guys seriously.

04:36.870 --> 04:38.100
OK you can see how this is running

04:41.980 --> 04:42.460
OK.

04:42.570 --> 04:47.300
If I just come here and I just go to the settings right now and then I just remove it.

04:47.310 --> 04:49.770
So you don't want to just predict my site OK.

04:49.830 --> 04:53.910
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to save right now and I'll go ahead and let's just enter it

04:53.910 --> 04:57.420
again and let's just add in any e-mail from here.

04:57.420 --> 04:58.740
So I'm just going to add

05:04.690 --> 05:05.630
and I'm going to just hit.

05:05.670 --> 05:06.020
OK.

05:06.030 --> 05:08.800
So you can see it's a subscription confirm.

05:08.820 --> 05:12.470
Thank you for subscribing their subscription to our list has been confirmed.

05:12.710 --> 05:13.130
OK.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.310

05:14.610 --> 05:20.160
So the subscription is being confirmed and everything is just going totally awesome.

05:20.160 --> 05:26.870
So instead if you do not want to add this or if you want to just add the MailChimp Beys to sign it forms.

05:26.870 --> 05:27.340
OK.

05:27.450 --> 05:28.180
How we can do that.

05:28.200 --> 05:28.610
OK.

05:28.680 --> 05:29.450

05:56.020 --> 05:59.370

06:07.870 --> 06:08.290
OK.

06:08.440 --> 06:13.620
And instead of this I want to just close it OK.

06:13.830 --> 06:16.830
And then here I want to add a text.

06:16.830 --> 06:19.860
So let's just come here and let's add a text.

06:19.860 --> 06:22.740
So on text I just want it to be in the right bar.

06:22.770 --> 06:27.450
And this is right here and I want to add the code that I have given to have to select the text from

06:27.450 --> 06:28.030
here.

06:28.320 --> 06:28.700
OK.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.790
And then here I have to paste the text.

06:30.870 --> 06:35.210
And now here I have to add Strype.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.590
OK this is your.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.710
I want to go ahead and I want to save right now.

06:39.060 --> 06:40.610
And now let's go ahead and let's see.

06:40.620 --> 06:41.490
So I'm going to come here.

06:41.490 --> 06:45.900
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to view my website so you can see this is how the form would

06:45.900 --> 06:47.220
be looking.

06:47.370 --> 06:50.020
There's other form is looking at its email address first name.

06:50.040 --> 06:50.790
And that's right.

06:50.790 --> 06:53.220
So if I just enter any of the e-mail address like

07:00.720 --> 07:10.280
and then here I just enter his name the last name and then I just go ahead and I just subscribe so you

07:10.280 --> 07:10.850
can see it.

07:10.860 --> 07:12.420
Thank you for subscribing.

07:12.440 --> 07:14.570
Subscribing is already done from here.

07:14.660 --> 07:15.160
OK.

07:15.290 --> 07:18.450
This is how it is for making this form just for acts like that.

07:18.440 --> 07:23.930
So if you don't want anyone to be just like that at it from there then you can just go ahead and do

07:23.930 --> 07:24.380
that.

07:24.530 --> 07:24.980
OK.

07:24.980 --> 07:28.900
And then I just go ahead and I just view my mailing list.

07:28.940 --> 07:29.250
OK.

07:29.360 --> 07:34.750
Then here you will see it's three subscribers and I can just view the list of surprises.

07:34.760 --> 07:39.460
I can just go with marriage conduct and in here I'll just I can just read all the context that I have

07:39.470 --> 07:41.120
so I have these right here.

07:41.150 --> 07:41.720
OK.

07:41.750 --> 07:47.330
I also have the name and the last name itself as well because we have asked them to just enter that

07:47.330 --> 07:52.910
so I would recommend you do basically go with this first name a last name so that your mail does not

07:52.910 --> 07:54.130
go into the spam.

07:54.250 --> 07:54.870
OK.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.410
And now in the next video I'm going to show you that.

07:57.500 --> 08:01.130
How can you send mail to all of them at once.

08:01.130 --> 08:04.110
And how can they open it up how can you just track everything.

08:04.250 --> 08:08.120
And then after that I'm going to show you how can you just go to the e-mail marketing how can you create

08:08.120 --> 08:10.880
lead pages so Stadion guys and by.
