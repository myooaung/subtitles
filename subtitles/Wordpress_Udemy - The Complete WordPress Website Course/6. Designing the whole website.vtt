WEBVTT

00:00.590 --> 00:04.140
What is a guys in Malcolm X now in this video we'll be designing this whole Web site.

00:04.140 --> 00:09.520
We are going to create three specific website for our like higher than determine our hire.

00:09.540 --> 00:16.800
Hire a hotel or like book a hotel or rent a car so you'll be creating these specific type of pages.

00:16.820 --> 00:18.470
So let's just go ahead and let's get started.

00:18.470 --> 00:22.380
First of all we need that ocean that will be theme and we have to go to the dashboard right now.

00:22.480 --> 00:22.990
OK.

00:23.090 --> 00:28.710
And here we have to just select the appearance and then things.

00:29.270 --> 00:33.520
And then here we have to just go to the Oddny right here.

00:35.450 --> 00:37.380
And let's come here and let's just search for a theme.

00:37.390 --> 00:41.880
So the theme that I want to be going up for would be ocean W.P..

00:41.920 --> 00:43.450
You can also go with the theme.

00:43.450 --> 00:43.980
OK.

00:44.050 --> 00:45.360
But I'll be just going over that ocean.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.180
We'll be right now.

00:46.270 --> 00:49.990
So I'm just going to go out and I'm going to install right now and you can see this team is currently

00:49.990 --> 00:53.960
being installed and is going to go ahead and I'm going to hit activity right now and this team will

00:53.980 --> 00:55.420
be activated.

00:55.420 --> 00:56.420
So this is right here.

00:56.590 --> 00:56.850
OK.

00:56.860 --> 01:03.520
Now what we have to do is that we need to just go to the this one that says begin installing plug ins.

01:03.550 --> 01:03.790
OK.

01:03.790 --> 01:08.290
And then I have to head this begin installing plug ins and they will install all the plug ins so make

01:08.290 --> 01:12.700
sure that you come here here and then you just install and then you just said applies so this will be

01:12.700 --> 01:16.910
applied to here and you can see that every plug in is installed right now.

01:17.050 --> 01:20.850
So one more thing that we have to do is that we need to buy the plug in.

01:20.860 --> 01:22.030
That's the program.

01:22.060 --> 01:26.440
So how you're going to buy one more plug in that is approaching and you have to just open up the video

01:26.440 --> 01:27.900
that you are watching right now.

01:28.090 --> 01:31.390
So you need the protrusion and the resources available.

01:31.390 --> 01:35.890
This video you have to just click here and get the program and you have to just click here and it's

01:35.890 --> 01:39.910
going to take it to the new page and then you have to just pre-Chase this so you can print Sheas like

01:40.090 --> 01:41.680
forty nine for one Web site.

01:41.690 --> 01:42.820
If you are just creating a trade.

01:42.830 --> 01:48.220
Now just say you can just buy it or if you are just doing a business thing and just go out and you can

01:48.220 --> 01:50.080
buy this unlimited page right now.

01:50.290 --> 01:54.430
OK so this will be like for limited web sites but it totally depends which one you want to buy.

01:54.430 --> 01:55.900
OK so make sure that you buy it.

01:55.930 --> 01:58.010
Because this is really very important.

01:58.090 --> 01:59.990
And in order for this to work.

02:00.070 --> 02:00.510
OK.

02:00.580 --> 02:02.530
So after you buy it you just have to upload it.

02:02.530 --> 02:08.530
You have to go to the plugins and then you have to go to amnion and in here you have to just upload

02:08.530 --> 02:10.420
plug in and then you have to choose the file.

02:10.450 --> 02:16.810
So I have to go to downloads right now and then I have to go to compressed sorry downloads and then

02:16.810 --> 02:18.650
I have to just search for the elements.

02:18.760 --> 02:22.900
This is the one I'm just going to go in and I'm going to install now and this should be installed in

02:22.900 --> 02:23.240
a minute.

02:23.250 --> 02:26.250
So let's wait did let's wait till this is done.

02:26.260 --> 02:31.300
And now I'm going to get hit activated plug in and you can see this plug in should be activated so this

02:31.300 --> 02:35.890
plug in is now activated what I have to do now and now I have to design my website to first of all I

02:35.890 --> 02:46.130
need to just make sure that I have the pages so in here I need to just go ahead and I want this to be

02:46.370 --> 02:47.440
new.

02:48.350 --> 02:50.630
Well let's just see the symbol page the home page.

02:50.630 --> 02:52.340
Well let's go here and let's change this to home.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.650
So this is my home page.

02:53.760 --> 02:58.910
I'm just going to come here and I want to go to the Condon's layouts so it should be 100 percent full

02:58.910 --> 03:02.860
with no margins and no title.

03:03.200 --> 03:07.940
Let's just hit publish and I can see this is right here.

03:07.940 --> 03:14.030
I'm just going to go to settings right now and then I want to go to you know the reading.

03:14.050 --> 03:18.130
So in the reading Ok let's come here to reading again.

03:18.580 --> 03:22.570
And in the reading you have to select a static page and in here you have to select the home page and

03:22.570 --> 03:25.710
then you have to hit save changes so you can see that we are done still here.

03:25.720 --> 03:32.920
And now let's have a look at or above say so on our home page you can basically just add something like

03:33.430 --> 03:37.570
hire hire hire a freelancer hire

03:41.460 --> 03:44.290
hire a car rental car and book you.

03:44.340 --> 03:52.650
OK so this will be like a let's say like that and then we want to just create these three pages specific

03:53.040 --> 03:56.580
So let's just go ahead and let's just first customize the website and then we're going to work more.

03:56.640 --> 04:01.650
So I'll also show you that how can you add the Didak check out function because that is also very important

04:01.670 --> 04:06.410
when we are doing a booking so there would be no shopping cart in that because we don't want to add

04:06.600 --> 04:11.310
the shopping cart and we just wanted to check out so that the person has to enter his information and

04:11.310 --> 04:13.680
they know he'll be taken to the Didak check out.

04:13.860 --> 04:15.320
He don't have to enter.

04:15.390 --> 04:18.940
Just like how many card how many quandaries he warned and something like that.

04:19.080 --> 04:19.510
OK.

04:19.620 --> 04:23.490
So I just come here and let's just come here to the header ok.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.080
The towbar a do we need a tabards.

04:25.080 --> 04:29.840
I'm going to come here to the general right here and let's just remove the toolbars So disable it.

04:30.060 --> 04:33.690
Let's come here and let's come here to the head straight here and I need the better background.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.520
So the background should be

04:41.430 --> 04:44.260
on hating this.

04:44.280 --> 04:45.580
It looks cool.

04:45.580 --> 04:49.770
The border bottom Sabater bottom I don't want any water about so you can see this is removed.

04:49.780 --> 04:55.000
I'm going to go back and I want to go to Demonios so-many color is going to be the wing color you can

04:55.000 --> 04:55.810
do it white.

04:56.020 --> 04:56.680
OK.

04:56.710 --> 04:59.960
And the whole should be this and everything should be totally ok.

04:59.980 --> 05:05.380
I'm going to go back right now and in here I want to select logos so the logo is going to be the color.

05:05.380 --> 05:09.710
So the colors are going to be white so if I just bring them out here it should be turned to blows.

05:09.730 --> 05:11.120
This is not turning about.

05:11.410 --> 05:13.030
OK this is not turning.

05:13.060 --> 05:14.950
So I'm just going to change it to be like I'm black.

05:14.950 --> 05:17.970
So if I bring my mouse here is changing to black right now.

05:18.340 --> 05:19.680
OK it looks pretty cool.

05:19.690 --> 05:22.370
And now here what I want to do.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.350
We're totally done with this.

05:23.350 --> 05:27.850
Now here we we have to design this page so I'm just going to I'm here I'm just going to just hit Cross

05:27.850 --> 05:33.070
right now and let's just installed a plugin that says direct checkout.

05:33.070 --> 05:38.380
So but we'll be doing that in the upcoming video lectures not now I'm old so let's just come here and

05:38.380 --> 05:42.180
let's just edit page OK and let's just design our home page.

05:42.190 --> 05:43.090
So I'm just going to come here.

05:43.090 --> 05:47.080
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to edit that elementary and it's going to take us to elementary

05:47.200 --> 05:47.470
age.

05:47.500 --> 05:52.240
And then we have to work forward so instead of doing everything from start I think we should be going

05:52.240 --> 05:55.740
up that using it beams because you guys already know how to design everything.

05:55.750 --> 05:59.740
I just want to show you that how can you create specific pages and you can design that so I'm not going

05:59.740 --> 06:01.140
to add a template right now.

06:01.240 --> 06:07.080
And in the template we want to go with this one.

06:07.150 --> 06:08.520
I'm going to go out and I'm going to insert.

06:08.530 --> 06:10.220
So this is being inserted right now.

06:10.390 --> 06:12.930
And after this is inserted then you're going to work with it.

06:12.930 --> 06:14.500
So let's wait till this is done.

06:17.430 --> 06:20.710
On OK this will take some time.

06:20.780 --> 06:20.980
OK.

06:20.990 --> 06:21.790
This is right here.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.950
OK design your word press.

06:23.960 --> 06:28.730
I'm just going to change this to be like Word Press.

06:28.860 --> 06:30.390
Not not not Word Press.

06:30.390 --> 06:30.960
It should be

06:34.160 --> 06:37.960
our booking site.

06:38.520 --> 06:38.940
OK.

06:39.120 --> 06:42.690
And in here we have to leave everything at this like this.

06:42.690 --> 06:46.500
You can see this is a major carrier I saw Crucell occur.

06:46.510 --> 06:49.430
So a crucial crucial crucial I don't know.

06:49.560 --> 06:50.630
OK so this is right here.

This also looks cool.

06:52.440 --> 06:55.460
OK we go down and we have so many things right here.

06:55.560 --> 07:01.350
So I think we need to add one more section right here and that will be like a book poking something.

07:01.350 --> 07:02.460
So I'm just going to come here.

07:02.460 --> 07:05.770

11:48.150 --> 11:56.490
So in the content we have to change the color so the color is going to be black.

11:56.670 --> 12:00.350
And I think pretty well it looks cool hotel booking.

12:00.450 --> 12:01.140
So

12:09.560 --> 12:14.470
and things of spacing we have the topography you have a description so everything looks pretty cool.

12:14.520 --> 12:20.580
And I will go ahead and let's just link it to the page so the page we will be creating would be a slash

12:20.580 --> 12:21.420
hotel.

12:21.600 --> 12:25.590
So if someone plays this page he'll be just taken to the hotel booking page.

12:25.590 --> 12:34.460
So we'll be just adding a hotel booking tour or instead of this let's just come here and let's add a

12:34.460 --> 12:34.810
button.

12:34.810 --> 12:38.570
So the burden is going to be book a hotel.

12:38.730 --> 12:42.240
OK so it should be a line decenter.

12:42.590 --> 12:43.210
OK.

12:43.280 --> 12:43.790
And

12:46.860 --> 12:49.490
book hotels.

12:50.060 --> 12:50.310
OK.

12:50.310 --> 12:54.180
And the link is going to be slash and then it should be hotel.

12:54.840 --> 12:55.300
OK.

12:55.470 --> 13:01.290
And then I want to go to disarrayed here and it should be like a house.

13:01.450 --> 13:04.670
I was home OK.

13:04.800 --> 13:10.000

13:10.070 --> 13:17.770

13:29.570 --> 13:30.830

13:30.830 --> 13:34.720
Now what I'm going to do I'm just going to come here and I'm going to duplicate this whole column.

13:34.730 --> 13:37.790
So let's just hit this and let's just say this one more time.

13:37.940 --> 13:38.340
OK.

13:38.510 --> 13:39.880
So we have everything coming.

13:40.070 --> 13:43.310
Now here I want to change this to be hotel booking.

13:46.660 --> 13:55.550
Freelancer so we also give a freelancer and we're going to change the image to this.

13:56.050 --> 13:59.160
