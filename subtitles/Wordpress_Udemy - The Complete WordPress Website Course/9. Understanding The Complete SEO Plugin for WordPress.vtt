WEBVTT

00:00.700 --> 00:06.400
What is up guys and what KMAX so before going up into our speed optimization I thought why not just

00:06.400 --> 00:12.130
go with our CEO comp. or c section and then we'll be moving on with our speed optimization.

00:12.130 --> 00:18.520
So let's just create a new section for speed optimization and then we can also include the free SSL

00:18.750 --> 00:22.670
that I promised in the video when we were registering our new meaning.

00:22.840 --> 00:24.460
Ok so let's get started.

00:24.460 --> 00:28.050
First of all you can see that we are totally done with our general settings.

00:28.060 --> 00:29.180
OK.

00:29.200 --> 00:34.960
Or the dashboard you can see we have a general settings here are features here that you would have to

00:34.960 --> 00:36.990
make sure that everything is enabled.

00:37.060 --> 00:43.680
We have a company info that we have already added we have or mastered Dewald that Vivat work when we

00:43.680 --> 00:45.770
will understand each and every thing here.

00:46.030 --> 00:51.100
And then we have this security so make it disable OK do not enable it.

00:51.130 --> 00:56.800
So let's just go ahead and let's just go to the title and meters and let's see what they are.

00:56.800 --> 01:00.110
So you guys already know about the title and the metal.

01:00.280 --> 01:00.790
OK.

01:00.820 --> 01:05.050
Now if I just come here and I just view my website and you can see how it is looking.

01:05.050 --> 01:09.340
Home how we create a WP site and this is right here.

01:09.550 --> 01:11.310
So you can select anything.

01:11.330 --> 01:14.020
I have already chosen from the dashboard.

01:14.290 --> 01:20.830
OK so then we come here and we have the home page so we can change the home page and the front page

01:21.250 --> 01:21.880
title.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.740
OK that view will be changing.

01:23.740 --> 01:26.620
You can just click here and you will be taken to the home page.

01:26.620 --> 01:27.150
OK.

01:27.160 --> 01:32.720
Let me just click here and I'll be taken to my home page and let me show you how you change your title.

01:32.850 --> 01:38.240
So now here you can see this is my title that is coming into his home and then separator and then it

01:38.250 --> 01:40.010
has the how to create a double B site.

01:40.020 --> 01:41.790
So it is like this.

01:41.820 --> 01:43.970
And you can change it if you want to.

01:44.070 --> 01:48.750
OK you can just click here and it's going to be right here you can see this is right here the title

01:49.080 --> 01:49.940
the separator.

01:49.950 --> 01:51.060
And then we have the site.

01:51.120 --> 01:54.390
So it is exactly like this if you want to change it you can change it.

01:54.410 --> 02:00.240
And I would highly recommend you to change your title to the keyword.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.940
You can make sure that your keyboard is coming here.

02:02.940 --> 02:05.940
Your main key word like W.P. situs coming here.

02:05.970 --> 02:13.800
It can be like create a double p site and then you can be like home and just you can add a tagline of

02:13.800 --> 02:14.990
your company as well.

02:15.150 --> 02:16.580
So that would be great.

02:16.680 --> 02:18.810
Instead of this homecoming right here.

02:18.950 --> 02:19.460
OK.

02:19.560 --> 02:20.790
So you can change it.

02:20.820 --> 02:22.990
You can also add the slug here.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.920
The meta description which I have already told you.

02:26.130 --> 02:29.330
So I didn't think so if I have to explain this already again.

02:29.340 --> 02:32.700
OK so you can see how we can change everything from here.

02:32.960 --> 02:37.170
Now let's go back to our title and metals and let's go to post.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.980
So in the post you can see that it's going to be like a default one.

02:41.120 --> 02:41.540
OK.

02:41.730 --> 02:44.420
This is going to just work with this template.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.780
OK the title is going to be coming here.

02:46.890 --> 02:49.590
The page is going to come in then the separator and the site name.

02:49.590 --> 02:52.530
Let me show you a live example if I just open this up.

02:52.800 --> 02:53.200
OK.

02:53.370 --> 02:55.170
And then I open up any of the posts.

02:55.170 --> 02:57.620
Suppose that this is the post.

02:57.750 --> 02:58.130
OK.

02:58.320 --> 03:01.760
I just open it up and I just hit at it and I just go down.

03:01.860 --> 03:08.520
And now here you will see that this is Title Page separator and the site name.

03:08.530 --> 03:14.030
So the title page is not coming here.

03:14.550 --> 03:17.180
I'm sorry guys this is a Preter is right here.

03:17.210 --> 03:17.840
I didn't see this.

03:17.850 --> 03:18.840
Is this a traitor.

03:18.870 --> 03:20.950
And then you have the same name right here.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.590
It is how do you create a WB site.

03:23.590 --> 03:25.580
So this is how it's going to work.

03:25.590 --> 03:27.610
It's going to give you a default template.

03:27.750 --> 03:28.230
OK.

03:28.260 --> 03:33.680
And then in here you can also get the metta box here that you can.

03:33.690 --> 03:40.380
But I would highly recommend you to keep this empty so that you can basically enter a metal tag heuer

03:40.380 --> 03:47.980
self and keep a habit of adding METAR description to your every page because this is so much necessary.

03:48.110 --> 03:48.480
Like this.

03:48.480 --> 03:53.150
We have the page right here and it's going to just grab it for every page.

03:53.250 --> 03:57.990
We have the media so media is like the image that you have.

03:57.990 --> 04:02.520
So if you have any of that image it's going to create a separate page for that image if I just open

04:02.520 --> 04:03.420
it up.

04:03.600 --> 04:03.940
OK.

04:03.950 --> 04:09.250
And then I just open this image OK.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.710
And then I just go to View attachment Bache.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.100
This is my attachment page.

04:13.100 --> 04:15.490
This is the title WordPress website it doesn't.

04:15.560 --> 04:17.560
18 this is the title of the image.

04:17.630 --> 04:17.930
OK.

04:17.930 --> 04:19.980
And then they tell you how to create a double beside.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.990
I also have the description of this image of gray.

04:23.240 --> 04:27.540
So this is how it is look and it is following the exact team here.

04:27.560 --> 04:28.780
So do not mess with it.

04:28.790 --> 04:32.350
OK because this is not necessary to just change anything here.

04:32.360 --> 04:36.920
I'm just telling you that how the default template is going to be appearing.

04:37.100 --> 04:39.150
OK you can change it.

04:39.170 --> 04:40.930
OK you can change it from here.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.400
You can just add anything here and you can see this is being changed here but we're not going to change

04:46.400 --> 04:46.550
it.

04:46.550 --> 04:48.490
We're going to use the default one.

04:48.680 --> 04:49.060
OK.

04:49.220 --> 04:57.350
So let's come here and let's go to our taxonomies taxonomies means category and the tags so you guys

04:57.380 --> 04:59.380
already know about the category and the tag.

04:59.380 --> 05:04.780
So this is going to follow the categories a template and this is going to follow the tags template.

05:04.790 --> 05:09.350
OK so this is I'm just giving you a basic introduction of them that how it's going to look.

05:09.520 --> 05:10.030
OK.

05:10.070 --> 05:16.710
And I would not recommend you to just change anything from here until unless you want to.

05:16.880 --> 05:22.540
OK so you can see if I just go to categories right now and then I just open up this Uncategorized.

05:22.960 --> 05:23.430
OK.

05:23.630 --> 05:26.670
Now you can see that this Uncategorized has all.

05:26.690 --> 05:29.510
So this and categorize are caves.

05:29.510 --> 05:31.660
OK so you can change it if you want to.

05:31.760 --> 05:39.380
And you can change it if you can change it then why you have to just assign anything to the category

05:39.380 --> 05:40.400
section from there.

05:40.580 --> 05:41.180
OK.

05:41.180 --> 05:43.630
From the taxonomy So then we have the archives.

05:43.850 --> 05:44.560
OK.

05:44.690 --> 05:46.490
You don't have to mess with anything here.

05:46.490 --> 05:53.440
It's going to be like the date archives and the search phrase search pages and also the 4:0 forward

05:53.460 --> 05:53.960
template.

05:53.960 --> 05:59.150
So we have this right now and it's going to be like some pages of archives.

05:59.150 --> 05:59.930
It's going in next.

05:59.930 --> 06:04.960
It means that the second page of the blog page.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.240
OK so if you just so happened to be example of a blog page I hope that is the s2.

06:09.480 --> 06:10.090
Yes.

06:10.130 --> 06:12.610
If he just have so many blog posts.

06:12.820 --> 06:13.120
OK.

06:13.130 --> 06:19.520
And then we go to the next page Dan the Google ville the Google index that page or Google will leave

06:19.520 --> 06:20.060
that page.

06:20.060 --> 06:21.810
So it is asking you about that.

06:21.830 --> 06:25.010
OK if I just go down and I just open this up second one.

06:25.190 --> 06:26.280
OK so this is the one.

06:26.450 --> 06:30.630
OK so this is right here to Google Ville index this page.

06:30.630 --> 06:34.370
If this is said to index and use a keyword obviously.

06:34.430 --> 06:34.650
OK.

06:34.670 --> 06:37.140
I don't know why you do want to meet a keyword count.

06:37.400 --> 06:41.330
OK so key word is not mental description is enabled.

06:41.360 --> 06:41.750
OK.

06:41.810 --> 06:47.360
But this should be kept this simple but if you want to enable the key word stock so how to be like OK

06:47.390 --> 06:50.000
it's going to give the keywords in the description.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.640
So if you want to enable it you can enable it.

06:52.930 --> 06:54.730
OK but let's just keep it disabled.

06:54.740 --> 06:58.120
OK so it doesn't matter if you just enable it or disable it.

06:58.130 --> 06:59.490
It totally depends upon you.

06:59.660 --> 07:05.540
OK but if you enable it and then take the changes OK then what will happen is that it will give the

07:05.540 --> 07:08.590
Google an extra Staggs of the keywords that you have.

07:08.750 --> 07:15.990
So but since we are not giving the Google the keywords that is why I will keep it disabled.

07:16.040 --> 07:16.440
OK.

07:16.640 --> 07:21.050
So you can see that we are totally done with the title and made to us let's come here to social and

07:21.050 --> 07:25.790
then we have here the social profiles so here you can create your social profiles and then he can add

07:25.790 --> 07:26.640
them here.

07:26.720 --> 07:27.560
We have the Facebook.

07:27.560 --> 07:32.680
So Facebook is like it's going to be like a default image you are l how this is going to look.

07:32.720 --> 07:38.360
You can see that if you share any of the posts you were able to your Facebook page then Facebook grabs

07:38.360 --> 07:39.460
the image of the link.

07:39.500 --> 07:45.940
So this is exactly referring to that image like if you need any default image for the post are pages

07:45.950 --> 07:47.690
that does not contain any image.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.210
Then you can choose this one.

07:50.210 --> 07:51.880
So it's going to be like a default image.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.830
It can be a banner of your web site or something like that.

07:54.860 --> 08:01.140
Then we have the Twitter we have Pinterest and we have the Google Plus So you can enter your Google

08:01.140 --> 08:05.400
publisher page and their Pinterest you can confirm your site Pinterest.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.530
You can go to Twitter.

08:06.540 --> 08:14.510
And then you can also just see the Twitter metor that guard is in the head section or not.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.790
But Facebook is I think he was the most.

08:16.890 --> 08:19.230
So you can work with this if you want to.

08:19.230 --> 08:25.710
And I would recommend you to add a banner to your image so that if anyone is sharing the link then your

08:25.740 --> 08:28.290
banner athletes at least comes in it.

08:28.500 --> 08:31.390
OK let me show you a live example if I just opened up Facebook.

08:31.650 --> 08:31.970
OK.

08:32.010 --> 08:35.640
And then I want to see any of that link.

08:35.910 --> 08:36.630
OK.

08:36.780 --> 08:41.280
Let me show you any link you can see this is the link that is being sponsored by Hostetter.

08:41.310 --> 08:46.620
If I just see you can see this is the title this is the description and then this is the image that

08:46.620 --> 08:49.920
is coming so this is how exactly the link works.

08:49.920 --> 08:54.360
OK let me show you another example of things you can see this in the title.

08:54.360 --> 08:57.200
This is the description and then this is the image that is coming.

08:57.390 --> 08:57.800
OK.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.480
So it is working like this.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.320
So now what I'm going to do.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.100
You can see this is how it works.

09:03.130 --> 09:05.960
Now we are totally done with Facebook Twitter and Pinterest.

09:06.120 --> 09:11.670
Let's go to axonal site maps Ex-Im multi-byte maps is a really important thing and we will be covering

09:11.670 --> 09:12.810
this later on.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.760
Let's go to advance.

09:14.790 --> 09:16.980
We have the enabled breadcrumbs.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.180
This is very important.

09:18.360 --> 09:18.790
OK.

09:18.960 --> 09:22.490
You should be enabling this just enable it and that's all.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.440
OK.

09:23.550 --> 09:25.830
Show blog page Shabelle.

09:26.070 --> 09:26.520
That's all.

09:26.520 --> 09:32.550
Leave everything to be normal OK and then make sure that this has enabled some of the websites to have

09:32.550 --> 09:35.400
the bread crumbs but you should be enabling this.

09:35.400 --> 09:35.890
OK.

09:35.970 --> 09:39.200
So then we have the permalink and the permalink.

09:39.210 --> 09:41.790
You can strip the category base and everything.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.720
So these things are not very much necessary.

09:44.810 --> 09:45.320
OK.

09:45.420 --> 09:48.870
These tools are also not very much necessary.

09:48.930 --> 09:54.880
The search console is that you have to register your site for the Google.

09:55.080 --> 09:59.340
OK so I'll show you that in the next video and then we have the premium.

09:59.340 --> 10:04.680
So these were the settings that were just the normal settings I gave you a basic introduction of how

10:04.980 --> 10:05.650
it works.

10:05.820 --> 10:06.170
OK.

10:06.300 --> 10:13.220
So now since we're totally done with that and then the next video I'll show you how can you work with

10:13.640 --> 10:19.950
the same old site maps and how can you some video replay to Google and bring in other search engines

10:19.960 --> 10:21.630
so Stadion and.
