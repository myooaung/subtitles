09:01.030 --> 09:07.490
It is also going to change when I add my own rating.

09:07.540 --> 09:15.190
So now what I'm going to do and talking about is that this is the complete theme that you can build

09:15.250 --> 09:20.770
if you go to the previous fray here you can see this is the premise we have the common and I also have

09:20.770 --> 09:23.400

09:29.350 --> 09:30.710
latest polls straight here.

09:30.880 --> 09:33.400
