00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,010
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,600
My name is Fernando Medina Corey, and welcome to my

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,680
course, Collecting Data on AWS.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,530
I'm a cloud architect at Stormlight Consulting, and I've worked

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,970
with dozens of AWS services over the years on projects ranging

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,380
from data pipelines to web applications.

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,560
AWS has one of the most robust public cloud platforms for data analytics,

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,850
and data engineers and other data professionals have some of the best

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,740
career prospects in the technology industry.

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,190
This course is a quick introduction to AWS data collection

11
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,020
services and other services that integrate with them. No prior

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,970
experience with AWS is required.

13
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,540
Some of the major topics that we will cover include collecting

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,920
realâ€‘time streaming data with Kinesis Data Streams,

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,000
analyzing streaming data with Kinesis Analytics,

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,610
transforming and delivering data with Kinesis Firehose and AWS Lambda,

17
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:02,240
and use cases for the Amazon Snow Family of hardware appliances.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,580
By the end of this course,

19
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,270
you'll know how to use different AWS data collection technologies

20
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,880
to get your data into AWS and how to analyze or apply

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,740
transformations to the data you're working with.

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,370
Before beginning this course,

23
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,430
you may want to have a general understanding of cloud

24
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,200
services and some programming experience,

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,800
but all code samples and demos will be provided,

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,430
and we'll walk through everything step by step.

27
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,170
From here,

28
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,770
you should feel comfortable diving into other AWS topics with

29
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,770
courses on Storing Data on AWS, An Introduction to AWS

30
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,460
Lambda, or AWS IoT: The Big Picture.

31
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:50,000
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn about AWS data technologies with the Collecting Data on AWS course, here at Pluralsight.
