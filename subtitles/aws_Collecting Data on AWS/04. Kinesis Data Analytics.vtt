00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.940
In this section, we'll be looking more at Kinesis Data Analytics and how

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.540
it's used to process streaming data in near real time.

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.610
So what is Kinesis Data Analytics, and how can we use it

4
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.740
to interact with our streaming data?

5
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.300
Well,

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.050
to start Kinesis Data Analytics will need a data

7
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.470
source that sends it streaming data.

8
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.590
This will either be a Kinesis Data Stream or Kinesis Firehose delivery stream,

9
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.840
and we'll talk about these both in more detail later.

10
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.050
This data flows in from the input stream source through to Kinesis Data

11
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.580
Analytics where all of the magic happens. Inside of Kinesis Data Analytics, the

12
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.100
data can be analyzed where our SQL queries are run against the incoming data to

13
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.440
review the contents or gather insights about what's in there, or transformed,

14
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.850
where data of one format might be modified into another format, or unused data

15
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.210
might be removed if we don't want it at all. You might also do something like

16
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.520
aggregate your data, where you take a series of records for all website actions,

17
00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.120
for example,

18
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.850
and then summarize them into intervals. After the data is acted on with these

19
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.460
processes or with other processes like machine learning or looking for top

20
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.070
items, the data is then output to a destination, like Kinesis Data Streams or

21
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.720
Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams.

22
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.470
From here,

23
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.480
the data in the destination streams might be picked up by other

24
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:30.000
applications or output to storage solutions like Amazon S3. Next, let's look at some of the possible sources for Kinesis Data Analytics.
