1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,580
It's important to know when we should use Snowball Edge versus Direct Connect,

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,410
not only for our purposes in our applications,

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,200
but also if we want to take any AWS certifications

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,110
because this will definitely come up.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,650
One way to first establish which you might want to use is if your

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,740
situation has a consistent network connection.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,050
If you're not able to establish a network connection at all,

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,700
then Snowball Edge might be a good fit for you because you can take it to a

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,820
location that can establish a network connection and have your local

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,770
devices interact with that Snowball Edge device.

11
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,880
And if you need to send any information back to the cloud,

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,790
you then ship that physical hardware back over to AWS.

13
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,760
With Direct Connect, on the other hand,

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,910
you're going to want to establish a direct network connection to AWS.

15
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,130
And it's not going to be an option if you can't do that at all or you have no

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,640
ability to connect into one of the Direct Connect partners.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,430
Another example might be when we want to enhance the compute or storage

18
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,750
needs of our applications at the edge or in an environment that doesn't

19
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,890
have easy access to the internet and to the cloud.

20
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,300
Snowball Edge, as the name indicates,

21
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,220
is really designed for at‑the‑edge computing.

22
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,860
Direct Connect, on the other hand,

23
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,820
will enhance your on‑premises environment with dedicated bandwidth to

24
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,280
AWS and provide you a more reliable way of interacting with those AWS

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,130
services at a potentially reduced cost,

26
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,800
depending on the bandwidth that you're sending in over the

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,540
open internet versus over Direct Connect.

28
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,190
Finally, we also want to think about what our transfer needs are.

29
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:38,020
If we want to transfer large batches of data from distributed locations,

30
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,060
Snowball Edge or even Snowmobile might be a great option for us.

31
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,440
But if we want to transfer large amounts of data on an ongoing basis and we're

32
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,240
able to send that out over a network and that's feasible,

33
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,340
Direct Connect could be a better option.

34
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,520
So now let's look at a few examples of when we might want to use

35
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,660
different services between Direct Connect,

36
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,500
Snowball Edge, Snowball, and the Snowmobile service.

37
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,200
First,

38
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,740
let's imagine we have 225 PB of video and image data

39
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,090
that we need to transfer into AWS.

40
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,980
This might be a one‑time transfer.

41
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,180
Now you can pause the video here if you're wanting to

42
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,490
think about it a little more and rehash.

43
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,340
And the same goes for the next two examples that I'll show.

44
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,540
Do you think you have it?

45
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,420
Well, in this case,

46
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,670
we might want to use Snowmobile where we send an entire truck

47
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,460
full of storage out to our location on‑premises,

48
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,020
connect to that truck,

49
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,980
and upload all 225 PB of data into the truck before it gets

50
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,800
sent over to AWS and unloaded into the cloud.

51
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,020
For the next example,

52
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,160
let's imagine we're trying to connect to AWS services

53
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,200
inside of a virtual private cloud,

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,740
and we don't want to go through the public internet.

55
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,860
We could do this with Direct Connect,

56
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,950
where we could set up a colocation provider that has a partner

57
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:00,200
that works with AWS to get us a direct connection to AWS VPCs and

58
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,930
also to public API endpoints for AWS without having to go through

59
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,340
the entire public internet.

60
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,050
Finally,

61
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,760
let's imagine that we need to aggregate some factory

62
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,340
equipment data and then send it to AWS.

63
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,370
But there's a lot of data inside of all the equipment that we're working with.

64
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,340
We don't need all of it though.

65
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,140
So what sort of tool would we use for this?

66
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,060
In this case,

67
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,870
we might want to think about using Snowball Edge because we

68
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,280
could bring that device to our factory, have it interact with our equipment,

69
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,490
and then either process the data that comes in and aggregate

70
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,010
or summarize it or take action on it before we send any

71
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,400
information over to the AWS cloud.

72
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:46,000
Now we can also ship Snowball back and forth between the local edge computing locations and the AWS cloud if we need to.
