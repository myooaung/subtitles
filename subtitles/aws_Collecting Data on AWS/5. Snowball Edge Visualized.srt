00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,660
So now that we know some of the basics of Snowball Edge,

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,200
let's try and visualize it.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,560
First,

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,610
let's think about a manufacturing process where we have a bunch of

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,330
different machines that are all sending data,

6
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,440
and we want to collect this data and be able to analyze it.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,370
Now, if we wanted to send this data over to AWS,

8
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,270
we might send it through a router on our local environment.

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:20,850
But,

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,500
what happens if we have either a spotty Wi‑Fi connection or we

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,610
have some other reason why it's difficult to send this much data

12
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,470
through our limited bandwidth to AWS?

13
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,430
Well, in that case,

14
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,240
we might get a Snowball Edge device delivered to our local environment.

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,640
And then,

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,460
we could send all this data into that local Snowball Edge device that

17
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,210
lives in the same warehouse as our manufacturing process,

18
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:43,890
for example.

19
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,460
And,

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,840
we could use the device to process this information before we send it to AWS.

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,320
For example, if we have a lot of redundant information,

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,410
we might take an aggregation of all of our machines, and

23
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,020
instead of sending in three times the data,

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,750
we could take all of the outputted data from our machines and

25
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,990
then squish it together before we send it over to AWS once our

26
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,510
Wi‑Fi is either reestablished, if we had a spotty connection, or

27
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,750
we're done aggregating it,

28
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,420
just to save ourself space after we send it into the cloud.

29
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,690
So now that we have a better idea of how Snowball Edge works,

30
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:25,000
let's take a closer look at when we'd use Snowball Edge versus something like Direct Connect.
