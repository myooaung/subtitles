00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.380
Now that we know a little bit more about sources and

2
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.750
targets, and the options that we have when we're working

3
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.850
with them to migrate our databases,

4
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.810
let's take a closer look at the components behind a DMS's replication process.

5
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.290
Now there's two main components that we'll need to understand,

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.350
the idea of a replication instance and a replication task.

7
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.540
With the replication instance, you'll have an EC2 instance inside of AWS,

8
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.590
and this instance will be set up either in a single availability

9
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.830
zone or multiple availability zone configuration.

10
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.350
Now you also have the option to pick between a variety

11
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.130
of different instances inside of AWS,

12
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.250
depending on the size of the data that you're moving over and how

13
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.670
large the jobs are that you're going to need to move chunks of data

14
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.520
from your source to your destination.

15
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.230
These instances are going to be what runs the code that DMS will use

16
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.640
to move data from your source to your destination.

17
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.080
Now, in addition to replication instances,

18
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.440
there's also replication tasks which run on these instances.

19
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.950
These allow you to set up a data table to migrate from,

20
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.580
and any transformations you might want to apply to the

21
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.950
data in that table, and then finally,

22
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.250
the destination that you want to migrate to. Now this could be a table in

23
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.710
the target database, or it might be a different sort of migration

24
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.240
depending on the target that you're using in AWS.

25
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.940
So let's try and visualize replication.

26
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.980
First, you'll start with your source,

27
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.560
which will have a variety of different tables in it.

28
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.060
And these tables, you'll want to be able to use DMS to move over to

29
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.030
the target database, and in order to do that,

30
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.310
you'll set up replication tasks,

31
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.930
which will be assigned to particular tables to move data from one

32
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.860
of those tables with the replication task by querying it, and then

33
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.640
send that data along to the target.

34
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.200
Now this would be repeated as many times as needed to get the

35
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.770
full data from the source to the target,

36
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.590
and it could happen on a variety of different tables inside of your

37
00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.760
source, but it will be whichever ones you configure.

38
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.210
And keep in mind that in addition to simply sending the data over,

39
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.740
you might also transform it into a new kind of data,

40
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.640
either by changing values in the data or by restructuring the data itself

41
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.120
before you send it along to the target, and after you do that,

42
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.490
it'll materialize inside of that target.

43
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.300
In addition to using DMS all by itself with a source and a target,

44
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.000
in the next video we'll look at how we can use DMS in combination with something like Snowball Edge.
