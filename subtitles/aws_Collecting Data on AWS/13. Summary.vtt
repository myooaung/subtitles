Congratulations!

2
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.230
We covered a lot of material in this module.

3
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.470
We started by reviewing a bunch of concepts surrounding Kinesis Data Streams.

4
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.800
We looked at all the producers we might use to get

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.340
data into a Kinesis data stream.

6
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.000
We also looked at how Kinesis Data Streams provision capacity using

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.990
shards and how the records inside of those shards are structured.

8
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.040
From there we also looked at how we could build consumer applications

9
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.900
with client libraries, the AWS SDKs, and AWS services that connect as

10
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.540
consumers themselves.

11
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.460
And after that,

12
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.510
we briefly touched on some of the differences between the shared

13
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.180
throughput model where different consumers share the capacity of the

14
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.450
stream versus dedicated throughput or enhanced fan‑out and how that

15
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.800
model has a consumer that can get dedicated capacity proportional to

16
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.990
the number of shards without having to share that capacity with other

17
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.710
consumer applications.

18
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.180
Additionally, we did some hands‑on work.

19
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.480
We created a Kinesis data stream and streamed it into it.

20
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.570
And we also used a Kinesis Data Analytics application to

21
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.820
review some of the data in that stream.

22
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.470
Remember,

23
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.650
if you haven't already removed the resources inside of AWS

24
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.500
that we created, go back and do that so that you don't have

25
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.050
unexpected charges on your AWS bill.

26
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.130
These services aren't included in the AWS free tier at

27
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.740
the time of making these videos.

28
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.210
So what's next for us?

29
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.000
Coming up, we'll take a closer look at Amazon Kinesis Data Firehouse. I'll see you there in the next module.
