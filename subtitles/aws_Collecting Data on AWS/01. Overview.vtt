Hello, and welcome to this module of collecting data on

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.770
AWS, Amazon Kinesis data streams.

3
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.520
My name is Fernando Medina Corey,

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.830
and in this module, we'll look at Kinesis data streams in depth and learn

5
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.040
how we can leverage it for our data collection needs.

6
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.640
Let's look at what we'll cover in this module.

7
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.300
First,

8
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.640
we'll get an overview of core Kinesis data streams concepts like producers,

9
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.240
shards, consumers, and records.

10
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.040
Then we'll look more closely at different kinds of producers.

11
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.500
We'll look at the Kinesis agent,

12
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.940
the producer library, and the AWS SDKs and when to use them.

13
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.710
After that,

14
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.780
we'll look at different consumers of Kinesis data streams,

15
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.230
specifically, we'll be looking at the Kinesis client libraries,

16
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.940
AWS services, and the AWS SDKs, as well as when each of them are appropriate.

17
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.600
Finally,

18
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.060
we'll do a demo that lets us visualize the data inside of a Kinesis data stream

19
00:00:53.060 --> 00:01:01.000
by using Kinesis data streams and Kinesis data analytics. So in the next video, let's get started with some basics.
