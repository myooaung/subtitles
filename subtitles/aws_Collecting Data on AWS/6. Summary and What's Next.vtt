1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.570
We learned a lot in the last few modules.

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.340
We managed to differentiate between different Kinesis

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.970
family services like Kinesis Video Streams,

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.170
Kinesis Data Analytics, and, of course, Kinesis Firehose and Data Streams.

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.690
We even used Kinesis Analytics with Kinesis Data Streams

6
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.360
in order to ingest and process streaming data live as it

7
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.140
comes through our application.

8
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.470
We managed to get some insights from that data.

9
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.310
And then we also created another application with Kinesis Firehose,

10
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.950
and we used it to deliver data to S3. In our application,

11
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.630
we transformed data with AWS Lambda,

12
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.210
and then we delivered it to S3 in its new format.

13
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.380
This allowed us to deliver value for our imaginary clients,

14
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.540
not only by collecting and storing the data,

15
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.670
but also allowing it to be in a more portable format so that

16
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.190
our finance engineers could review it.

17
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.980
From there, we learned a little bit more about the Amazon Snow Family,

18
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.330
and we looked at Snowball Edge devices and how they could be used

19
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.460
at the edge to do both compute and storage tasks when Wi‑Fi

20
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.460
connections might not be the most reliable, or the entire situation

21
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.530
calls for computing and storage closer to the facility that's

22
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.310
actually generating the data.

23
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.440
And, of course, we looked at Snowmobile,

24
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.040
which is a massive truck that lets us store and move massive

25
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.790
amounts of information in the petabyte range.

26
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.690
From there, we looked at Direct Connect, and how we could use

27
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.040
it to get a more direct connection into AWS without having to

28
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.730
go through the public Internet.

29
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.240
And, we just learned about the Database Migration Service, or DMS,

30
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.590
which would allow us to move our databases from either an on‑premises

31
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.530
environment or potentially another cloud into AWS, and we learned how we

32
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.110
could combine it with something like Snowball Edge.

33
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.770
Now, with all of this information, you might be thinking,

34
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.440
what would we want to do next?

35
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.940
Well, there's a lot more we still have to learn.

36
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.740
You could think about more AWS data tools that you might want to work with.

37
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.400
Now that we've collected this data,

38
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.950
you might be more interested in different ways we can store

39
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.960
data on AWS. For details on this, you could look at my

40
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.690
upcoming Storing Data on AWS course.

41
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.330
You might also want to review my current course on Connecting

42
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.540
DynamoDB to Your Applications, as DynamoDB is a fairly common place

43
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.640
to store data for access in your applications.

44
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.250
After you learn a few more AWS data tools,

45
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.590
you might want to learn more about processing tools for your data.

46
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.630
These might be things like AWS Lambda,

47
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.840
which we used a little bit inside of this course.

48
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.410
If you want a bigger introduction to AWS Lambda,

49
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.590
I have a course on that, too,

50
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.970
here on Pluralsight. Or if you want to learn how you might create

51
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.300
Lambda‑based applications that are a little more sophisticated,

52
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.890
then you could take a look at my Serverless Framework course,

53
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.980
which will allow you to easily deploy out infrastructure for

54
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.140
your AWS Lambda applications onto AWS.

55
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.700
And if you want to learn more about how the data generation side happens,

56
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.660
especially if you're using Internet of Things devices,

57
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.880
I have one other course you might look at with the

58
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.340
AWS IoT: The Big Picture course.

59
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.240
This will give you a much better idea of all the different services that

60
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.190
AWS offers specifically for the Internet of Things.

61
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.590
There's a lot more to learn,

62
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.050
and I want to wish you the best of luck in your journey, and

63
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.010
say, thank you for taking this course.

64
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.370
Feel free to get in touch with me on Twitter or ask me more

65
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.260
about this course in the comments section.

66
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.160
I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about the course and

67
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.000
resolve any issues that you might experience. Thanks, and I hope to see you in another course soon.
