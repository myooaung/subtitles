Hello and welcome to this module of Collecting Data on

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,940
AWS: Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,690
My name is Fernando Medina Corey,

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,520
and in this module we'll look in Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose in depth

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,920
and learn how we can leverage it for our data collection needs. To

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,550
start, we'll be looking at some basic concepts surrounding Kinesis

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,040
Firehose. We'll look at records, buffers,

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,440
destination, and data retention.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,210
Then we'll look at Firehose's limits, what it can do and what it can't do.

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,020
After that,

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,590
we'll look at how we can use data transformations with Kinesis Firehose,

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,700
visualize some of those transformations, and look at how we could use Lambda to

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,260
transformation data and a few examples of using Lambda.

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:42,940
From there,

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,390
we'll look at Kinesis Firehose producers that send data into

16
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,250
Kinesis Firehose, and Firehose destinations,

17
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,840
or where the data will end up when Firehose is done with it.

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,540
After that,

19
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,520
we'll look at a demo, creating a Firehose delivery stream inside of the

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,460
AWS console. And we look at a few examples of when to use Firehose versus

21
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,160
Data Streams, to make sure that we understand which Kinesis service is

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,000
appropriate for which situation. So let's get started in the next video.
