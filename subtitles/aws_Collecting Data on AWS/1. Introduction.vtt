Hello, and welcome to this module of Collecting Data on AWS,

2
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.760
the AWS Database Migration Service.

3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.600
My name is Fernando Medina Corey, and in this module,

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.790
we'll look at the AWS DMS service and see how to use it

5
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.940
to migrate our databases into AWS.

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.650
First, we'll be looking at what DMS is and some of the basics around it.

7
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.210
These basics will include things like the sources and the targets

8
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.110
that we can use with the Database Migration Service,

9
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.550
as well as what goes on in the background on replication instances and with

10
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.040
replication tasks to move data between a source and a target.

11
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.770
From there,

12
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.660
we'll look at how we could use DMS in combination with Snowball Edge

13
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.960
in order to move our data in substantially large databases from an

14
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.940
onâ€‘premises environment to the AWS cloud.

15
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:58.000
So now that you know the outline of what we'll be doing in this module, in the next video, let's look at what is AWS DMS.
