1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,560
We've done a lot in this module.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,150
We learned a bit about Amazon Direct Connect and how we

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,140
can use it to get direct access to AWS, not using the public internet.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,490
We also learned how we can use Snowball Edge and Snowmobile

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,500
to either send data into AWS or to process data at the Edge

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,420
inside of our own locations.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,850
And, we learned how we might want to use these different services in

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,900
different scenarios and when they're most appropriate.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,530
Now, in the next module,

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,230
we'll be taking a look at the AWS Database Migration Service,

11
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,920
which is another great option if we have data inside of a database

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,000
of some kind and we want to move it into AWS. So I hope to see you there.
