00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.950
Let's look at an example of how you might use Kinesis Video Streams.

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.450
Imagine you have a videoâ€‘enabled IoT device somewhere in the world.

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.930
You'll need to make sure that that device has an Amazon

4
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.840
Kinesis Video Streams Producer library set up.

5
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.040
After you do this,

6
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.700
you can get this device to stream data into the

7
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.120
Amazon Kinesis Video Streams service.

8
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.870
This data can then be processed in a number of ways.

9
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.860
In this case,

10
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.040
you can use a JavaScript library, like Video.js or hls.js to stream video

11
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.750
data in from the Kinesis Video Streams session URL. These libraries will

12
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.600
allow us to embed streaming video data inside of a mobile or web

13
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.440
application and make it available live.

14
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.150
Now let's look at another example when we want to detect

15
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.450
objects inside of our video. You can use Kinesis Video Streams

16
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.860
and other AWS services to do this.

17
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.370
Imagine the same setup as the previous example,

18
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.710
and instead of streaming the video data to a browser or mobile device,

19
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.380
we can process it in near real time.

20
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.140
The streaming video should be processed by a machine learning algorithm

21
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.080
using something like Amazon SageMaker. If the algorithm detects any

22
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.550
abnormality or finds something in the image that it's concerned about, like

23
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.560
an object that's not supposed to be there,

24
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.000
it could also have an application send out an alert or take some other action determined by the needs of our application.
