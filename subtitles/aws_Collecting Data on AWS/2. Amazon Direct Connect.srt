1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,950
Let's take a closer look at Amazon Direct Connect.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:04,430
First,

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,550
let's look at what Amazon Direct Connect is, it's a

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,550
dedicated network connection between your own on‑premises

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,940
infrastructure and the AWS Cloud.

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,460
You'll be able to use it to get virtual interfaces to AWS services

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,980
and it'll help you to bypass some of the ISPs in your network path to

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,760
AWS giving you a more direct route to AWS services and your own

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,840
infrastructure inside of the cloud.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,080
Now this requires that we have a partner in order to use to connect more

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,860
directly with AWS. Some of these partners include CenturyLink,

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,260
A,T&T, Cologix, and many others depending on the region that

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,110
you're trying to connect to inside of AWS. These partners will be

14
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,310
dependent on the region. For example,

15
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,620
there are different partners in US‑East1, Northern Virginia

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,140
than there are inside of AWS's Oregon regions. Now there

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,130
might be a little bit of overlap, but when you're using Direct Connect,

18
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,140
you're going to need to specify which ones you want to work with in

19
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,270
order to get your data from your local on‑premises environment into

20
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:07,210
the cloud. So what are some of the configuration options that we have

21
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,040
when working with Direct Connect?

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,960
Well, we have multiple different speed configurations that we can use.

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,460
We can have anywhere from a 50 MB connection to a 10 GB connection

24
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,730
that goes directly from our on‑premises environment through a

25
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,320
co‑location provider directly to the AWS Cloud.

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,720
And then when we're getting that connection,

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,210
we can then access VPCs in the same region as our on‑premises environment.

28
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:32,380
Now,

29
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,940
if we needed to access other regions inside of VPCs, we need to

30
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,810
make that possible with VPC peering between regions. But if we

31
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,080
don't need to access services in a VPC,

32
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,910
we can access any region's public AWS API endpoints while

33
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,540
we're using this direct connect connection.

34
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,600
So why would we want to use direct connect and what are some of the

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,600
potential benefits that we get when working with it?

36
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,030
Well,

37
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,360
it's going to allow us to potentially reduce our

38
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,780
network costs from that ISP. Now,

39
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,820
this is something that you'd have to take into account if you have high

40
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,930
bandwidth costs or you have ISPs that charge you significantly more when

41
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,980
you're working with them to get data into AWS over the public internet. When

42
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,270
you're working with the Direct Connect, it might be possible that the speed

43
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,450
and benefits you get from it, along with the reductions and cost,

44
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,540
might be able to balance some of the spending that you have for it.

45
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,610
Now a big part of this is that Direct Connect will build data at a lower

46
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,050
rate than the traditional data transfer rates of AWS.

47
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,750
So when you're doing all the math on calculating this,

48
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,500
you'll have to think about how much data you're transferring at

49
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,040
AWS's standard data transfer rates versus how much you'd be

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,600
transferring at the reduced Direct Connect rates.

51
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,090
In addition to these potential cost benefits,

52
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,150
you also might get some more network consistency. Because you're avoiding the

53
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,950
public internet infrastructure and all of the additional hops that go through

54
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,540
different servers and routers on their way to AWS,

55
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,080
you might get some benefits from avoiding those.

56
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,860
This direct connect option allows you to use Ethernet cables and

57
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,230
hardware in order to plug in directly to co‑location providers

58
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,990
that have more direct access to AWS.

59
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:16,000
Skipping some of those hops and being able to take this sort of approach can provide better network consistency.
