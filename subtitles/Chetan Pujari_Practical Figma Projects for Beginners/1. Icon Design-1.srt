00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:01,660
Hi there.

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:05,410
My name is Jacqueline Sadat and I am a UI UX designer.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,250
Today we will learn how to design concepts, icons and figma.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,690
These are the icons we will be designing.

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:18,280
We have the mobile phone icon, the email icon, the location icon, the color icon and the telephone

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:18,850
icon.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,500
Google's material design has an icon template that guides with the icon design.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:32,230
Using it ensures consistency, uniformity and scalability of the icons you design.

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,230
The dimension of the template is 24 by 24 pixels.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,300
This part is the life area and this part is the padding.

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:50,470
So the light area is where your icons should be designed and the pattern is the space around the icon.

12
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:59,340
Now, icon may extend into the pattern if additional space is needed, but make sure the icon you are

13
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,070
designing does not extend outside of the grid or outside the borders of the templates.

14
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:15,660
These are the key line shapes that guides you to design the basic shapes such as circle, square and

15
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,490
rectangle.

16
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,390
So this guides you to draw a square and this guide you to draw a circle.

17
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,600
This guide you to draw a vertical rectangle.

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,000
And this a horizontal rectangle.

19
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:35,100
To learn more about icon design using material design guidelines, you can visit the link on the screen.

20
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,460
Okay, so onto a face icon, the mobile phone icon.

21
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:47,880
We will start by selecting the rectangle tool from the toolbar and then join a rectangular shape of

22
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,630
12 by 20 pixels on the frame of the guidelines.

23
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,200
Then round the corners by two pixels.

24
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,110
Okay.

25
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:05,900
So we'll then change the color to black using the color to add the field section on the design tab.

26
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:12,620
Once we are done with that, we select the rectangle again and draw a bar at the top and then round

27
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,550
the corner to one pixel full.

28
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:25,220
Then select a circle from the shapes two and draw a circle at the bottom of the main rectangular shape

29
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,620
with the size of two by two pixels.

30
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:28,910
Great.

31
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:39,260
Now we select the circle for the bar and the main rectangular shape, and then we go to the Boolean

32
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:46,550
menu up there to select Subtract, which subtracts the circle shape and the bar shape from our main

33
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,750
rectangular shape.

34
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,570
And voila, we have our phone icon.

35
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,430
Okay, the next icon is the new icon.

36
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:02,350
Once again, we select the Rectangle two from the Shape menu and then draw the horizontal rectangle

37
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:10,580
size 20 pixel by 16 pixel using the guideline provided there around the corners by two pixels.

38
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,050
We then changed the colour to black.

39
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:23,080
We want to be able to see that guideline with the still active so that the stroke instead.

40
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,400
Yeah.

41
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,550
We said that said.

42
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:37,210
And then select the PIN two and draw a V line from this end of the shape to the center, then to the

43
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,200
other end of the sheet.

44
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:48,300
Selected and set the size to one pixel, then change the color to white so that it will be visible when

45
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,210
we fill the rectangular sheet with black.

46
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,660
Now fill the rectangular shape with black and remove the stroke around it.

47
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,760
Once you're done with that, adjust the line with a little.

48
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,790
Then select both the line and the shape.

49
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,720
Go to the Boolean menu once again and select Subtract.

50
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,740
This will subtract the line from the rectangle.

51
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,740
Then we flatten it to convert it to a vector.

52
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,810
And there we have it, our very own image icon or male icon.

53
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,340
Moving on, our next icon to design is the location icon or the pin icon.

54
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:39,810
With this, we will select the triangle from the shapes to then draw it from the top to the bottom.

55
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,810
Flatten it so it's easy to work with.

56
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,960
Now stretch it a bit to the end of the life region.

57
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,320
Remember early on I told you the life region is where the design goes.

58
00:04:54,330 --> 00:05:02,610
So once you're done with that, right click the shape and select flip vertical from the menu that appears.

59
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:09,030
You can either double click on the shape or press enter your keyboard to enter the vector mode of the

60
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:09,450
shape.

61
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:16,800
Before we continue, go back to the normal mode and duplicate the shape by pressing control command

62
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,030
on your keyboard.

63
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,960
Now change the color of the copy to help you differentiate it from the original.

64
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:32,610
Press and hold both the shift and optional also on your keyboard to reduce the size of the copy.

65
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:44,590
So option or the old key anchors are shaped in the middle, so the shape stays in the middle regardless

66
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,330
of the changes it undergoes.

67
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,000
Now select the original sheet.

68
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,670
Press enter on your keyboard, enter the vector mode.

69
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:57,850
Once again, select the two points at the top of the shape and then round those corners by changing

70
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,840
the values here.

71
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:04,090
These select the top corners and select the bottom corner and then round it a bit.

72
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:10,660
Now, when you're done with that, select the copy and press enter on your keyboard.

73
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,370
Enter the vector mode.

74
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:22,130
Then select all the three corners or points, change the corner radius of all the planes by changing

75
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,530
the value here to form a circle.

76
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:33,580
The legs, both the seco and the pin shape, then select subtract from the volume and to complete the

77
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,300
icon.

78
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:38,350
Once you're done with that, flatten it and then change the color to black.

79
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,650
Then we are done with the location icon or the pin i.
