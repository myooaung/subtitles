00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.340
Hello future designers.

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.350
Welcome to Another Future ABCD.

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.950
So today what we'll be doing will just be learning about Sigma components.

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.620
How to build faster.

5
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.760
As you see, this wasn't actually created by me.

6
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.850
It will take a number of hours to be able to do this.

7
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.210
Okay.

8
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:26.890
So let's say you want a quick story and then a way to design your UI for.

9
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.660
As an MVP for products.

10
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.230
Okay.

11
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:40.690
So what you can do instead of you getting someone to design or you design it yourself, so that's actually

12
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.710
do it as designed.

13
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.210
Okay.

14
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.190
We came across sigma components and then yeah.

15
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.490
So you visit the link sigma components as you see here.

16
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.620
Small component that's common then.

17
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.800
Here are the components you can use.

18
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.480
We have mobile iPhone.

19
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.560
So iPhone.

20
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.200
Just how is when they say, I want an iPhone, I can just click here.

21
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.140
Copied to, copied to clipboard and I'll go to my figma and then just control V or you can right click

22
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.920
and PC.

23
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.020
So that's what we have here.

24
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.240
Very simple, easy as pie.

25
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.800
And then you can decide to change the color.

26
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.010
So let's say I want to change the color of this background.

27
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.950
Just click here to feel Lincoln.

28
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.690
Let's use this color so you can see this change, so you can tweak it as desired then.

29
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.990
So there are more options that I can work through from.

30
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.940
The.

31
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.060
Rooms, dark themes.

32
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.020
And then.

33
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.520
Let's see.

34
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.450
See, that's all the websites.

35
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.780
So websites you can.

36
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.520
Let's see, I want this.

37
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.840
Okay.

38
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.110
I just copy this.

39
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.870
He wants his copy to go to my projects and then I can just see it.

40
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.730
So this, like this sort of taking hours to be able to accomplish this.

41
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:22.410
But since we have sigma components able to just do this as easy as by.

42
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.470
So just as usual, you can decide to tweak them the text, the colors, just as you would do if you

43
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.540
were building on your own case.

44
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.520
Let's just try changing the colors.

45
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.660
So let's go with.

46
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.860
Let's see this.

47
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.200
Q.

48
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.140
You can also change the text color too.

49
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.820
So any of the UI, everything can be changed here.

50
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.990
Okay.

51
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.080
So if you go to Sigma components here, we also have other things here.

52
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.250
Components.

53
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.320
You can visit the they can see other here.

54
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.130
This is.

55
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.150
For websites.

56
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.590
Okay.

57
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.570
So you can let's say we want let's say you want this.

58
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.780
Okay.

59
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.270
So you can copy this to.

60
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.950
Go to your figma projects and then just paste it inside this.

61
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.960
Right this year.

62
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.040
Then I have the projects.

63
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.340
Or.

64
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.830
Actually didn't copy.

65
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.710
Let's see.

66
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:35.310
We copy?

67
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.900
Let's copy this instead.

68
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.370
Is this copy?

69
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.950
So.

70
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.090
You see?

71
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.470
So I'm trying to copy, but it's not copying.

72
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.950
So let's try other components and see.

73
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.260
It's copied to clipboard.

74
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:16.910
He seems not to be --, but I guess you guys get a concept of what the component is trying to achieve.

75
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.140
But you might also want to check on the terms and conditions like the terms and conditions.

76
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.940
Let's use a CC.

77
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.360
So you remember they said are not affiliated with Sigma and then let's see.

78
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.170
So there's a creative common attribution.

79
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.390
Okay, now.

80
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.870
Okay.

81
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:47.360
So I would advise you actually know the basics of figma like design before trying this.

82
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.560
Not like trying this.

83
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.160
This will help you build faster, but just so you don't become lazy, just know what you are trying

84
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.880
to do.

85
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.930
Make sure you.

86
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.200
You understand that if you actually want to be a designer, you are us designer.

87
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:10.580
Make sure you understand user research, basic the basics of UI, UX, and then make sure you have some

88
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.840
project that you've done.

89
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.480
And then you can start using these ones just to like make you build faster.

90
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:18.830
So thank you.

91
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.020
And then see in the next lesson.

92
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.600
Thank you.
