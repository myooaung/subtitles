Hi everyone.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.520
As part of your course today, I will be giving a short introduction to Wizard, which is a design tool.

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.610
You'll be learning just a short intro about me and Tia, and I'm the community manager at Wizard.

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.010
So for first to understand what we do, it's important to look at the evolution of design tools.

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.860
We started with Adobe back in the late eighties and early nineties where we had a means to design our

6
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.480
ideas, but it was a bit too technical and a bit too difficult to manipulate.

7
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.560
So it was a bit too specific for a certain group of people with technical design skills.

8
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.270
Some decades after we were introduced to Sketch and Adobe XD in 2010, which started to make it more

9
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.690
specialized for creating apps and websites in 2016, Figma took it up a notch and created something

10
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.670
that enable people to work together in a browser as you do in Google Docs.

11
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.970
So we were introduced to real time collaboration.

12
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.980
The only thing that's noteworthy really about all these tools is that they were all made for designers.

13
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:10.800
And of course that makes total sense because for a specific point in time and also for a long point

14
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:19.320
at that note, we were only getting design ideas from designers, so designers were the only ones who

15
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.270
were actually doing designing.

16
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.260
But that has changed now.

17
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.970
Nowadays we have the design thinking methodology, the design print methodology, and basically the

18
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.450
democratization of design as a whole is put more forward because we do have other proponents who are

19
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.480
traditionally non designers who also need a means to be able to express their ideas, especially.

20
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.090
So think, for example, executives in the company or people who talk a lot with the customers who probably

21
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.010
have ideas on how to improve a product.

22
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:57.210
So nowadays it's just more relevant for stakeholders to take part in the designing and the prototyping

23
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.810
phase.

24
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.580
Let us take a look at the democratization of photography.

25
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.410
So with photography we see, for example, that in 1888 we have the first commercial camera from Kodak,

26
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.970
which was really hard to manipulate but work really well.

27
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.680
Unfortunately, it only worked for the specific group of people who knew how to use it.

28
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.790
And slowly we move towards the Instagram generation we're in now where everybody is able to take a picture,

29
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.160
essentially in a nice picture at that.

30
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.650
So the democratization of photography really moved from only having experts able to take pictures to

31
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.340
also making it a bit more mainstream for ordinary people like me.

32
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.620
Or also maybe some of you can take beautiful pictures, but that, of course, doesn't eliminate the

33
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:53.250
need for expert photographers, but only enables other people to also take beautiful pictures that could

34
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.020
serve them in their day to day needs.

35
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.620
With expert photography.

36
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.570
The person does the hard work, but with mainstream photography, we have the technology do the hard

37
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.020
work.

38
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.450
So we basically want to replicate the democratization of photography in the field of design.

39
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.920
And in order to do that, we believe that using AI is the means.

40
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:22.700
If we look at the left corner here, we have people who use sketch and vision figma and these people

41
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.230
are usually people who are willing to do the hard work, they have the technical skills, and these

42
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.850
people are usually designers.

43
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:36.260
On the other hand, we have now a need for more AI assisted tools, which enables non-technical people

44
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:43.520
such as chief product, UX designer, product manager to also visually create app and web design ideas

45
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.240
without having to spend so much time learning a new tool, basically with a low learning curve.

46
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.140
So we believe in Wizard, that A.I. is the interface that will make all of these happen.

47
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.450
A.I. is the enabler that will democratize design.

48
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.370
So with that, we mean that with technology, hard work will be hidden.

49
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.680
So the complexity will be hidden that the core users, such as you and I, won't even know that there's

50
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.840
all these complex things that are going on in the background.

51
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.160
What we see on the interface is that we have something that's easy to use.

52
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.430
We have something that helps us get the job done and doing it beautifully as well.

53
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.270
So basically the learning curve becomes very low as well.

54
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.710
For example, here we have a set of different people from different profiles that are traditionally

55
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.230
non designers such as domain experts, UX designers, chief of product.

56
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:47.470
So all of these people we want to enable to design apps and websites so that they're able to communicate

57
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.160
their ideas visually to more technical people, such as UI designers and front end developers.

58
00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.610
So essentially on one hand, we will have all the non-technical people, wizard in the middle, enabling

59
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.430
communication, enabling the democratization of design and the more technical people on the other side

60
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.430
to actually make it into actual applications.

61
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:16.600
So yeah, if we are to democratize design, we believe in Wizard that A.I. is the way and we have kind

62
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.270
of expressed that in the tool that we built.

63
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.490
So it's implemented all over it.

64
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.790
It's an AI powered design tool for everyone.

65
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.270
And today your course teacher will actually show you how to use it and all the AI features incorporated

66
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.840
with it.

67
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.420
So yeah, thank you so much for listening to my short intro and show your course on UX and Wizard.
