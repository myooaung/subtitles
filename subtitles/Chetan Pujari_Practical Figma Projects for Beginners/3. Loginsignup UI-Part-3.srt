1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:01,950
Okay.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:06,150
So I have my illustration file opened here.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:07,430
Right.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,580
So what I did was I selected the.

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:26,050
The illustration I wanted to use and then copied it and paste edits into figma as an SVG file.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,520
So yeah.

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:30,470
Good.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,240
I have my first one.

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,020
Move it to a position.

10
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,720
Well.

11
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,520
Here.

12
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:40,410
All right.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,850
As you can see, the lady.

14
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:49,540
And then I'll go back to I'll go back to Illustrator to select the next file.

15
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,990
So the next one is the mine.

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,820
With the camera in his hunt.

17
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:04,860
When I select this, when I do this, you realize that it selects the background as well.

18
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,430
But I don't need the background, so I have to deselect the background so that I can copy the illustration

19
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,140
by itself.

20
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,210
I can copy just the illustration.

21
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,590
So to do that, I just press and hold shift and then click on the background.

22
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,290
You notice that it selects the background and only selects the illustration I want.

23
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:34,290
So then I copy it by pressing command C or control C on whatever keyboard or C are using.

24
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,050
Then I go to Figma and I use control.

25
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,150
It's just paste.

26
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,730
So yeah, I have it.

27
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:42,820
Hmm.

28
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,420
Well, I have to do a bit of resizing here.

29
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,700
Yeah.

30
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,200
Mm hmm.

31
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:53,670
Uh huh.

32
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,070
Uh, I have to make sure that they are.

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,450
You have similar sizes.

34
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,170
So.

35
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,670
1i5, I think.

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,910
And they change the shape here manually.

37
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:14,670
Okay.

38
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,300
So.

39
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,720
I have my illustration.

40
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,470
Yeah.

41
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:22,870
Okay.

42
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,770
So if you notice.

43
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:32,330
The background here in this design is different from what I have here, right?

44
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,290
The ladies background is.

45
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,800
A lighter shade of purple.

46
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:48,130
So I do that to do that app, to double click, to select the background, and then under the fill section,

47
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:53,350
I click on the color and then using the.

48
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,060
Selection color selection method I taught you.

49
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:07,680
You can select the color from sorry color picking method so you can pick the color from the design.

50
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:13,720
I think you probably know half that you'll be given the image as well.

51
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:21,520
So you pick the color from the image and then in this case I'll change.

52
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,030
I have the color here in my documents color.

53
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,630
So I just click and change the background color.

54
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,830
Right.

55
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,760
Okay.

56
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,570
So.

57
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,950
So that I have it.

58
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,520
I'm done.

59
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,440
It's left with the log.

60
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:39,820
Sorry.

61
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,040
The welcome update, right?

62
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,300
The welcome update.
