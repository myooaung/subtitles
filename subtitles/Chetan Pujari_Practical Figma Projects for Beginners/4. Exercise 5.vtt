00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.190
So hello everyone.

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.400
So welcome to the continuation of our previous lesson.

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.360
Now what we are going to do?

4
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.280
As I said, we are just going to be working with the text and then we'll do some simple shapes too.

5
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:16.900
Okay.

6
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.980
So this is what we are trying to do.

7
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.160
We are just trying to populate the screens with the email and the email address and then we'll do something

8
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.580
on this and then we'll try out the telegram and WhatsApp icons.

9
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.390
Okay, so let's proceed.

10
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.320
So I am going to select this.

11
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.400
So let me check this email and phone number.

12
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.130
So let me just select.

13
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.880
Okay.

14
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.080
And control C.

15
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.370
Control V.

16
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.390
So and then I'll use the all key with the help of the shift key to move this.

17
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.490
So I think this distance is quite okay.

18
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.380
The gap is quite okay.

19
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.930
And when you take this out, let me see.

20
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.150
So also, I'm going to check that the distance is 15.

21
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.450
So 15.

22
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.900
Okay.

23
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.620
So the distance from the mobile to this text is 15.

24
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.780
And I'm going to change this to email.

25
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.310
Emile.

26
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.260
Okay.

27
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.680
Then I'll give it a dummy email.

28
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.090
So a dummy email.

29
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.130
So let me just use.

30
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.200
Go.

31
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.810
That's.

32
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.660
We're going to take up.

33
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.530
Dot com.

34
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.640
Okay, then.

35
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.280
Now how to change the icon.

36
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.720
So let me just take this out then I'm going to bring this this here.

37
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.660
Remember the size statuses by 36.

38
00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:00.910
Okay, so for consistency sake, I'm going to change this to 36 so I can just resize it here so I can

39
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.050
just input the value.

40
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.390
So 36.

41
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.630
Cynthia.

42
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.020
It's also 36.

43
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.960
Okay.

44
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.030
Then I'm going to align.

45
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.060
It's just so it's aligns with this.

46
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.580
Okay, so let's make it.

47
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.390
Touch it.

48
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.940
Okay.

49
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.400
So it's well aligned.

50
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.270
And then what else to do as to.

51
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.270
Dempsey the copier, the size 22 hours is 15.

52
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.060
Now we have the group's uniforms.

53
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.710
So let me just increase the distance a bit.

54
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.500
So just now let me check the distance between them.

55
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.320
So 19.

56
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.820
So let's use 19.

57
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.000
Now we need that of the groups.

58
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.600
Okay.

59
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.420
So just this.

60
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.430
What is control C, control V then?

61
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.260
See.

62
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.630
Since just six.

63
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.210
So here is 19.

64
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.280
So let me check here to.

65
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.790
So into six, then move it up.

66
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.350
She'll be 19.

67
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.610
Okay, so 19.

68
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:33.230
So while holding on oats, I use the arrow key to move it up so that I could see the changes as I move.

69
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.300
Okay, we don't need this.

70
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.980
So delete this and then I would check here.

71
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.330
So we have uni frames.

72
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.130
Okay.

73
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.760
So with a uni frames.

74
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.910
Sorry, we need this.

75
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.320
So I'm just going to change.

76
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.700
Really.

77
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.340
Let me check.

78
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.330
See, just a groups difference.

79
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.400
So groups.

80
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.440
So groups.

81
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.420
Then here is uni friends uni.

82
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.620
Prince or let's do it.

83
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.490
UI Prince.

84
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.540
UI friends.

85
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.650
Look.

86
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:10.630
And then.

87
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.650
Okay.

88
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.500
So now let's do that of this accounts linked.

89
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.160
So I'm going to do this shape and then account link.

90
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:28.530
As usual, we use the rectangle two and then I'm going to draw from this and in this size.

91
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.500
Okay.

92
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.140
So I'm using 48 by 50.

93
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.310
Okay, let's see that distance.

94
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.120
Just so you just close so we can pick it up.

95
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.620
So 19 is okay.

96
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.510
So let's.

97
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.420
At 19.

98
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.050
Okay.

99
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.680
For consistency sake, then I'm going to change it to height.

100
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.700
Okay.

101
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.020
And now we need to give it to the text accounts linked.

102
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.610
But remember, they said drop shadow.

103
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.460
But this shadow is actually a line.

104
00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.430
So it's a line.

105
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.120
I can do is just control.

106
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.450
See this line?

107
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.720
Okay.

108
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.940
The line that we have here.

109
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:16.290
So let me just zoom in and then click then control C, control v, they use the key to move it down.

110
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.300
Let me hope they don't initiate.

111
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.460
I'm going to make it move down faster.

112
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.860
Let me zoom in to see if it's purposely the position of one's.

113
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.910
So I think it's the.

114
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.370
Okay, so.

115
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:43.430
Okay.

116
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:52.570
So now I'm going to just select this control C, control V and then bring it down and then change its

117
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.900
name.

118
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.960
Remember, since I picked it first I have to bring it to front.

119
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.770
So bring two front.

120
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.590
So right click and bring the front and then I'll change it.

121
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.350
Accounts linked is a linked council.

122
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.510
Accounts Linked linked.

123
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.100
Let's check.

124
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.740
So it's a council link.

125
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.230
Okay.

126
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.060
So accounts linked to the URL escapes.

127
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:14.100
Okay.

128
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.750
Then let me just try and center it.

129
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:17.620
So okay.

130
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.610
So he sent it.

131
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.530
So he sent it.

132
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.240
Okay.

133
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.430
And really let them bring it out.

134
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.830
Okay.

135
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:44.320
And now we have to do that of the telegram WhatsApp and then the icons so account linked.

136
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.870
Let me see.

137
00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.570
So they seem to be.

138
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.980
So the text size is 16 normal.

139
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.450
So I'm going to change my to guess 20.

140
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.260
You see this string?

141
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.680
See?

142
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.500
This also is chintzy.

143
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:13.880
Okay, so let's leave this to 20 and now we have to do that.

144
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.810
So the telegram and then WhatsApp.

145
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:16.720
So Telegram.

146
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.320
WhatsApp.

147
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:24.130
So let's take this text control C, control V and I'm going to bring it down.

148
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.850
So while holding on old them check.

149
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.110
See the distance.
