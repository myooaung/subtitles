1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,230
Welcome to This Week, Marcos.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,550
So let's move along.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,730
Let's move along.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,080
Yeah.

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:15,000
So I'll just search the other icons here so I don't have to go back to the plug in.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,910
So I'll switch user to for the user name.

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:19,960
Okay.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,680
I think this looks good.

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,990
So I'll just select this.

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:26,960
Yeah.

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,080
This looks good.

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,920
And then our such key padlock showed padlock.

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,550
Yeah.

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,670
For the password.

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,800
I'll just pick this.

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,040
This looks good for me.

17
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,770
Okay, so I'm done with the I qualified plugins.

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:54,630
I have all the icons I need for my design, so I will just have to resize them.

19
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,200
Right.

20
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,400
So this is 24 hour.

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,320
Reduce the size a bit.

22
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,040
20.

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,600
Then I change the colour from black to violet.

24
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,710
Because that was the color of the icons.

25
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,150
Violet.

26
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:26,060
It looks too small on my design, so I guess I have to make it a bit bigger.

27
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,540
Let's see.

28
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,320
It's 24.

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:30,970
Okay.

30
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,320
Oh.

31
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:33,540
Yeah.

32
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,890
So 24 is okay.

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,300
24 is good enough.

34
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:45,070
I mean, sets the distance between them to 20.

35
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:52,920
Okay.

36
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,770
So to how am I doing this?

37
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,630
I'm checking this by pressing down option on my keyboard.

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:09,460
I think it's all on Windows Keyboard, so I have the elements selected and then I press and hold option.

39
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,490
And then just who were my moms around it to check the distance between the elements?

40
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,040
Right.

41
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,300
I want to set that distance to 30, so I guess I'll have to move it back a bit.

42
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:20,990
Okay.

43
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,370
As I said, you now.

44
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,900
So let's see how it looks.

45
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:34,040
It seems that this stands between the icon and the text is a bit too much, so I reduce the distance

46
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,030
to 15.

47
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,600
Let's see how it looks.

48
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,520
It looks a bit.

49
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,270
Okay.

50
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,910
So, yeah, we'll move on to the next one.

51
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:41,990
Let's see.

52
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:44,850
Okay.

53
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,130
No, it looks like I have to increase the distance, so.

54
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,890
And move it to 30 and see.

55
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,890
Hmm.

56
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,350
No, let me set it to 25.

57
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:58,690
Okay.

58
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,210
So you said whatever distance you are okay with.

59
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,990
This looks good enough for me, so I guess I just move on.

60
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,910
Okay, so I'm done with that email input box.

61
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,950
Now the next thing I'm going to do is create the username input box.

62
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,270
So.

63
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,860
I'll get a duplicate once again and then move it below.

64
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,200
And position my icon correctly.

65
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,210
Change the colour as usual.

66
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,910
And then also I changed this from email to username.

67
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,350
Right.

68
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,280
Okay.

69
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:13,340
Okay.

70
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,420
So I'm done.

71
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,190
I just grouped them.

72
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,270
See how it looks.

73
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,250
Hmm.

74
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,820
It looks good, but I feel like we have to reduce the intensity a bit.

75
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,450
So.

76
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,630
Every movie from 15 to 10.

77
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,460
Yeah.

78
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,260
No, I like what I see.

79
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,720
Okay.

80
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,120
So since this is.

81
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,340
Let me move the logging button from here.

82
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:58,640
Sorry.

83
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,350
This is supposed to be the log in but ended up designing the register, so I guess I'll just have to

84
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,130
rename.

85
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,630
The frame from logging to register and then rename the title to to register.

86
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,010
Okay.

87
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:13,820
Good enough.

88
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,640
Good enough.

89
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,180
So our next page you are going to design will be the login screen to do that.

90
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,000
We've basically done the everything we need.

91
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:24,970
Basically.

92
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:35,100
So to do that, I'm going to create a duplicate once again of the register screen this time of the register

93
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,680
screen.

94
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,430
So I just rename my register screen.

95
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:47,940
To log in and I change my title from register to log in and make sure that my title is censored.

96
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,420
Okay.

97
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,610
So we are almost done here.

98
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,170
We realize that the only thing that's different here, right?

99
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,540
Is that illustration.

100
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,690
And our button.

101
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,460
So.

102
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,430
We are going to.

103
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,880
Delete the email from here.

104
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,670
Okay, so I just noticed the mistake.

105
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,820
This page, guys, is supposed to be the register page and this is supposed to be the login page, not

106
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,130
the other way around.

107
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,650
Right?

108
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,410
So I guess we are correcting it in the design here.

109
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,860
So we just move along and work with that.

110
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,390
So I select this and I drag this up here.

111
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,550
Good.

112
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,170
So now we have our username and password.

113
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:57,530
I just have to change the text here from register to log in.

114
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:05,970
Mm hmm.

115
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,450
This looks good.

116
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,620
This looks good.

117
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,710
If you notice.

118
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,040
Yeah.

119
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:19,290
So the next thing I have to do is change the illustration I have here.

120
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:24,330
To do that, I have to go back to my illustrator file and then pick.

121
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,550
The illustration I want to use.

122
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:35,630
So to do that, I'll select the one I want to use by realize that it selects my targeted illustration

123
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,950
in the background.

124
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:42,800
As I told you earlier, to just select the illustration after D select the background.

125
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,010
So I press and hold shift and click on the background.

126
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,600
It selects the background for me.

127
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,410
Then I can now copy my illustration into Figma.

128
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:58,640
To do that I just press command C and I go into Figma and then Press Command to paste.

129
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:11,930
So I just drag it into my frame, delete this and then move it to the position is supposed to be let

130
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,070
me see the size of this.

131
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,330
This is 190.

132
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,430
So I guess.

133
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,700
190.

134
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,690
Good enough.

135
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,970
And we see this position.

136
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:26,850
I'm 90.

137
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,280
And we make it smaller.

138
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,590
Mm hmm.

139
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,580
That's good enough.

140
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,840
So we are almost done here if you look at the log in screen.

141
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,890
You realize that there's this icon here, right?

142
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,250
That is icon.

143
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:54,130
So to get that, we go back to our iconic I Plug plugin.

144
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,690
We go back to I quantify it and then such.

145
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,850
For the I.

146
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,780
All right.

147
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,190
So once we find it, we drag it.

148
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:14,530
You select what you want, the one you want, and then you drag it here into your frame.

149
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,300
So I have this now.

150
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,100
The only thing I have to do.

151
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,940
Sorry.

152
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,920
The only thing I have to do is now change the colour.

153
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:27,220
So I change it and then modify the opacity a bit.

154
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,430
Okay.

155
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,440
This looks good.

156
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,690
This is good enough.

157
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,230
Good enough.

158
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,860
Good enough.

159
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,730
Good enough.

160
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,560
What's happening here?

161
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,200
That's right.

162
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,620
Let's see how it looks.

163
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,460
It looks good.

164
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,790
So now we are done designing our three screens.

165
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,510
I promise you we are going to design at the end of the course.

166
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,880
So we have a welcome screen now.

167
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,510
We have our register screen and we have our login screens.

168
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,090
