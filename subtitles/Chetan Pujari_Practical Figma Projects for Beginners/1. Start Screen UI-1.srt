1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,230
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,960
Today I'll be taking you through.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,330
Basic Introduction to user experience.

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,840
User Interface Design.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,030
Okay.

6
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:20,500
Before we come to what we are seeing here, I'll give you a basic introduction on what that interfaces.

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:26,320
So sorry, your user interface is your like your app.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,800
It's easy for you and all these things.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,990
Do you understand what a design.

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,070
Exactly says now.

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:36,720
Hello, guys.

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,460
Yeah.

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,240
Yeah, I think.

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,480
And then user experience is how I think I send something to the group.

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:49,980
Yes, you are.

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,890
User interface is user experience.

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,200
So user experience is how you feel when you are interacting with a product.

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:57,900
You feel good.

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,440
When you are interacting with the product is an experience.

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,300
You feel bad when interacting with a product, you feel confused.

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,680
We are interacting with the product.

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,180
You feel angry, annoyed.

23
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,690
You get that this user experience.

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,910
How you feeling at interacting with.

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,980
Yes, with a product.

26
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:25,340
So just Google Sigma or type sigma dotcom, it takes you to the website.

27
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,700
You don't necessarily have to install it.

28
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,440
It's also a web based software, so you can use it in your browser.

29
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:34,870
Okay.

30
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,190
You just have to sign up.

31
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,640
As you can see here.

32
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:44,690
At a top here.

33
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,620
There's a bar.

34
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,190
I think it's similar for windows to.

35
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,130
The top.

36
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,360
Here is a bar that has already created some projects.

37
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,990
So.

38
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,180
You can see the various types, the types of the various projects.

39
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,660
Can you see that?

40
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,060
Yeah, I see that.

41
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,600
So it is craigslist redesign UX UI presentation.

42
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,430
Simple again.

43
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,520
Can you see that is up here?

44
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,890
Those are my project that I've created.

45
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,920
And beside the final project tab there is a plus icon.

46
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,840
Can you see it?

47
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:36,770
For those for those who just signed up for Figma, I'm sure you you just see that you see just the plus

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,840
icon on the the the tab update since you don't have any projects created.

49
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,280
So you can just click on the plus icon.

50
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,750
When you click the plus icon, you see.

51
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,130
Does see it.

52
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,120
You have the design file and then the fig jam file.

53
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,220
Now fig jam file is in.

54
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,540
Is a file that allows you to create.

55
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,530
Like your plan.

56
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:15,360
You plan with your team on your workflow or your project flow, but they are going to do on your project

57
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,900
to.

58
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,340
Is that how to help you plan?

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,970
Yes.

60
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:24,820
And a design file is a file to is where you design your projects.

61
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:30,600
So for this session, we are going to use the design file.

62
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:36,250
So we just click on that design file and then it takes us to our design workspace.

63
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,960
Can you see it?

64
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,630
Yes.

65
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,420
Okay.

66
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,350
All right.

67
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,640
So are we all here?

68
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,090
Have you been able to get to this interface?

69
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,410
And your various accounts.

70
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,300
It would just take you to.

71
00:03:59,330 --> 00:03:59,770
Okay.

72
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,530
So I think you do the interface, right.

73
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:09,840
So yes, this is Figma workspace where you create your designs.

74
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,630
In adults mostly desire.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,020
So up here we have the menu bar.

76
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,910
It has the jazzy toolbar.

77
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,490
I'll call it a toolbar slash menu.

78
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,960
Yes.

79
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,140
So it has the various tools that you need for your design work.

80
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,350
We have the move to here.

81
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:42,540
Move to move to wait, click on the rectangular thing and a dropdown appears and then you see move inside

82
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:48,330
and then skill inside and beside the move to is a mesh icon.

83
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,150
The mesh icon is a frame too.

84
00:04:54,290 --> 00:05:02,900
So when you are like you see frame the frame labels showing it also has a triangular thing at the side,

85
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,610
showing that you can drop down to a click on the one you see frame inside.

86
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,360
And then there's a slice, a slice to inside.

87
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:11,940
Okay.

88
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,280
So moving on, the next one is the shape to the shape tools.

89
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,580
Who has the dropdown icon beside it?

90
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,820
To show the world that you can find inside.

91
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,760
So can click on it.

92
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,880
You have the rectangle to the rectangle ship.

93
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:38,700
Sorry, the line, the arrow ellipse, polygon star and then image.

94
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,390
Right?

95
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,620
So the next one is the pen to join to.

96
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,360
Right click on the.

97
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,410
The rectangular thing beside it.

98
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,900
It drops down to show the pen to and then the pencil to the next.

99
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:04,030
Text to then be cited to the hunt to and then we have the comments to.

100
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,580
So moving on and then you have the on the same bar, you have the.

101
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,570
Name of the file here.

102
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,120
You can rename your file.

103
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:22,240
Currently we've not named it so is untitled, so we can choose to give it a title by double clicking

104
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,620
it.

105
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:29,080
And then when I double click, well, we'll be designing a simple log in.

106
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,400
So our name is logging in class.

107
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,130
This come from.

108
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,840
Okay, so now I renamed my file and what you see beside it, there's this small icon here.

109
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,740
It shows you the current account.

110
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,370
Your file is in, your design file is in.

111
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,190
So when I click on it, I'm thinking back to my draft site.

112
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,810
I don't need to go here.

113
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,350
I know.

114
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:07,940
And then the draft shows like the folder or the group that your project is currently in, you can choose

115
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,090
to create a team project.

116
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,550
Did you get it or just leave it in draft?

117
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,400
Currently I don't.

118
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,610
We don't need to create a team project, so I'm going to leave it in draft.

119
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,070
Okay.

120
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:27,350
And on I think you go here you have your you can view your profile.

121
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,000
You have this icon.

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,960
This time it's colored.

123
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,810
With the anime showing that since I'm called Jacqueline, my initials G.

124
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,570
If you are David, your initial D and so on, you have the share button on the bar as well.

125
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:51,540
You can use this button to share your file that you are working on with other designers or other collaborators.

126
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,000
It helps you collaborate through life with other people when working in Sigma.

127
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:03,330
So when I tap on the shared right, I get this dialog box that's like containing the options or what

128
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,470
I have to do to share.

129
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:12,060
So in this input, input the email of the person that you want or people that you want to share your

130
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:19,320
file or collaborate with on your work, whatever work they are doing in the figma.

131
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:19,860
Okay.

132
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,770
So that's that.

133
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:28,710
And then you have this play icon here, like the play icon enables you to preview what you are working

134
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,920
on.

135
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,910
So that's it.

136
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,440
And then the Zoom view option scaling.

137
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,210
So moving on, we have the Layers panel.

138
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:41,880
The Layers panel contains or shows the elements you've used in your design work so far.

139
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,770
And then you have the assets.

140
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,100
Your assets, the assets you used in your design.

141
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,590
So you a component, right?

142
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,640
And let me give you an example.

143
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:02,250
So if I'm in your design work, you are adding a customized color palette.

144
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:11,640
You can add it to the assets so that a user due out when you make a change to want one thing, it runs

145
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,030
two.

146
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:17,790
Or if they are going to use a particular button, right, say a logging button, they are going to use

147
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,630
it throughout.

148
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,780
You have a number of things you don't want to be changing.

149
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,300
If you make a change to one button, you don't want to go to make a change to all.

150
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,340
They say, I want ten different buttons.

151
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:36,540
You don't want to go to make a change to all those buttons, so you can just create the first button.

152
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:42,240
You will convert it to a component, and then you create an instance of the components.

153
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,150
That's it for the Layers and assets panel.

154
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,610
And then you have the page here.

155
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,550
You can create a number of pages here during your design file.

156
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,150
So moving on, moving on, moving on.

157
00:09:54,150 --> 00:10:00,990
On my right hand side, you see the design panel, the prototype panel and the inspect panel.

158
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:08,670
The inspects allows you to see the code of the access code or whatever it is you designed.

159
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:13,140
So okay, so you have the case as the under the Android I iOS.

160
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:21,420
And then so the design panel shows the properties of your design elements.

161
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:27,870
So currently I have a rectangle here and on the design panel you can see the various options or properties

162
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,770
of the rectangle.

163
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,430
You see the rectangle position, the size.

164
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,610
The angle, the visibility, the color, and so on and so forth.

165
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,700
Very good.

166
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,380
The prototype.

167
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,160
The prototype.

168
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:50,400
The prototype allows you to transition from one frame to another frame.

169
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,360
It allows you to do your animations, like your design.

170
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,720
As I said earlier today, with designing a simple login.

171
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,360
Okay.

172
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:01,570
Okay.

173
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:09,140
So moving on Behance and Drupal sites where as a designer, you can go to get inspiration.

174
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,450
It has a lot of.

175
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:18,450
You can get inspiration from other designer schools and you yourself can go to post your design work.

176
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,490
Let me share my web browser so that yeah, so this is dribble.

177
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,440
So if I design what type of designer that you are.

178
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,910
Motion designer, graphic designer.

179
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,440
User interface designer.

180
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,060
You can come here.

181
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:45,840
You an illustrator, you can come here to get ideas because it's this website curates a lot of work

182
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,920
from other designers and you yourself can post your design work.

183
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:56,340
So for what we will be designing today, we'll look for it here.

184
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,060
Right.

185
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,000
So I said I mentioned we be designing a simple again.

186
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,860
So I'm sketching log in here so that we choose one and work on.

187
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,760
We'll be doing mobile app design today.

188
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,290
So,

189
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,120
so yeah, we all decided to do this design.

190
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,410
Let me copy the image and paste it and figure.

191
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,270
Okay.

192
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:37,770
Are we ready to replicate this design login design screen?

193
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,310
Okay.

194
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,790
So the next thing we'll do is we'll create a frame.

195
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,720
Right.

196
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,760
We see that this is designed as a mobile app design.

197
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,120
So our frame, too should be a mobile frame.

198
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,430
It shouldn't be a web frame you get.

199
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,790
So we go to the mesh icon here, the top.

200
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:06,940
Put your present stream, tap on it, and then on the right hand side, you'll notice that the frame

201
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,220
options appears there.

202
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,330
Okay, so for that class, we'll be using iPhone 11 pro.

203
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,540
As a friend.

204
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,080
So yes, I tap on this and then is created here.

205
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,970
Moving on, I double tap in my layers panel.

206
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:35,160
With the first stream of dead selected I double tap the name here you can see that it's showing here

207
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,720
iPhone 11 pro max.

208
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,940
Hyphen one showing here.

209
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:45,940
I double tap on the name and then I rename name it into that screen.

210
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,070
Who's that string?

211
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,260
Okay.

212
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,030
I see that.

213
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,200
All right.

214
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:07,090
So now on this touch screen, we can see that some shapes.

215
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,000
In Texas, right?

216
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:19,470
So there's this there's this two large rectangle shapes here.

217
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:25,080
And then you have at the top is you have the pure shapes, pink filled shape.

218
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,100
And they have all these different, different, different, different shapes.

219
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:33,080
So first, what we are going to do is we are going to click.

220
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,600
This ship.

221
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,310
The shape of the mind.

222
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,910
The mind image are going to pictures on our screen.

223
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,230
Are we following?

224
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:46,720
You guys?

225
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,080
Yes.

226
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,820
Following your.

227
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:49,660
Okay.

228
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:57,290
So to create this, what I'll do is I'll go to the sheet to it's currently on rectangles I just click

229
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:57,920
it's.

230
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,780
And then I come here to my.

231
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,410
Dream.

232
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:14,990
And then I draw a shape, rectangular shape by dragging personhood, put in the mouse or trackpad,

233
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,180
and then dragging it to form.

234
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,140
She sighs.

235
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,300
You won't see my kids.

236
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,710
I guess I'll just leave it here.

237
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,030
Okay.

238
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,690
So I have my rectangle, the length of this thing, but I'm going to assume so.

239
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:42,500
I'll keep the height, adjust the height a bit and keep it up to 20 pixels.

240
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,850
And in the width I keep it at 115.

241
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,480
Okay.

242
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:59,300
So in the property here on the right hand side, you see there's x, the x position value, the Y position

243
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:07,370
value, the width of the the shape, the height of the shape, the angle, the angle of the shape that

244
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,920
is tilted, the Charleston angle, the ship.

245
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,420
And then we have the corner radius of the shape.

246
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:25,700
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to change the radius of the rectangle I created to achieve

247
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,860
this shape that we see here.

248
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:33,230
I'm going to try to achieve it by changing the radius of my rectangle.

249
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,000
We are getting.

250
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:35,730
Yeah.

251
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,390
Yeah, yeah.

252
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,120
With that changing of the.

253
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,880
Can I reduce of your ship?

254
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:44,880
You could either.

255
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:51,910
Use the camera and see the rounded things at the corner of the ship here.

256
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,340
Yeah.

257
00:16:54,370 --> 00:17:02,610
So you could, you could choose to drag this click and hold and then just drag to create the desired

258
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,740
effect you want.

259
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:12,570
Or you could just go to the corner video's input box and then enter the value you want depending on

260
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,710
whichever method you want.

261
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:16,920
So in my case, I guess this is easier for me.

262
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:25,170
So I'll just drag the corner the corners of the rectangle to create my own reduce so you see what's

263
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:25,890
happening.

264
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:33,420
But don't worry if you can't see the circular things, you just go to the input box and then type in

265
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,020
a value.

266
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,160
Okay.

267
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,690
So you get that.

268
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,870
These are sheep.

269
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,160
The image sheep.

270
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:45,960
The.

271
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,240
The ship similar to what you are seeing here.

272
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,360
Okay.

273
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,380
So now the next step is to.

274
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:04,540
The next step is to convert the ship into an image or put an image inside the ship.

275
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,280
The number of ways you can.

276
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,360
Bring an image into Figma, right.

277
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:19,210
You can decide to drag and drop the image and then max the shape that's currently here to the image

278
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:24,960
or you can directly convert the the shape we created into an image.

279
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:29,390
In our case, you are going to convert it into an image.

280
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:39,040
So I'm going to find a random image on Unsplash so we can all go to Unsplash.com and then find an image

281
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,420
and message.

282
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:42,340
Okay.

283
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,740
So I've chosen this.

284
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,480
I'm going to download it.

285
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,430
So now you don't have to image.

286
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:59,500
What you are going to do is we are going to convert the shape we created into an image.

287
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,340
You have to pay attention here.

288
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,100
So with a rectangle selected.

289
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,150
That fills the section of the design panel.

290
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,330
I click on the color here beside.

291
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,960
The code you see here.

292
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,420
But my ship selected.

293
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,260
Right?

294
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:30,180
The properties of the ship appears on the design panel, which is on your right, your far right.

295
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,500
And under the design panel, you have a cross section.

296
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,150
So it's your section, right?

297
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,940
And then another section you have.

298
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:50,050
This thing where you see a rectangle with a color and then you have the color code and then the intensity

299
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,880
of the color which is in percentage, right?

300
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:59,470
So what I did or I'm going to do is click on this rectangle beside the code.

301
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,160
When I click on it, something appears.

302
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:09,280
So with this thing and up here, there's solid.

303
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,890
When you go right, you see that there's a dropdown icon.

304
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:21,730
So I click on that and then there are options available in that menu appears, right?

305
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,780
In this case, I want to convert the image so the shape into an image.

306
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:26,890
So.

307
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,930
I select the image option.

308
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,230
Okay.

309
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,960
So.

310
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:37,790
I click on the Choose Image button here.

311
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,350
Then I go to the folder I downloaded my picture into.

312
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,600
So it isn't my picture I downloaded.

313
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,770
All right.

314
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:59,900
So now I'm showing you on notice that there's another rounded rectangle shape behind the first image.

315
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,260
Yeah.

316
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,990
So I'm not going to create the image from scratch.

317
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,970
What I'm going to do is I'm going to duplicate what I already created.

318
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,310
So in this case, I'm selecting the shape that I have.

319
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,150
And then for me, it's command D for windows.

320
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,200
You press and you press control.

321
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,140
Now you see that is duplicated.

322
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,280
Okay.

323
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:32,150
After you've done that, the thing won't duplicate, but instead I duplicate that less until you move

324
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,240
one of the duplicated things off.

325
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,790
Okay, so moving on, moving on, moving on.

326
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:45,170
Now, if you will notice, you see that the duplicate layer is on top of the original one, right?

327
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,390
Like it's in front of it.

328
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:53,330
So when I move it around, when it gets to the original one, it covers or overlaps the original one.

329
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:53,960
Right.

330
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,740
Now, what I want to do is I want to send it to the back and to send it behind the original layer.

331
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:06,890
So but that duplicate it enough to duplicate it with the copy selected.

332
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:17,060
I'm going to right click and then go to move to back.

333
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,520
So I move it to the back.

334
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,980
If you notice now the copy is behind the original.

335
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:23,790
I don't see it.

336
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,590
To achieve this effect they have here.

337
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,230
I think this thing is slightly.

338
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:32,910
Yeah.

339
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,670
Yeah, I did.

340
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:43,810
And we put a slight value on the picture so that that can sort of positioned my.

341
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:53,010
My copy in a way that's going to that's similar to, if anything, what you're trying to replicate here.

342
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,550
So before that, let me copy pick the color.

343
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,510
From what you're doing.

344
00:22:59,380 --> 00:22:59,830
So.

345
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:06,430
Okay, so let me teach her to pick a color to see you want to pick a color from something, right?

346
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,510
Like what we did.

347
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,590
Like the process we went to was trying to convince them that shaped an image.

348
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,900
You click on the film.

349
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,900
The rectangular, the colored rectangular box.

350
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:29,480
When you open here, you have the solid at the top, the huge color box here, then the things down

351
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:29,930
here.

352
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:34,160
You see, there's a drop icon here.

353
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,450
Can you see that?

354
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,780
Three tap on the drop icon and then you send it to the color that you want to pick.

355
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,990
So I'm trying to pick the red color in the guys t shirt.

356
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,240
When I tap on it, you notice that I've picked a color.

357
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:57,000
I created a shape here to fill it with that guy's color.

358
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,920
Thank you very much.
