00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,930
Hello, feature designers.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:06,060
Welcome to today's lesson on the UI UX training.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,650
Doing this interface.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,100
Okay, so this interface.

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:18,090
So today will be starting with this and then with time would move to this frame or this screen.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,770
So that's it.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:26,010
Firstly, what I would want to do is to get the icons down and then some.

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:27,860
Takes.

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,280
Okay, let's do that of the icon's face and then we can just start the project.

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:41,940
So if you log into Sigma, you would have to you see this interface and then you have to click on new

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,220
design, okay?

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,330
New design file.

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,580
So you click on this and then it's going to open the working environment or the working space for you.

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,720
So that said, let's go and then select the frame.

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,780
So I'm going to select this and then click on frame.

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,840
So I'm going to choose the iPhone Pro Max.

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,300
So let's frame and then let's see.

18
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,280
So let's use this.

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,030
Let me check here.

20
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,880
This should be what's so contact information.

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,270
So I'm going to rename here to contacts them just to contacts info, contact info.

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,290
And then what I would do next is to get the icons down.

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,450
So we need a Chevron and then this MO dialysis.

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,500
So I would do it.

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,980
So just right click and then go to plug ins.

26
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,420
Okay.

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,860
So from our previous lessons, we learned how to install plug ins.

28
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:49,020
So if you've not installed plug ins, you would have to go to manage not manage plug ins or browse plug

29
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,500
ins.

30
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:50,890
Okay.

31
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:59,760
So you browse plug ins where you would have to you learn to install the plug ins.

32
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,420
But we already have done that.

33
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,540
So we have I have for me, I have the design icon and I qualify.

34
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,730
It was taught in the previous lessons.

35
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,580
The Lucifer wouldn't be using that.

36
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,760
But it's an interesting project or.

37
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,450
Plug in that you might want to use.

38
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,150
So that said.

39
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,520
Or use material icons or let's start with icon ify.

40
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:28,880
So with the icon ify on our contact page, you can see we have the WhatsApp icon and then the telegram

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,510
icon.

42
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,920
So I'm going to search.

43
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,240
Okay.

44
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:37,040
So WhatsApp or so WhatsApp so we can just type here WhatsApp and I'm going to click this.

45
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,690
So.

46
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,270
Let me see.

47
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,930
Just click on Imports Icon.

48
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,440
So I should be the I contribute my screen.

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,700
So this icon and then I'll do same for that telegram.

50
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,320
So I qualify the search for telegram.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,510
Press enter now click on this then imports icon so it's imported.

52
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,030
Okay.

53
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,630
So I'm going to put this.

54
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,610
Sorry, this.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,700
So highlights all in the move them.

56
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,340
Okay.

57
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,490
Let's see.

58
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,020
And then I need the ellipses.

59
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,390
So we need the Chevron and then this ellipses.

60
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:42,110
Okay, so we use dots of the you can get dots in material icons and then iconic, but let's use dots

61
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,250
of material icon.

62
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,770
So that's way it's allowed.

63
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,120
Okay.

64
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,670
So it's taken a while to lose to all it lose.

65
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,750
Let's just try some.

66
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,370
If you look here, you can see the icons we selected.

67
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,190
You can see this seems to be separated.

68
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,860
So to make them one objects, you can just highlight all.

69
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,830
And then just use control g to group.

70
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,120
Or you can right click and then use look for group as group.

71
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,970
Okay, so why group them?

72
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,010
Okay, so I'm in group.

73
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,000
So.

74
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:22,920
The group.

75
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,420
So now they become one object and then I can resize them evenly.

76
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:30,850
Okay.

77
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,760
So they're going to do same for lots of what's up.

78
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,800
So you can see what is happening here.

79
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,980
So highlight and then group them.

80
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:45,610
So group selection and then I can move them as one objects or components.

81
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,160
Okay.

82
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,940
So our design icon is installed loading.

83
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,870
Let's try that for the.

84
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,850
There's no loading.

85
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,060
I qualify in search for something.

86
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,740
Okay, so it's back.

87
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,140
So I'm going to type here.

88
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,050
Chevron.

89
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,130
Chevron.

90
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,400
Think so.

91
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,100
We want this.

92
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,970
So just let me change the size face.

93
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,930
So engage in this size to this size them later.

94
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,800
And then you can also change the color.

95
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,110
Let's give it this color value and I will just drag it here.

96
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:25,720
Okay.

97
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,840
And then once that's for the more so more which is going to give us a three ellipses.

98
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,250
So we want this one to.

99
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:34,980
Okay.

100
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,420
So I'm going to drop it here.

101
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,250
And then we won that.

102
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:46,440
So.

103
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:53,610
Let's see the message phone and then the this one.

104
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,510
Email and then also the floating action button and then the search.

105
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,460
Okay, so I'm going to do that quick.

106
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,390
So search.

107
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,090
So we have such.

108
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,150
And then I'll take that off the email.

109
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,750
So email.

110
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,540
Then let's look for.

111
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,150
Phone.

112
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,040
Phone.

113
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,110
So such a phone.

114
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,280
So phone.

115
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,420
Let me take this.

116
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,880
Okay.

117
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,390
Let me just move the C then I'm going to search for message.

118
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,890
Message.

119
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,770
Okay, so we have the message.

120
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,580
And then let's search for the odd button.

121
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,420
So out.

122
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,550
He's going to give us our floating action button.

123
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,570
So just here.

124
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,380
Okay.

125
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,600
So I can close you now.

126
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,240
And our interface looks.

127
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,400
So.

128
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,370
Can.

129
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,700
Would just leave them.

130
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,300
That's.

131
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,730
Let's leave them that way or better, so we can just highlight or resize them.

132
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,930
So I'm just going to hold on shift and then resize them.

133
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,770
Space airplane in transit.

134
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,580
Just recites them individually.

135
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,880
If something changes.

136
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,130
So let's do it this way.

137
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:54,080
So now if you look here, you would see we have the Chevron and then we have the text.

138
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,740
That's how the more icon.

139
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:03,440
So this actually is just the background colour of the frame.

140
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,750
So what we do is and then let's do this.

141
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,140
So this is just a line.

142
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,110
So as you see, it's a line.

143
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,100
So I'm going to have to pick a line.

144
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:20,030
So just let line and then let's draw from somewhere, this place.

145
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:20,860
Okay.

146
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:26,150
So to get the perfect or to make sure your line is straight, he's on shift.

147
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,780
So you can see when I leave shift, it's not straightened.

148
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,520
So when I hit, shift it straight in.

149
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:33,870
Okay.

150
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,500
And then I'm going to give it a height of one.

151
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,940
What's this opening?

152
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:45,790
Yeah.

153
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,110
Okay.

154
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,720
So it's already sets one.

155
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,740
And then so here it's really sets one and then I'll give it a color.

156
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,030
So it says true cookie the color value of this.

157
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,710
So we already have this call, so I'll just pick this one.

158
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,150
Okay.

159
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,280
Let's see.

160
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,080
It's a.
