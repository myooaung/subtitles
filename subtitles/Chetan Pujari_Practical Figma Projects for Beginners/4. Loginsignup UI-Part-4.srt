00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:03,800
Welcome to this fake McCoys.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,110
So let's move along.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,250
Let's move along.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,630
Okay.

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:17,390
So the next thing we are going to do is add the welcome text above the illustrations here.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:26,760
So to do that, I either select the text two on the menu bar or just type T on my keyboard and then

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,650
I click anywhere in my.

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,240
In my free.

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,740
I stopped typing.

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,460
So welcome.

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:36,940
Okay.

12
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,010
So I sent out.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,600
It has all the properties I need.

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,080
If it's not enough, it's not good enough for you.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,680
You can change the text properties here.

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,700
Okay, so I have everything sent.

17
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,620
I have everything done for now.

18
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,770
Let's see how it looks when I preview it.

19
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,880
Okay.

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,330
So it looks good.

21
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,160
Good enough.

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,750
I could try.

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,540
Bring in the wall.

24
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,370
Come down a bit.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,520
So that it could be more in view.

26
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,900
Bring the illustration down a bit and.

27
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,750
Bring down the wall.

28
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,740
Come a bit.

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,550
Okay.

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,010
Okay.

31
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,130
I look at this and it looks good.

32
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,040
It looks good.

33
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:41,380
Now, when we look at the design here, we realize that there's some shapes here are the corner is not

34
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:51,550
true such that some designs here to do this designs to do this designs, I'm going to select the ellipse

35
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,370
to form the shapes to choose.

36
00:01:54,550 --> 00:02:01,930
So yeah, I select the ellipse and to draw a perfect circle I press and hold, I press down shift I

37
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,310
press and hold shift.

38
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,750
And then I start drawing my ellipse to whatever shape I want it to be.

39
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,610
Okay, so this is good enough for me.

40
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,310
I just push it to the corner.

41
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:18,850
Yeah.

42
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,580
Okay.

43
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,670
So I put my shape, I push it to the corner.

44
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,570
It looks good.

45
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,690
The next thing I'm going to do is change this color to this.

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:38,960
So to do that, I go to the floor once again and I change the option here from solid to linear.

47
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,890
I'm giving it a linear gradient.

48
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,900
So I tap, I select the first color option.

49
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,790
I said again using the eyedropper to I pick my color.

50
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,790
Okay.

51
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,130
So it looks like.

52
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,480
This is hitting.

53
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,900
So I'll just drag it down and beat the opposition as well so that I can see my cut up.

54
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,920
Bring this down.

55
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,310
It looks good enough.

56
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:21,410
Then on top on the next one, X color option increase the intensity from 0 to 100 and pick the eyedropper

57
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,360
again, then tap on it.

58
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:25,670
Yeah.

59
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,670
It looks good.

60
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,900
It looks good.

61
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,930
See how it looks when I preview it.

62
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,250
And those good.

63
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,150
Close enough.

64
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,280
And we bring this down a bit, maybe reduce the size a bit.
