1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:01,970
So hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:07,340
So welcome to the continuation of our previous lesson thus for our my home screen.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,150
So this was able to do in our previous lesson.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:16,850
So now today we will be doing this.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,610
So try and finish up with this.

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,700
So let's get started.

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,570
So first we'll do the results and then we just have to do some images.

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:27,110
Okay?

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,950
But what I would have to do is what I did was to go to Pixabay.

10
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:31,520
Okay.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,700
In our previous lesson, I'll show you how to copy.

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:34,930
Okay?

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,710
So just good pixabay and then just copy the image.

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,610
So use copy right click and then copy image of the copy.

15
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:51,950
You just have to come to your working environment and then control the right click and then paste it

16
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:52,310
here.

17
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,510
Okay, so this was our pasted.

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,490
Okay, so let's do that.

19
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,520
So the avatar or the proof of this, okay.

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,800
So to do that, we've already learned that.

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,420
So the left too.

22
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,280
So I'm just going to do as one example and all the rest will be on assignment for you.

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:10,790
Okay.

24
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,550
So the ellipse and then I'm going to hit on shift.

25
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,230
Draw.

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,400
Then let's pick this animal, this image.

27
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,650
Let me send this to boxer.

28
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,430
Right click.

29
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,940
And then if I do it this way, it won't work.

30
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,550
Okay, so right click and then use us mask.

31
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,480
So it didn't work.

32
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,180
So Control Z, we won't do.

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,090
So I have to send this behind.

34
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,550
So right click.

35
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,190
Then sent back the then highlights.

36
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,710
Also, you can see I've highlighted a circle and then this image and the right click.

37
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,400
And then they'll use us.

38
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,240
Musk.

39
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,680
So now we have it.

40
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,130
Okay.

41
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:03,800
So even with the right position, it's where you want in the image.

42
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,070
So you can do that for the others.

43
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:12,850
Okay, so I'm done with mine and then I'm going to resize it.

44
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,760
So I'm going to use 39 by 39.

45
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,190
That's nine.

46
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,930
By Tatiana.

47
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,080
Okay.

48
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,070
Then I'll do.

49
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,120
Same for this.

50
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:33,790
Okay.

51
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,600
And then do for the last one here.

52
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,440
Okay.

53
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,760
So we can just move it here.

54
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,290
Move them here.

55
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,640
So now let's see what we have to do.

56
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,170
We have to do that.

57
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,480
All the text for reasons and then this.

58
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:11,990
Okay.

59
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,180
So an in the distance.

60
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,890
So 34.

61
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:17,820
So that's it.

62
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,360
Four.

63
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,910
So let them bring you here.

64
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,210
Then our hood out.

65
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,750
And then the distance.

66
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,810
So the distance is 65.

67
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,120
I'm going to change to 34.

68
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,190
So with the arrow key, Kayla, stick it up.

69
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,750
So you get 34.

70
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,600
Okay.

71
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,910
So that's what I should be for the reason.

72
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,760
Schroder So the reason not the image.

73
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,660
So.

74
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,970
So I'll do is just to copy this.

75
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,570
Okay.

76
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,780
I'll copy this and.

77
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,990
See or.

78
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,830
Let me see.

79
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,250
It's normal.

80
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,490
This is normal.

81
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,950
You need to normal.

82
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,520
Okay.

83
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,880
And then this size, it's 14 pixels.

84
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,410
Soon, you need to know more.

85
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:29,800
So let me just use this control C, control V and then I'm going to move it here.

86
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,670
So we'll just do a regular.

87
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,340
I don't think I have normal here so I'll a regular and then I'm going to type recent.

88
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,490
Who the spelling is.

89
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,750
Coke resents.

90
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,910
Resents.

91
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,460
So there is no s the E.

92
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,760
So really sense here.

93
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,800
So I would have to change this to.

94
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,390
Semi boat or better.

95
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,220
So let's give it this value.

96
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:21,490
Okay.

97
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,350
So the mobile is semi boat and then is 20.

98
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,220
So then we do this also 20.

99
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,750
Semi boat and I'll give you 20.

100
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,720
So I'm just going to enter to zero.

101
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,800
Okay.

102
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,580
I'm going to use this vertical ruler.

103
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,190
Okay.

104
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,900
Once our distance to align at this point.

105
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,780
Okay, so let's okay.

106
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:53,800
And then what we can do is just to copy this control, see less shifts and then copy that to control

107
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,830
C, control V, they are going to move it here.

108
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:58,930
Okay.

109
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,790
So then in name.

110
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,920
So let's see what we have for our.

111
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:12,320
So since you have the name and any contacts and then we have some ellipse and then a divider.

112
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,140
Okay.

113
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,720
So we'll have to do that.

114
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,070
So give any name here.

115
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,800
So I'm going to use Bright.

116
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,270
So bright.

117
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,540
And then we just move this image here.

118
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,190
So let's check the distance.

119
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,800
So there's some ten.

120
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,180
So it's actually in a box in this ship.

121
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:58,640
So what you can do, you can use the rectangle to then just draw here.

122
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,000
From here to hear.

123
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:11,360
Okay.

124
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:19,330
Then its size is 375.

125
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,700
Height is 60.

126
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,210
It's 60.

127
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,660
So the height is 60.

128
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,070
So height.

129
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,880
375.

130
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,410
Okay.

131
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,160
What is happening?

132
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:45,000
So let me just stretch it here and then I can just highlight all of this.

133
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,630
So highlights this, these let's bring it here.

134
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,360
Then I'm going to right click and then bring two fronts.

135
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,890
We'll just take it book.

136
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,270
So it escalates.

137
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,990
So just change it to whites.

138
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,140
Now we would need a divider.

139
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,880
Or let's start with this.

140
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,320
Let's do this.

141
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,850
But first, okay, so let me see here, then I'll bring right here.

142
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,220
An another ruler here.

143
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,460
So I want to start chestnuts where the contest starts.

144
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,840
And I also bring you here.

145
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:30,670
Okay.

146
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:35,740
So I'm going to have to use both and see the distance here.

147
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:49,240
See the distance from the recent races to the shape is 12 so 12 pixels.

148
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,520
So let me see recent.

149
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,970
Photos and and check that.

150
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,280
So it's nine here, so we should take it down.

151
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,800
So I guess.

152
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,620
Well, okay, so 912.

153
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,220
Okay.

154
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,760
And then hold.

155
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,630
So I think this is okay.

156
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,100
We want.

157
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,190
Okay.

158
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:20,590
So if we look here, you'll see we have the three ellipses or the more icon.

159
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,350
So I'm going to have to just select this icon control C, control V, then bring it here.

160
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:27,760
Okay.

161
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,480
We can just give it some degrees here.

162
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,260
So I used 90.

163
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:41,410
And then this position itself to be a horizontal, not physical.

164
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:47,170
Now I would have to change its color to this gray color.

165
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,270
Okay.

166
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,110
Then let's see.

167
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,280
Try and center it.

168
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,230
Yes, I think it's been here.

169
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,920
Okay.

170
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,750
I'll check the distance.

171
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,650
So let's see the distance.

172
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,570
It seems to be at the edge of this.

173
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,490
So let's see here.

174
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,170
Well, let me use the ruler.

175
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:14,990
Okay.

176
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,840
So I think it's perfect.

177
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,840
So that should be it for this part.

178
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,280
So the only thing we are left with is let me just group or let's just leave it this way.

179
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:26,670
Okay?

180
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,940
We'll continue populating the list as you have here.

181
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,660
So this a list list view, so populate it and then we'll do that of the floating action button and then

182
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,290
we are done.

183
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,040
So thank you.

184
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,240
And then see the next lesson.
