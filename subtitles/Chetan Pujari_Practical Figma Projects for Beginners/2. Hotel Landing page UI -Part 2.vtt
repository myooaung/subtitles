00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.300
Hello there.

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.320
Welcome to this UI UX design course.

3
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.190
I hope you enjoy the course as you move along with me.

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.410
Okay, so to do this, I have to create the search icon.

5
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.880
So to do that.

6
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.620
I will be using a plugin in Figma today.

7
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.450
I'll be using I quantify, which is a plugin I mostly use for my work.

8
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.910
In case you don't have that installed or you don't know how to install that in figma, I'll take you

9
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:31.180
to.

10
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.860
So to do that right click any place or any space in your figma then select plugins you see a dropdown

11
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.700
menu.

12
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.210
In the dropdown you can go to browse like in the community.

13
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.870
That's if you don't already have the iconic plugin installed.

14
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:57.110
In my case, I have it installed so you can see it in the list of plugins I have installed here.

15
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:04.590
So if you don't have it installed, just select browse plugins in community and it takes you to a community.

16
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.510
Just type.

17
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.310
I qualify here.

18
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.340
I qualify?

19
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.180
Then search.

20
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.290
Click on the search.

21
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.330
They select plug ins, appear PSU.

22
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.260
That explains it shows you all the plug ins and I quantify.

23
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.000
So here, if you don't have a store, you are going to see the install button, then just click on it

24
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.710
is an instance in store.

25
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.730
If you have it in store, you are going to see something like this in store as you have seen on my laptop.

26
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.380
Okay.

27
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.590
So back to our design.

28
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.950
Back to our design, since I already have I quantify I radically go to plug ins and then select I quantify

29
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.240
in my plugin list.

30
00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.130
Right?

31
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:06.330
So from here I guess search for search the search icon, essential search.

32
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.430
Yeah, I get how it sounds.

33
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:09.080
Okay.

34
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:15.150
So I get, I select an option from the options presented to me.

35
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.750
In this case I'll just click and drag to an empty space or my figma, then I workspace and then I close

36
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.080
it.

37
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.820
So I have this, I just drag it to my frame.

38
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.660
Yeah, it's small, so the only thing I'm going to have to do is increase its size so that becomes visible

39
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.320
enough.

40
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.210
For users to see.

41
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.300
Okay.

42
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.710
I was looking.

43
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.420
Okay.

44
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.350
So my search has a big head compared to the other.

45
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.520
It seems smaller, it has a big head and to be a bit similar to what is there.

46
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.720
So I'll have to look for another search I can go back to.

47
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.160
I quantify search,

48
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.350
I may see them go to the next page to see my options presented.

49
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.980
Okay, I think this is good for me, so I'll select this.

50
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.640
Is so.

51
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.420
I just increase the size to 40.

52
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.680
Let's see how it looks.

53
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.750
This good enough?

54
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.650
Yeah.

55
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.520
It was good enough.

56
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.450
Looks close.

57
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:37.390
Then I reduce the size and the color opacity or color intensity from 100% to 50%.

58
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.150
Yes, yes, yes.

59
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.190
I love what I have so far.

60
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.930
So the next thing I'm going to do, the next I'm going to have to do is create this.

61
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.920
Shape we see here.

62
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:54.570
Right.

63
00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:04.050
The shape I'm going to create the to do that I'll select the square to from the to the shape choose

64
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.410
and then.

65
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.220
Create a shape here.

66
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.570
Make it big enough.

67
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:19.520
Okay.

68
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.900
So the height 590 and then.

69
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.630
With 630.

70
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.690
Okay.

71
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.800
Okay.

72
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.200
So the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to round the corners, but now I'm going to do it a bit

73
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.360
differently from what we usually know.

74
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.230
I'm going to round the corners independently, the four corners independently.

75
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.710
So to do that, I go here and I select this independent corners button here.

76
00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:01.530
Then it gives me the various input options for the various four corners of the shape I have there on

77
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.310
my frame.

78
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.290
So yes, the first corner, I'm going to give it a 100.

79
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.160
And the second one, I'll give it a 50.

80
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.630
Then the third one, I'll give it a 50 as well.

81
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.180
Then the final one.

82
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.560
I'll give it 100.

83
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.290
No, no, no, no, no, no.

84
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.110
So the third one, I have to give it 100 and a final one.

85
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.220
I give it to 16.

86
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.810
It doesn't look too close as there.

87
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:40.890
So what I'm going to do is instead of changing the you could choose to continue changing the values

88
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:41.340
here.

89
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.500
But for me, I'll use these dots that you see here in the squares.

90
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.800
I'm going to use these here to round it further so that it looks closer to this.

91
00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:00.570
So to do that, in order to not round all the shapes as ones I have to press in order to know round

92
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:07.140
all the shapes, the corners at once, I have to press option or all on the keyboard.

93
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.150
They're around.

94
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.790
Okay.

95
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.200
So I think I would just have to ground it like that.

96
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.680
Okay.

97
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:18.960
So around.

98
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.390
This looks good enough.

99
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.880
Two for 250, 250 looks good enough for me.

100
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.880
So I just run the 250 as well.

101
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.750
Hmm.

102
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.160
Yeah.

103
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.110
This looks close enough.

104
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.610
I'm proud of what I've done.

105
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.980
I'll just reduce the width a bit.

106
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.050
So I do the rest.

107
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.740
Yeah.

108
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.710
So I'll just make a square instead of a rectangle.

109
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.690
So now my width.

110
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.520
Value is the same as my height value.

111
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.510
So my width is 590 and my height is 590 as well.

112
00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.890
So the shape is 590 by 590.

113
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:08.430
So I move it a bit away from the left because, you know, I have the social media icons I have to put

114
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.420
here, so I have to move it a better way to create space for that.

115
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.580
Okay.

116
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:16.240
Good.

117
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.210
Aha.

118
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.530
So now I have my sheep.

119
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:26.520
The next thing I'm going to do is to fill my sheep with images.

120
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.180
This time I'm going to use a plug in again.

121
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.230
So to do that already you how to install a plug in.

122
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.910
So I'm going to use an splash plugin.

123
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.350
So I already have it installed.

124
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:44.360
So if you don't have it installed, use the elements that I told you on how to install plug in to install

125
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.680
on splash as well.

126
00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.540
Okay.

127
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:51.110
So right click select on splash from my plug in to activate it.

128
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.280
Okay.

129
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:57.200
So if your internet is fast, it's actually loads up faster.

130
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:02.750
But I think I have I have a little issue with my connectivity here.

131
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.280
So it's taking some time.

132
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.960
Well, it just loaded.

133
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:06.410
Okay.

134
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:13.880
So to continue, what I'm going to do is we see that this looks like a living room.

135
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:18.920
So I'm going to search for living room images.

136
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.450
So I just search for a lever.

137
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:24.540
Nice.

138
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.360
I have gorgeous and nice, beautiful pictures here.

139
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.510
I just select the first time since that looks good enough for me.

140
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:39.110
So yeah, in order to make sure that your image feels your shape, you have to make sure that that shape

141
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:40.380
is selected for you.

142
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.760
Click on the image to get the downloaded into the shape.

143
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.480
I hope that is understood.

144
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.550
Okay, so now I have my shape.

145
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.410
This looks good enough for me.

146
00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:54.230
Okay.

147
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:56.150
Okay.

148
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.730
Okay.

149
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:57.240
Okay.

150
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:57.750
Okay.

151
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.380
Okay.

152
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:00.540
Yeah.

153
00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:03.780
Looks good enough for me.

154
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.790
So the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create a text here for lives.

155
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.500
Biggest moves to do that.

156
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.870
Once again, I find my text too.

157
00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:14.530
Then I click on it.

158
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.860
And then I start.

159
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.340
I click on my frame and start typing.

160
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.580
Biggest life, biggest moves.

161
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:28.620
So I think these are fun bits.

162
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.720
That's a 60.

163
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.670
And instead of semi bold.

164
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.440
Let me make it bold.

165
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:38.820
Yeah.

166
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:39.980
Oh, look.

167
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.550
Good enough.

168
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.460
Stretch to 70 and see how it looks.

169
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.330
Okay.

170
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.580
Food is a bit too much, too cerebral.

171
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:53.860
Okay, I like this.

172
00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:54.460
I like this.

173
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.250
So I'll just maintain the semi symbols.

174
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.280
Okay.

175
00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.150
Okay.

176
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.640
The next thing we are going to do is we are going to create this.

177
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.760
With our hearts who test down here.

178
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.890
So once again.

179
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:17.400
I'll just duplicate this here so I don't have to reset.

180
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.900
The properties, tax properties.

181
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:29.370
So we can choose the type or just use a lorem ipsum something.

182
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.130
So with whose use?

183
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:02.520
Well.

184
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:08.700
Okay.

185
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.680
So I checked the spacing between this and this.

186
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:24.090
To do that, you can just select one of the the items and then press and hold auto option on your keyboard

187
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.960
and then hover over the next element you want to compare the distance to.

188
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.430
So let me move it to make sure it's 40.
