1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:09,240
The next thing we are going to do is to create the hero text and create the dynamic hero text attached

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,280
to it, which is the group.

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,310
You find a text too.

4
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:24,940
And then type our hero copy and make the necessary changes to the texts settings.

5
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:52,460
We then duplicate a text layer and then type glue.

6
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,740
And once you're done with that, we duplicate it and then type.

7
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,020
So then we change the colors.

8
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:20,040
Using the earlier method, we create a mask for our text layers to match them.

9
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:22,330
Once we are done creating our component to move it to the top, to start creating our interactive components

10
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,930
so we create a variance of the first group.

11
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:35,320
And then what we do is we select the bar to select just the by how to press command on your keyboard

12
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,940
and then use the mouse to select what you want to select.

13
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,120
After you select the bar, you move it to your left.

14
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:53,080
And then we go through we select our mask from the Layers panel, and then we adjust the marks to hide

15
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,980
the groove.

16
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,140
Once we're done with that, we create another variant.

17
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,650
In this new variant.

18
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:17,180
What we are going to do is we are going to make the growth text disappear and the saw text visible,

19
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,110
even though they are both still going to be hidden within the max.

20
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:30,380
To do that, we'll press on the AI icon to make the good heading and then the icon also to make it appear

21
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:34,790
so that when we slide back, what we see will be the saw instead of the growth.

22
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,580
Now we we're done with that.

23
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,300
We create another variant.

24
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,170
In this variant, we are going to make the saw up here.

25
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:50,960
We select the by using the command slash control key and then the mounts to isolate that.

26
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,030
And then we drag it to the right.

27
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,010
Then we select the max layer from our layers panel and drag it to our right as well.

28
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,330
And as you can see, the saw text is what appears now.

29
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,010
It's not the growth text.

30
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,730
We then create another variant of our components and this variant we are going to hide that.

31
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:25,700
So again, so we drag, we select the bar, drag it to our left side, select the component once again

32
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:33,380
and drag it to our left side so that I saw disappear that we create another component.

33
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:42,080
And as we did earlier, we switch, we make sure the growth is visible in this component and the saw

34
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:49,520
is hidden in this, even though they are both hidden in the max layer we're going to be creating in

35
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,270
this component is the row, which is what you created.

36
00:04:53,270 --> 00:05:01,370
Initially, we select the bar slider to its original position, the right, and then select the mask

37
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:08,210
slider to its original position and now it shows go instead of.

38
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:19,340
So once you're done with that, we go to the prototype section to connect a variant to make the component

39
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,150
interactive.
