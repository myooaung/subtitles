1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:02,530
So here.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:10,060
So with the useful links, here are some links that you can get free or page resources like images,

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:15,400
icons, colors, illustrations, fonts, animation, and then where to get inspiration.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,050
BLOCK okay.

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:25,780
So a community like so we can visit from Google dot com and then you have good number of fonts that

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,050
you can use in your design UI.

7
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:29,510
Okay.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,760
So these are the properties you can go through them and then we have its icon.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,870
So fonts click here or better.

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,620
So I'm just going so fonts dot google dot com and then slash icons.

11
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:48,930
So here you can see we have icons that you can use when you click on them to give you the properties,

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,340
then you can download them as PNG or SVG.

13
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,720
You can also click here to change the white.

14
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,300
We have the Android, iOS, flutter and the likes.

15
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,870
They can download them either SVG or PNG.

16
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,870
So SVG scalable vector graphics.

17
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,040
So you can change the colors, you can scale it to any size, resize it.

18
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,690
And then if you come to illustration, look here we have fun.

19
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:21,310
Sekiro so far scrolls is a good place if you want fonts for certain projects.

20
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,390
Then we have the illustrations we have on Draw.

21
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:32,380
So this on draw, you click on it and then you can download it as SVG or PNG.

22
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,920
So if you come here, I think you can even change the color.

23
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,370
So, so, so let's say we want this color case.

24
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,030
We can see how in effects you can search for.

25
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,640
So let's say running or run.

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,400
So you can see what we have here.

27
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,890
So you can download them and then use them your projects when it comes to colors.

28
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:02,790
You have coolest, coolest school, so it is a good place, a good community where you can generate

29
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,090
colours.

30
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,390
So let's see me explore trending palettes.

31
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,120
I'm going to explore trending palettes.

32
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,340
So these are pilots that are trained in and then you can use them, a combination of them.

33
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,600
So let's click here, copy it, and you can use it in your project.

34
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:31,980
Let's click here, can click view pallets and it is the pallets for this particular one or this.

35
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:42,890
This is so you have the hex HSP which these are like hex you saturation and it goes into B and then

36
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,680
so these are things that you can copy through and click to copy.

37
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,610
You can use it.

38
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:55,260
Just go to your projects and figma or any designing software and then paste it inside.

39
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,190
So when I go back and I go to the generator, so I'm going to generate some colors.

40
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,510
So these are the colors so you can work on these properties to change the colors.

41
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:15,010
So let's see if we can work on this you and see what is happening.

42
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,140
Then copy it.

43
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,590
You can see the color.

44
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,050
Okay.

45
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,290
So there are lots of things that you can do here.

46
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,490
So you can export.

47
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,240
See?

48
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,320
So you have to go through it and then whatever suits you, we use it.

49
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,870
And then we have the material palette dotcom.

50
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:32,440
Okay.

51
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:38,830
So here if you click if I click on icons, it should give me icons that I can use.

52
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:41,210
Okay.

53
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:47,340
So you can see icons that can use when I click on this it gives me the option to see was PNG, Fiji,

54
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,770
iOS, Android and maybe if you are a programmer you can use this code.

55
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,660
Okay then we have colours.

56
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:56,540
Okay.

57
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,090
So you can come here and click on the colours you want and then copy them.

58
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,350
Then we have the palettes.

59
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,760
So the palettes, let's see.

60
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,320
So this one of Android.

61
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,250
So I'm going to select two colours, so pink and then let's see, light blue.

62
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:16,950
So you can see it's giving me the material, material view or material palette for this Android device.

63
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:23,220
So if I come here, you can see the colour codes here and then you can download them.

64
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:31,020
I then give you the options, CSS and the likes PNG, SVG, you click on download, then you can use

65
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,630
it in your projects so you can see it's giving me the pink and then the blue selected.

66
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,090
So you can do that for any of these lists.

67
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,020
So let's move to cool.

68
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,020
So my current sorry colour space, my colour space.

69
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,290
So here too is a good place to generate gradient colours.

70
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,100
So let me see.

71
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,080
I want to make a combination of gradient.

72
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,110
So when I click on Generate, it's going to generate ingredients for me.

73
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,010
So you can see I have some ingredients that I can use my.

74
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,090
Rejects Sue.

75
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,720
A combination of these should give you some credence.

76
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,320
We use them in your projects just as you see two colors.

77
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,690
This so these two colors.

78
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,050
So the formula of green and violets.

79
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,090
So gradients two colors.

80
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,350
Trying to fuse together.

81
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,110
Then we have this icon eight.

82
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,920
So Icon eight is a good place to get illustrations, photos, icons and the likes.

83
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,080
You can click on it.

84
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,260
You might want to read the terms and conditions.

85
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,530
Also, how to use the files that you download here.

86
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,010
I really like the 3D option.

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,660
It's taking longer for my internet to load, but this is what you should get and several other 3D files

88
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,090
that you can use in your projects.

89
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,410
And I'm going to go to here so if icons dot com so it gives you the option to preview.

90
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,510
So when I click on preview, you can download it.

91
00:05:54,510 --> 00:06:00,690
So let me preview and then we'll see this added tons of color illustrations that we have or.

92
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,830
As in icons that we can use in our projects.

93
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,590
You can download them for free, then use them in your projects.

94
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:11,840
Okay.

95
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,160
So I've done with.

96
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,830
Okay, I'm done with this.

97
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,880
So Unsplash is also a good community website where you can download images and then use them in your

98
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,840
projects too.

99
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,660
You might want to check these places.

100
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:33,560

I use pixabay and it's like freelance.

104

You can use it for free, both commercial and then for personal use.

105
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:53,450
No attribution is required, so you can see the Pixabay license free for commercial use.

106
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,770
No attribution required.

You can download them and then use them in your projects by just clicking here.

108
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,500
We also have pixels.

109
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,360
So pixels is a good place to also download your things images for projects.

110
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,410
Stock those too.

111

Lucy.

114
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:13,980
So Lucy.

115
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,570
Lucy.

116
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,280
Or demonstrates something later.

117
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,270
Somewhere in the course.

118
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,400
Or maybe after some presentation.

119
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,590
A guide to UI UX to this.

120
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:30,590
You want a community so you can visit the visit IO blog where you can learn more about UI and UX and

121
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,010

00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,480
And then we have dribble.

124
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,220
So dribble.

125
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,840
So you can get images, inspirations from where you can learn.

126
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,040
Remember told you to copy and then improve.

127
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,990
So there's a good place to copy what people are doing for inspiration or methods here.

128
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:58,490
They can work on their projects, improve or just try to learn something and then improve yourself where

129
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,380
you copy.

130
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,160
And then we have templates free vs dotcom template free vs dotcom.
