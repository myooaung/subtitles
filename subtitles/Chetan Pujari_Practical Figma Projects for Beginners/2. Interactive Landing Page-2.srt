1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,320
Next thing we are going to build is the interactive component.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:10,200
Our main theme for the video, we're going to build an interactive component for the backend.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:17,610
So the first thing we're going to do is select a frame, greater frame on which we get our interactive

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,390
components and then create a grid.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,400
The grid is not necessary.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,400
It's just to guide me.

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,860
It's just to create that margin for me so that I don't design out of that.

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:40,170
Another method you can use to align your design as to draw the guidelines from the ruler if you don't

9
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:48,480
have it turned on, can turn it on by using the shift, our shortcuts or your keyboard, and then you

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:58,620
just drag the guideline from the ruler, press our on your keyboard to select the Rectangle two and

11
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,920
then draw it on your artboard or frame and make changes to the properties.

12
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,160
We said the color to Lena in this case.

13
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,780
He changed the face colour to the darker shade of blue and the second colour to the lighter shade of

14
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,110
blue.

15
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:30,330
He then said the colonel reduced to five and then pressed C on the keyboard to select the text to and

16
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,560
we type work with us on a rectangular shape.

17
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,760
Make sure I text a center aligned.

18
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,140
And we change the properties of the text

19
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,130
after searching the properties of the text.

20
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:57,780
The next thing we do is select both the text and the rectangle and group it to group our selection.

21
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,580
We press command open to D on the keyboard.

22
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:08,360
Once again, we have to make sure as well aligned is aligned in the center of the rectangle.

23
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:14,060
After making those adjustments, rename our group to Action Button.

24
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:24,260
When we are done, we convert a button to a component by clicking on the component icon at the top of

25
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,040
the window.

26
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:31,640
Once you've created a component, you notice that component symbol is now changed to add variance and

27
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:31,960
add that.

28
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,020
Add another variance.

29
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:39,740
We click on that button and then it creates another variance for us, which we can edit to show another

30
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,720
state of our components.

31
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:51,230
For this variant, we are going to create a shadow, so we just duplicate the rectangle and then we

32
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,390
set the properties.

33
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,390
We drag it down a bit, change the size.

34
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,420
And add a layer blur to it.

35
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:18,880
We make some adjustments afterwards and adding the layer by layer, we then rename the shadow layer

36
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:19,790
we just created.

37
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:31,160
The next thing we're going to do after we're done creating a Hoover variant is we're going to connect

38
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,100
them together so that it becomes interactive.

39
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:45,290
So we select the prototype top and then drag the point from the default to the Hoover and select mount

40
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:45,940
into.

41
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,210
And sets the animation type to smart animate.

42
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:02,610
You then connect the whole event to the default and then you select monthly for that.

43
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:10,350
Our previous website is already set, so you don't really make much changes there.

44
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,020
Okay, now we're done with our interactive component.

45
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,930
The next thing we are going to do is to utilize it.

46
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:26,330
So we'll create a copy of our main component, drag it onto our main screen and make sure it's well

47
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,210
aligned to our logo.

48
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,700
I'm not done with that.

49
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,490
We preview it to see what we've done so far.

50
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,530
As you can see, our interactive component is working.

51
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,730
The next thing we're going to do is create the menu item, interactive component.

52
00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:02,260
So with that, you press t on your keyboard and type whatever it is you want to type.

53
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,250
And then you change the properties.

54
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,020
You set the properties.

55
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:18,120
And you are done with that to get a rectangle, to enjoy a rectangle over our menu item.

56
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:26,280
And then we bring the menu item text to the front and make sure it's center aligned to a rectangle.

57
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,370
We are just a rectangle a bit.

58
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,560
Just use our preference.

59
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:49,360
We then draw another smaller rectangle at the edge, bottom edge of the rectangle you first created

60
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,980
and adjust it a bit.

61
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,810
It has to be small.

62
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:01,690
Then we rename it to Bar and then we change the color.

63
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,860
To the deeper shade of blue.

64
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:14,930
We then change the color of the larger rectangle to the lighter shade of blue and reduce the intensity

65
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,310
to 5%.

66
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:23,810
When we are done with setting the rectangle properties, we select them at the same time and then group

67
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,260
them.

68
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:35,900
We draw another rectangle over who we are going to use this new shape as a mask.

69
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,340
We rename its mask.

70
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,430
Once we are done with that, we bring our menu item text to the front.

71
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,820
And then the mucks are behind the group, select Buddha Group and the monks.

72
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,190
Leah and create a mask.

73
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:59,360
Once we're done with that, we select both the monks group and the menu item text and group them.

74
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,690
Then we rename our new group to menu item.

75
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,180
We then create a component of our new menu item group.

76
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:19,280
We expand the contents of the component by pressing the rectangular icon, and then we go into Mark's

77
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:26,690
group and select Max from that, and we adjust our max to hide our shape.

78
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:35,900
Once we finish with that, we create a variance of our new components.

79
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:46,190
We rename it to Hoover, and then in this new variant we find our max layer and adjusted to make our

80
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,080
shape visible.

81
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:02,380
The next thing we do after that is to connect our components to make it interactive.

82
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:11,890
So we select prototype, and then we make our component interactive by connecting the dots to each other

83
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,600
and setting the properties.

84
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,710
We are done making our components interactive.

85
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,330
The next thing we are going to do is use it.

86
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:36,840
So we create a copy of our components and then send it to our main stream and we edit.

87
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,570
When we finish, we'll preview it to see what we've done so far.

88
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,500
As you can see, the components we created are working very well.
