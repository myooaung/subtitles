00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.370
Welcome to this fake McCoys.

2
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.840
So to get on with it.

3
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.730
We'll have to find the Figma website and create an account.

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.690
So to do that, we will search Figma in our browser.

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.590
I've said it before, so I completed it for me.

6
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:27.890
But if that is not the case for you, you go to Google and then you click on the fast results that appears.

7
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.010
Yes, they are sent to this web page.

8
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.550
Okay.

9
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.710
So what we see here is the fake my websites.

10
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.580
Now you may actually this figma figma is one of the main prototyping tools out there.

11
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.330
You can use it to create wireframes, mockups and.

12
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.310
Flus and things.

13
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.610
Yeah.

14
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.550
You can also use it to plan out your work.

15
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.880
Flu and.

16
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.040
I think Figma is an interesting tool to use now.

17
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:06.350
They had a lot of interesting updates that is very helpful to our designers, to the design community

18
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.120
out there.

19
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.460
Yeah.

20
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.420
So to come back.

21
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:16.220
Figma is both web based and desktop based, so you decide based on your preference, you can design,

22
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.430
decide to focus on the.

23
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.210
Web or the decide to download the desktop based version.

24
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.270
Whichever one works for you, you go with it.

25
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.850
Okay, so you are the fake my website.

26
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.930
And what we are going to do is we are going to create an account that is if you don't have an account

27
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.780
and this is your first time visiting or seeing Figma, so you create an account, right?

28
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.590
You sign up or already have an account.

29
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.160
So I'm not going to create one.

30
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.000
You enter your details.

31
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.930
If you want to go with your email, you enter your details and your password and you create an account.

32
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.760
A very simple process, if not anyone to sign up with Google to.

33
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.820
You can just choose to click Continue with Google.

34
00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.630
Yes.

35
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:07.390
For those who would like to download the software, you just go to product and you select downloads.

36
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.360
It takes you to where you can download the app.

37
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.500
So here you see that the desktop app, the live device preview and the font installs, right?

38
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.590
As you notice, you realize that there are two separate apps for two separate.

39
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.750
Also, if you use Mac, you can decide to download the one for Mac.

40
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.210
If you use Windows, then you download the one for Mac.

41
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.980
So that's the desktop app.

42
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.820
And then we have live device preview, right?

43
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:46.390
The live device preview requires the software, the camera on your mobile device so that you can view

44
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.930
your design on your mobile device or your mobile phone as you design along is a very effective to people.

45
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.850
You can try it out.

46
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.630
Okay.

47
00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.540
So since I already have the software and I've already created accounts, I don't need to do all that.

48
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.830
So I'm going to jump.

49
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.070
Since I already have the software and I've already created the account, I don't have to do all that,

50
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.010
so I'm just going to jump right in.

51
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.160
Okay.

52
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.640
Okay.

53
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.400
Okay.

54
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.510
Okay.

55
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:30.310
So what you download Figma you are going to see after you download that figma and sign, then you are

56
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.860
going to see this interface for the first time, be it in your browser or the desktop app.

57
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.210
Right.

58
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.230
I'm using the desktop version right now.

59
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.590
So you are going to see this interface, right?

60
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.760
And you won't see all these files I have here.

61
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.580
These are just works I've done right.

62
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.850
Are these are past works I've done.

63
00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:00.240
So after you signed, after use registered and signed in, you are going to see this interface.

64
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.280
The first interface you are greeted with after you sign in or create an account in Figma.

65
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.210
Right.

66
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.150
All this you see here are works I've done.

67
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.840
They are not files you are going to see as you move along.

68
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.160
Right.

69
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.760
Okay.

70
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.250
So to move along, what you see here is.

71
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.890
Yeah.

72
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.300
So this here are my files that I've worked on.

73
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.170
My design files are worked on.

74
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.620
This section allows you to either create a design file or a fig jam file.

75
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.310
Right.

76
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.390
And then this section provides the tabs for you to go to the various rooms.

77
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.990
Right?

78
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.680
So to create a new design file, there are a number of ways you can do that.

79
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.490
Now, you can choose to click on the plus, right?

80
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.930
And then you have two options.

81
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:57.650
You have an option to either create a design file on a figure or a fig jam file, and we click on the

82
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.160
fig gum and see what it comes up with.

83
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.810
Okay.

84
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.130
So the fig jam file is where you create your work process, right?

85
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.660
You can if you are in a team, right.

86
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:18.740
And then you are designing the workflow or your like you can you basically use it to create your workflow?

87
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:19.250
Yeah.

88
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.930
So let's go back.

89
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.220
Yes.

90
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.800
So back to the plus.

91
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.250
I kick on a plus, but I click on the plus.

92
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.220
Right.

93
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:40.020
In this case, we are going to do a design, so I'll have to select the design file.

94
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.600
That's one way of creating a design file.

95
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:50.190
Or you could just go here directly and then just click on the design file to create a design file.

96
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.880
All right, all right.

97
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.330
All right.

98
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.080
So let's come to our topic.

99
00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.930
We are going to do today as design a very simple screen.

100
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.830
Oh, sorry.

101
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.120
What we are going to do today is design some very simple screens.

102
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.000
So we have a welcome screen.

103
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.120
I log in screen and I register screen.

104
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.540
Sorry, I have to arrange that quite very well.

105
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.940
Okay.

106
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.440
So, da da da da da da da da da da da da da.

107
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.850
Yeah.

108
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.620
So isn't the right order?

109
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.100
No.

110
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.530
So be designing a welcome screen.

111
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.160
I log in screen and then register screen.

112
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.510
Let me move this out.

113
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:38.340
Before we design, let me introduce you to the Figma interface.

114
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:45.930
So the gray area you see here is the work area in Figma where you do all your design work.

115
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:55.650
The right panel you see here is has the design, the prototype and then inspect options, right?

116
00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:03.680
So the design tab shows you a element of your the little bit of the.

117
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.400
Okay.

118
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:11.140
So let's do a quick introduction to Figma before we move on to do our designs.

119
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.390
The top bar you see here is the menu bar.

120
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:22.230
The two and menu bar has the tools here and then it has the Figma menu.

121
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.680
So this is my logo.

122
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.470
When you tap on it, you see the various menu items that you need.

123
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.340
Sigma.

124
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:37.670
So yeah, I can see that it gives me the options to create new design files and so on and so forth.

125
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:46.580
This year, right next to the Sigma icon is the move to the move to allow you to select a design or

126
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.080
an element in the work area and then move it around.

127
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.700
Next to it, we have the wireframe.

128
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.360
Sorry.

129
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.400
Next to it, we have the.

130
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.120
The frame icon.

131
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:08.760
The frame enables you to create the artboard that you do your designs on, right?

132
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.760
So the frame to you tap on it, right?

133
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.870
You get a lot of options on your left here.

134
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:22.980
You see there's a phone option, there's the tablet option, there's a desktop option, there's a presentation

135
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.210
and so on and so forth.

136
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:30.240
The next to after the frame icon is the rectangle two.

137
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.310
Oh, let me see that shape too.

138
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:35.850
Is that actually the shape to so the shape to click on the.

139
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:43.750
Everything down facing down here, you see the various tools available under the shape two.

140
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:49.210
So we have the rectangle, we have the line, we have the arrow, we have the ellipse, polygon, star

141
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.650
and images.

142
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.920
The next to here is the pen too.

143
00:08:54.250 --> 00:09:02.200
So the pencil is basically used to create complex shapes that are not present or available under the

144
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.130
shapes to.

145
00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.500
So yeah, that's basically it.

146
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.130
Okay.

147
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.420
So the next two after the pin to.

148
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:21.070
The next to after the painting is a text to the text two is what enables you put text on your design.

149
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:27.790
Then we have the hand tool that allows you to move around in your design file.

150
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.490
Yes.

151
00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:34.630
And then we have the common tool that allows you during collaboration and comments to a design.

152
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:40.530
So it promotes collaboration with your other team members or other team members?

153
00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.200
Yeah.

154
00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:41.890
Okay.

155
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.010
So that's and then.

156
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:44.530
Okay.

157
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:53.660
Up here you see the drafts that the for designed for wind and then beside it you see the design file

158
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.110
name the name of the design file.

159
00:09:55.130 --> 00:10:00.070
You can double tap to rename your design file to whatever you want.

160
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.220
So here you see the your profile icon two.

161
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:04.930
Yeah.

162
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.920
And the next to it you see the share.

163
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:13.400
This enables you share your design with other collaborators or other editors for you to work with.

164
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.030
Okay.

165
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:19.670
So, and then we have the preview button is the preview button enables you to view your design in the

166
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.690
platform you are working.

167
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:28.460
And so it allows you to see how the design is going to look on the mobile device or the desktop device

168
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.080
that you are designing.

169
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:37.430
And and we have the Zoom view options that allow you allows you to zoom, gives you the options to zoom.

170
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.430
So here the layers panel.

171
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:50.990
This panel here shows all your design elements that you've used in your design work, all the design

172
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:54.320
