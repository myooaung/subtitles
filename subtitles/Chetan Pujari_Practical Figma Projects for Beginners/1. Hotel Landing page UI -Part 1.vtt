00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.300
Hello there.

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.320
Welcome to this UI UX design course.

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.130
My name is Jacqueline Ansari.

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.150
That's a UI UX designer, and I'll be your instructor for today.

5
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.490
I hope you enjoy the course as you move along with me.

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.190
So today we'll be doing a very simple design of a web interface.

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.560
You're going to be getting our design from our design inspiration from dribble, and then we'll bring

8
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.000
it into our figma to design.

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.760
Today's to that will be using will be figma.

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.720
Yes.

11
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.930
So I already have my file created.

12
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.620
If you have your figma, you open it and then you make sure you create a new file.

13
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.060
So to get started, I go to dribble.

14
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.760
I already have my inspiration down.

15
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.100
So this is what we'll be designing for today.

16
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:58.750
So this design is by Lire Zeit by John Jarboe, and the name of the design is n e.

17
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.990
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy the image into Figma so I don't have to like keep

18
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.600
switching back and forth as I design.

19
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.170
So I copy and paste it here in Sigma.

20
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.930
Yeah.

21
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.080
So there we have it.

22
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:16.970
Then I start my design.

23
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.150
So to get started, I have to create a frame for my design, right?

24
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.290
So I click on the frame too.

25
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.650
Or you can just use the shortcut f on your keyboard to activate the frame options and then you select

26
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.660
your.

27
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.300
Your frame option from the list that presents.

28
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.380
So I'm going to select.

29
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.890
440 by 1024.

30
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.650
That's the industry standard for any design, any web design.

31
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.280
Sorry.

32
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.660
So yeah, so that I have is ready to go.

33
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.790
So I just I have my frame now.

34
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.580
The next thing to do is I rename my frame.

35
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.120
So I'm just going to rename it to what's, what should I do a landing page because this is a landing

36
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.080
page.

37
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.530
Okay.

38
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:19.040
So the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create a grid for my page so that I follow along.

39
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:27.230
I follow along as I design, I like to design with a grid to guide me so I don't go into certain areas.

40
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.950
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to select my layout grid option here.

41
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.930
Then I click on this square thing here, then click on the options, select columns and set my margin.

42
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.080
I'm going to set my margin to 80 pixels.

43
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.580
Yeah.

44
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.470
So that's good enough for me.

45
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.070
Okay.

46
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.600
Okay.

47
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.420
I mean, lower it a bit so it doesn't interfere my design as I move along.

48
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.760
Good.

49
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.670
Okay.

50
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.760
So I have my grade ready to go.

51
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.010
The next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to design the now bar in case you don't know whether or

52
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:11.070
not bar is that thing at the top here where you have the logo and then the menu options or the menu

53
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.540
items and then the search bar and then a button update.

54
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.410
Okay.

55
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.270
So.

56
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.360
Let me zoom in to us to see our design.

57
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.050
Well.

58
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.510
Oops, I forgot something.

59
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.320
So before we start designing, we have to.

60
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.210
Okay.

61
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.760
No, I didn't forget anything.

62
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.390
Okay.

63
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.940
So we are going to design now by the next thing we are going to do is we are going to design a number,

64
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.400
which is what we see here.

65
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.360
If you can see my mouse where it's pointing and it keeps moving.

66
00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.200
Okay.

67
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.190
So since I don't really have this logo, I'm going to create a I'm just going to put a simple text logo

68
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.080
there and then we move along.

69
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.070
Okay.

70
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:07.100
So yeah, so I click on T in the toolbar, just T on my keyboard using the shortcuts.

71
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.930
And then to create my logo.

72
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.860
Let me just as well as any.

73
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.490
Right.

74
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.930
So.

75
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.270
And Cups.

76
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.170
Mrs..

77
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.990
I gets an interesting.

78
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.980
Once they make this as big as possible by increasing the font size.

79
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.870
But he doesn't look to be bold.

80
00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:57.310
Okay.

81
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.990
This looks good enough, so I guess I'll just stick here and make it a big bowl.

82
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.980
A big.

83
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.950
Okay.

84
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.210
So this looks good enough.

85
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.920
So I guess I'll just maintain this text and make the size of it bigger.

86
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.390
A bit bigger.

87
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.260
Okay.

88
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.350
So I have this.

89
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.280
Yeah.

90
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.160
Okay.

91
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:33.500
So the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create the menu options or menu items that we see.

92
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:43.830
So we have about us the mode gauges, the buy a home refinance and then we have the button and the search

93
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:44.580
icon.

94
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.910
The next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create the menu about us.

95
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.300
Oops, I have to change the phones I like.

96
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.540
I really love to use Gilroy as I move along.

97
00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.900
So let me first type about us.

98
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.880
Change your properties.

99
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.590
You're right.

100
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.050
Yeah.

101
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.580
Make it smaller.

102
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.820
I think 20 is a bit too small.

103
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.970
And make this very bold.

104
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.220
Okay.

105
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.190
Let's set into 20.

106
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.700
22 looks fine and she looks fine.

107
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.200
So I duplicate this by.

108
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.920
So I have my first test done.

109
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.020
I'm just going to duplicate the others.

110
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:51.880
This by selecting the text and then pressing and holding command D to create a duplicate and then using

111
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.710
my mouse move my duplicate away so I have my duplicate.

112
00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.400
So now I rename it to mortgages.

113
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.290
My mortgage.

114
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.020
Then.

115
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.070
Duplicate again.

116
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.430
Very name to buy a home.

117
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.570
And then duplicate again.

118
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:19.830
Move to.

119
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.830
Refinance.

120
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:41.900
So I just evenly distributes my things up here by going here, selecting this, and then just clicking

121
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.890
on tidy up.

122
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.010
As you see, it's distributes the space between them evenly for me.

123
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:55.730
So all I have left to do is either to increase if I'm okay with the space I have between them or reduce

124
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.060
it.

125
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.480
So with this, I think.

126
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.440
I think 60 is okay for me.

127
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.240
60 is okay for me.

128
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:06.800
So.

129
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.110
Yeah, let me push you here a bit.

130
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:09.430
Okay.

131
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.090
It looks a bit censored.

132
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.850
It may reduce.

133
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.220
The colour intensity.

134
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.410
So from 100 to.

135
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:22.960
70.

136
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.350
So my.

137
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:32.370
A bit too dark for me because the 80.

138
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:34.240
All right.

139
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:40.660
So the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create the apply now button up here.

140
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:45.010
So to do that, I have to select my rectangle in the toolbar menu.

141
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.900
So the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create the Apply Now button.

142
00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:00.330
To do that, I have to select the square in the toolbar up there and then draw.

143
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.990
A rectangle here.

144
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:06.890
On my screen.

145
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:09.920
Okay.

146
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.470
As you be.

147
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.120
It's bigger.

148
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:15.370
Okay.

149
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:25.490
So let me set the height to 60 and then width to 180 and then I round the corners.

150
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.400
So I set the corner reduce to.

151
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.640
Betty.

152
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.170
Then I change the fill color.

153
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:36.940
But that will cut out to black.

154
00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.250
Your black.

155
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:46.130
Yeah.

156
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.130
So now I have my rectangular shape.

157
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:53.880
The next thing I have to do is create the text inside my shape.

158
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.580
So selecting the text.

159
00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.060
I click on the shape and then I type apply now.

160
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:05.830
Okay.

161
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.430
So now I have my text.

162
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:14.980
The next thing I have to do is make sure that text is centered both horizontally and vertically in my

163
00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:15.670
button.

164
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:16.990
So I'm done with that.

165
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:23.620
Now, the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go to both the text and the shape after grouping

166
00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:23.710
it.

167
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:28.380
I'm going to renew my group to Button's button.

168
00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.110
Sorry.

169
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:30.540
Okay.

170
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.050
So the next thing I have.
