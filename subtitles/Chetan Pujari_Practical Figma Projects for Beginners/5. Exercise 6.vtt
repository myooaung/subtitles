1
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.980
Okay.

2
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.930
Let me see the distance so old.

3
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.470
And then mine is 25, so 25.

4
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.790
So let's leave it at 25 and then I'm going for my telegram icon.

5
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.220
Okay.

6
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.730
You should have this by now.

7
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.060
Remember, that was the first thing we did to pick our icons.

8
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.690
Okay, then I'm going to resize it to 36.

9
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.880
So 36.

10
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.990
Then that's a six.

11
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.650
Then I'm going to make sure it's aligned with this.

12
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.520
Okay.

13
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.420
Okay.

14
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.530
So 36 by 36.

15
00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.290
First.

16
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.970
Let me check here in seven, seven days.

17
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.050
Okay.

18
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.750
So here.

19
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.640
713 seven.

20
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.840
But we are using tests by text six.

21
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.670
It's okay.

22
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.310
And then I'll just control C control with this and I'm going to bring it down.

23
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.260
Change it to Warsop.

24
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.130
Or is it now?

25
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.990
Okay, so what's up?

26
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.780
No matter what's up.

27
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.980
What's up?

28
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.100
Let's see the distance.

29
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.460
Okay.

30
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.690
So just for your reference, so I'm also going to do here 19 since the distance so here the gap.

31
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.630
Pitching.

32
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.610
This is what's being seen.

33
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.040
So let me just do that of 19 for this, too.

34
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.230
So let me just take it up.

35
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.930
So 19.

36
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.470
Then I'll go for the WhatsApp logo with WhatsApp.

37
00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.510
You should have this to.

38
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.280
And I'll change it to a 3636 press enter.

39
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.240
I think it's also a six.

40
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:10.460
Okay.

41
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.390
So let's bring it.

42
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.690
Let's make sure it's in line.

43
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.260
Okay.

44
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.010
So here there seems to be a good number of cup here.

45
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.860
You can do that.

46
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.430
Okay.

47
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.030
Let me see if this is so.

48
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.830
That's okay.

49
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.690
You can do that.

50
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.420
Or we can also just try to give it enough space.

51
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.940
So let me move it.

52
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.860
So well, so much is selected.

53
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.740
I'm going to move it down to give them some small gap.

54
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.250
Okay.

55
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.190
And now our gap is let's see.

56
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.500
So that's a lie.

57
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.970
Okay, so that's in my.

58
00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.980
Okay.

59
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.240
So we just have the more options.

60
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.550
Simple.

61
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.470
So we're just going to copy this.

62
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.940
So, control.

63
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:11.360
Plus.

64
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.960
Plus.

65
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.050
Select this.

66
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.610
Okay.

67
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.280
So let me zoom in so that we're able to select this.

68
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.100
It's.

69
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.290
So you notice I'm unable to select the line so I can do it.

70
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.270
I can just come here.

71
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:45.470
And since I didn't really miss out just how much I can experience, I know what the line I'm looking

72
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.920
for.

73
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.330
Remember, we have two lines.

74
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.840
Okay?

75
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.450
So what I'm looking for is line two.

76
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.370
So when I click on this, I so it shows me that I'm actually working on this.

77
00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.880
Okay?

78
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.150
So I'm just going to just select this.

79
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.080
And then I once the rectangle names select the return, so there's a rectangle and then I'm also going

80
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.950
to select.

81
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.200
So hold shift.

82
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.510
Sorry, not shift control rather.

83
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.300
So they shift, so control.

84
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:22.610
So the rectangle, this rectangle, and then the line to control, not shift.

85
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.250
Shift is going to select or.

86
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.460
And then we need also the accounts linked.

87
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.410
So which is this?

88
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:39.550
So I also control this to K then control C, control V, and then I'm going to move it down.

89
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.870
So let's check the distance from here.

90
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.500
Okay.

91
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.400
So what you.

92
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.050
Okay, so 19.

93
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.700
So I'm going to do same to this.

94
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.500
So 19.

95
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.300
If it was.

96
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.410
Coach three then counseling.

97
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.710
Okay, so it's 19, so it's not dating.

98
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.000
So I'm going to change it to 19.

99
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.470
So we don't are going to sue 19 and which is okay.

100
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.730
Okay.

101
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.610
So we have to change this text to more options.

102
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.160
I'm going to change it to more options.

103
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.920
More options, options.

104
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.810
Then we get more options.

105
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.380
Let's see the so we have share contacts and then cover our code.

106
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.200
So just control C.

107
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.220
Control V.

108
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.810
Bring this here.

109
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.020
Firstly, let me check the gap or the distance here.

110
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.580
So 25, we're still going to ensure he has 25.

111
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.530
So it's 34 now.

112
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.960
So just use the rookie 25.

113
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.000
So it's now 25 and then it's going to be called the share contacts.

114
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.130
So share contacts.

115
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.910
Share.

116
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.430
Is this.

117
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:30.670
Share.

118
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.730
Share.

119
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.380
Share.

120
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.080
Contacts.

121
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.790
Share.

122
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.720
Contact.

123
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.600
The next one is controls you control v so I'm going to move it down.

124
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.160
So I'm holding two key.

125
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:51.220
So 19, I'm going to give you a 19 to 19 and then it's going to be called cure all.

126
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.920
Cure all could cure could see how it was.

127
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.940
Sure I could.

128
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.290
Okay.

129
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.200
So this should be our final work.

130
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.110
I can take this out now.

131
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.220
So I can take the rules out?

132
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.790
No, and then I can preview it.

133
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.020
James, our lesson.

134
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.750
The gap is too much.

135
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.250
So we can decide to follow that.

136
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.890
And let's see.

137
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:39.410
So let me just give them enough cap space and let's leave it this way.

138
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.620
Hold out and see.

139
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.290
So for me, I used 27, so.

140
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:46.250
Okay.

141
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.720
So depending on what you want to achieve, we can just try to keep.

142
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:55.380
So let's open our projects and then you can decide to preview it.

143
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:59.100
Okay, so let's wait for it to load the preview.

144
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:06.780
So this is our final project, not our final list, the first screen that we just worked on.

145
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:12.040
And then I think this is to boot.

146
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.480
It's too thick for me so I can change it to let me change to semi.

147
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.260
So it's the semi boat.

148
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.490
So I think I like it this way.

149
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.960
And then I think the changes.

150
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.790
Okay, so it's affected the changes.

151
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:24.870
Effected the changes.

152
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:33.180
So thank you guys for being part of today's session and then I hope to see you in the other lessons.

153
00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:33.990
So thank you.
