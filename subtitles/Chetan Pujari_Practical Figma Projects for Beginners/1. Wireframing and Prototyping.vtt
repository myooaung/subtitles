Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:07.640
Welcome to this UI UX crash course with anybody can develop in me or Twitter for today.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.100
So now we're going to prototyping.

4
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.480
What is prototype?

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.580
What is a prototype?

6
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.270
A prototype is a simulation of a real product that is used to get feedback.

7
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.790
And test, so it is an effective way to get feedback from investors and stakeholders.

8
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.450
Prototype is like a representation of the actual product.

9
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.500
It is not the actual product prototypes are made because it is a fast way to get feedback.

10
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.150
It is a fast way to test your users, incorporates the feedback you get from them.

11
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.830
So what are the types of prototypes?

12
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.310
Now we have two types of fidelity and high fidelity, but then someone asks, What does fidelity mean?

13
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.750
Fidelity refers to the level of detail in a design.

14
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.880
So when we say low fidelity, we are basically saying there is low level of detail in that design.

15
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.500
In high fidelity, we mean there's high level detail in the design.

16
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.360
So examples of low fidelity prototypes, types of low fidelity prototypes are paper prototypes and digital

17
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.990
prototypes.

18
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.860
An example of high fidelity prototypes are the digital prototypes that we design in these designing

19
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.790
tools like Adobe Vision, Figma and the Rest.

20
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.190
So these are examples of prototypes.

21
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.470
On my left here you see the low fidelity prototype or the wireframe.

22
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.430
On my right, you see the high fidelity prototype.

23
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.730
Now that's moving on to wireframe or the wireframe.

24
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.990
So from Ilya, you mentioned that wireframe is a type of the low fidelity prototype.

25
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.630
So it's a low fidelity layout.

26
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.640
It doesn't have a lot of details.

27
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.230
It just has the basic information needed to figure out how the app is going to look like it deals with.

28
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:10.470
Structure and functionality than the visuals or how it's supposed to look.

29
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.610
So its goal is to create a skeleton of the actual design before moving on to create the design itself.

30
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.760
What are the types of wireframes we have?

31
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:31.230
Low fidelity wireframes like the prototypes we have low fidelity wireframes and high fidelity wireframes.

32
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.840
So as you can see here on my left, there's a low fidelity wireframe which has very limited detail,

33
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.400
and then there's a high fidelity wireframe which has a bit more detail compared to the low fidelity

34
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.180
wireframe.

35
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.770
Okay.

36
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.030
So does the further theory move on to the practical?

37
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.640
So this is what we are going to be designing for the practical and wizard.

38
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.850
Join me as we design.

39
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.500
Thank you very much.
