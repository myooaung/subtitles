00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.110
Hello feature designers.

2
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.470
So welcome to the continuation of my projects with Lucy.

3
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.930
So I'm going to continue this.

4
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.730
So that's what we are going to be doing.

5
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.110
Okay, so our final projects will look like this scroll.

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.860
Okay.

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.400
So that said, already in the previous lesson, you guys learned how to import Lucy files.

8
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.840
Okay?

9
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.970
So I'm not going to go and then pick this false again because I already have them.

10
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.400
So what I'll do is to just what I was to draw rulers.

11
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.240
Okay, so the ruler is going to guide me as to where this objects or this shape should be and the icons

12
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.280
should be okay.

13
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.910
So first of all, let's do that.

14
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.560
So there's a shadow here.

15
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.170
Adidas using the line, too.

16
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:55.520
So the lines will all go here, pick a line, so then click here and then draw on shift.

17
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.770
Okay, so shift is going to make a pivot line.

18
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.920
If I leave shifts, you can see it's diagonal now.

19
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.550
So I'm going to shift in the streets.

20
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.810
Now I'm going to change my stroke to two.

21
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.090
So let me see.

22
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.840
Where is it?

23
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:15.890
Did it vanish?

24
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.710
Okay.

25
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.670
Click here and see what it is.

26
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.040
Speech.

27
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.780
So I'm going to give you a color and color, gray color.

28
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.670
So you wouldn't have this.

29
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.420
So if you don't know if you can just click this, that's my color code for the gray.

30
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.520
So I'm going to move it up with the arrow key.

31
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.120
Take it up.

32
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.840
Okay.

33
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.160
So this should be okay then.

34
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.820
Now let's do that of this icon.

35
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.190
So this icon, we just right click and then go to.

36
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.400
Sorry, I qualify.

37
00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.720
So I qualify.

38
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.620
And then as I qualify, we can search for switch.

39
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.080
Yeah.

40
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.770
So just type switch and then click on this.

41
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.150
Okay.

42
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.260
Now.

43
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.920
You might not have qualified because you've not installed a plug in, so you have to go to plug ins.

44
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.270
Those thoughts in the previous lesson grasp plug ins and then search.

45
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.670
So we were going to do that.

46
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.260
So I'm just going to copy control, see control feeds and then bring it here.

47
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.730
I want it to be here.

48
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:34.390
Okay.

49
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.450
Okay.

50
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:44.730
And you when you install or you install it, this icon, you would have different colors.

51
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:45.180
Okay.

52
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.920
So what I did was to just click on it and then come to feel.

53
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.120
Then I gave it any color but actually use the eyedropper to pick a color from here.

54
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.350
So you can see I can use the eyedropper to pick any color.

55
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.370
So let me just pick this color.

56
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.380
Okay.

57
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.860
Now, what we do is we want to draw a district, go around a rectangle.

58
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.160
So I'm going to the shapes and then pick a rectangle, and then my border wants out how to start from

59
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.290
this place and then here.

60
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.010
Okay.

61
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.580
So I'm going to use also oats.

62
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:20.030
Okay.

63
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.730
So the distance from this rectangle to the edge of our device is 38.

64
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.050
Does the spacing.

65
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.970
Okay, it's eight.

66
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.070
And then from.

67
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.250
From here to here is 86.

68
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.370
So from the top of the ship rectangle shape to his 86.

69
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.440
So that's the spacing.

70
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.430
And if you want to look at the spacing for this two is.

71
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.330
So this is 45 from this to this is 45.

72
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.530
Okay, so here I'm going to change its color to white.

73
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.100
For right now.

74
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.630
And then I'll give it a stroke.

75
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:04.210
Sorry.

76
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.370
And effects.

77
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.700
Drop.

78
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.420
Shadow effects.

79
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.230
So my shadow value.

80
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.290
I'll leave it to four and then replace four.

81
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.500
So let's see if I have to do something else around in the corners.

82
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.160
I'm going to ground in the corners so you can see this three circles.

83
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.210
This four circles.

84
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.010
If you can see it, you have to zoom in.

85
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.650
So then to appear okay, using control plus plus to zoom or better.

86
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.220
So you can actually do this here.

87
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.830
So you can give it a value here.

88
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.730
Let me see the value I give to it.

89
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.500
So I gave it.

90
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.750
You see the value?

91
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.500
Okay.

92
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:46.970
So let me give it ten.

93
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.850
So, Justin, I'm going to entertain.

94
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.230
It's so tense surrounding the contest, but we can see it well.

95
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.990
So I also work on my drop shadow.

96
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.080
Okay.

97
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.240
So let me look here and then see that drop shadow effects that was given to this.

98
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.810
So two and then six.

99
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:14.860
So to six.

100
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.320
So to.

101
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.330
That's why what says to the mind player was said to six.

102
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.470
Okay.

103
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.720
So I can take this rectangle the rules out, thus the physical ones.

104
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.960
So let me leave this one spot.

105
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.910
Okay.

106
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.910
Okay.

107
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.490
So now let's pick out Lucifer.

108
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.830
Okay.

109
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.500
So you already know how to pick the loser.

110
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.290
You go to plug ins and go to Lucifer.

111
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.970
If you're already registered on Lucy, you've done the connection plug ins and installation.

112
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:08.630
Just click here and then search for Lucifer and then click on Convert to Give.

113
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.870
So it's taking some time.

114
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.370
So I'm going to consult because we already have links about that in the previous lesson.

115
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.210
So I'm just going to copy this control, see Contrave and then bring it here.

116
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.740
So position is here.

117
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.040
We bring it here?

118
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.100
It's okay.

119
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.130
I don't need this.

120
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.810
Okay.

121
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:39.440
Okay.

122
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:47.390
Now, Wood, once the icon so the icon, you can right click and go to plug ins and look for icon ify

123
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:57.040
and then look for correct or look for any icon or any icon that looks like this or any icon.

124
00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.910
Because for me, I really don't know how I brought this, but let's just use it.

125
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:08.840
So look for any icon, then put it here so you can either use icon ify or material icon any icon.

126
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.660
Okay.

127
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.290
CNN closed its.

128
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.970
So I'm just going to copy this to C control z.

129
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.550
Then I'm going to move it.

130
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.360
So this place.

131
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:25.370
Okay.

132
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.090
A Soma.

133
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.920
The size of my icon is 19.

134
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.820
By 19.

135
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.310
Then there's some let me give you some small spacing before the test comes.

136
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.540
So with the text, you use the text to just see here.

137
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.310
Okay.

138
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.790
So I'm not going to do that.

139
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.390
I'm just going to do control and control.

140
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.070
V Then I'm going to start from here.

141
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.170
I mean, bring it down.

142
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:54.350
We.

143
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:55.390
It's.

144
00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:03.520
And now what once the icon, the icon or the notification icon, so you can still go to your plug ins

145
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:12.420
and then such an icon ify or our design icons and then look for the or notification and then pick it.

146
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:18.010
And when you select this one control C, then move it here.

147
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.220
So I'm going to make it.

148
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.130
Sent it in between this.

149
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.220
Okay.

150
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:32.060
So if you want to change the color, just click on the icon, then click on The View and then give it

151
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.690
any color value of your choice.

152
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.670
Okay, so I'm going to take it back to its color.

153
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.800
Now we want this.

154
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.480
I call this.

155
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:49.230
Shape here and in the text, so you can just pick the rectangle two and then draw from here.

156
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.530
So I'm going to draw from here.

157
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.690
So some way here.

158
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.950
Then I can stretch it to this place.

159
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.100
So somewhere here where the E begins.

160
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.500
And then I'm going to round in the corners.

161
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.940
So let me give it a kind of value of, say, ten and see ten.

162
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.590
And it's too much.

163
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:11.400
So let me do it.

164
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:11.910
Five.

165
00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:12.600
Okay.

166
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.710
So five is okay.

167
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.230
Okay, so five is okay and then you can give it to this color value.

168
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:25.190
So I'm going to my field and then pick the eyedropper and okay, all better.

169
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:32.790
So since it's already the colors that I already have on my canvas until my interface is here, I'll

170
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:38.270
just select it, end up so select it, and that should be okay.

171
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:45.570
And then I can just control, see this, control it, and then bring it here.

172
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:47.190
Okay.

173
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.870
So that is the in progress.

174
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.710
So any icon with this color means in progress.

175
00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:01.260
You can see the color is trying to tell the user what the icons mean.

176
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:09.120
So this particular color us is overdue and in a green color tells this is completed and this one is

177
