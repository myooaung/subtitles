Hi there.

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:09.130
My name is Jaclyn, and I saw that I'm a UI UX designer I've been designing for a while now.

3
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:16.540
In today's tutorial, we're going to design a very simple, easy landing page, and we'll be using a

4
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.400
figma interactive component to make the design interactive.

5
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.440
That's the main thing we're going to learn in today's Video Sigma Interactive Components.

6
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:33.790
So I hope by the end of this video, you know how to use interactive components in Sigma.

7
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.590
Let's get started.

8
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.580
The first thing we're going to do is create an ad board or a frame.

9
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:55.290
So we'll do that by selecting the frame two and then selecting the 1440 by 1024 Frame or Artboard.

10
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.290
And the next thing is you create your grid as you can see me doing.

11
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.450
To do that, you press the plus icon by the layout grid.

12
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.980
And then you set the settings to what I have there.

13
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.450
Okay.

14
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.040
So now we have our grid done.

15
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:31.170
The next thing we are going to do is create a rectangle that is going to guide the design of our header.

16
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.270
Uh, menu.

17
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.770
Yeah.

18
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.670
So I had to.

19
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.880
After that, we're going to delete it.

20
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.470
It's just going to be used as a guide.

21
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.920
So you select the rectangle from your rectangular two and then draw it on your artboard.

22
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.090
Good.

23
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.560
The next thing we're going to do is we're going to find a logo.

24
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.260
This is not a logo design class, so we're going to use a placeholder logo.

25
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.860
So we'll find logo ipsum, right?

26
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:11.340
Logo Ipsum has a website and a figma plugin in this tutorial will be using the Figma plugin you right

27
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.740
click select plugin and then select browse plugins in community.

28
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.220
Then you search the plugin in the logo ipsum plugin in the search bar.

29
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.190
It appears if you don't have it installed, you just click the button and it installs.

30
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.770
It takes less than a second to install.

31
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.580
So once you're done installing, you come back to your Figma file, right click again, go to plugins

32
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.370
and find your plug in the logo ipsum plugin you installed.

33
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.160
Good.

34
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.610
So we're going to find our logo.

35
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.370
Fine.

36
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.530
Stretch that search.

37
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.450
Okay, so there we have it.

38
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.160
We find our logo.

39
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.800
We just click, just click on it and then appears on the dash, the artboard or your frame.

40
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.310
The next time it is out, drag it out and drag it back.

41
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:16.460
And the reason why I did that is because the logo wasn't already in my ads board.

42
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:25.100
I had to drag it back out and then back in so that it would appear inside my dashboard.

43
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.630
I just did a little.

44
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:35.600
Yeah, as you can see, our logo has a text beside it, so we'll be creating the text ourselves.

45
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:44.630
So you find a text to on the menu bar or you just press C on your keyboard and type, whatever it is

46
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.680
you have to type.

47
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.180
Design purpose with Chinese type design purpose.

48
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.820
Good.

49
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.310
Then we change

50
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:01.930
the font.

51
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.090
We change the font to Alegria stands as SI.

52
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.550
I hope I'm pronouncing it right.

53
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.710
Sans SC.

54
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:12.700
Yep.

55
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.210
Mm hmm.

56
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.390
And then we changed the font weight tables

57
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.700
and increased the text size.

58
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.860
Increase the font size.

59
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.930
Now align it.

60
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:55.110
Make sure that is well aligned and this piece is good enough for us and our group it.
