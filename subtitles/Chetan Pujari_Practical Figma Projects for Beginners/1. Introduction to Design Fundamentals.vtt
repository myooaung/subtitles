Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.140
Welcome to this UI UX crash course with anybody can develop in me.

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.060
Moving on Introduction to Design Fundamental.

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.600
Yes.

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.980
So there are a number of design fundamentals out there.

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.250
There are a lot of design fundamentals out there.

7
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.450
But for this course, we are going to focus on color and contrast white space, the short hierarchy,

8
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.690
complexity and simplicity, consistency and finally skill.

9
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.430
So color and contrast.

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.210
Contrast is the difference in luminance between two adjacent or overlaid colors.

11
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.150
Right.

12
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.550
If you look at my examples here below, you realize that's the first one.

13
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.900
Doesn't have a very good contrast here.

14
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.770
The design on my left, you see, last updated can hardly be seen because the contrast between that

15
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.290
in the background is quite poor.

16
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.770
But when you focus and look at the design on the right here, you see that last updated is quite visible

17
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.180
now because the background color was changed to a color that contrasts well with the test.

18
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.650
So white space, that is white space, this is white space, the empty space between design elements

19
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.680
and your user interface.

20
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.680
If you look here on the left, you see that.

21
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.680
There's lack of whitespace here.

22
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.580
So the design looks a bit clumsy or it looks clumsy basically, let me put it like that.

23
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.140
But if you look at the design on your right, you realize that there's enough whitespace to make the

24
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.940
design look breathable and beautiful and pleasing to the eye.

25
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.920
Okay.

26
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.550
So visual hierarchy.

27
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.240
Visual hierarchy is a principle of arranging design elements to show the order of importance.

28
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.600
So it basically let us know what elements is important, what elements the user should focus on, what

29
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.200
element you should see first, right?

30
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.080
It's visual hierarchy and direct that uses action in a way.

31
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.130
So when you look at the design on your left, you see last updated.

32
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.180
So you see the designer on the left, things are not really pleased or everything looks the same.

33
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.060
So it had to pick one particular thing to focus on.

34
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.660
You don't know if you focus on the private security or Amazon because everything, nothing stands out

35
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.940
here.

36
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.960
Aside from the logo, nothing stands out, everything looks the same.

37
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:53.640
But when you look on the design or your rights, you realize that things have been carefully positioned

38
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.650
in a visual hierarchy form, so it makes it easy to notice.

39
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.370
I'm setting or particular elements here.

40
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.370
In my case, the first thing I notice when I look at this design is probably C grade E because the color

41
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.770
is different and it stands out.

42
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.790
Then from then I see the logo, the Amazon logo, right?

43
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:24.040
So it has been carefully positioned and placed to direct the user's attention.

44
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.470
So that's basically what the short hair does.

45
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.740
Complexity and simplicity.

46
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.170
Now it is in the design world.

47
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.170
We say that more is not always better and simplicity is more.

48
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.670
Do not overwhelm your user with too much details.

49
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.520
When you look at the design on the left, you realize that it has too many things going on here.

50
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.130
So.

51
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.520
It makes the thing look clumsy.

52
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.020
Your five critical concerns found, you see.

53
00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.630
Shadow data isn't supposed to be there.

54
00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.360
Privacy.

55
00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.630
Great.

56
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.470
Easy shadow.

57
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.700
And then I don't know the dollar what the dollar sign is doing in the background, but when you look

58
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.560
at the design on your right, you realize that everything is simple.

59
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.360
Nothing is complicated.

60
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.220
Everything is as it should be.

61
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.360
Consistency.

62
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.860
You have to make sure.

63
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.500
The elements in your design are consistent.

64
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.400
Everything is applied consistently in your design.

65
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.620
Everything is aligned as it should.

66
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.640
Buttons are placed similarly, as they should be.

67
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.650
So when you look on my left, you realize the alignment here is not consistent.

68
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.970
Things is like everything's all over the place where you look on my right, you realize that is as it

69
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.970
should be.

70
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.590
The alignment is perfect.

71
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.390
The spacing is good.

72
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.170
And then the contrast is good.

73
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.300
So scale.

74
00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:04.830
Now when we say skill or do we mean how big or how design mean basically mean how big or how small the

75
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.490
design elements are in a design is shooting.

76
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.070
Your things should be properly placed.

77
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.850
It should have the right skill, shouldn't be too small that the user is unable to read or see or too

78
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:18.630
big.

79
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.300
That takes up too much space.

80
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.960
So when you look on my left, you realize that things are not going wrong there.

81
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.840
But when you look at my right things, everything is pleased as should be.

82
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.460
Thank you very much.
