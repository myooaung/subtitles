1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:07,530
So skill is the relative dimensions of an element measured by some percentage or numerical value.

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:17,040
Now there are some advantages of skill, so skill helps bring some form of consistency in your UI.

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:25,950
So let's see how your device or your UI would look on a on desktop and then how it will look on mobile

4
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,630
devices and then on tablets.

5
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,980
So you'd have to skill your UI elements, and that defeats all this, the various pixels of the screen

6
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,460
sizes.

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,830
The screen sizes of these devices.

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,080
It could be iOS or Android.

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:51,360
So how your UI will look on on a tablet should be different from how it would look on on a mobile device.

10
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:51,840
Okay.

11
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,390
So let's take a look at this.

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,960
So this is an example of scaling.

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,060
So let's say this is 100%.

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,770
And then there's a different percentage.

15
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,640
A different percentage.

16
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,650
So in the receding order.

17
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,660
So here you could see this looks bigger than this, done this and then done this.

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,110
So let's say this is a text.

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,430
So the how this would appear on a desktop would be different from how it appear on a mobile device.

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay.

21
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,820
So we have this responsive design.

22
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:31,110
If you use responsive design, you would notice that the way websites would look on desktop will be

23
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,130
different from the way it would look on a mobile device.

24
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,540
The elements might change.

25
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,450
Positions of the elements might change depending on the screen size of the device that a person is using

26
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,290
or your use as you.

27
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:44,980
They use this use.

28
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,670
And so this is example of skill, then it helps in some form of a visual hierarchy.

29
00:01:52,330 --> 00:02:00,400
So some kind of importance is given to objects that are scaled or UI elements, UI elements that are

30
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,360
being skilled.

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,010
So this is a perfect example of skill.
