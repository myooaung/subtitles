00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.590
So hello everyone.

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.800
So welcome to the continuation of our previous lesson.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.230
Now.

4
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.990
We will be working with the text to.

5
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:19.610
So to do that, I'm going to have to select the text and then I'm going to type.

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.400
Let me see what we have.

7
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.340
Mobile.

8
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.050
So mobile.

9
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.460
So mobile, let them see the phones type.

10
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.270
The phone type is normal.

11
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.520
You need to know more.

12
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.770
We need to know more.

13
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.200
So let me change it to normal.

14
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.600
If you don't have.

15
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.340
No, I'm going to use regular.

16
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.230
So I use regular.

17
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.220
So this symbol, this is so let me use semi board.

18
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.740
Okay, so that we have some consistency.

19
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.290
So I'm going to change it to semi boat.

20
00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.250
Okay.

21
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.270
And then this is more the color is okay.

22
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.850
Okay.

23
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.820
So.

24
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.050
I can just use this.

25
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.590
Okay.

26
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.250
Control C.

27
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.150
Control V.

28
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.240
And bring it to you.

29
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.680
And I'm going to change.

30
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.290
They should change its color.

31
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.820
And I can see why it's not sodium just undo controls that's on the.

32
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.710
Okay.

33
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.810
So let me just control V, then I'm going to move it here.

34
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.210
Then let me change its color to a gray color.

35
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.190
So let's use the gray color.

36
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:58.420
So let's see.

37
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.780
The takes is regular.

38
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.760
Okay, so let's do it at regular.

39
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.180
And then I'm going to change them.

40
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.810
See, this font size is 20, so I change this to 20.

41
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.610
So you see.

42
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.590
Okay.

43
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.520
And this is 16.

44
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.510
So let me bring this here, then I'm going to change it.

45
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.700
Let's give it any number.

46
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.560
So plus two, three, three.

47
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.410
Let's use any number of our choice.

48
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.980
So this.

49
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.640
Okay, so any dummy number.

50
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.890
But let me align this.

51
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.830
So once it starts just behind this.

52
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.230
So just behind this.

53
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.530
So I'm going to bring you here and then I'm going to also bring this here.

54
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.440
Okay.

55
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.260
Now let's work.

56
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.180
Okay.

57
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.780
So first let me take this up a bit.

58
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.350
So name what selects and then use the hierarchy to take it up.

59
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.160
So this is okay, the distance here.

60
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.860
So change for searching for is okay.

61
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.680
And then let me just bring this here.

62
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.240
Let's see.

63
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.980
So here.

64
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:33.020
Okay.

65
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.660
So for me, I would want my icon to be here.

66
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.640
Okay, so I'm going to move this icon here and then let me see here.

67
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.650
So we have two icons.

68
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.450
So I'm going to resize them which resize this.

69
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.570
So while holding an all shift, I'm going to resize it.

70
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.410
Okay.

71
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.000
So this is okay.

72
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.950
So I'll drink it here and then I'll do the same for the phone.

73
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.130
It should be a phone.

74
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.330
Okay, so a phone.

75
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.350
So let's resize it.

76
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.510
Let's.

77
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.240
So first let me check you say so 36 and this one is 36.

78
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.000
Let me make it touch the edge.

79
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.820
So select it and then make it touch the red ruler.

80
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.980
Okay.

81
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.070
Okay.

82
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.690
So that's okay.

83
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.010
It's okay.

84
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.870
And then let me check the heights.

85
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.580
So I want them to be in the same height as the mobile.

86
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.070
So I'm going to take it down so that.

87
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.810
So you are going to go down.

88
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.330
Okay.

89
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.640
And then see what we have here.

90
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.950
Okay.

91
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:49.480
So this.

92
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:57.170
Okay, so what is left is just for us to control, see, duplicates or this.

93
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.210
Okay, so we'll do that.

94
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.820
One, two, three, four, five, five times.

95
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:04.240
Okay.

96
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.950
So let's do that in the next lesson.

97
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.660
So listen.

98
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.620
Thank you.
