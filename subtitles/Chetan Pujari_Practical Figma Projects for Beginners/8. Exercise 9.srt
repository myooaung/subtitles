1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,070
ASO.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,620
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,540
So welcome to today's session.

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,180
So we'll continue with where we left off when we left off.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:16,620
So you can see here, I really don't like the distance between the reasons and then this whole section

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,490
or UI.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,520
So I'm going to the project then let me just highlight these.

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,390
So one, so multi select with the help of the ships key, then select, select and do that for the ship

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,780
here.

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:31,980
I'm going to take it down.

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,890
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:43,110
Okay, so let's see that gap so holds and then so I used 20, now things should be 22, so 22.

13
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,040
So I'm going to take down.

14
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:45,420
Okay.

15
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,070
So 20.

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,280
Okay, so let's preview it.

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:48,700
Okay.

18
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,100
So I think it's quite okay now.

19
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:51,990
Okay.

20
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,730
And then let me see.

21
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,110
See these phones.

22
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,850
So this phone is no more.

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,160
You need to scroll.

24
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,770
So here is so changes to 12.

25
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,050
So you need to know more.

26
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,350
So let's use regular.

27
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:20,480
Okay.

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,520
So that's okay.

29
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,180
So this.

30
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,000
Okay.

31
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,940
And let me see the name here.

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,290
Okay.

33
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,820
The most selected.

34
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,650
I'm going to bring them down.

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,380
Okay.

36
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:51,880
So we are.

37
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:52,840
Okay.

38
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,250
So now what I'll do is I'm just going to select this again, okay?

39
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,400
And then we are just going to control the with the help of the shift key or bring it down.

40
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,450
But let me group.

41
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,320
Okay, so right click and then group selection.

42
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,240
So now they become one objects and then they move together.

43
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,270
Okay, so why we just have to do it?

44
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,280
So I'm going to take this out.

45
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,740
So let me replace it with this guy.

46
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,310
So I'm just going to take you out.

47
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,960
Beaten in all places with this guy.

48
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,070
So it seems to be position.

49
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,840
Well, here, let me give it some 1 to 2 heads and then give some.

50
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,810
One, two.

51
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,190
Now.

52
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:09,600
So this group look excluding this, so I would have to group it again or with astronomy group and group.

53
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,210
So I regroup.

54
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,360
Let me change the name here to Bright Data.

55
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:26,870
Okay.

56
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:33,700
Then I'm going just to group control G and then let's see the we need to have a divider.

57
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,260
So if you look here, we have a divider here.

58
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,330
So a divider.

59
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,690
So I think is just one point.

60
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,940
Let me just do that.

61
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,370
So a divider, we are going to use the line two.

62
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:46,630
Okay.

63
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,860
So the line that I'm going to select draw from here, okay.

64
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,600
Then while holding on shift, I'm just going to drag to here.

65
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,000
Let's see if that's what we have.

66
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,030
Okay.

67
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:05,910
It's great.

68
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,270
So how does it change?

69
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,700
It's from black to grey.

70
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,890
So that's okay.

71
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,860
So the stroke is one.

72
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,400
Okay.

73
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,500
So that's okay.

74
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,310
But let's see.

75
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,700
It's supposed to be here.

76
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,070
So also, let's hear.

77
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,270
So I'm going to move it up.

78
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,060
Okay.

79
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,390
So this.

80
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:28,920
Okay.

81
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,080
Sorry.

82
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:46,620
So now we can just control or we just control C, control v, and then bring it down to the base of

83
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:46,980
this.

84
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,420
So let me see the base.

85
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,160
Okay, so we take this up.

86
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,410
Let's see.

87
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,880
Okay.

88
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,410
So specifics.

89
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,260
Now, let's just group this.

90
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,060
Group this.

91
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,910
How to group it.

92
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,760
Then I'm going to group that to.

93
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,060
So control G.

94
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,630
So now we have them as one objects.

95
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,620
So let's check here and see the distance.

96
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,440
So the distance from here.

97
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,950
So.

98
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,810
So from this.

99
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,480
So this.

100
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,320
Thin.

101
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,610
So ten.

102
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,270
So let's do that.

103
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,010
So ten.

104
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,510
So I'm just going to select and then hold out.

105
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:37,990
Okay.

106
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,480
So ten tickets up.

107
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,930
So there's no intent.

108
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,790
So this is okay.

109
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,310
Let's preview it here.

110
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,580
Okay.

111
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:01,350
So you can decide to change the values so the name and then they can decide to change it.

112
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,550
So just one last one.

113
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:18,400
So I'm just going to control C, control V to open.

114
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,200
The.

115
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,810
C control fee.

116
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,120
This is all.

117
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,100
It's so supposed to be ten.

118
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,310
So I'm going take it up.

119
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,030
And then we just have to change this image.

120
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,320
Okay.

121
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,000
So bring this image here.

122
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,420
It's like I just bring it here.

123
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,820
Okay.

124
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,570
Okay.

125
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,560
So now we have this.

126
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,930
So what we are going to do?

127
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,580
Change this moment.

128
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,320
Okay.

129
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,670
So.

130
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,620
Now we have this contacts.

131
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,750
So as usual, we are just going to select the reasons here.

132
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,250
So control C, control V with the help of the shift key, I'm just going to move it down.

133
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,820
Rookie.

134
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,050
Okay, so let's shift key while holding on shift and then that rookie shift key will help it move faster.

135
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,110
If I should use the rookie, you just move shifts.

136
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,520
It's faster.

137
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,220
So let me see the distance used here or the.

138
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,780
So it's well, so confused.

139
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:02,780
Used.

140
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,150
So let's do same.

141
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,200
Better still.

142
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:05,790
Okay.

143
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,160
So it's all old.

144
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,630
So I'm going take it down.

145
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,030
So I'm going to change it to contacts.

146
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,590
I think he used contacts.

147
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,770
So contacts.

148
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,970
It's a contacts.

149
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,400
So you can use control.

150
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:38,630
Plus, to zoom in, control minus twos, zoom out with the key keyboard, plus the combination of keys,

151
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,370
control plus and control minus.

152
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,450
So now what we have to do is just do this.

153
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:50,900
Okay.

154
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,490
So a.

155
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,070
Okay, so now let's see me.

156
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,780
See the distance from here.

157
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,060
So here is.

158
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,870
Here to 34, 34.

159
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:11,740
So I'm just going to copy this control C, control V and then bring it down.

160
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,410
Okay.

161
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,410
So I did include this.

162
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:23,590
So let me just control C, this control v, so bring it down.

163
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:49,730
And if I how to next is it change the names.

164
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,690
Okay.

165
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:14,460
And then we would change here would add on a so alphabet.

166
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,340
So that's actually another ship here.
