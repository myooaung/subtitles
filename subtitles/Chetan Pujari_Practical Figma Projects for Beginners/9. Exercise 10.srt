1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,060
It's 18.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,460
So control minus that I'm going to draw a rectangle.

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,620
So the rectangle.

4
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,950
So its distance from the contacts is nine or nine pixels.

5
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,120
So I'm just going to let me face move this once.

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,680
So old.

7
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,060
It's mine.

8
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,060
I'm going to move it down.

9
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,970
So I get nine.

10
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:49,800
Nine.

11
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,300
Then the color is white.

12
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,020
So change to white.

13
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:12,150
Thing this a show on AMC the size 14 pixels you need to a normal case of 14 pixels need to normal so

14
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:21,870
this use disorder controls quattro v inside so right click arrange it and bring two fronts and then

15
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,280
send this to back right click on the shape here then send to back.

16
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,490
So Central Bank is going to take a lot.

17
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,500
So I'll just send this.

18
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,000
I rather you send back.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,240
What?

20
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,380
So let's just send it back.

21
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:37,880
Okay.

22
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,600
So now it's in front of it.

23
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,710
So a so.

24
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,440
An A yes.

25
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,320
20.

26
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,260
This is what's.

27
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,030
It's 14 normal.

28
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,130
So let's change it to 14.

29
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,360
14.

30
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:17,930
No.

31
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,170
So normal use regular.

32
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,930
Let's make it both.

33
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,550
Okay.

34
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,300
I am going to make it both.

35
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,170
Semi both.

36
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,410
So semi boat is okay.

37
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,490
So a distance should be nine.

38
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,760
Let's center it first.

39
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,330
So we just move this.

40
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,400
Okay.

41
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:13,740
So in order to center our alphabet here, I'm going to have to just highlight it's to click this and

42
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,880
then click on the shape.

43
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,770
So select it.

44
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,030
Then we are going to use the aligned physical centers.

45
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,250
So you can see now it's centered.

46
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,350
Then I'm going to move it to the edge.

47
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,520
We'll see.

48
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,680
Six or so pixels.

49
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,870
So this is our alphabet.

50
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,850
And then let me see.

51
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:50,570
Okay.

52
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,330
So this creates.

53
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,020
Okay.

54
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,010
Let me check.

55
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:56,480
Okay.

56
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,070
So, yeah, it's at the edge.

57
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,780
Then let's see the distance.

58
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,340
No.

59
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,520
So now the distance for this alphabet to this box or this shape.

60
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,450
Okay, so let's do that as five pixels.

61
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:21,150
So let me just highlight this, then hold out and then check.

62
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,520
So we use 53, so let's take it up with the help of the arrow key and getting picked up.

63
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,350
So rich five.

64
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,760
So that was it.

65
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:33,730
Okay.

66
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,610
Then let's preview it and see.

67
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:39,370
Okay.

68
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,650
So interesting.

69
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,130
So now we'll check.

70
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,430
So we have to do.

71
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,360
So I'm just going to duplicate it.

72
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,140
So let me just duplicate this.

73
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,030
Jesse Control V is going to bring it down.

74
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,480
I see them.

75
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,640
Check the distance.

76
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,380
Let's see here.

77
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,430
So Tim so I'm going to do that here to show ten so old.

78
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,250
So strange since it's ten.

79
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,590
Then from there we have

80
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:43,800
the B, b, so as usual, we are just going to select this or even group it.

81
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:51,670
So let me just group this to this, the highlighted group, then control C, control V and I'm going

82
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,510
to bring it down.

83
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,010
Then I will change here to B.

84
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,600
Should be.

85
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,090
Then I'll check that.

86
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,610
So let's check the distance here.

87
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,220
So there seems to be no gap.

88
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,510
They just closed.

89
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,020
Okay, so let's just stick it up.

90
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:48,920
Okay.

91
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,320
And then just control you.

92
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,390
Control this.

93
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,240
Then bring it down.

94
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,510
Open.

95
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,480
This is.

96
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,450
So this seems to be close.

97
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:39,360
Okay.

98
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,160
So we are just going to be joining them together.

99
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,210
Okay.

100
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,600
Then we'll do that for this guy to catch your second trophy.

101
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,310
Take it down.

102
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,340
See the distance.

103
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,450
If you notice, you will see that we actually haven't picked the shape.

104
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,910
The interaction is not an issue.

105
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,920
We can just to use our eyes to gauge.

106
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,040
So I'm just going to select this fantasy trophy.

107
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,110
Then let me check here.

108
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,580
We don't have the divider.

109
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:50,540
So we'll just do that of the divider with a divider just to control this.

110
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,810
Then I'm going to bring it down.

111
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,480
It should be just some distance.

112
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,610
Okay, so this should be okay.

113
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,060
If I should check, let me take it up slow.

114
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,280
Let's see.

115
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,730
And I do control C, control v, take it down.

116
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,140
So this.

117
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:20,930
Okay, let's check from here and see if they suggest so then.

118
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:33,560
So A, B, C, so just A and B, two, one, two, three, two, B, one, two, three.

119
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,780
So now what we have to do is the floating action button and the way we are done.

120
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,220
So the floating action button.

121
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:50,030
So I think the C here to see we can just control C, control V and bring them down.

122
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,880
It's not that they just delete it.

123
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,190
We just do that over the floating action button.

124
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:02,400
So I'm going to bring it here and I'll weigh.

125
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,870
If we preview it.

126
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,710
Okay, so that should be it.

127
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,160
We are not going to add this color.

128
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,430
We are not going to do the same like the coloring.

129
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,680
Just leave it this way.

130
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,010
And then that should be it for our final projects.

131
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,990
Okay, so thank you for watching.

132
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,260
And remember to change the names accordingly.

133
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,310
So thank you.
