1
00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:01.810
Okay.

2
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.650
So I've checked my spacing and it looks good enough for me.

3
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.440
I spaced that there's a 40 pixel distance between them.

4
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.260
So the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create this button here.

5
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.420
More options button and then.

6
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.600
The thing now follow up to after that will be the collar button and then the numbers.

7
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:34.190
So to create a more options button, instead of designing a journey from scratch, I'll just duplicate

8
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.300
what I have.

9
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:42.710
I just instead of creating this from scratch, I'll just duplicate the apply now button and then modify

10
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.640
it a bit to suit my more questions button.

11
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.510
So let me make the distance.

12
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.870
Hmm.

13
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.360
Yeah.

14
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.180
60 seems good enough.

15
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.690
60.

16
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.380
60 seems okay to.

17
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.890
I double click.

18
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.580
Since it's a group I have to drop.

19
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.430
Since it's a group I have to double click to in order to select only the rectangular shape.

20
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.690
So I double click and I select just the rectangular shape.

21
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.210
And then I stretches a bit.

22
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.540
As you can see here.

23
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.220
Then I change.

24
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.000
And we use this to exercise a bit too.

25
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.030
So I change it from my plan.

26
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.400
On to more questions.

27
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.450
Good.

28
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.280
Okay.

29
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:55.650
So if you notice in the button that a circular thing with an icon, a forward icon inside it, so I'm

30
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.840
going to create my circular thing.

31
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.990
Or spherical shape.

32
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.510
So I go to the shape to click on the down order and then select my ellipse.

33
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.590
I want to draw a correct circle.

34
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.700
So to do that, I press and hold shift.

35
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.080
And then I create my circle.

36
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.890
Good.

37
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.840
Good.

38
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.490
This.

39
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.790
Good.

40
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.860
This looks good enough.

41
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.360
So I'm just going to change the color from this to whites.

42
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.900
Yeah.

43
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.120
It works for me.

44
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.170
Once again, I go back to I quantify it to find an icon that matches that.

45
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.630
So I would just say forward, central forward.

46
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.010
This matches that.

47
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.690
So I drag this into my working space once again.

48
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.910
I close this and then move this into my ship I created earlier

49
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.990
and make it a bit bigger.

50
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.740
26 seems good enough.

51
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.250
Okay.

52
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.420
So I group the shape.

53
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.090
With.

54
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.290
Very secular, too.

55
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.630
And then I moved this.

56
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.590
Me on the button so that I can group all of them together and they become one.

57
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.270
Or managing my keyboard.

58
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.330
Okay, great.

59
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.290
So the next thing I'm going to do.

60
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.980
Wait.

61
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.110
But if you notice here, you realize there's a shadow around a button, right?

62
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.010
So I'm going to create a shadow with my button selected.

63
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.050
I just click on effects yet.

64
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.550
And then you see, it gives me a shadow, a subtle shadow.

65
00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.390
So I click on the effects settings and then they make the blood 20.

66
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.080
And then this 30.

67
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.860
The wife for.

68
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.400
Okay.

69
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.420
Let me get that.

70
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.670
Let's make the plan.

71
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.300
You see how it looks?

72
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.480
Okay.

73
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.020
So this looks good enough.

74
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.890
This looks good enough to preview.

75
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.760
You can just click on the play button up here.

76
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.570
It loads and gives you a preview of the design.

77
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.260
Great.

78
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.640
So this is how my design look is in progress.

79
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.450
This I look what I'm going to do is I'm going to reduce.

80
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.230
This takes color a bit.

81
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.880
And then we use these sizes, the icon sizes as well.

82
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.780
I said the icon, the menu item options that size just as well.

83
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.210
So I reduce it to 20.

84
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.540
Move this from reduce this to 20 as well.

85
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.940
And change.

86
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:24.550
Our phone tweets from semi boat medium and then reduce the intensity a bit.

87
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:32.460
So when I look here, it looks a bit better now, but the spacing between the menu items are a bit too

88
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.820
much.

89
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.300
So I have to reduce those the space a bit.

90
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.710
To do that.

91
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.610
And reduce it to 15.

92
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.580
See how it looks.

93
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.300
Move it a bit closer to the button.

94
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.930
Take my space in between them.

95
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.230
And we see how it looks.

96
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.490
Hmm.

97
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.920
This doesn't look bad.

98
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.300
Let me bring this.

99
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.420
Takes up a bit, too.

100
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.840
Strange.

101
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.600
He seems to look okay.

102
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.260
Yeah.

103
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.620
Saint is good enough.

104
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.060
Let's move the baton up a bit.

105
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.140
So.

106
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:26.800
Let's see how it looks.

107
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.580
50?

108
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.020
Yes.

109
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:30.820
Looks good.

110
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:31.780
Looks good.

111
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.500
So I just have to bring this up a bit.

112
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.510
If we reduce this from 200 to 2 50 to 200.

113
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.310
Q 52 200.

114
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.830
See.

115
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.640
Have a look.

116
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.030
And reduce the width a bit.

117
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.980
Two 540.

118
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.050
Okay.

119
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.730
So this looks good.

120
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.900
This looks good.

121
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.990
I think I still have to reduce the spaces between.

122
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.370
Over here.

123
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.240
Good.

124
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.250
Hmm.

125
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.590
I love what I'm seeing.

126
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.220
Okay.

127
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.540
Let's reduce.

128
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:39.220
It's a bit.

129
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.930
And sense that it takes incited.

130
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.200
This looks good enough.

131
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.120
This looks good.

132
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.150
It just looks good.

133
00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:01.480
Okay, so moving on, the next thing we are going to do is we are going to be designing this button,

134
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.860
this call button.

135
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.010
Once again, we select a.

136
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.500
Ellipse, too, and then create a circle.

137
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.810
So once again, we select our ellipse to increase create a circle.

138
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:22.540
Once again, we select our lives too, by pressing.

139
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.310
Or on that keyboard and then create a circle.

140
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:37.720
It's over the same height to make this 16 year.

141
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.070
Good.

142
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.180
Change it to white.

143
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.610
Change the colour of the circle to white.

144
00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.020
And then create a shadow.

145
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.950
Make the schedule to.

146
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.110
Let's make it 20.

147
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.340
See how it looks in the preview.

148
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.550
As reduce our intensity a bit.

149
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:11.580
Okay.

150
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.350
Let's see how it looks.

151
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.100
If it doesn't make it 15.

152
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:22.520
Okay.

153
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.960
So this looks good enough.

154
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:32.750
So the next thing I'm going to do is we are going to look for the phone icon from my quantifier once

155
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:33.290
again.

156
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:39.020
So I just pull it up and then search for phone.

157
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:40.280
Okay.

158
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.690
I'm good with this, so I just drag it onto my ODS board.

159
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.870
And then I send sides.

160
00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.730
Then I group it.

161
00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:01.700
So.

162
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.890
May I have my sheep here?

163
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:11.490
I think I have to reduce the size of bits because it looks a bit too big here, so I'll just reduce

164
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:12.330
it a bit.

165
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.860
25, I think 25 should be good enough.

166
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.930
So I would use it in a sense that it's in my seconds again.

167
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:26.280
When I finish, I group it so it looks good enough.
