00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.820
Welcome to this fake McCoys.

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.260
So let's move along.

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:06.630
Okay.

4
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.620
So we have our first shape created here in Canada.

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.150
What we are going to do is we are just going to duplicate the shape.

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.310
So I just select the shape and then Press Command D on my keyboard.

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.570
I create a duplicate.

8
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.270
I move the copy away from the.

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.450
The original.

10
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.760
I move it to the corner here at the bottom and I reduce the size a bit.

11
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.290
Yeah.

12
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.360
The size a bit.

13
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.880
Okay.

14
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.140
So this is good enough.

15
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.180
But if we look here, we pay attention, realize that this is not linear.

16
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.000
This is a simple, solid color.

17
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.980
Have the lights.

18
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.890
I hear so.

19
00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.880
Yeah.

20
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.750
We maintain this and then convert it to solid good.

21
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.190
We have a color here.

22
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.270
Well, I think there's the lighter version of the Violet.

23
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.110
So let me reduce it a bit.

24
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.530
Okay.

25
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.940
Let's see how it looks.

26
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:22.510
Yeah.

27
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.970
Okay.

28
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:39.400
So we change the color and then what we have here, let's make this light a bit lighter and change it

29
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.450
to ten.

30
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.080
I think that ten is too light for us.

31
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.190
So 15.

32
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.960
Yeah, 15 works quite well.

33
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.670
So when we compare it to what we have here, we realize that it's similar.

34
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.410
We are good to go.

35
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.260
Let me preview it and see how it looks.

36
00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.960
Oh.

37
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.190
Okay.

38
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.150
It's showing now.

39
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.800
It looks good and close enough.

40
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.730
Okay.

41
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.010
So moving on, what we are going to do is we are going to create the login screen next to do that.

42
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.840
We are not going to design from scratch.

43
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.080
We are just going to duplicate the page you've already created and then modify that to suit the login

44
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.740
page.

45
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:32.400
So to do that I select my frame and then I press command D because I'm using Mark and it's controlled

46
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.140
for you if you are using windows.

47
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.580
So I have my duplicates.

48
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.670
Now the next thing I'm going to do is rename my frame.

49
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.170
So I rename it from Welcome to log in.

50
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.180
Yeah.

51
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.520
So I have my log in frame now.

52
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.800
Let me move there.

53
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.080
Let me turn off the grid here so that I see how it looks here.

54
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.820
It looks good.

55
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:57.680
It looks good.

56
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.350
So back to my log in screen.

57
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.500
I have my log in screen.

58
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.030
Now, the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to change this text from.

59
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.700
Welcome to log in.

60
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.780
Yeah.

61
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.590
Okay.

62
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.840
So I have my log in here.

63
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:19.490
As you see here, you realize that we have the illustration of the female, but then the male one is

64
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.820
gone.

65
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.400
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to delete this and move this update.

66
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.030
Maybe reduce the size a bit as well.

67
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.000
I mean, would use it from 200 to 190.

68
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.460
And then sent sides.

69
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.890
Let me see how it looks by previewing it.

70
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.690
It looks good.

71
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.860
It looks good.

72
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:55.510
So the next thing I'm going to do here, as you see, we have the inputs section, so the input boxes.

73
00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.760
So we have the image of input box, the username input box and the password input box.

74
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.750
So I'm going to create these boxes, right?

75
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:15.660
To do that, I'm just going to duplicate the the button I have here instead of creating a shape from

76
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.150
scratch.

77
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:23.280
As you see, they all have similar shapes, so I'll just duplicate my register button here and then

78
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.050
move it up there.

79
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.860
Right.

80
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.470
Cynthia.

81
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.000
I make sure it's well centered.

82
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.920
And our own group.

83
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.550
Our own group.

84
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.360
This now.

85
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.570
So a group it.

86
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.780
And then delete.

87
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.220
No, no, no, no.

88
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.530
So our group it.

89
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.940
So I won't group that.

90
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.430
Now I'll change this text from register to email.

91
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.980
That's my first.

92
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.420
Inputs box I'm creating.

93
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.020
So from register to email and I reduce the size to 15.

94
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.470
Let me look at the design here.

95
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.110
You realize that the input boxes have very little shade of purple.

96
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.970
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to reduce the color intensity here.

97
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.970
So I reduce it from 100 to 15.

98
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:14.600
Let's see.

99
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.680
Okay.

100
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.550
It looks good.

101
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.270
It looks good.

102
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.110
It looks good.

103
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.430
Then I changed the text from White's.

104
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.800
To great.

105
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:27.230
Okay.

106
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.910
Works.

107
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.030
So.

108
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.190
000 and 30 30% of.

109
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.830
There is 0000 that's there.

110
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.280
Those there's there is pure black.

111
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.130
So 30% of that.

112
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:45.290
Okay.

113
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.570
So the next thing I'm going to do here.

114
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.680
Right, is.

115
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.940
Put in an icon.

116
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.960
Yes.

117
00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:00.710
To find an icon, you can either choose to get your icons from Figma plugins or you can choose to go

118
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:08.030
to the icon websites to download icons and then implement them in your designs or use them in your designs.

119
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:15.310
What I found easier to do is to download a plugin and then use them inside of figma.

120
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.310
So I do.

121
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:24.020
I end up using icons without having to go outside of Figma, but for educational purposes, I'll teach

122
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.360
you how to go to plugin sites and then download.

123
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.350
Right?

124
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.530
So let's go to the browser.

125
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.220
Okay.

126
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.030
So we have a browser here.

127
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:55.740
There's a go to search for flags icons flags icons has a wide range of icon options that.

128
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.520
Sorry, Fred.

129
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.930
Flood icons has a wide range of icons, options that you can use and implement in your designs.

130
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:12.110
They also have a Figma plugin, so if you want to download from the website, you come here and you

131
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.210
search for whatever icon you need.

132
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.050
So let me search for email, right?

133
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:23.750
So when I search for email, you realize that I'm given a wide array of email icons.

134
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.610
I have a lot of options here, so I can choose to download whatever I want.

135
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:39.500
If you want the SPG, sorry, the PNG version of this, you can just copy the PNG and then paste it

136
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.630
in your figma without necessarily having to download it if you want the PNG option.

137
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:52.430
But as I mentioned earlier, I like to use SVG because it allows me to modify them to suit my preference.

138
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:57.920
So if you want to download the SPG option, you click on the icon option.

139
00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.550
Right, then you are given PNG and SVG.

140
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.900
Okay, this is a premium one.

141
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.000
There are a lot of free icons here too.

142
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.660
So let's select the free one.

143
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:09.290
Yeah.

144
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:27.790
Wow.

145
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.790
It looks like.

146
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.770
Flat icons of media demand paid now.

147
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.400
You used to be able to download as we use for free guys.

148
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:40.990
This is new to me.

149
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:41.830
This is new.

150
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:44.740
So wow.

151
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:50.020
If you want to pay to get the service and just download the service.

152
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.680
Okay, let's go back to the plugins and figma.

153
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.870
So we are in Figma now.

154
00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.780
To download a plug in your rights, click here.

155
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.250
And then you see plug ins.

156
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:05.000
What you see here, the plug ins I've downloaded.

157
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:10.640
If this is your first time going to this menu and you don't have any plug ins, this is going to you

158
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.900
are not going to have all these.

159
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:12.400
Right?

160
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:18.170
So if you want to download a plug in, you move to browse plug ins in community, right?

161
00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.430
We click on that, it takes you to the community.

162
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.310
So you see a lot, a whole range of community files.

163
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:29.890
So let's plug in top and then search for the plugins you need for this course.

164
00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:31.990
We are going to use icon ify, right?

165
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.550
So in search I quantify.

166
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:41.610
You said was I couldn't if I plug in and then when it comes up because I've installed it, you see installed

167
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.180
here.

168
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:48.620
If you don't have it installed, what you are going to see is you're going to see an install button,

169
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.260
you click on it and then it installs it for you instantly.

170
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.700
It's very fast and very simple.

171
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.210
Okay, so back to our design, right?

172
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.190
Back to design to use the plugin we just installed.

173
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.770
You have to right click again, go to the plug ins in the plug in options that appears.

174
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.230
You see the plug in that you just installed.

175
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:20.130
We are going to use I qualify now so you select I quantify right and then a load for you just know what

176
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.310
you are going to see when you first load.

177
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:28.710
I quantify I seen this because this is my last icon I searched for.

178
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:32.850
So this is what you see on your face the first time you open.

179
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:33.720
I qualify.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.650
So we are going to search for an email icon.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.000
Right.

182
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.810
So such you type the keyword email here.

183
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:52.300
And gives us a wide range of email I can so I will select.

184
00:10:54.220 --> 00:11:01.420

185
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.740
My.

186
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.840
