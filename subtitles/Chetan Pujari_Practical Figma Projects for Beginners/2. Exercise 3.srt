1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:00,990
Okay.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:07,500
So welcome to the continuation of the US project that we started previously.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,610
So here I'm going to have to take this up.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,300
Okay.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,070
To this.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:15,390
Okay.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,050
So that is quite okay.

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,280
And then you might want to preview what you've done so far.

9
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:27,280
But this remember this the line to the line shape or component.

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,010
So I'm going to increase this to two.

11
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:35,190
So one interest in our interest thing about visit, you can actually type two here.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,690
Let's see, I'm going to do eight divided by so eight divided by four.

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,610
So two.

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:43,210
Okay.

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,030
So maybe you can also do some simple calculations here.

16
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:46,800
Okay.

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:55,090
So now I'm going to pick the rectangle two and then at this point just right below the line.

18
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,380
So I'm going to draw.

19
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:57,740
Okay.

20
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,370
And then leave this here.

21
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,140
Let me take it down.

22
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:02,990
Okay.

23
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,870
So we just control plus plus two, zoom in.

24
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,820
So they're able to snap this a bit.

25
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,960
So let me snap it to it's okay.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,280
And then I'm going to have to change this color.

27
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,220
So let me go here and then this color.

28
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:26,830
So this color, this is the color value or the color code has to do and then I'm going to paste it in

29
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,190
the fill pops.

30
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,670
So control v press enter.

31
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,710
Okay, so it has picked us for us.

32
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:33,490
Okay.

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,120
Don't it up?

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,760
Then let me control Manus.

35
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,620
Let's see what we have here.

36
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:46,990
Okay.

37
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:51,250
There's some percentage here, so let me see here.

38
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay.

39
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:04,420
Finbarr, when you go here, you can see we have a percentage like 20%.

40
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,400
So I have to go and change to 20%.

41
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,460
So just you can see 100.

42
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,330
So we change it to 20.

43
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,230
So now we have the actual color that we want.

44
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:17,690
Okay.

45
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:23,180
So what we can do now is to check this.

46
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,640
So we need to do the mobile, the phone number and then these icons.

47
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,330
So first of all, we would have to do this, the background components, okay?

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,340
So to do that, we would have to use the Ellipse tool.

49
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,430
So the Ellipse too, and then I'm just going to draw here.

50
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:46,670
So our denote shifts as usual cycle and then I'm going to change this color to white.

51
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,160
Okay.

52
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,230
And then now you can see if you zoom in carefully, you see that it has some drop shadows.

53
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,570
So control plus you can see how.

54
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,220
So I'm going to do that.

55
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,680
So I'll go to my effects and then the dropdown is already selected.

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:16,570
So I'll click on the effects settings and then I'm going to change my spread or let me change my Y to

57
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:22,090
zero and then I'll change the spread to, let's say two.

58
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,610
Then my play, I can put my play at play.

59
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,190
Use eight or five.

60
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:32,160
Okay.

61
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,220
So now I can see we have some shadows here.

62
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,690
See, we have the shadow.

63
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,500
Okay.

64
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,670
Which makes its appear as if is projecting out of the screen.

65
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,190
As you can see here, we do have this shadow.

66
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,290
So now we would have to pick the icon.

67
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,770
So let's use that.

68
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,130
So the message face.

69
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,400
So I'm going to pick this with.

70
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,970
And I'm going to resize it.

71
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:06,900
So while holding on auto shifts, I'll just resize it inwards to move it inwards so that it to my tattooed

72
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,420
and let me paste it out.

73
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,660
How to write click because it was picked earlier.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,510
So I have to right click arrange and then bring to France.

75
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,540
So let me look for a range and then how to bring it to France.

76
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,070
So bring two fronts.

77
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,820
So it's not in France, I don't think it's well aligned.

78
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,770
So I can just highlight all and then try to align it's okay.

79
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,010
So align it vertically and then align it here to.

80
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,170
Okay.

81
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,610
So now it's aligned.

82
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:45,960
I can.

83
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,300
So I can just copy this control c, control v and then move it.

84
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,870
And then I'm going to do that for the phone.

85
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,290
Okay.

86
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,920
For the phone.

87
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,530
Also how to right click and then bring two fronts.

88
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:05,330
Okay.

89
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,140
So let me resize it first.

90
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,840
When we take it to buy to tell you to buy, set two right click arrange and then bring two fronts.

91
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,680
So bring two fronts.

92
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,130
Okay.

93
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,390
See, this is also tested by.

94
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:25,670
Okay.

95
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,220
And it changes info.

96
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,030
Okay.

97
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,660
Let me do it.

98
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,350
32 by 32.

99
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:47,890
And I can highlight all and then arrange let me highlight so and then align physical here to try and

100
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,450
delete this from.

101
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,850
So we'll just take this and it'sit's.

102
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,440
Okay, so control minus.

103
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:06,340
So remember to group dance to highlight this and then group control g to group so it becomes one objects.

104
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:13,600
I'm going to highlight this two and then control G to group this and then now let's see the other.

105
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,670
So you have to do that for the IMU.

106
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:21,820
Okay, so since we've already we already control C and copy this, I can still use control V to paste

107
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,030
it.

108
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,890
So it's already stored in memory.

109
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:30,040
So I just use control v to paste it and then I'm going for the meal.

110
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:38,620
So the email I can just do the text two by 32 here and then change it to 32.

111
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:44,890
Okay then I'm just going to move it then right click arrange and then bring two fronts.

112
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,730
Okay.

113
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,960
It looks stretched, not stretched.

114
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,550
So let me just do it this way.

115
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,570
So I think I like it this way.

116
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,430
I like it this way.

117
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,600
So it's well centered.

118
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,420
Okay, so I'm just going to group control G.

119
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,550
So now we have the icons for the IMU default and then the message.

120
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:13,200
Okay.

121
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,520
So let's see what we can do now.

122
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,300
Then I.

123
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,190
Okay.
