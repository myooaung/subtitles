1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:04,610
Well, everyone, so welcome to the continuation of our frequent projects.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:10,990
Okay, so you'll notice that our icon here is too close to the edge, so I'm going to click on it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,310
Let me move it.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,370
Just that somewhere here.

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,160
Okay.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,090
It's okay.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,600
Let me zoom in.

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,020
So I wanted to start on the edge of this.

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:23,670
So here.

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:27,940
Okay.

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,240
So the center is at the edge of it.

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,050
Oh, this.

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,550
Okay, so let's see something and how you can rectify it.

14
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,850
Okay, so let me zoom out.

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,320
Now, if we should.

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,410
Pay close attention to this.

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,410
When I stretch, you can see when I'm trying to stretch the canvas or the frame, you would notice that

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,290
it's stretching the icons too.

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,730
So to avoid that error, you can hold control.

20
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,930
That's for windows.

21
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,350
I don't know.

22
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:10,620
The shortcut key for Mac is you control on your keyboard and then stretch your canvas so that you can

23
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,640
be able to scroll.

24
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,640
Okay, so we want you to achieve the scrollable.

25
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,400
Like I'll just be able to scroll.

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,240
Okay.

27
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,500
So remember to use control when you are transferred to such effects.

28
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:32,840
So what I'm going to do now is just to highlight this control C, control V, or we can just use control

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,350
DX.

30
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,930
Okay, I'm going to bring it down.

31
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,540
So stay with us.

32
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,620
That's nine.

33
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,010
And then I'll do controls D again.

34
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,720
Bring it down.

35
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,120
So it was four.

36
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,390
It's in the.

37
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,560
With that in mind, King.

38
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,660
Now when I do control the.

39
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,760
You should have it.

40
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,950
Okay, so I've already done some control.

41
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,260
D So do this.

42
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,700
You control D Then I'll bring it down.

43
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,130
That's nice.

44
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,040
So let me just bring this up.

45
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,840
Hey.

46
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,890
So remember, I'm going to hold the control, and then I'm going to take it up.

47
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,800
So what next to do is just to change the colors.

48
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,040
So I'm just zooming in to change the colors and then the icons.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,270
We already have gone done.

50
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,440
We've already done something and let's see how to do that.

51
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,330
So when I click this, I can go to.

52
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,050
Let's see.

53
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,330
Sorry.

54
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,750
Right click plugins and then choose lossy files.

55
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,700
Let's wait for it to load.

56
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,380
Once once has downloaded.

57
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,640
Let me just choose Amy.

58
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,010
So I just click this and then convert to give.

59
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,200
Okay.

60
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,810
Then I'm going to add it to Figma.

61
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:10,480
So in other, you see it took the shape it took the shape of this icon, this loosey, when it was here.

62
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,160
Okay.

63
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,970
So we don't need to worry ourselves trying to resize and everything.

64
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:16,860
Okay.

65
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,670
So.

66
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,210
That should be it for this.

67
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,330
And then the rest we are just going to duplicate.

68
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,880
Okay, so I can just take this out.

69
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,630
Delete.

70
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,390
Just control C, control it.

71
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,920
And then bring it here in case.

72
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,390
They will do same for the others.

73
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,420
So control C, control v.

74
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:39,680
No.

75
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,450
Bring it.

76
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,950
Delete this.

77
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,130
Don't drink it here.

78
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,070
Okay.

79
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,700
So that should be it for the last before we have to just align them.

80
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,880
Well here with the help of the guidelines or rules or guidelines.

81
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,100
Yeah.

82
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,680
So we can change the text here to exercise or yoga or whatever.

83
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,620
Exercise here to shopping.

84
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:24,040
Whatever you want to studies or coding remember type in code code CiCi's open countries it's.

85
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:41,800
Quotes.

86
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,560
Essays, recording essays.

87
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:45,750
Okay.

88
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,150
This one amended this donations.

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,830
It isn't work or pets.

90
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,090
Let's do patchwork.

91
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:58,950
Okay.

92
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,340
So we are going to so we have that for our progress.

93
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,700
For progress.

94
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,120
So all we have to do is just change this and it's color.

95
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,390
So this is going to be let's do overdue.

96
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,540
No change will change its color.

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,470
Okay.

98
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,040
So I'm going to give you this colour value, this colour value, and then we'll do same for this.

99
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:34,580
Okay?

100
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:39,690
So we just want some consistency so that our user, when the user sees this color, he knows that it's

101
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,660
an overdue activity.

102
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,280
Okay.

103
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,140
So just as this represents in progress, okay, this represents overdue.

104
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,960
And then the remaining two will give it a green color.

105
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,420
Okay.

106
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,010
So this color value.

107
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,450
And I'm going to green will be called completed.

108
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,260
Completed.

109
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,310
It will change here, too, to.

110
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,700
GREENE So this just a quick projects.

111
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,040
A quick project.

112
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,550
So.

113
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,370
We need to align them.

114
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:26,230
So let me select this and then this multi selects, then I'm going to align them with the help of this.

115
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,120
Okay, so they are well aligned.

116
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,700
So we'll do that for all the other ones.

117
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,660
So more select then align them with the help of the alignment.

118
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,670
So so align physical centers.

119
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,060
Okay.

120
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,970
Okay.

121
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:52,310
So I'm done aligning the icons and then the text here, and then I can change here now to change this

122
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,350
and then select the two.

123
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,730
And then by holding shift and then selecting them and I'm going to give them a green color.

124
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,860
So a quick way to do that and I'm going to change it to complete it.

125
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,420
Okay.

126
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,380
So let's see what we have this.

127
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:21,530
Okay, so this icon, the switch icon was cut and I gave it a shadow drop shadow of an enabler of six.

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,710
Then it's a C icon.

129
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,400
Sorry, it's an iconic icon that I pick from icon ified.

130
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,200
It seems like I'm right.

131
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:38,690
Okay, so I'll click on this and then I'm going to preview it with a play button, open a window and

132
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,650
then load the interface was okay.

133
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,870
So when I tried previewing it, our main lesson isn't showing.

134
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,600
I don't see why it's not showing.

135
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,140
So let's preview this instead and see what happens.

136
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,550
Oh, now this works.

137
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,950
Okay, so when I screw, you can see Scrollable.

138
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,700
Okay?

139
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,680
And then that should be it for our projects.

140
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,640
So thank you.

141
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,050
And I'll see you in the next lesson.

142
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,680
Thank you.
