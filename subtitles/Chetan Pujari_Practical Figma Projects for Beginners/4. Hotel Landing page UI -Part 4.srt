1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,640
The next thing I'm going to do.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,710
It's great.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:11,770
My text, the number we have 8663124370.

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:14,870
Oh.

5
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,330
What is the number again?

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,620
8663124370.

7
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,230
Cool.

8
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:50,090
So the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to increase the capacity since this is 50.

9
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:58,310
So I'll increase it to 80 and then change the font, which is semi blue so that it becomes more visible,

10
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,460
like what we have in the original design.

11
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,470
Then I'll give it a 15 pixel space.

12
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,020
Silver looks good.

13
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,580
It looks good.

14
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,290
We are almost there.

15
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:12,750
We are almost there.

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:20,740
So the next thing are going to do in this design is we are going to create the icons at the far.

17
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,750
So next thing we are going to do in this design is going to create the icons at the far right.

18
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,770
So we have Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and I don't know what this is.

19
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:38,200
So we just create three of the icons since only two of the icons are recognizable to me.

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:47,890
Once again back to I quantify yeah I know utilized I quantify a lot in this session so our search for

21
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,970
Facebook.

22
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:52,680
Good.

23
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,690
So Facebook pops up.

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,250
I select the options.

25
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,890
That is okay for me.

26
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,450
Okay.

27
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,200
So this time I wanted to find all my icons.

28
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,490
Before I close.

29
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,270
I qualify it.

30
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,300
I don't have to keep coming back here.

31
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,230
Yeah.

32
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,520
So I found Facebook.

33
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,340
The next thing is LinkedIn.

34
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:22,930
So I'll type LinkedIn here, see how it looks.

35
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,320
Okay.

36
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,430
This looked good enough for me, so I would like to see a.

37
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,870
Modify it a bit.

38
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,530
Make it small enough and place it.

39
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,360
And the.

40
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:42,680
Okay.

41
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,480
So what's the next icon?

42
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,740
We have Twitter.

43
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:51,890
So.

44
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,390
So pick one of the iPhones.

45
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,750
That seems good enough for me.

46
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,850
Drag it to my.

47
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,710
The ones again.

48
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,040
So I'm going to make the final.

49
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,670
I want a random one by just clicking, just searching social media and choosing whichever one is not

50
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,720
on our list here.

51
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,700
So.

52
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,770
Social media.

53
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,380
Okay.

54
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,380
Nothing should.

55
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,720
I guess I'll actually have to look for something.

56
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,860
We have Instagram here, Facebook.

57
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,680
We have to tell us social media.

58
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,260
Okay.

59
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,030
So we look for Snapchat.

60
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,500
Snapchat.

61
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,680
Let's just look for Snapchat.

62
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,390
A gay.

63
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,480
This should be good enough.

64
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,150
All right.

65
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:06,170
So now that I have all my icons, I'm now coming to the size role.

66
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,330
So I resize it.

67
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:19,380
By either using the options here or just using the inputs, size, inputs of the change, the sizes.

68
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,900
It seems a bit too small, so.

69
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,740
So this was the size.

70
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,400
And make this.

71
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,930
55.

72
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,290
You seem a bit too small, so I have to make it smaller.

73
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,490
Let me see how it looks here.

74
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,370
Okay.

75
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,620
I have to make it smaller.

76
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,150
So I think it should be.

77
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,000
You know, it's usual.

78
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,070
1817 should be okay.

79
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,600
Small.

80
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,840
Should you be?

81
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,510
20.

82
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,110
And you see the size of this.

83
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,600
And we sent them using the center button.

84
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:37,750
I left Facebook out and then distribute the space between them evenly.

85
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,080
And moving closer to my.

86
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,000
My grade age.

87
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,740
Let's see how it looks here.

88
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,770
It looks good enough.

89
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:58,430
So from this design, the only thing I have to do is reduce the color opacity.

90
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,350
I changed it to 40.

91
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,370
Let's see how it looks now.

92
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,100
Design, but looks good enough.

93
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,870
We are going to do is I'm going to shift this a bit closer to our icons here.

94
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,220
This weekend, 50.

95
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:16,680
Great.

96
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,310
So 50 looks good enough.

97
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,540
Okay.

98
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,890
So we are left with some few things I almost forgot.

99
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:32,420
So we have these buttons here and then we have this go button.

100
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:37,810
So to create this once again, I'll just duplicate this here.

101
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,500
On this.

102
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,020
You need the iPhone already available.

103
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,990
Change the color from white to black.

104
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,600
And make it a black.

105
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,640
Can I just make your block lock?

106
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,020
Okay.

107
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:01,570
Good.

108
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,290
I qualify once again.

109
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,000
Special headphones.

110
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:11,530
Okay.

111
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,190
So I just select the first icon I'm okay with.

112
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:21,680
SC One closer to yeah, this one looks close towards us there, so I'll use this.

113
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,730
So I drag this to my board and then I resize it.

114
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,700
Change the color.

115
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,280
Resize it.

116
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,990
Make a small enough to fit.

117
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,610
The small Seiko I have down there.

118
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,290
Yeah.

119
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,720
This small alembic give.

120
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,950
And then sent it to my ship.

121
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,740
And then finally it.

122
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,200
Let's see how it looks.

123
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,610
Okay.

124
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,920
Looks good enough.

125
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,970
So now we have our final thing, which is these two shapes.

126
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,260
Once again.

127
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,670
I'll just duplicate this instead of doing it from scratch.

128
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,360
I'll group bids and delete.

129
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,340
The phone icon.

130
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,440
Make the circle a bit smaller.

131
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,570
It make it that 60 by 50.

132
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,550
Yeah.

133
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,010
60 by 50 looks good enough.

134
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:31,990
Let's see.

135
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,690
And this seems to be to be.

136
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:37,910
Okay.

137
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,900
50 looks okay and make it for 20.

138
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,100
Okay.

139
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,590
35 looks good too.

140
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,260
So let's maintain 45.

141
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,470
Okay.

142
00:08:51,610 --> 00:09:01,600
So once again, back to iconic by our favorite plugin for the session and then search forward once again

143
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,640
forward for it.

144
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,680
Forward, forward.

145
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,120
I see.

146
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,730
What's.

147
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,200
Have something close.

148
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,390
Okay.

149
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,120
So this is close to what is there?

150
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,300
I drag this.

151
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,730
And they use it in that design.

152
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:18,840
Let me see.

153
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,790
Inside the circle.

154
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:22,850
Yeah.

155
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:23,660
It's okay.

156
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,020
I don't.

157
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,830
I don't think.

158
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,480
Okay, let me make it slightly.

159
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,230
Move it to 25 and then send it.

160
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,550
Then, Rupert.

161
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:35,970
Good.

162
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,680
So I have my face buttoned down.

163
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,680
Then I just duplicate this to create the next one.

164
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:51,520
To create the next one, I just have to double click to select the the forward icon and then right click

165
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,520
on the icon and then flip horizontal.

166
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:55,770
I'm done.

167
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,950
I'm good to go.

168
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,770
Are we going to design realize a similar.

169
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,060
We are done and does it.

170
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,400
I told you it was going to be a very simple design.

171
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,250
There you have it.

172
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,400
I hope you enjoy the session.

173
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:20,500
If you have any concerns or any questions, you can send it my way and I'll try my best to answer everything

174
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,840
as clearly as possible.

175
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:31,270
Thank you very much and do have a lovely day or evening, depending on whichever time you're watching

176
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,080
this course.

177
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,260
So next time, bye bye.
