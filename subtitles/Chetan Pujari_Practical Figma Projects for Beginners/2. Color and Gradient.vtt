00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.310
So now let's talk about color.

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.200
So color.

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.690
So color is a basic elements of design that affects the sensation of the eye.

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.170
So we have color theory.

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.640
So when I say color, we are looking at red, yellow and green and the like.

6
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.710
So red.

7
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.900
And then so you have the primary colors being red, yellow and then green and blue.

8
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.750
Okay.

9
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.010
So we have.

10
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.620
We also have secondary colors.

11
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.320
That is a combination of these colors, primary colors.

12
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.090
And then we have texture colors, too.

13
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.870
So a combination of the secondary colors.

14
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.390
So let's take a look at something that didn't figure.

15
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.690
Okay.

16
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.390
So let's say so these are the primary colors.

17
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.250
So red, yellow and then blue.

18
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.520
Now, these are a combination of red and blue.

19
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.270
Yellow.

20
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.230
So red and yellow.

21
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.530
So it's orange and then yellow and then blue gives us green and then blue and then red.

22
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.200
This as well.

23
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:09.330
So a combination of any primary color gives you a secondary color, and then a combination of the secondary

24
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.250
color gives you a texture color.

25
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.570
So you might want to research on complementary colors, analogous colors.

26
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.830
And then we have some some other forms of colors.

27
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.710
But let's look at gradients.

28
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.910
So to achieve gradients, let's say I'm going to select this.

29
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.030
So gradients this is also called color transition.

30
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.250
So how two or more colors fuse or transition or blend together.

31
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.720
So let's say this color, I want to blend another color.

32
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.170
So and sigma when I select this and then it gives me the color property, I can click here and then

33
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.980
go to.

34
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.860
Linear, you can choose radio and then it's given me the option to add a color.

35
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.180
So this orange say I want to add.

36
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.990
You.

37
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.150
For.

38
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.890
We need to.

39
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.370
So the secondary color.

40
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.910
On the second color I'm going to and then I'm going to choose this.

41
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.530
Then here we're going to select.

42
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.000
So there's something that we can do for our.

43
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.880
Greedy and callous.

44
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.020
So thank you.

45
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.540
And then also, you might want to check on color theory.
