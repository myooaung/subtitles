00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.480
Hello.

2
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.380
Everyone will come to this UI UX crash course with anybody can develop is going to continue from where

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.420
we left off yesterday.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.180
So what I'm going to do today is I'm going to create an frame from scratch.

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.740
I'm just going to duplicate the frame I already created and then continue from there.

6
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.480
We all remember our duplication technique.

7
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.530
Replicate your screen and change the name of the new screen to log in.

8
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.830
In screen.

9
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.590
They say so that these are clapping with a Zen icon inside.

10
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.840
Okay.

11
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.570
So we are going to greet them since we didn't do that.

12
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.070
All right.

13
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:57.650
So with this, what you're going to do is before that, we can see that there's an icon inside the shape

14
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.450
and there's an icon here as well.

15
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:09.950
So another technique I'm going to teach you right now is how you can use plug in figma right click in

16
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.770
the empty space in your work area.

17
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.150
Okay.

18
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.000
When you right click, you get a pop up menu.

19
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.800
You have show UI, choose large hide UI, quick actions and then plugin you hover over the plugin for

20
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.750
click java what you want to do.

21
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:36.020
You see if you already have plugins installed, you see a list of plugins and the options, manage plugins,

22
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.730
browse plugins and community.

23
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:44.120
If you don't have any plugins installed, you just see the manage plugins and the browser plugins in

24
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.080
community.

25
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.030
What you do is you click on Browse plugins in community.

26
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.500
Do we get that?

27
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.790
Yeah.

28
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.170
Okay, good.

29
00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:02.030
So now what I want you to do if you on this page, you will see on Splash as the first plugin and I

30
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.070
quantify as a second plugin stream.

31
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.150
Right, you'll notice that some buttons and on the buttons are written in stone and stone.

32
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.310
So what I want you to do is install the I qualify plugin, which is the second plugin on the list.

33
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.150
So just as you can see on my screen, I've already installed it, so I don't need to click on new stuff

34
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.530
to install.

35
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.890
For those of you who don't have that plugin, click on it and then it instantly installs the plugin

36
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.400
for you.

37
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.610
So now we have

38
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:47.060
our first, I'm assuming we all have enjoyed a plugin before, so we have our first plugin stored.

39
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:55.860
Now before we use the plugin, we are going to do it this shape that we missed yesterday, seconds to

40
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.770
one second.

41
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.870
So what you are going to do is you are going to pick the rectangle to from the tools menu or you just

42
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.000
press are on the keyboard and then you start drawing your rectangle on the.

43
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.980
The frame or the assemblage.

44
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.230
Okay.

45
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.260
So and it's supposed to be small because actually it is quite small.

46
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:24.130
Yes.

47
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.830
Okay.

48
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.460
So now I have my rectangle.

49
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.580
And they a bit more.

50
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.320
I have my rectangle.

51
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.520
Now.

52
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.840
Yesterday, I taught you how to carve the corners of your shapes.

53
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.530
Today, what I'm going to learn is how to carve a corner.

54
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.340
Yesterday, we learned how to give the contents of the ship as a group like Cave or the contents at

55
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.920
once.

56
00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.580
Today, what?

57
00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.720
We are going to do it.

58
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.980
We are going to learn how to ground or cave the contents individually.

59
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:04.640
So.

60
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.780
I can't choose to carry this rank or not without affecting the other kids.

61
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:18.140
Or I can just choose to give to one without affecting one or none.

62
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.200
Yeah.

63
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.600
So I still have my chip.

64
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:31.720
I just created selected and my mouth is currently on the juice box.

65
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:39.860
And if you all observe, we see that there's a small square beside the box.

66
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.220
Once I who are worried, you see independent columns showing.

67
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.690
We see that.

68
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.290
Yes.

69
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.240
Okay, good.

70
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.770
So you click on that.

71
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.630
When you click on that, you get an additional function down there.

72
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.660
So now what we are going to do this.

73
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.870
So this is the shape you are designing, right?

74
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.810
With my rectangle selected rectangle aggregates.

75
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:17.800
You can see that after we click the square box or the square icon, we had a number of options broken

76
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.070
down.

77
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:27.280
This is to reduce, but this time we have the individual values of the four corners.

78
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.560
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to round three corners and leave one.

79
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.490
So

80
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.220
that's hundred is too huge.

81
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:54.760
So I start inputting my values huge and then leave the parts I don't want to round the.

82
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.520
Okay.

83
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.110
It's.

84
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.710
I think I'm right.

85
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.270
You think you are?

86
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.020
So yeah, I think.

87
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.560
Thank you.

88
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:32.160
Except I mean, I think as you make it a bit more as you do though, if it looks similar because I agree

89
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.020
that it looks similar.

90
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.690
Right.

91
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:44.810
So now we have come to use our plugin that we installed because we need to put an icon on this clip.

92
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:51.390
As you can see in the original Victoria Trinity Design, original design we are trying to do so once

93
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:56.310
again, you are actually in your way in the free workspace.

94
00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:03.720
There are options this time when you are a plugin or click plugin, you see the.

95
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.290
The plugin you installed, which is the icon inside.

96
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.370
We see that.

97
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.100
You see your icon, that asset icon you plug in that installed.

98
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.350
In this case, you are going to use I quantify.

99
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:24.650
So I tap on, I quantify and I wait for it to drop here.

100
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.440
That's because I already searched for something.

101
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.810
So this icon here looks like a globe something.

102
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.100
So I'm going to search group out to see what I'll find.

103
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:42.540
Okay.

104
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.980
So I got something similar.

105
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:53.500
So what I do is I'll click and hold the one I'm choosing and then drag it to my frame.

106
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.990
So now I have my icon on my ship.

107
00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:04.760
What I'm going to do and as you notice, it's not really visible because the color of the iPhone is

108
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:04.870
low.

109
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.930
Contrast the color of the shape.

110
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:13.830
So what I'm doing converts the color from black to white so that you can notice it more.

111
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.040
So after I've done this, I'm going to do what me?

112
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.050
I'm going to do.

113
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.390
So after you've done this, they give you this one.

114
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.550
So now this is next.

115
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:42.100
As you can see, we have a similar shape, but this one is bigger than the other one.

116
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:47.410
I'm not going to create the shape from I'm going to create this thing.

117
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.340
So as I said, I'm not going to create the shape from scratch.

118
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:59.430
I just copy and paste what I already created and modified, modify it again.

119
00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.520
So now I'll duplicate that my shape.

120
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:09.280
I suppose I could have created a duplicate of it.

121
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:14.920
So then this is what's creating the occasion.

122
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.300
This my people.

123
00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.590
If you want to see this, creates this for me.

124
00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.560
Yes, for my own.

125
00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:35.860
I duplicated what I created earlier and I just enlarged it, as you can see, as I enlarged it, that

126
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.500
she becomes like, what is here?

127
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:47.760
But then you notice that my is like inverted the opposite of what is here.

128
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:53.520
You got to see it.

129
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.740
All right.

130
00:09:54.750 --> 00:10:00.570
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to flip it both horizontally and vertically.

131
00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:00.990
Let me see.

132
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:02.970
This is an experiment

133
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.190
with zero eggs.

134
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:19.500
So I just copied or duplicated the first one I created, enlarged it, and then I right click on it.

135
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:26.370
So I right click on it on the shape, the duplicate shape that I enlarged.

136
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:30.930
And then if you see the pop up menu, you can see flip horizontally and flip vertical.

137
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.640
I'll flip it horizontally and then flip it vertically.

138
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.250
The Varla, I have my shape.

139
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:40.800
Okay.

140
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.790
All right, all right.

141
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.740
So let me send it back.

142
00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.540
This is why it looks like this has a bit of a shadow.

143
00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:53.950
Now it just converts the colour to whites.

144
00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.420
And then we have it looks like this one has an icon by which time gets an icon type.

145
00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:03.820
$500.

146
00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.710
And this month besides.

147
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.210
So 500.

148
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:12.940
And this might.

149
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:16.870
We?

150
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.390
MP Changing the colour white.

151
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:23.310
Yeah.

152
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.820
Change the colour of the ship to white.

153
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:34.940
If you duplicate it or if you feel you're feeling adventurous and you think you can pick a colour that

154
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.280
works right.

155
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:40.270
His company.

156
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:46.570
With nothing else.

157
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.660
I give this things to coach.

158
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.590
Because we.

159
00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:55.590
What's it all?

160
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:00.400
Okay.

161
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.750
So I left out my iPhone, so it looks a bit different.

162
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:13.970
I'm putting the log in the stream side so that you can look on it.

163
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:24.920
So we noticed that the log in is also using the capsule image.

164
00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.700
Right.

165
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.850
The Cubs will image and text.

166
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.170
The only difference here is we have to add

167
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:45.240
a marxist here and also this thing.

168
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:50.230
Yeah, there's nothing here and it doesn't have the capsules.

169
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.430
Two capsules at the top.

170
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:57.400
What I'm going to do is I'm not going to delete the capsules at the top, the capsule shapes at the

171
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:57.820
top.

172
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:07.060
I'm only going to group it and then delete one so that I can use that one to form this shape or do this

173
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.440
or create this design.

174
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:18.490
As that's my own grouping, this layout here, then deleting one of them, I move the one that I left

175
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:19.630
behind here.

176
00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.180
I enlarges a bit just so I can create the shape.

177
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:36.360
Around my corner is a bit more around so that I can see you achieve a similar.

178
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.550
I think this is a bit stronger than this

179
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:44.610
one.

180
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:48.630
That's fine.

181
00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:49.770
Okay.

182
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.890
So then how have it received?

183
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:53.480
Now.

184
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:55.560
All right.

185
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.100
No, no.

186
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:00.080
Give me.

187
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:10.530
The next thing you are going to do is you are going to if you look at the image here, you see that

188
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:18.480
the back image is now up here and then the front image is here.

189
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.370
So it's like the switch places.

190
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:24.030
So now we are just going to move them, switch them to as well.

191
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:30.840
Then they're just

192
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.510
going to do now is going to use a different picture.

193
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:37.860
Okay.

194
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:38.790
Is it clear?

195
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:39.360
I know.

196
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:40.530
Yeah.

197
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:41.900
Okay, good.

198
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:47.850
I need to use my

199
00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:54.890
way of

200
00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.040
doing

201
00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:01.650
it.

202
00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:04.740
Okay.

203
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:07.880
So moving on.

204
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:09.190
Moving on and moving on.

205
00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.170
Moving on.

206
00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:16.980
Then this up a bit so that we can get enough space to select.

207
00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:18.090
Then.

208
00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:25.620
Now I'm really hoping you grouped that now in the shape for it to become one so that we have ready to

209
00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:25.820
move.

210
00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.020
So if you did that, that's good.

211
00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:33.600
So if you didn't do that, then you are now going to have to select the text and the shape behind it.

212
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:41.040
So select these things as I'm doing and then move them up a bit so that we get enough space for the

213
00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.680
that is from the input side.

214
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.820
Because.

215
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:55.860
I think this is a key move that takes up a bit.

216
00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:58.590
So.

217
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:04.690
Okay.

218
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.690
Yes, that takes a bit.

219
00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:17.230
Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to guess the top of my text here and then change.

220
00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.790
The text log in now.

221
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.540
They modified this year's.

222
00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.080
Sorry.

223
00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:40.340
And the details.

224
00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:45.810
That's a good thing,

225
00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:49.550
right?

226
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:53.010
Okay, so this is no need to delete this.

227
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:02.830
Thank you very much.
