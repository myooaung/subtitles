1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:07,320
Everyone will come to this UI UX crash course with anybody can develop in me or Twitter for today.

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,380
Jacqueline I solidarity.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,540
So a bit about me.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,640
I am sorry that, as I mentioned earlier, I'm a lead user interface designer, Garner Tech Lab and

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,890
user experience designer tech so limited I completed my bachelor's in computer engineering.

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,390
I love to learn and also teach what I learned.

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,900
So on behind you can find me using the names below here.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,910
So today what we'll be doing is introducing you to UI, UX and then.

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Who explained the difference between UI and UX design, and then there will be some examples.

10
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,940
You've introduced the design fundamental and then you introduce prototyping by framing basics.

11
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,510
And finally, high fidelity mockup basics protocols.

12
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,810
And with that, we are going to design that.

13
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,800
So UI UX, what is UI?

14
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:16,020
User UI is basically user interface and what is user interface is the medium used by the individual

15
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,620
or the user to interact with the product or service.

16
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:27,030
So user interface is basically what the user interacts with to get a specific job done or a type of

17
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,740
job done right.

18
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,460
So.

19
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,700
What is UX?

20
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:41,560
UX, which is simply user experience, is how the user feels when interacting with a product.

21
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,910
How does it feel?

22
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:50,650
Interacting with the experiences for products can either be good or be bad for your users to have a

23
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,850
good experience.

24
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:56,740
The design should be equitable, usable and durable and useful.

25
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,750
Now, when we say equitable, what do we mean?

26
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,430
We mean that the design should be able to be used by a wide range of people.

27
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,280
A variety of people should be able to use it.

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,390
It shouldn't be only limited to a specific type of people.

29
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:18,130
Disabled people should be able to use abled people should be able to use people from different diverse

30
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,810
backgrounds, should be able to use that as well.

31
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,450
What do we mean by usable?

32
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:22,990
Usable?

33
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,280
Should it be too complicated for the users to understand?

34
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:34,360
They should be able to see and immediately know how to use or be able to see and be able to learn how

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,170
to use it.

36
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:40,450
If it's too complicated and not usable, it delivers bad experiences to your users.

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,460
Now enjoyable.

38
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,690
What keeps your users coming back is when your experience is enjoyable.

39
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,150
If they don't enjoy the experience from the first time or the first try, they are not going to come

40
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,840
back again.

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,140
So you have to make sure that your experiences are in job.

42
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,170
An example is social media.

43
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,920
Social media we know Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and so on.

44
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:11,080
People keep visiting or keep going back to these apps because they are enjoyable to them.

45
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,720
They enjoy the experience, they enjoy everything them and finally useful.

46
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:25,030
Now when we say user, we want the same sorry, we mean the experience should do what it says it will

47
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,570
do.

48
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,870
It should be able to perform its intended activity.

49
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:37,150
So if I say I'm designing a messaging app and the app I present to my users is not able to send messages,

50
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,640
then my design is not useful.

51
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,970
It becomes useless to my users.

52
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:50,350
Okay, so let's add the differences between UI design and UX design.

53
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,820
UI design involves using colours, shapes, and other design principles.

54
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:01,900
Creates a visual product of visually pleasing products, and you as design basically informs involved.

55
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:07,760
So the creation of a product that provides meaningful and relevant experiences to its user.

56
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:13,270
So UI basically involves the interface how it looks.

57
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:20,200
The colors, the typography and all that and us encompasses everything day.

58
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:30,040
It goes from the beginning to the end, the experience that is being created for the user.

59
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,580
That is what UX design is now.

60
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,120
That's some examples of.

61
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,410
You would say UI design.

62
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,630
What we see here is an example of a user interface.

63
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,690
Right.

64
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,560
We see the colors, we see the typography.

65
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,660
We see the size of the text and the buttons and a whole lot more.

66
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:58,560
You X here in this case involves the way the contents have been placed.

67
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,960
So the structuring of everything here.

68
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,930
There's a reason why login was not a button and get started was made.

69
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:13,350
A button is a user experience that was considered and there's a reason why the logo is up there and

70
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,580
not down there.

71
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,660
That is the user experience being considered here.

72
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,260
She gets it.

73
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,220
Thank you very much.
