00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.200
Welcome to this fake McCoys.

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.550
So let's move along.

3
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:05.720
Let's move along.

4
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.610
We are going to create this beautiful screen here.

5
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.140
Yes.

6
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:19.220
So the first thing I'm going to do here for this design is to create a mobile hotspot.

7
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.930
To do that, I just tap on the frame or press F on my keyboard.

8
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.260
That's a shortcut to it.

9
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.860
And then I see my options appear under the design tab.

10
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.430
Right.

11
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.720
So.

12
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.090
And that is designed to help.

13
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.490
I have a number of options in this work.

14
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.830
I'm going to be designing for a mobile phone, so I just.

15
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.240
Select an option under the phone options.

16
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:51.560
So here I'm just going to select iPhone 13 pro max, not because I have any specific reason, but because

17
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.360
that's the the easiest option to get to select actually.

18
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.900
Okay.

19
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.180
So I have selected my iPhone.

20
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.190
11 Max.

21
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.210
Yeah.

22
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.910
So I've selected my iPhone 11 max.

23
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.530
What I'm going to do is I'm going to double tap on the frame and rename it my first screen to design

24
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.790
as the walk on screen.

25
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.630
So I'm going to rename the screen to walk.

26
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.020
Welcome.

27
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.610
Okay.

28
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.740
Okay, okay.

29
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.270
So the next thing I'm going to do.

30
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.560
It's to create a grid.

31
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.720
So for me, grids are grids guide me so that I don't move into a specific region.

32
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:56.430
So I like to set my start out with a grid so that it guides and I don't move into the margins I set

33
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.420
for myself.

34
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.500
So yes, to do that, I click on the layout grid, the place beside it, and then I tap on the square

35
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.720
here and I'm presented with options, right?

36
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.920
So I select columns from this layout and I set my my margin to 30.

37
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.700
Yes.

38
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.410
So 30.

39
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.730
That's all I need to do.

40
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.720
My margin.

41
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.950
Okay.

42
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.410
I'm good to go away.

43
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:30.840
I have to reduce the opacity a bit, the color intensity a bit so that I can view my design and the

44
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.790
grid won't be a distraction to it.

45
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.750
Okay, so I have my grid setup.

46
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.780
Now, the next thing I'm going to do is draw my.

47
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.560
Register and log in.

48
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.850
Buttons.

49
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.510
Right.

50
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.650
Okay.

51
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.400
To do that, I have to select the rectangular two and.

52
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.480
Draw.

53
00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.280
Oh, my.

54
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.780
My odds board.

55
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.790
Okay, so I have it down.

56
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.490
I have it down.

57
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.780
Let me move the height to 50 and I'm okay with the width.

58
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.670
Then the next thing I'm going to do as we see, we can see here or look here.

59
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.400
The button is rounded, right?

60
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.080
The corners of the buttons are rounded.

61
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.810
So I'm going to round them.

62
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:31.100
So here under the design tab, with the shape I just drew selected, I'll go to the corner radius and

63
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.860
then change the value to that.

64
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.030
T Well.

65
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:42.860
Now you see that my, my shape, the corners of my shape is rounded beautifully and perfectly.

66
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.910
Yes.

67
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.200
Okay.

68
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:52.360
So yeah, the next thing I'm going to do for this design is to change the color, right?

69
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.820
Assuming I don't know the color code, but I have my beautiful design here that I'm copying or remaking.

70
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.750
I just with that shape selected, I go to fill under the design tab.

71
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.240
I click on a.

72
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.240
The color thing here.

73
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:18.710
And then I tap on the eyedropper to right then I move the eyedropper to to the color I want to pick.

74
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.630
And I just click on it.

75
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.590
You can see that it changed the shape.

76
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.620
It changes the color of the shape to the color I wanted to pick.

77
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.160
Right.

78
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.960
Yeah.

79
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.570
So I'm good with this one now.

80
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.920
So the next thing I'm going to do here.

81
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.910
As to type the register.

82
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.830
Text on my sheet.

83
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:49.220
So I'll go to the text to a press t on my keyboard for shortcuts, and then click on my true my shape

84
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.840
and then start typing.

85
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.570
So the first thing I remember is register.

86
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.660
Yeah.

87
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.250
So you realize that my text is a bit too small.

88
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.910
So what I'm going to do is.

89
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.670
And I don't like my phone, so what I'm going to do, I'm.

90
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.000
I'm going to change it to Montserrat.

91
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.080
And then changed.

92
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.500
My phone's from the phone to it, from light to medium, and then increase the font size.

93
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.050
It's all done under the design tab in the text section.

94
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.220
So our increase is 18.

95
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.380
Yeah.

96
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.760
18 looks good.

97
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.140
18 looks good.

98
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.540
Okay.

99
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.590
Okay, okay.

100
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.890
It's going well so far.

101
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.370
It's going well so far, so.

102
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:43.220
Okay.

103
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.580
So I have this here to move on.

104
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:53.360
I want I have to group my buttons so I select the text and the layout and then I press command to group

105
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.810
it.

106
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.310
I go to the layout tab to rename it to.

107
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.940
Register button.

108
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:09.710
Now, it's not necessary for you to rename your elements, but it makes things easier for you as you

109
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.120
move along.

110
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.620
Okay.

111
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.500
So.

112
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:16.310
Moving on.

113
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.210
Moving on.

114
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.280
Okay.

115
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:41.210
So moving on after we've after we've renamed our button, the next thing I'm going to do now is create

116
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.860
a duplicate.

117
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:47.630
To do that, I select the shape that I want to create a duplicate of and press command the it creates

118
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:53.240
the duplicates for me, but you can't see the copy because the copy is still on the original.

119
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:59.210
So what I'm going to do now is move the copy from the original to beneath the original.

120
00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.990
Right.

121
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.570
And I'll move it at a distance of 30.

122
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.800
That just stands between.

123
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:05.290
Yeah.

124
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:12.400
So what I'm going to do now is just double click my text and then change the register to log in.

125
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:22.030
And then I make sure that I select the text and the rectangle and then center align it inside the rectangle.

126
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.310
Okay.

127
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:33.430
But I realize that when we look at this design, right, the color for this is different from this.

128
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.110
This is lighter.

129
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.010
And then the text is not whites is actually the color of this.

130
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.510
So I select my text.

131
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.710
No, I think the first thing I should do is change the color of my rectangular shape.

132
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.350
So I select that and.

133
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:56.380
I go to where the color code is and decided the intensity value.

134
00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:01.760
So I'll change the value from 100 to 10.

135
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.300
Oh, I think ten is a bit too light.

136
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:07.930
I think.

137
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.010
Ten is a bit too light tennis to light.

138
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:18.340
So I me move it a bit to 2035.

139
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.950
I see 30.

140
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:21.800
Okay.

141
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.600
I think 30 is good enough.

142
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.260
I think 30 is good enough.

143
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:30.040
So now my text button is.

144
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.610
This color.

145
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:35.280
What I'm going to do is change the text.

146
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.230
Hello.

147
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:44.460
Am I to remember?

148
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:51.610
Okay.

149
00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:56.710
So the next thing I do is change the text color.

150
00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.750
I'm going to change it to the color of the button up there.

151
00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.040
So, yes, I select the colors.

152
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.330
Now I have my two buttons down.

153
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.490
Good and ready to go.

154
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.670
Let me preview it and see how it looks.

155
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.400
To do that.

156
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.710
I select the frame and then click on the preview button.

157
00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:18.820
Yes.

158
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.300
So due to my internet is taking some time to load.

159
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:29.150
If you have a better internet connection or probably load within seconds.

160
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:29.480
Yeah.

161
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.910
So it's loaded now.

162
00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.200
So this is how it looks on my phone.

163
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.440
Mm hmm.

164
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.890
Okay.

165
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.770
So back to my design and.

166
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.650
So back to the design.

167
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.030
We realize that there are some cartoonish icons here.

168
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.070
These things are illustrations, right?

169
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.510
So to use illustrations, you have to download them or create them yourself.

170
00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:01.330
What I do is I download these illustrations and then use them in my work.

171
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:08.290
There are so many illustrations, sites, sites you can go to to get illustrations.

172
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.490
One of them is on draw is as you can see here.

173
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.140
One of them is on draw.

174
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.430
And then you can just Google illustration sites.

175
00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.980
And then you you be given so many options.

176
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:28.400
You can use the illustrations you see in the design here.

177
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:34.170
I got them from stock vote yes towards people.

178
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:41.150
So here is a freebie illustration someone has designed and put on the internet.

179
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:42.680
Stock votes.

180
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:50.870
I'll share the link so that you can go and download them and use them in your work as you go along.

181
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:51.190
Okay.

182
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.730
So yes, this is top vote, right?

183
00:10:56.030 --> 00:11:03.200
So you go to the sites and then you scroll to where you find the download Photography Vector Illustrations

184
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:04.630
link.

185
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:10.570
Then you tap on it and then it downloads the file for you since it downloads them as a zip file.

186
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:11.000
Right.

187
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:19.610
And you, if you have an illustrator software, if you have illustrator, you open it in Illustrator.

188
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:25.370
If you don't have a tool, then I guess you just have to use a substitute icon for this course.

189
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.290
You can get that from on draw.

190
00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:39.850
So I joy gives you illustrations in PNG and as we form so depending on what you want, you download

191
00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:40.830
you choose the format.

192
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:48.460
But I always choose to go for S region because in the everyday format I can manipulate it or modify

193
00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.110
it to suit my.

194
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.610
My interests or what I want.

195
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.730
So that's that's it.

196
00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:02.900
So yeah, that's why for those who have Illustrator and can download it and open it in Adobe Illustrator.

197
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.260
And I'm going to.
