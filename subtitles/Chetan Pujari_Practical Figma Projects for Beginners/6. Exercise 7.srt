1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,060
Everyone, welcome to the continuation of our previous lesson.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:12,120
So our previous lesson we learned to create a contact information screen as you see here.

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,640
So today we'll be doing will be learning to create my contacts home.

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,700
So this screen is what we'll be doing today.

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:18,370
Okay.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:24,420
So that said, we would have to go to our Figma projects.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:24,700
Okay?

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:37,290
So remember we did this and then we have to just add a new screen so I can just go here to the frame,

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,580
click on frame.

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,910
And then since we use this, I'm just going to select this.

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,900
This is what we used.

12
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,600
Okay, so position it was just bring it down.

13
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:49,040
Okay?

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,700
So, okay, so now would have to, let's see what else to do now.

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,950
So how have to.

16
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,980
Those are the texts and then this profile or avatar.

17
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,040
Okay, so let's start with this.

18
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,830
So that's it.

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,580
I'm just going to have to copy this.

20
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,020
Control C, control V, and then I'll move it here.

21
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,890
And see if is the same.

22
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:38,700
Okay.

23
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,160
So I'm going to have to reduce this question to my home.

24
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,320
In my home.

25
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,640
So sorry.

26
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,690
My contacts.

27
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,860
So my contacts change it to my contacts.

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,420
Contacts.

29
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,050
Okay.

30
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,760
Then I'm going to give it to size of, let's say 24.

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,390
So 24, 64 is okay.

32
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,670
This was 36,

33
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,590
this was 24, 34.

34
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,680
Okay, so let's just do it 36.

35
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,500
So just do it just 36.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,220
So.

37
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,040
So let me see the distance.

38
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,500
2438 So.

39
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,620
Hold on, hold on.

40
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,000
Let me see.

41
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:51,260
So there's 26, so I'm going to make it with the arrow key left arrow.

42
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,370
I'm going to shift it to 24 and then it's already 38 at the top.

43
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,060
Okay.

44
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,760
And now we'd have to do that.

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,440
So the proof.

46
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,500
So the profile is, I think 40 by 40 or 40 by 40.

47
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:17,570
So I can just control see this courtesy control V and bring it here can change the size to 40, 40 by

48
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,110
40.

49
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,740
Then just try to align it here.

50
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,880
There's a distance.

51
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,750
So here's 35.

52
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,080
Okay.

53
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,110
Sow oats, sow 40.

54
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,800
Ready change to sow as 40.

55
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,450
So we do, right?

56
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:43,830
Okay.

57
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,740
I'm going to move it to a discourse.

58
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:56,770
And then we'll do that off the switch.

59
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,750
Okay.

60
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,090
Research by how to use the rectangle tool.

61
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,810
Then I'm going to draw here.

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,610
And then I'll give it a radius of let me see what radius was used.

63
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,660
So the radius should be 12 pixels.

64
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:22,920
Okay.

65
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,960
So 12.

66
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,810
So I'll go.

67
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,100
So sorry for that.

68
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,760
I'll have to change the radius to 12.

69
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,800
It's for, so it's not.

70
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,340
Okay, so let's see.

71
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,190
Let's check the heights first.

72
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:46,030
So the height is 40, which is 43 to 7.

73
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,070
So 44.

74
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,880
The heights.

75
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:58,480
And then here 3 to 3 to this.

76
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:04,970
327.

77
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,190
Okay.

78
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,150
So that's right.

79
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,740
Just try to center it and then the color is white.

80
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,750
So I'm going to give it a white color background.

81
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,360
Let's see.

82
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,880
And then if you look closely, you see that it has a drop shadow.

83
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,860
Okay, so a drop shadow.

84
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,900
So would go to.

85
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,070
Let's just see how.

86
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,680
So a trough shadow.

87
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:47,370
So when our if effects panel or effects section, I'm going to click here.

88
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,420
The Drop Shadow is already selected, so I'll click on this then.

89
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,330
OSU up is.

90
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,750
And to play.

91
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,830
It means it's five.

92
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,050
Leno sets my way to zero.

93
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:12,830
Okay.

94
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:24,720
So I'm going to increase the play or let's increase the spread a bit, so let's do it.

95
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,070
So what I did was I changed my way to.

96
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:38,920
To so that we have this shadow most beneath.

97
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,730
Okay.

98
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,650
And then my blade was set to 12.

99
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:48,640
Now, if you study carefully, you'll notice that the distance here is 23.

100
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:54,280
So I can so stretch it.

101
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,210
Woman and.

102
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,490
So let me just just hold and then I'm going to use the left key to move it.

103
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,100
So I get 23.

104
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,730
Okay.

105
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,190
And then the distance.

106
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,440
So I'm going to have to stretch this.

107
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,600
Then let me hold outs and then check to 26.

108
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,040
Okay.

109
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,710
Jesus is okay because here.

110
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,460
I simply.

111
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,780
Thank you, sir, for that.

112
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,400
So here k click here and check is 25.

113
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:56,620
So we just leave it to my s 26 and is 23.

114
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,500
So leave it this way.

115
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,870
Now what we can do is take this.

116
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,490
So now we'd have to do that on the search icon.

117
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,680
So the search icon, I'm just going to have to select this.

118
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:24,500
Remember, we pick this on the previous lesson and then I'm going to give it a shot, a color value

119
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:31,430
of click on the fill property and I'll give it this grey color.

120
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,660
See this size 81 by 21.

121
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:46,240
So I can just change it here 21 by 21.

122
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,610
Okay.

123
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,920
Then I'm going to move it inside.

124
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:52,610
Yeah.

125
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,810
So it's.

126
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,430
Okay.

127
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,500
So the distance is.

128
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,190
It's easy for so.

129
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,440
It's a movie that gets 24.

130
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,490
Okay.

131
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,560
And then we'll have to type the hints.

132
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,040
So the hint is search by name or number, search by name or number.

133
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,490
We just have to select this.

134
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:35,490
They control C and then paste it inside control V, we will happen.

135
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:40,890
Okay.

136
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:49,950
Now I'm going to change it to search by name or contacts.

137
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:59,050
Search by name or phone number or number.

138
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,510
Search by number.

139
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,790
I'm going to move it here.

140
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,080
And then it seems to be centered.

141
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,760
And then let me check.

142
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:24,730
Okay.

143
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,570
So 15.

144
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,640
So the distance is 15.

145
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:29,980
So 15.

146
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,530
So let's do that.

147
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,340
Okay.

148
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,780
So it helps you.

149
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,310
I'm going to say 215.

150
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,710
15.

151
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,030
Okay, so we are done with this.

152
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,960
Then let's preview it and see.

153
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,270
So now we change here to contacts, as in my.

154
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,730
My contacts home.

155
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,470
So let's just do it at home.

156
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,500
So.

157
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,230
Then you can preview it now.

158
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,030
Okay.

159
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:05,580
Okay.

160
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,990
So there's the preview for the first screen and then the preview for the second screen.

161
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,890
So thank you.

162
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,420
See in the next lesson.
