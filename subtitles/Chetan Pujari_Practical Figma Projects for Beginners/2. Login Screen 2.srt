00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,020
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:09,420
Welcome to this UI UX crash course with anybody can develop is to continue from where we left off yesterday.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,740
So.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,430
We are going to do now is you are going to create.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,430
The.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,010
Input box down here.

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:32,240
So you get your to and then as usual, you're in good shape.

8
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,800
So for me, around the corner, it's a bit.

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,380
Maybe the key to that is not to obvious and change

10
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:55,820
the color.

11
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,260
You can't do the modification to your creativity as usual.

12
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,060
Feel free to explore.

13
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,890
Great finish.

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,390
You duplicate your shape to get another increase.

15
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,290
All right, so now we have two input boxes created.

16
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,170
Next, we are going to write the text you see here inside.

17
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,480
You see John Stevens, that's email dot, right?

18
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:45,960
Right.

19
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:46,750
Yes.

20
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:47,830
Yes.

21
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,930
You see this that thing?

22
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,710
Yes.

23
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:58,550
We are going to agree that we all know how to put a tax lien on.

24
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,200
Okay.

25
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,010
Okay.

26
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,780
So you don't necessarily need to type what I'm typing.

27
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,340
Anything you want to.

28
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,000
This.

29
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,910
I wasn't being hard to get a password.

30
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,570
Text is.

31
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,220
Yes.

32
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,660
That's that's that's that's that.

33
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,460
That's the

34
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:59,140
bad stuff that's done away from is you can't modify it or do it big enough for you to see.

35
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:06,570
Right.

36
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:21,860
Okay.

37
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:29,870
So now as we can see, there's an eye and I always see eye to eye.

38
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:30,400
Yes.

39
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:39,050
So we are going to be going back again to pick a similar icon and put it in a password box.

40
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,290
Okay, good.

41
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:40,610
Okay.

42
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,260
Good to go.

43
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,380
Yes.

44
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:45,860
Okay.

45
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,670
I just Google the symbol.

46
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,070
See if I'll find something similar.

47
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,930
Yes, I did.

48
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:03,800
Using the old method, I'll drag the icon to the input box.

49
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,110
So.

50
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:22,290
Okay, so next I forget password downtime.

51
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,250
So I already have a text with a similar callout.

52
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,220
These kids are particular artists and change.

53
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,410
That's the date for going past with.

54
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,540
Let's listen.

55
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,500
Reduce it.

56
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,030
Really?

57
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,140
The next thing is to modify the budget so we can get something similar to what we have here.

58
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:22,350
Now, looking back, I start by reducing my text points.

59
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,310
Yes.

60
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:23,970
Yes.

61
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,420
If you putting your buttons from the past, will you select the select

62
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,840
on the text for this one selected?

63
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:47,260
If you look your text in the I'm if you put your button in that material as I was saying earlier, for

64
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:55,510
you to be able to click or select a single item out of the group, you need to double click on whichever

65
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,150
item it is that you want to select.

66
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,820
So for right now, it's the text that you want to select.

67
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:08,530
You either press and hold command or control based on the platform you are using and click on whatever

68
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,610
you want to select in your group.

69
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,190
Or you can just double click or whatever I want to select.

70
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:22,420
And then it becomes individually selected, modified to use your preference.

71
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
So now I'm changing.

72
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,940
Log in.

73
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,080
Yes.

74
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,500
The next is to select and modify my rectangle.

75
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,910
Make it a bit longer.

76
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,120
Okay.

77
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:34,710
So.

78
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,600
Okay.

79
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,270
Okay.

80
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:53,580
So our final thing is to change the text below the button instead of already having an account.

81
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,920
We just have to change it already having accounts.

82
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:01,470
Again, we just have to change it to don't have an account register.

83
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,450
So do that.

84
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,320
Let's.

85
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,040
We want.

86
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:08,940
Okay.

87
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,310
Firms having accounts.

88
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,070
Okay.

89
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,250
So if you've done this, congratulations.

90
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,500
You finish getting the login screen.

91
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,210
So.

92
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,490
All right.

93
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:39,470
So now what I'm going to do right, is to.

94
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,530
Connect us.

95
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:51,490
Now, what are going to do is we are going to connect frames for ads so that when we click on a button

96
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:57,580
or because that you got some way we get a response words or we are able to move from the first screen

97
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,090
to the second screen by the trigger.

98
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,210
The trigger could be a button or time.

99
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:05,830
Okay.

100
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,920
So, I mean, let's let's do the prototype.

101
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,470
Nice, nice.

102
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,150
You can let's continue.

103
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,220
Okay.

104
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,350
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to type our design.

105
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,380
So we click on prototype

106
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,740
with the type on your left.

107
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,920
I'm sorry.

108
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,670
Right.

109
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,550
You're right here, extreme right where the design is.

110
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,250
So we have design, prototype, inspect.

111
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,860
So you just tap on prototype and then it moves you to the prototype section.

112
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:42,880
Okay.

113
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:50,320
So now what we want to prototype here is our button, our get started button.

114
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:58,630
So what I'm going to do is hopefully everyone your buttons, everyone Google buttons, move your button.

115
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,180
The typing becomes a little bit challenging.

116
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:07,140
So we tap on the I tap on button.

117
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,070
There are two ways you can prototype your this one.

118
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,000
The shot method moved out along with the launch method.

119
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,680
After I've selected my button, I click on Welcome to Prototype.

120
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,760
You see Interactions and Interactions is a plus icon.

121
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,900
When I click on the plus icon, I create an interaction.

122
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:39,580
I tap on the action to modify the options, suits, my needs or my preference or my goal.

123
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,240
That's I want to achieve that particular instance.

124
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,650
So with this, I want to achieve a tap trigger.

125
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,920
And when I tap on to, to navigate to another page, to isolate, navigate to from the options here,

126
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,260
and then I choose the page I want to navigate to which the login screen.

127
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:05,740
This is one method you can use to prototype your screens.

128
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:17,710
Now another method is I just when I select the elements, I want to add an additional design prototype

129
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:24,100
to you see around this one here at the end the selection thing.

130
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:32,740
So you just when you write your like this becomes a plus so you can just click and drag to your destination

131
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,490
page.

132
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:40,430
This time when I click on it, I want you to go to my log in so I just drag that thing to my login site

133
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,240
or page.

134
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:51,440
You realize that once you drag the interactions and preference options or the two options open up opens

135
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:51,650
up.

136
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:56,120
So yeah, you already done the basic thing, what you have to do.

137
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,400
You can choose to add this one.

138
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,150
An animation to its not.

139
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,450
This time, what am I going to do?

140
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,740
Let me do a sliding animation.

141
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,220
Let me start with a short animated.

142
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,520
So they shot one, right?

143
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,650
You select your targets that you want to.

144
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,780
The prototype in this case.

145
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:26,870
I want to I want my page to move to log in when I click on Get Start.

146
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,690
So I select the stated button.

147
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,560
You can see that when you select that, there's a round thing at the edge of the selection thing.

148
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,000
So you just drag.

149
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:45,830
Tough on the wrong thing in your destination where you want the page to transition to when you click

150
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,910
on to get started.

151
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,280
So I just go.

152
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,150
So in this case, you want to.

153
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,440
Prototype our vaccine.

154
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,160
So what you are going to do is select the button.

155
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,250
But next, you're going to bust and I want you to move to my login page.

156
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:11,680
And you love it?

157
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,330
Yes.

158
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,350
I want you to smile.

159
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,410
So what I will do is.

160
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:21,770
Okay.

161
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,390
So they selected you click on this one.

162
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,470
The second thing was you selected a button.

163
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,790
Drag it to your destination page right where you want the.

164
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,000
Where you want to move to when you click on the button.

165
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,590
In this case is my login page.

166
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,790
So I go to the login page and then you see the interaction details.

167
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,580
You can do some small modification here.

168
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,580
You want an animation, you can choose them.

169
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,850
So let's move and move out, push sliding side out.

170
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:59,690
That is all this much animates instance, instance, basically adding any sort of animation to it.

171
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,040
So it just moves in an instance without it necessarily animating.

172
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,840
So in my case, I select this sliding.

173
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:12,020
So that's, you see, it's when it's transitioning.

174
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,000
That's it for our animation here.

175
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,370
Okay, so now that we are done, I'll go back to the design tab.

176
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:28,950
Tap on the first frame we created, which is the start screen, and then hit the play icon.

177
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,050
Now it brings me to my previous site.

178
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:39,540
The Pew site is where you see your animation in action or your people taking action.

179
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:45,090
So I am here now because I connected my buttons to the next page.

180
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,870
When I click on Get Started, you realize that it moves to the next page or the next slide.

181
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,240
So.

182
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,650
I deleted my original work now.

183
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,640
So with the prototype in, you can't do that.

184
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:08,020
Two methods you can use to create your prototype.

185
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:15,120
The first one is you select your targets, the trigger objects.

186
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,360
In this case, trigger objects is a button.

187
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:19,890
Right.

188
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:23,190
So as you can see, my button is selected.

189
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:30,590
And then under the prototype layer you get, you see interactions beside interactions.

190
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,590
The plus icon.

191
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,200
When you click on the the plus icon, it adds an interaction.

192
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,980
But then you have to do the configuration yourself.

193
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:51,560
You tap on the other interaction and then you open the interaction details, dialog box or let you see

194
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,600
your trigger options the kind you want.

195
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,460
I think to me, too.

196
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,710
And we talk to we maintain our own top.

197
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,240
And then.

198
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:08,950
The next one is what you wanted to do once you tap your button.

199
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,550
I want you to navigate to another page.

200
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:18,190
So what I do is I select from my menu or my options navigate to okay.

201
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:24,880
So now selected I wanted to navigate to where do I want it to navigate to or what's what's free or as

202
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,560
both do I want it to navigate through.

203
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,930
Since we have one extra adverb here, we only have one.

204
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:38,140
If you had a number of outputs, you would have seen those here as well.

205
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,560
So in this case, you select the login screen.

206
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:49,000
This is one way you can use to create your prototype just so you get this.

207
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:52,990
Hello, Joseph.

208
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,210
I've done this, though.

209
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,170
You've done this.

210
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,530
Okay, so that's one method to prototype.

211
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,790
The next one is very simple.

212
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,950
When you select your target.

213
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,030
Sugar.

214
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,330
You see around something, they click and drag you to your next stream.

215
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:27,770
So you want to go back to your this one, your set, your start screen.

216
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:35,670
You can actually decide to tap on, get started.

217
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,500
It moves to the login screen.

218
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:44,330
You can use your arrow keys or your keyboard to go back to your previous screen.

219
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:52,730
Or if you want to animate or do that to go back, you can choose to put a back.

220
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,970
That's an icon here doing that.

221
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:03,690
When you press it, you can't go back, then you animate it or you add a transition to it.

222
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,500
So for example, let me add this.

223
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,190
I'm just drawing a line to show what I mean.

224
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,480
Make it bigger.

225
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:17,580
Oh, so you mean the line is my arrow icon?

226
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:22,080
I go to the type, then I move it here.

227
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:22,980
Right.

228
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,090
You see what I just did?

229
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,590
Yeah.

230
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,380
Yes.

231
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,380
So now when I come here, I click on to get started and I want to go back.

232
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,670
I just click on this.

233
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,230
Okay.

234
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,270
Let me make it bigger.

235
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,130
So.

236
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:44,770
Excuse me.

237
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,390
I know.

238
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,540
Still.

239
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:47,990
Okay.

240
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:53,000
So when I click on this, you see that it takes me back to the start screen.

241
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:00,680
So that's what we can do is if you just want to navigate through your pages on there, design can use

242
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,450
the arrow keys or your keyboard.

243
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,920
Thank you very much.
