00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.140
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:09.000
So now we are going to do is I'm going to add an overlay to the image behind, right?

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.960
So select the image and then back to Phil.

4
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.800
Right.

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.850
This time I'm not going to click on the small square box beside the image text.

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.840
This time you are going to click on the plus icon.

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.640
Are they extreme rights or they feel section?

8
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.670
I feel section.

9
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.080
We click on the plus icon see way.

10
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.160
Okay, good.

11
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:46.650
So when I click on the plus icon, you realize that it adds another layer to it on top of the image.

12
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.360
The image.

13
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.320
The image.

14
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.280
Can see that.

15
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.050
Yes.

16
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.820
Yeah.

17
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.020
Good enough.

18
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.310
U.S. you can see the extra layer.

19
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.490
And then when you look at the picture, you can see that it has changed.

20
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.750
Okay.

21
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.980
So here what we are trying to do is not to add a linear overlay.

22
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.990
We want to add a solid overlay.

23
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.540
So on the new layer, we'll click on the rectangle.

24
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.800
The field rectangle beside this time is white, so we click on it.

25
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.730
And then when you look you look here where initially you saw solid.

26
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.090
They are linear, we don't want linear.

27
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.330
So we click on the dropdown, so we click on the dropdown and then we click on the solid.

28
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.160
But then if you notice, once we selected a solid, it seems like our image, the image at the back

29
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.210
is disappeared.

30
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.120
It's actually there.

31
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.130
It hasn't disappeared.

32
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.810
It's blended with the background.

33
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.200
That's why it seems like it's no day you get it.

34
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.800
So now what you are going to do is we are going to reduce the intensity of the whites, but we actually,

35
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.650
before we do that, the color we want.

36
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.340
The only color you want on an image is not white.

37
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.770
We want something pinkish reddish.

38
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.610
Right.

39
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.660
So.

40
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.580
The color created, the color I picked.

41
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.920
In the earlier discussion, the color which is the red.

42
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.950
If you look down here where you have documents, colors, everything, you can see that there are a

43
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.510
number of square boxes here and they are filled with different colors.

44
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.290
These are the colors that you've used in your projects.

45
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.530
I pick the red and my red is showing here, so I'll just select the red.

46
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.880
When I click on the red, you notice that the shape appears.

47
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.170
Because now I see it.

48
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.880
Okay.

49
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.190
All right.

50
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.640
So.

51
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.100
Yep, yep, yep.

52
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.400
So now we are going to do it.

53
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.260
I'm going to increase the intensity of the color so that we can view our image.

54
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.140
Do it.

55
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.940
So we see that there are two bars here, right?

56
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.150
There's the the color bar.

57
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.370
That's a huge bar.

58
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:08.170
Yeah.

59
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.980
And then there's the intensity bar.

60
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.920
Beneath that, you have the color code or the intensity percentage.

61
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.060
You can reduce the intensity by either entering a number.

62
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.960
Are they intensity percentage sites or you can just.

63
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.260
A edits that by hit by dragging the secular thing.

64
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.620
Can you see it?

65
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.310
I see what I'm doing.

66
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.780
Yeah.

67
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:40.290
Okay.

68
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.770
All right.

69
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.250
All right.

70
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.260
So to achieve.

71
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.260
Can I just run my resort?

72
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.700
It looks like the oval is like that.

73
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.020
I might buy anything.

74
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.210
We'll do it like that.

75
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.710
I guess so.

76
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:06.170
Yes, I'm going to use a red value of 50 50% with an intensity of 50%.

77
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.070
All right.

78
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.690
Moving on.

79
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.570
Yes, we are coming to beat this.

80
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.360
Well, since you've already going through the process of pitching this, I'm sure it won't be hard to

81
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.170
beat this.

82
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.710
You can't beat it without me diving, right?

83
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.720
Yeah, that was two guys doing it.

84
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.060
So it's just this rash, too.

85
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.400
So I tap on my rectangle shape, too.

86
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.750
And then.

87
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.800
Draw a meaning small rectangle up here.

88
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.060
I mean, that's the width to 15 and then.

89
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.380
There had to 40.

90
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.890
50 and then.

91
00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:02.830
Well, here, I'm going to enter the reduced value instead of using the circular theme.

92
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:09.400
So let me put think 2010.

93
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.510
So tonight.

94
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.580
Do we have this?

95
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:23.900
With the duplication, the duplication technique we used earlier, I'm going to duplicate the shape

96
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.260
so that we don't have to recreate it from scratch.

97
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.930
So with a shape selected, you press and hold command.

98
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:37.790
Then Press D now is duplicated, but we can't see duplicated because I've not moved the copy away from

99
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:38.450
the original.

100
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.620
So when I move it now you see that it's copied.

101
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:44.930
I've created a copy of it.

102
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.460
So now we have something similar towards this day.

103
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:54.240
Okay.

104
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.760
So now what you are going to do is you are going to group this, these two shapes, right?

105
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.750
So.

106
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.570
People are going to do multiple selection.

107
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.040
So press and hold shifts on the keyboard right.

108
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.080
Then tap on the first object or shape once you select.

109
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.980
With the shirts still pressed down or held down, we tap on the select the second shape we want to select

110
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:25.140
from.

111
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.150
You see that both shapes are selected.

112
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.780
The two small things that are selected.

113
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.190
So.

114
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:47.420
So that you selected I right click on one of them and then from the dropdown menu I select good selection.

115
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:59.430
To do multiple selection, you have to press and hold shifts on the keyboard and then be tap and tap

116
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.040
in the various objects you want to select.

117
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.560
So in this case, I'm selecting the two pure like shapes.

118
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:13.500
So I press and hold shift on my keyboard, and then I select the first shape which shifts though held

119
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.040
down.

120
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:20.910
I click on the second shape which allows me to select the two you that.

121
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:23.780
Can we see that now?

122
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.690
My two ships have been selected.

123
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:34.830
Command gene or control gene is the shortcut for grouping them and then by can also right click and

124
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.930
then select group selection.

125
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.040
To give them.

126
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.640
So now my my objects have been grouped.

127
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:48.580
The reason why I grouped them is to make it easier on me when I'm moving them so that I don't have to

128
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.230
move one.

129
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.760
And then later, come and move on.

130
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:52.930
Do you get it?

131
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:54.540
Yes.

132
00:07:54.670 --> 00:08:00.360
So now, as you can see, these two pillars are not centered on the frame.

133
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.520
So I'm going to move it around to center it.

134
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:09.280
When I move it to the middle, you see that there's a red guideline showing me that it's directly in

135
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:09.940
the middle.

136
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.650
So once since I'm.

137
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.690
I've confirmed this in the middle of.

138
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.130
I just leave it here.

139
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.440
This is one way of arranging or aligning or things or centering your things.

140
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:27.310
You can see the alignment section here.

141
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.960
That's the first section of the design panel.

142
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:31.940
Yes.

143
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.720
So with my grouped items, I just.

144
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.720
Click on the.

145
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.940
There's a line horizontal centered.

146
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.200
Into the dry.

147
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.790
So moving on.

148
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:55.980
So now we have apples.

149
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.090
And image.

150
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.640
The first image and the image at the background.

151
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.050
The next thing we are going to do is great.

152
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.970
So the next thing we do is create the text, right?

153
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.660
So we see translate and then.

154
00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:14.500
That's the office.

155
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.720
That's the title take.

156
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:23.530
So you go to the text to you click on the text or use the shortcut on the keyboard.

157
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.410
Just press t on the keyboard.

158
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:39.910
So you just press you use the shortcuts on the keyboard or you move to select the test to on to menu.

159
00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.090
So in my case, I selected it for you to see.

160
00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:50.150
Then you click anywhere in your frame and you start typing.

161
00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:54.970
So I'll translate and link to type translate.

162
00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.030
And then

163
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.250
as you can see, my text is too small.

164
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.220
I don't like my phone, so I come here.

165
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:07.760
All right.

166
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.660
Inside we see the properties of the text, right?

167
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:16.030
So on the design panel and that it takes section.

168
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.900
The first thing under the tech section is the fonts.

169
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.360
So I changed my phone.

170
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:29.150
So I'm changing my I don't know if so you change the font to whatever font you like.

171
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:34.550
I'm changing it to wear away because unattractive fonts for me.

172
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.730
Then I increase my font size.

173
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:40.010
Let me do it.

174
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.320
That's quite big.

175
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.920
Okay, so let me know that is okay.

176
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.470
I see that it's not thick enough.

177
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.800
The designers are copying the title seems to be bold.

178
00:10:51.980 --> 00:11:00.770
So I convert the this one to both the text to both from the font styles.

179
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.330
Are we following?

180
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.170
Do we get it?

181
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:09.500
Property under the text section is the font.

182
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:11.030
Type.

183
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:12.830
Can you see that?

184
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.660
Yeah, in my case, my phone, my current phone is groovy.

185
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.770
So what you see there is real way.

186
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.560
Maybe yours go to a lot.

187
00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.130
So that's what I'm going to see.

188
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.000
Can you see that?

189
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:23.990
Yeah.

190
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:24.860
Yeah.

191
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.970
So if you have a phone in mind, do you know the name of your phone?

192
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.190
You can just stop.

193
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.790
Sorry.

194
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.020
You can just stop.

195
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.440
In the inputs box and type the font name.

196
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.860
If you don't you want to explore for you.

197
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.970
See, there's a dropdown icon beside the input box.

198
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.860
Yeah, I see that.

199
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.740
Yes.

200
00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:48.120
Yeah.

201
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:52.760
So you can just drop down and then experiment with the various forms that are here.

202
00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:53.470
All right.

203
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:53.720
All right.

204
00:11:54.230 --> 00:12:00.890
So now what we are going to do is our next task is to create the text that is underneath.

205
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:01.760
Right.

206
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.730
In this case, you are not going to

207
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:13.590
find the text to again, I'm just going to duplicate the text I've already created, change the properties

208
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:17.510
and then type whatever I need to type.

209
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.380
But we already know how to duplicate.

210
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:25.690
So I tap on a command, they move down, then I change the properties.

211
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:33.190
So I think I'll change it to 18 font size to 18 and then medium or to maintain the font type.

212
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:37.810
All right.

213
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:48.100
So from here we can look to that the color of the body text and the title text is different.

214
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:48.970
Right?

215
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.740
So I'm going to find a color that is gray.

216
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:58.010
Okay.

217
00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:03.670
I'm sure by now we can all we all know how to change our colours.

218
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.130
The colours of our ships and texts.

219
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:08.980
Okay.

220
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.070
So, yeah.

221
00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:18.370
I guess, you know, I've changed the properties of my tech, so I'm just going to.

222
00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:23.160
I'm just going to type.

223
00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.800
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

224
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.500
I'm just like, This is good thing.

225
00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.270
You just type it for that and money.

226
00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.170
That was easy to end.

227
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:36.900
Money.

228
00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.180
Just use the.

229
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:48.100
Just lay up and collect money.

230
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.830
Collect the points.

231
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:56.700
I'm sure you all can see that my text is disappearing as I type, right?

232
00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:58.560
Yes.

233
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.090
So when you notice, as you are typing away, you notice that it's getting to the end of day like it's

234
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:04.020
entering or this one.

235
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:08.460
You just press enter for it to move to the next line.

236
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.090
To continue.

237
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:19.830
Or another thing you can do is you can type if you feel like, okay, you can continue typing letter

238
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:26.140
past the border and then when you finish you come here to the text property, right?

239
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:31.850
The website, you enter a way for it, right?

240
00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:32.630
The body takes.

241
00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:40.030
So what you do is you can choose to select your text to start typing from scratch the way you finish

242
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.100
or modify the properties.

243
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.730
Or you can just duplicates.

244
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:52.780
So you kind of choose to do it from scratch or select the translate and learn and then duplicated and

245
00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:57.160
change the properties of the new copy in the text layer.

246
00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:58.970
So another way to duplicate.

247
00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:03.430
Okay, you see where your rectangle is on the left?

248
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.550
The Layers panel that's on the left.

249
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:10.270
I think you can right click and then it will give you an option.

250
00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:14.560
Try and see right click and see who could duplicate this.

251
00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.560
No, no, no.

252
00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:18.940
We have rectangle one.

253
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:19.990
Rectangle two.

254
00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.040
Yeah.

255
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:23.980
Is there duplicates?

256
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:25.940
Excuse?

257
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:30.790
No, I think we have copy and paste.

258
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:31.390
Yes.

259
00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:32.920
Do we?

260
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.000
It is copy paste.

261
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.700
I saw that the last menu is.

262
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:41.770
Yes.

263
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.480
But I think this one is stress.

264
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.290
This is stress.

265
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.440
Better to just do that from day one.

266
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:48.340
Yeah.

267
00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:53.590
So, guys, just one where you can duplicate your objects or your layers.

268
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.410
All right, all right, all right, all right.

269
00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:57.970
Moving on.

270
00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:59.220
Moving on, moving on.

271
00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:00.430
Moving on, moving on.

272
00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:05.260
We can see this small loading thing here, right?

273
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.860
The next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create this small loading things.

274
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:14.740
Now I'm going to use the application to create it.

275
00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.660
I'm not going to create it from scratch.

276
00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:23.950
So this bill that I've created, right, I'm going to duplicate one of them, pull them out of the group.

277
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.540
You remember that?

278
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.380
I grabbed him.

279
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.340
And then change the property to suit what we see here.

280
00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.400
So with my target selected.

281
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.460
Command is duplicated now.

282
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:39.300
Right.

283
00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:42.960
I'm moving it.

284
00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:49.020
When you look at the Layers panel coming in my screen.

285
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:50.710
Yeah.

286
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.820
You can see that the copy I did is in a group.

287
00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:58.900
Is a group of their peers.

288
00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:59.460
Yes.

289
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:05.250
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to drag this out of the group.

290
00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:07.090
Okay.

291
00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.580
So for those who didn't see them, do it again.

292
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:17.930
The agenda is currently or the ship that's currently selected is the copy I rights and I don't want

293
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:25.040
a copy to be part of the group because if I should move, that group is going to move this to and I

294
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.800
don't want that group to affect this copy.

295
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.370
Right?

296
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:30.380
That is my reason for moving it out of the group.

297
00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:39.800
I created it so I click and hold the copy in the layers panel, drag it and drag it out of the group.

298
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.100
So I put it above the group I've created.

299
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.690
The loading is smaller than the pill.

300
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:48.470
I put that up there.

301
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:54.620
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to reduce the the width and the height of the pill.

302
00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:55.640
So.

303
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.390
Yeah.

304
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.610
Okay.

305
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:10.560
So you can also I mean, you can also work on it as I'm working on it.

306
00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:21.820
So duplicate again reduce the the height.

307
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.070
So eliminating 30.

308
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:29.300
And make it five.

309
00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:35.720
Okay, let me leave it at eight.

310
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:37.820
Duplicate this.

311
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:43.040
Reduce the height to 25.

312
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:49.690
Or duplicate it again and reduce the height.

313
00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:52.300
I've tried.

314
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:52.600
Okay.

315
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:57.010
So now I have my three ships to represent my loading icon.

316
00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:58.650
Thank God.

317
00:18:58.690 --> 00:18:59.320
What's your big.

318
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.810
Okay.

319
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:13.400
So we can notice that in that picture, the first one is 100% intensity opacity and then the second

320
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.310
one has the second and the third ones are reduced.

321
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.850
Right.

322
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.800
So that's what I'm going to do.

323
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:24.440
Nothing you can do in Figma is you can change a number of.

324
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.540
Properties.

325
00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:33.270
Properties of multiple objects at once.

326
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.650
You get it.

327
00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:43.860
So in this case, I'm going to change this and this the color intensity of this and this at once.

328
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:50.940
So with the selection, the multiple selection method, I told you, use it to select the two.

329
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:56.520
There you come here where the color is, where the film is, you got you can either choose to press

330
00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:03.300
on this thing, go inside and then use the bar, or you can just directly into the color intensity value

331
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.410
here without you having to open that dialog box.

332
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:12.150
So in my case, I'm going to directly entity 40.

333
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:13.660
Yes.

334
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:19.740
So you can see that my color intensity for the years two has reduced.

335
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.460
Our next thing is.

336
00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:40.490
That's not the time.

337
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:44.920
I'm so confused that I'm losing my mind.

338
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.420
The Criminal Code.

339
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:49.940
Do this turn.

340
00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:04.950
I get it.

341
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:06.190
Time to work.

342
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:08.340
We'll finish this up tomorrow.

343
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.550
Yeah.

344
00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:12.120
We can see that.

345
00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.850
There's already there's.

346
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:14.970
It takes.

347
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:15.790
We need a button.

348
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:16.070
I see.

349
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.730
He's already have an account.

350
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.070
Log in if you notice.

351
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.900
You see that already.

352
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:27.660
The colour of the already have an account is different from the log in colour.

353
00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:28.070
Right.

354
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:28.350
So.

355
00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:35.090
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use to defend text here.

356
00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:40.670
So the first one I'm going to type, I already have an account.

357
00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:44.920
Mm hmm.

358
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:46.330
Yeah.

359
00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.520
It was a bit dark, so.

360
00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:55.150
I would change the colour and make it is not too black is a bit dark.

361
00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:59.200
It's darker than a gray color, so make it a bit darker.

362
00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:02.130
Okay.

363
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:03.530
I think this is okay.

364
00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.750
And then grids the second text layer.

365
00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:10.690
Again.

366
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.050
So then I can't change this color.

367
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:27.090
So I'll change this to red and change the font to make it a bit

368
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:30.450
darker.

369
00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:16.570
Okay.

370
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:26.350
So as you can see, the text finish, prototype it, that will make it the buttons clickable so that

371
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.260
when I click on one button it moves to.

372
00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:33.280
The next frame or the next speech.

373
00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:34.660
Yeah.

374
00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.890
Done with this screen.

375
00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:40.770
You can preview it by pressing the play icon at the top here.

376
00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:41.460
So.

377
00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:44.800
They.

378
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.570
It opens another tab for you.

379
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:48.270
Yes.

380
00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:55.960
So you click on a tab and then you see it gives you an idea of how to look on an actual mobile screen.

381
00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.260
That's why I see an iPhone.

382
00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:03.400
What I see now is iPhone 11 pro because the frame we chose was iPhone 11 pro.

383
00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:09.370
That's why in the preview you are seeing how it will look like in an iPhone 11 pro.

384
00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:11.340
Thank you very much.
