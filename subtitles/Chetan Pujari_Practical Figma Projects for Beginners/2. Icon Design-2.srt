1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,060
Okay.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,140
So moving on, our next icon is a color icon.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:17,220
Select a circle or sorry, the ellipse tool from the shapes to enjoy it in your frame.

4
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,130
Remove the fill and set the stroke to 0.5 pixels.

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,630
Now duplicate the circle using command or control dx on your keyboard.

6
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,700
Then reduce the size of the copy.

7
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:43,730
Once you're done reducing the size, duplicate the copy using command or control.

8
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,950
Again, select one of the small circles and the main circle.

9
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:55,130
Then click the top align button to position the small circle at the top of the bigger circle.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,140
Select the other small circle and the bigger circles and click on the right align button at the top

11
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:09,110
here to position the small circle at the right side of the big circle.

12
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:17,630
So when all is said and done, select all three circles and rotate it by 45 degrees to the left side

13
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,470
or to the left.

14
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:30,860
Now select the triangle from the shapes to and draw a triangle in the center.

15
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:40,000
Move the mouse here and increase the value of the number of sides of the triangle to five.

16
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,110
So now it becomes a Pentagon.

17
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,370
Okay.

18
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,640
Now select the big circle and fill it.

19
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,750
Once you're done with that, change the color, then move the stroke around.

20
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:59,770
Click this point or dots and drag it in the clockwise direction.

21
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,630
So you get what I have here.

22
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,930
Select the circle and fill it.

23
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,080
Once again, remove the stroke around it.

24
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,760
Repeat the same action to the other small circle.

25
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:20,770
Once you're done with that, click on the shape created with a bigger circle and select the dot here,

26
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:28,060
then drag it backwards, flatten the Pentagon, then adjust it a bit.

27
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,430
Make sure that everything is going around.

28
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:41,270
Select the brown shape and the two small circles and click the union selection in the volume menu.

29
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:48,590
Select the polygon and the shape that was just created and select subtract from the Boolean menu once

30
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,100
again.

31
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:58,850
Flatten the shape to convert it into a vector, double click or press enter on your keyboard to enter

32
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,800
the vector mode of the shape.

33
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,120
Once you're done with that, select the dots in the center and carve the corners a bit.

34
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,690
Then select that.

35
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,240
Then select the dots at the edges.

36
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,010
The four dots.

37
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,400
Yeah.

38
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:22,500
And then curve that a bit to now change the color to let's say curve.

39
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,390
I meant round them.

40
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,910
So now change the color to black.

41
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,280
Once you're done, you created and then we're done with our color icon.

42
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,690
So we're almost at the end of our video.

43
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,710
I lost them.

44
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,250
Find out.

45
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,710
Icon as the telephone.

46
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,650
Okay, so first we'll duplicate the collar and bring it here.

47
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,020
Because, you know, we need that.

48
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:59,030
Grab a rectangle and draw a rectangle in the frame.

49
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,980
Enter the vector mode.

50
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:13,070
By either pressing and telling your keyboard or double clicking on the shape and then create the point

51
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,540
at the side like I'm doing now.

52
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,460
Select the points at the top corner and move it here.

53
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,540
Okay.

54
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,320
Good job.

55
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,530
Do the same thing for the other side.

56
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,760
Select these two points and round their corners.

57
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,010
The leg.

58
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:38,750
The point we created as a side and round the point as well.

59
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,060
I'll make some slight changes to the shape we have here before we move on.

60
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,510
I sat down with that.

61
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:07,810
The legs, a rectangle from the sheet and draw this box around the corners of the bar as well and then

62
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,920
duplicated.

63
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,300
Change the color.

64
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,790
Select the Ellipse to enjoy a circle in the center of the phone.

65
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,970
Now create a stroke around the circle and change the color of the stroke to whites.

66
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,690
I just the size of the circle a bit.

67
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,980
I remove the peel.

68
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:49,780
The leg, both the seco and the telephone shape, and click on the subtract and the boolean menu to

69
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,620
create a hole in the center of the shape.

70
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:59,530
Finally, select both the collar and the body to flatten it.

71
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,000
Once you have that down, we are good to go.

72
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:09,580
I hope you enjoyed this video and it was informative enough.

73
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,310
Thank you for watching and see you next time.
