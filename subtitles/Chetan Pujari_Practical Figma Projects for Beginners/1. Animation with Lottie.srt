1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,630
The future designer's work comes in a teacher's ABCD.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,820
So today I'm going to take it to Lucy.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:06,130
Okay.

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,000
Just some simple animations they can add to your projects.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,670
So we're doing something on Lucy.

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,530
So this is Lucy.

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,160
And then Lucy when you visit the link.

8
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,920
Lucy for you to see what you can do.

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,830
So lots of animation that you can add into your figma projects.

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,750
So that's it.

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:25,950
Just go to this.

12
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,530
What I'm just trying to show you today is going to be a brief one.

13
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,230
Okay, so I'm just going to add my frame to frame.

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,840
Okay then.

15
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,850
First of all, you need to right click and go to plugins.

16
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,330
Okay.

17
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,560
So I already have the plugin installed.

18
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:51,320
So if you don't have it, you just have to go to browse plug ins and community and then you would have

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,270
to come to plug ins.

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,300
Okay.

21
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,980
And then the search for Lucy.

22
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:00,730
Okay.

23
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,050
So when?

24
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,480
Except for Lucy come to plug in, see again.

25
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,560
Then you'd install Lucy.

26
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,960
I already have it installed.

27
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,530
When?

28
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,730
After installing.

29
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:10,780
Okay.

30
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,540
You got your project.

31
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,300
Are you right?

32
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:13,530
Click.

33
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,430
You should have it's listed.

34
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,290
So I'm going to select Lucy.

35
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,120
And then I can just.

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,290
You'd have to log in.

37
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,380
You have to create an account before you're able to use it.

38
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,960
So click here then, or search for space.

39
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,370
It is a space image of wounds.

40
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,430
Then I'm going to click on Convert to give the converted or click to Sigma.

41
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:46,570
So once they are that, you just use a skill to to scale it so that it's resizes so to the desired screen

42
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,760
the size of the screen once.

43
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,330
And then when you click on the play button, you should have this.

44
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,960
That should be it for beautiful speech.

45
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,020
Thank you.
