00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.770
Now we make sure that our component is well aligned with the rest of the text and then preview it.

2
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.730
So the result is a text changing.

3
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:17.220
Once you have done with that, we create a meta copy by selecting the text to an ancient text on our

4
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.960
main frame and then making the necessary adjustments to the text preferences or settings.

5
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.660
The next thing we're going to do after creating the meta copy is to create the call to action.

6
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.500
So to do that, we just use our pattern components we created earlier.

7
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:09.290
So we just duplicate what we have up there and then bring it down here and change the shape slightly

8
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.170
to make it a bit bigger and more visible.

9
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.950
Once we are done with that adjustment, we preview it to see the work we've done so far.

10
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.900
Next thing we are going to do is create the illustration.

11
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.210
So we're going to import the illustration file into figma.

12
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:47.060
So you do that by going to your recents files and then drag and drop the fig file of your illustration

13
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.580
into your recents file.

14
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.140
Once you're done importing, you open it in your figma and then select the illustrations you copy.

15
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:05.060
The illustration will be using on the landing page and go to the landing page file and paste it.

16
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.170
There you copy by pressing command or control z on your keyboard and then you paste by pressing command

17
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.540
or control V on your keyboard.

18
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:22.370
After you've pasted it onto your main frame you're working on, you adjust it to the proper size.

19
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:30.300
Once we are done adjusting, it's the next step to do is to change the colors of our illustration.

20
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.650
Once we are done with our illustration, we do our final preview.

21
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.700
And as you can see, everything works as it should.

22
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.660
Our menu, the hover works, our dynamic text changes.

23
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.390
We've come to the end of our video.

24
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.180
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial.

25
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.900
If you have any questions, you can leave them and I'll answer them.

26
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.880
See you next time.

27
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.230
Bye.
