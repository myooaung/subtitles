Hello and welcome to this new tutorial.

2
00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.980
So we've just got the puzzle rewards obtained by playing the perturbations in positive directions.

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.850
And I went to get the negative rewards.

4
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.570
That is the words obtained by playing the perturbations in the opposite directions as the previous ones.

5
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.520
This once and so it's going to be so easy now because we've done this and we're going to get these rewards

6
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.520
with the same values of the perturbations that is the Delta scale here for each of the six indirections.

7
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.370
But the only thing that will change your mind is where it is is of course the direction which this time

8
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.750
will be negative.

9
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.440
That is opposite to the previous ones so that we will be in this condition else which corresponds to

10
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.910
Elif directional co-equals negative.

11
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.320
And therefore it will return the matrix of weights minus which represent the opposite direction the

12
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.710
noise times the perturbation but it is the same value here of the perturbation Delta scale.

13
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.650
And so that when we explore the policy on the full episode for each of the six indirections the action

14
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.890
here will be played by evaluating the policy on the current state.

15
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.680
The same value of the perturbation Delta that it was simpled but the opposite direction here because

16
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.340
we are going to specify that the direction is negative.

17
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.580
So the only thing that we have to do is just take these two lines.

18
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.920
All right.

19
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.630
So I just copy them I'm getting here everything has to be well aligned.

20
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.710
I'm facing that then it's the exact same for loop.

21
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:41.600
But instead of specifying the other direction Well we're going to specified the negative direction.

22
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.660
And here you go.

23
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.150
This is done to get negative rewards.

24
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:53.890
And of course we need to replace you positive by negative to update our list of negative rewards variable

25
00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.430
that contains all the rewards obtained by playing the perturbations in the opposite directions that

26
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.950
were applied here in the previous step.

27
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.130
All right so here we go we have our positive rewards now and our negative rewards.

28
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.590
And now what we're going to do is gather all of them.

29
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.180
All of these positive words and negative words in one same list.

30
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.130
So it will be a list of 32 words.

31
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.740
And why do we need to do this.

32
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.490
That's just to apply this 3.1 feature scaling by the standard deviation.

33
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.270
We want to scale the reward for Again performance purposes.

34
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.640
And so by scaling by standard deviation we will get Sigma R which is just one standard deviation of

35
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:47.800
the word and we'll integrate that factor here in the method definitive answers to our one step of Graylands

36
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.770
sent to update the policy.

37
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.290
So we'll do that in the next its oil.

38
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.700
It's going to be pretty easy.

39
00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.220
We'll just gather all the words in one simplest and then using the SDD function will compute the standard

40
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.420
deviation of all the awards composing that list.

41
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.270
Let's do that in the next as oil.

42
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.810
And until then enjoy AAE.
