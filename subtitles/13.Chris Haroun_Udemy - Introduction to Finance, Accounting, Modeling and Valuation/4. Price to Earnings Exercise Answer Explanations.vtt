00:00:00.420  -->  00:00:05.910
All right let's talk about the answers to the price to earnings valuation methodology exercise.

2

00:00:05.910  -->  00:00:08.830
Let me zoom in because my eyes are not like that anymore.

3

00:00:08.850  -->  00:00:11.590
The older I get the better I was.

4

00:00:11.910  -->  00:00:12.790
OK.

5

00:00:13.110  -->  00:00:16.310
Shift click finger off shift delete.

6

00:00:16.320  -->  00:00:17.020
Here we go.

7

00:00:17.370  -->  00:00:17.930
OK.

8

00:00:18.120  -->  00:00:21.820
So the growth year over year for ABS is 65 percent.

9

00:00:21.840  -->  00:00:22.140
Right.

10

00:00:22.140  -->  00:00:28.700
Is that growth over that and this is pulled directly off the income statement down there.

11

00:00:29.110  -->  00:00:29.900
All right.

12

00:00:30.340  -->  00:00:31.120
OK.

13

00:00:31.430  -->  00:00:36.610
Sixty five percent earnings growth and earnings growth slows to 54 percent earnings growth.

14

00:00:36.920  -->  00:00:37.540
Okay.

15

00:00:37.560  -->  00:00:47.970
So in terms of the price target for that year what you do is you double click and because we're at two

16

00:00:47.970  -->  00:00:52.010
times the earnings growth rate we're in a Polish market there.

17

00:00:52.020  -->  00:00:53.710
I don't like 2 times earnings.

18

00:00:53.760  -->  00:00:56.110
I prefer to pay closer when times earnings.

19

00:00:56.250  -->  00:00:59.370
We're in a bullish stock market environment everything is going up.

20

00:00:59.370  -->  00:01:01.220
Even the low quality high growth stuff.

21

00:01:01.410  -->  00:01:01.870
OK.

22

00:01:02.160  -->  00:01:07.430
So in this case what you do is the PC is going to be twice the growth rate.

23

00:01:07.530  -->  00:01:08.180
The growth rate.

24

00:01:08.170  -->  00:01:09.550
Sixty five percent.

25

00:01:09.660  -->  00:01:11.570
Right so that is very very high.

26

00:01:11.940  -->  00:01:13.190
So here's what you do.

27

00:01:13.230  -->  00:01:15.820
You take two times that red one there.

28

00:01:15.880  -->  00:01:16.570
OK.

29

00:01:16.710  -->  00:01:23.310
So that basically means a growth rate of sixty five percent times two is 130 times 100 percent in real

30

00:01:23.310  -->  00:01:24.080
numbers.

31

00:01:24.480  -->  00:01:27.170
And then you multiply by earnings per share that year.

32

00:01:27.210  -->  00:01:34.200
Now your target price and your market cap that year is just that times the number of shares at the bottom

33

00:01:34.220  -->  00:01:35.060
it comes in.

34

00:01:35.140  -->  00:01:36.740
And that's expensive.

35

00:01:36.960  -->  00:01:41.420
And by the same token do the same thing here except the growth rate is lower.

36

00:01:41.610  -->  00:01:49.190
So we're going to take it in 2020 and then we're going to multiply it by two times the growth rate.

37

00:01:49.200  -->  00:01:49.460
Right.

38

00:01:49.470  -->  00:01:55.820
So hundred eight or whatever it is and the market cap is just that times number shares.

39

00:01:56.340  -->  00:01:57.750
That's a bullish market.

40

00:01:57.960  -->  00:02:00.160
That's when everything is going up.

41

00:02:00.180  -->  00:02:01.980
I don't like buying stuff at two times earnings.

42

00:02:01.980  -->  00:02:06.720
I like to short stuff that's two times or more usually if the fundamentals catalysts and everything

43

00:02:06.720  -->  00:02:07.680
are all in alignment.

44

00:02:07.710  -->  00:02:14.490
Look at bearish what we do here is if the market's not doing well or if somebody is bearish on his company

45

00:02:14.490  -->  00:02:18.860
for whatever it's worth the price target can be 1 times earnings growth rate.

46

00:02:18.910  -->  00:02:19.700
Okay.

47

00:02:19.820  -->  00:02:26.100
And so in this case you've got growth of close 400 percent here called 9:9.

48

00:02:26.580  -->  00:02:36.330
And then what you do is you're going to take this one k times the growth rate basically right or 1 times

49

00:02:36.330  -->  00:02:41.160
growth rate and that's basically 100 percent growth so it's like a hundred times earnings so at higher

50

00:02:41.160  -->  00:02:46.630
prices both times I got this one here you got lower growth.

51

00:02:47.400  -->  00:02:53.190
So asking me about 90 times earnings can still kind of expensive but I don't mind paying up for growth

52

00:02:53.210  -->  00:02:53.250
.

53

00:02:53.260  -->  00:02:54.090
Okay.

54

00:02:54.600  -->  00:02:58.330
And then my favorite is to look at five years then discounted today.

55

00:02:58.350  -->  00:03:00.850
So this is the just right Goldilocks and three bears.

56

00:03:00.930  -->  00:03:02.090
This is in between.

57

00:03:02.220  -->  00:03:02.750
OK.

58

00:03:02.760  -->  00:03:07.750
One to a two Peg okay in shifts and graph shift backspace.

59

00:03:07.770  -->  00:03:08.390
There.

60

00:03:08.690  -->  00:03:09.000
OK.

61

00:03:09.020  -->  00:03:13.120
And here the price target is one and a half times a growth rate.

62

00:03:13.290  -->  00:03:15.030
So it's like under 50.

63

00:03:15.030  -->  00:03:16.540
So you take that.

64

00:03:16.640  -->  00:03:17.430
OK.

65

00:03:17.910  -->  00:03:20.740
Times one point five I should say.

66

00:03:21.240  -->  00:03:24.880
And then you just find the P similar what we did before.

67

00:03:25.050  -->  00:03:26.850
And then the same thing here our last one.

68

00:03:26.850  -->  00:03:32.080
It's one and a half times that growth rate times earnings.

69

00:03:32.490  -->  00:03:38.340
And that was that gets us to a target price of that one there and then it's discount by four or five

70

00:03:38.340  -->  00:03:41.220
years depending where you are in the year or next year whatever it is.

71

00:03:41.220  -->  00:03:43.900
I think you guys understand out DCF this counting works.

72

00:03:44.010  -->  00:03:46.730
And then that discount is the price target today.

73

00:03:46.740  -->  00:03:49.520
And that's a high price target.

74

00:03:50.000  -->  00:03:50.970
OK.

75

00:03:51.000  -->  00:03:55.510
So you've got three answers here.

76

00:03:55.740  -->  00:04:00.540
I'm glad we did the high price one because it will somewhat get normalized by this.

77

00:04:00.540  -->  00:04:01.130
Right.

78

00:04:01.410  -->  00:04:07.620
So if you just use PPI right you may decide oh my god that one is way off right.

79

00:04:07.690  -->  00:04:11.670
If you just use DCF you might realize why I'm not bullish enough.

80

00:04:11.730  -->  00:04:18.210
So some people might even choose to ignore that one because it's an outlier.

81

00:04:18.360  -->  00:04:21.280
And you know one or two data points does make a trend but many do.

82

00:04:21.480  -->  00:04:24.960
So you might want to do another valuation methodology here if you wanted to.

83

00:04:24.980  -->  00:04:26.580
But I think this is good enough.

84

00:04:26.610  -->  00:04:31.270
And when you bring this to your portfolio manager your boss or your potential employer they might say

85

00:04:31.280  -->  00:04:31.640
.

86

00:04:32.160  -->  00:04:35.810
Chris I kind of think this is an outlier.

87

00:04:35.850  -->  00:04:41.990
I don't want you to factor that in at all and not get rid of it or you might get to a point where you're

88

00:04:42.180  -->  00:04:45.550
a sophisticated investor and you just kind of look at one or two of these.

89

00:04:45.600  -->  00:04:51.540
Right and you might even favor this one here but you better have good logic in your model to justify

90

00:04:51.540  -->  00:04:53.940
a target price of that much upside.

91

00:04:53.940  -->  00:04:58.020
I love looking at ridiculous high target price companies.

92

00:04:58.050  -->  00:05:02.430
I don't like wasting my time trying to come up with investment ideas that are going to go up 10 percent

93

00:05:02.430  -->  00:05:02.960
per year.

94

00:05:03.030  -->  00:05:05.090
Right because the margin of error is just too high.

95

00:05:05.220  -->  00:05:07.140
What if you're five or 10 or 20 percent off.

96

00:05:07.140  -->  00:05:08.020
Right.

97

00:05:08.040  -->  00:05:15.780
So this excites me these types of target prices here because basically I'm an outlier.

98

00:05:15.780  -->  00:05:18.690
There's no way anywhere else in the market I think the Sox can go up that much.

99

00:05:18.690  -->  00:05:19.540
I love that.

100

00:05:19.740  -->  00:05:25.260
That's why I love looking out five years because again I don't know the path but I know the destination

101

00:05:25.260  -->  00:05:25.290
.

102

00:05:25.290  -->  00:05:30.810
If I feel comfortable my five year estimates and again Wall Street or most analysts most investors look

103

00:05:30.810  -->  00:05:33.240
out one year maybe two max whatever.

104

00:05:33.240  -->  00:05:35.270
I think the smart money looks out long term.

105

00:05:35.610  -->  00:05:38.540
OK so anyway here's a blended average of all three.

106

00:05:38.580  -->  00:05:43.160
Our target price is boat or 9 Dagar close to 10 bagger is pretty good.

107

00:05:43.290  -->  00:05:43.690
You get.

108

00:05:43.770  -->  00:05:44.260
OK.

109

00:05:44.370  -->  00:05:44.570
Go
