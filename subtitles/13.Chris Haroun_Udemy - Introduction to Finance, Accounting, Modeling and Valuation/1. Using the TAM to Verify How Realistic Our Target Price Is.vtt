00:00:01.890  -->  00:00:03.110
Let's do a sanity check.

2

00:00:03.120  -->  00:00:03.690
OK.

3

00:00:03.690  -->  00:00:05.490
Checks and balances here.

4

00:00:06.210  -->  00:00:08.820
This is our revenue in 2020.

5

00:00:08.820  -->  00:00:11.550
For the three segments these three added together toll revenue.

6

00:00:11.680  -->  00:00:14.060
Remember we hear from the TAM or total just will mark a little while ago.

7

00:00:14.190  -->  00:00:15.970
Let's see if this makes sense to.

8

00:00:16.280  -->  00:00:17.180
OK.

9

00:00:17.400  -->  00:00:24.330
So for the three line items that Tam that we calculated was those three those three amounts.

10

00:00:24.480  -->  00:00:32.360
So that means that Tallaght solutions for us by 2020 is only 2.2 percent of the TAM market solutions

11

00:00:32.640  -->  00:00:41.310
by 2020 is 2.3 percent of that TAM or total Jaspal market and Priem solutions by 2020 is a miniscule

12

00:00:41.310  -->  00:00:44.850
point 1 percent of that total possible market.

13

00:00:44.850  -->  00:00:52.590
So this sanity check is just a little whatever you feel good about your results analysis.

14

00:00:52.590  -->  00:00:54.420
This makes me feel OK about my numbers.

15

00:00:54.420  -->  00:00:54.920
We're not.

16

00:00:54.930  -->  00:01:00.990
I mean sometimes our model companies and I will get a mass of percent of the total addressable market

17

00:01:01.050  -->  00:01:02.120
four or five years.

18

00:01:02.190  -->  00:01:03.540
And in that case I'm usually wrong.

19

00:01:03.540  -->  00:01:06.480
So I actually feel pretty good about this and that's it.

20

00:01:06.480  -->  00:01:06.840
Thanks
