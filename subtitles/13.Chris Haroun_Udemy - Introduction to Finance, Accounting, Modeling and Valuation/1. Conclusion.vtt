00:00:00.660  -->  00:00:04.570
Congratulations you've made it you've completed the course.

2

00:00:04.620  -->  00:00:10.920
So what we'll do is we'll go through a very quick review of everything we've covered and I've hope I

3

00:00:10.920  -->  00:00:15.900
hope you've enjoyed this course and if you have any feedback from me on how I can improve the course

4

00:00:16.200  -->  00:00:19.350
or make it more simplistic to understand please let me know.

5

00:00:19.410  -->  00:00:24.820
So a county as we know is more of a science because you're looking backwards and you have to completely

6

00:00:24.820  -->  00:00:31.740
and accurately ensure that the numbers are accurately reflected now finance as we know is a bit more

7

00:00:31.740  -->  00:00:36.900
of an art because you're predicting the future and you'll never be 100 percent correct but directionally

8

00:00:36.900  -->  00:00:42.000
of course you have to be correct and that's why it's a little bit more of an art on the accounting side

9

00:00:42.000  -->  00:00:42.030
.

10

00:00:42.030  -->  00:00:46.630
We start off by talking about what is an income statement and we talked about what is a balance sheet

11

00:00:46.630  -->  00:00:50.850
and what does a cash flow statement and what is the purpose of these three statements and how are they

12

00:00:50.850  -->  00:00:52.450
all linked together.

13

00:00:52.530  -->  00:00:58.770
And then after the accounting section we started to project the future using our crystal ball and Microsoft

14

00:00:58.770  -->  00:01:04.200
Excel and the inputs that we use are readily available and free for everybody which is awesome.

15

00:01:04.620  -->  00:01:07.140
We use Investor Relations Web sites.

16

00:01:07.140  -->  00:01:13.960
Yahoo Finance which is great and the Securities and Exchange Commission and what we did was we use all

17

00:01:13.960  -->  00:01:18.390
of this information when we forecast it to try to come up with the appropriate target price at the end

18

00:01:18.390  -->  00:01:19.470
of the road there.

19

00:01:19.680  -->  00:01:25.530
And we also did a very high level analysis using a number of different formulas to assess the financial

20

00:01:25.530  -->  00:01:27.270
health of a company.

21

00:01:27.540  -->  00:01:29.930
And so I hope you enjoyed this course.

22

00:01:29.940  -->  00:01:36.110
I've certainly enjoyed putting it together and I try to always enjoy what I learn or what I teach in

23

00:01:36.130  -->  00:01:42.180
and hopefully that that comes through as well so no longer are any of us confused about finance and

24

00:01:42.180  -->  00:01:43.350
accounting.

25

00:01:43.380  -->  00:01:44.880
We put that to rest.

26

00:01:44.880  -->  00:01:46.340
So congratulations.

27

00:01:46.380  -->  00:01:51.240
And again please let me know how I can make this course better for you.

28

00:01:51.240  -->  00:01:53.040
Thanks a lot for your time and for your commitment

29

00:01:55.560  -->  00:01:58.210
.
