1

00:00:00,780  -->  00:00:07,340
Price to earnings and this is pretty simple it's just pulled directly off of the income statement tab

2

00:00:07,340  -->  00:00:12,150
you see there and it's green because it's coming off another sheet and this is the annual year over

3

00:00:12,150  -->  00:00:13,140
year growth.

4

00:00:13,140  -->  00:00:20,610
Now remember we're assuming because revenue growth is decelerating LinkedIn wants to make certain shareholders

5

00:00:20,610  -->  00:00:21,330
happy.

6

00:00:21,360  -->  00:00:21,590
Right.

7

00:00:21,600  -->  00:00:25,380
Because they're going be losing some shareholders here some growth investors might you know jump off

8

00:00:25,380  -->  00:00:26,420
ship here.

9

00:00:26,490  -->  00:00:28,670
They may not want investing more because growth is slowing.

10

00:00:28,840  -->  00:00:35,080
So some of the more gossipy investors right are happy to see hey check this out.

11

00:00:35,100  -->  00:00:40,060
You've got yearly growth earnings growth is accelerating That's pretty cool.

12

00:00:40,470  -->  00:00:40,760
OK.

13

00:00:40,770  -->  00:00:45,790
So how do you come up with the right valuation for a company on a basis.

14

00:00:45,810  -->  00:00:49,310
Well remember before I mention the PEG ratio right.

15

00:00:49,320  -->  00:00:53,770
So if we assume that a company trades in line with its growth rate.

16

00:00:53,790  -->  00:00:54,020
Right.

17

00:00:54,020  -->  00:00:55,920
Which is what the market usually does over time.

18

00:00:55,920  -->  00:01:02,220
The market usually trades at about roughly 15 times earnings because the market's growing at 15 percent

19

00:01:02,270  -->  00:01:02,630
.

20

00:01:03,140  -->  00:01:06,960
And so if a company is growing at 30 percent earnings it's titrated 30 times.

21

00:01:06,960  -->  00:01:08,360
That's actually a good rule of thumb.

22

00:01:08,430  -->  00:01:13,980
In fact if a company misses earnings by 50 percent then usually the stock was down close to 50 percent

23

00:01:13,980  -->  00:01:14,130
.

24

00:01:14,160  -->  00:01:14,370
Right.

25

00:01:14,370  -->  00:01:15,820
It's a one to one ratio.

26

00:01:15,870  -->  00:01:17,740
Usually there are exceptions.

27

00:01:18,220  -->  00:01:22,810
And so here what we do is this market cap right.

28

00:01:22,860  -->  00:01:30,660
You basically take you basically take the price this year price her right you take $9 and 64 cents and

29

00:01:31,110  -->  00:01:35,110
you multiply it by 30 times or 30 percent times higher.

30

00:01:35,210  -->  00:01:35,710
OK.

31

00:01:36,000  -->  00:01:37,080
And that's a peg of one.

32

00:01:37,100  -->  00:01:43,650
It's 30 percent here 29 times here 27 times.

33

00:01:43,660  -->  00:01:47,300
Get that up here in the bullish scenario.

34

00:01:47,340  -->  00:01:51,180
Sometimes you get this in bull markets where companies trade at two times that earnings growth rate

35

00:01:51,330  -->  00:01:53,170
get terror and it happens.

36

00:01:53,610  -->  00:01:57,940
So here two times earnings growth rates are 60 times earnings which is too high.

37

00:01:58,170  -->  00:02:05,220
We'll get to that target price and then the just right cap is in between 1 and 2 which is 1 1/2 times

38

00:02:05,400  -->  00:02:07,010
earnings growth.

39

00:02:07,080  -->  00:02:14,040
And so in this year here we see that one and a half times earnings growth times our EPS get to higher

40

00:02:14,040  -->  00:02:21,390
price of 434 let's discount this guy down to today's terms like we did over here and basically that

41

00:02:21,390  -->  00:02:24,890
means we take this divided by one plus the whack to the power of four.

42

00:02:24,990  -->  00:02:28,320
And that is our just right price earnings target price
