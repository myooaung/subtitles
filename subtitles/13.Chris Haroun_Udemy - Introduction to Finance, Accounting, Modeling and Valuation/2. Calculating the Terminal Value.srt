1

00:00:00,510  -->  00:00:03,320
All right let's build on the logic from The Last Lecture.

2

00:00:03,420  -->  00:00:04,230
OK.

3

00:00:04,530  -->  00:00:07,380
So we calculated the net present value.

4

00:00:07,470  -->  00:00:08,090
Right.

5

00:00:08,220  -->  00:00:10,720
But what about the free cash flows.

6

00:00:10,890  -->  00:00:14,640
After that last year into infinity that's got to be worth something.

7

00:00:14,640  -->  00:00:17,040
Well how do we account for that.

8

00:00:17,040  -->  00:00:23,160
Well that's called the terminal value the cap and the terminal value calculation is a lot easier than

9

00:00:23,160  -->  00:00:25,400
you think.

10

00:00:25,410  -->  00:00:31,090
So what you do is this you need to calculate the terminal value.

11

00:00:31,290  -->  00:00:37,470
So you take your interest rate which is 7 percent in cash and then you've got to get the long term growth

12

00:00:37,470  -->  00:00:39,150
rate which we assume is 2 percent.

13

00:00:39,150  -->  00:00:44,820
And don't ever assume that a company can grow more than 1 2 or 3 percent into infinity okay.

14

00:00:44,880  -->  00:00:46,170
Look at the U.S. economy.

15

00:00:46,170  -->  00:00:52,050
Hey it's it's a big company it's 25 percent global global GDP but it can't grow more than a couple percent

16

00:00:52,050  -->  00:00:53,260
just because it's big whatever.

17

00:00:53,300  -->  00:00:56,010
So big companies don't grow very much.

18

00:00:56,100  -->  00:00:56,490
OK.

19

00:00:56,580  -->  00:01:02,580
So long term growth is usually one two or best case 3 percent but more likely one or two percent.

20

00:01:02,580  -->  00:01:04,770
OK we cut our interest rate which is 7 percent.

21

00:01:04,770  -->  00:01:08,170
We've got our long term growth rate which we assume is 2 percent here.

22

00:01:08,550  -->  00:01:13,060
So the terminal value formula calculation is as follows.

23

00:01:13,110  -->  00:01:15,330
You take the last year free cash flow.

24

00:01:15,380  -->  00:01:15,730
Okay.

25

00:01:15,750  -->  00:01:21,680
So that's 1100 point for you multiply by 1 plus the long term growth rate.

26

00:01:21,960  -->  00:01:25,030
And then you divide it by interest minus the growth rate.

27

00:01:25,100  -->  00:01:25,620
Okay.

28

00:01:25,740  -->  00:01:26,730
Makes sense.

29

00:01:26,730  -->  00:01:30,080
So remember it's got to be that final year's free cash fall again.

30

00:01:30,090  -->  00:01:34,720
Times 1 plus the growth rate divided by interest minus long term growth rate.

31

00:01:34,950  -->  00:01:39,150
And you might ask yourself way to second guess what the long term growth rate is higher than the interest

32

00:01:39,150  -->  00:01:39,770
rate.

33

00:01:40,050  -->  00:01:45,960
It really can never be OK because interest rates will never stay as low as they are today forever right

34

00:01:45,970  -->  00:01:46,030
.

35

00:01:46,050  -->  00:01:47,350
Interest rates are usually a lot higher.

36

00:01:47,350  -->  00:01:47,850
What they are today

37

00:01:58,500  -->  00:02:01,910
in

38

00:02:05,610  -->  00:02:08,250
long term growth rate can never be more than a couple percent.

39

00:02:08,250  -->  00:02:12,300
All right so let's do it and take our final your free cash flow.

40

00:02:12,660  -->  00:02:19,140
You multiply it by 1 plus the growth rate is 2 percent divided by the interest rate minus 2 percent

41

00:02:19,140  -->  00:02:19,530
.

42

00:02:19,530  -->  00:02:21,150
So it's divided by 5 percent.

43

00:02:21,150  -->  00:02:26,370
OK. Let's build on this slowly and wait for it wait for it.

44

00:02:26,370  -->  00:02:32,820
We get our terminal value total of come on twenty two thousand six hundred fifty two.

45

00:02:32,910  -->  00:02:37,980
And then there's one little step left which is you need to discount that twenty two thousand six hundred

46

00:02:38,090  -->  00:02:39,700
$52 into today.

47

00:02:39,840  -->  00:02:40,110
OK.

48

00:02:40,110  -->  00:02:41,340
And you know how to discount already
