00:00:00.480  -->  00:00:02.650
Let's go through the answers to the price to revenue.

2

00:00:02.650  -->  00:00:08.280
Exercise is basically just three boxes to go through here before I get there I want to show you one

3

00:00:08.280  -->  00:00:13.300
little thing here which is remember that the DCF exercise right.

4

00:00:13.320  -->  00:00:16.220
We have these numbers flowing into here.

5

00:00:16.230  -->  00:00:16.560
OK.

6

00:00:16.570  -->  00:00:19.950
Got the bullish case bearish case and chust right.

7

00:00:19.950  -->  00:00:21.890
Target price number that was 22 bucks.

8

00:00:21.900  -->  00:00:22.770
Right.

9

00:00:22.860  -->  00:00:28.080
And so the price to revenue numbers is going to feed into here as well.

10

00:00:28.180  -->  00:00:34.830
Kathy the target price that we come up with here today and then next exercise in the next section will

11

00:00:34.830  -->  00:00:39.780
do price to earnings and then we'll take an average of all three a cat.

12

00:00:39.810  -->  00:00:40.790
All three of these.

13

00:00:40.800  -->  00:00:45.390
And the reason we take an average is just to kind of minimalize the margin of error if one of them is

14

00:00:45.390  -->  00:00:47.470
way way off and we never know which one it is.

15

00:00:47.530  -->  00:00:48.380
OK.

16

00:00:48.750  -->  00:00:51.490
So let's talk about the bullish price target.

17

00:00:51.540  -->  00:00:58.180
Right so recall with the DCF exercised very bullish target a bearish target and it just right.

18

00:00:58.200  -->  00:00:58.970
Target OK.

19

00:00:58.980  -->  00:01:00.990
Remember Goldilocks and three bears.

20

00:01:01.410  -->  00:01:06.590
OK and let's kick it off with the bullish target price which is 10 times revenue.

21

00:01:06.810  -->  00:01:13.260
And you can calculate it based on different years rate all depends on what kind of investor you are

22

00:01:13.280  -->  00:01:13.470
.

23

00:01:13.650  -->  00:01:17.600
OK some investors take it off of the current year or the next year.

24

00:01:17.640  -->  00:01:22.030
But I prefer to look at on a longer term basis and you can even discount it if you want to.

25

00:01:22.480  -->  00:01:22.820
OK.

26

00:01:22.830  -->  00:01:31.470
So what does the bullish price target if we're at 10 times revenue in years 2019 2020.

27

00:01:31.500  -->  00:01:37.620
K Well member hit shift first then click and you can hit delete.

28

00:01:37.620  -->  00:01:38.720
Take your finger off shift.

29

00:01:38.910  -->  00:01:39.830
OK.

30

00:01:40.310  -->  00:01:47.250
And so what you do is this you basically take 10 times the revenue in that year.

31

00:01:47.400  -->  00:01:47.690
Right.

32

00:01:47.700  -->  00:01:54.120
And here if you just click command and close brackets you'll jump back to right here.

33

00:01:54.120  -->  00:01:57.510
See I went back and forth right there up here.

34

00:01:57.510  -->  00:02:05.390
All right let's go back and then we you do after you've calculated the market cap target right.

35

00:02:05.610  -->  00:02:07.690
Then you divide it by the number of shares.

36

00:02:07.700  -->  00:02:08.390
OK.

37

00:02:08.460  -->  00:02:11.070
And the shares are just pulled right off the income statement.

38

00:02:11.070  -->  00:02:13.590
K. Mark Khadra I buy shares equals target price.

39

00:02:13.590  -->  00:02:14.200
Right.

40

00:02:14.640  -->  00:02:21.710
And that is just right their income statement line 44 let's go check it out.

41

00:02:21.750  -->  00:02:22.550
There we have it.

42

00:02:22.830  -->  00:02:24.340
That's it there.

43

00:02:25.080  -->  00:02:26.050
All right.

44

00:02:26.340  -->  00:02:27.750
So we're done with bullish.

45

00:02:27.750  -->  00:02:33.930
Let's talk about bearish so a bearish price target would have a revenue multiple of let's just say five

46

00:02:33.930  -->  00:02:38.590
times OK shift click take finger off shift hit delete OK..

47

00:02:38.940  -->  00:02:45.600
Oh and by the way here just to the same logic but just for for for that revenue there I can see that

48

00:02:45.600  -->  00:02:49.790
times 10 buy number shares can right in terms of bearish.

49

00:02:49.950  -->  00:02:58.660
You take five times five times the revenue to buy buy number shares or see a pull up income statement

50

00:02:58.670  -->  00:02:58.800
.

51

00:02:59.010  -->  00:03:06.990
And by the same token here for the price target if you base it off a 2018 and what you do is you basically

52

00:03:06.990  -->  00:03:10.640
just take five times that revenue number.

53

00:03:11.370  -->  00:03:14.050
And then you divide by the shares get the income statement.

54

00:03:14.700  -->  00:03:18.880
And then lastly this box here that just right one.

55

00:03:19.050  -->  00:03:19.260
Right.

56

00:03:19.260  -->  00:03:24.630
So in the middle is just right 7 1/2 times revenues instead of five or 10 times.

57

00:03:24.960  -->  00:03:31.140
And then just by the same token you can take that time 7 1/2 and then just divide that by number show

58

00:03:31.140  -->  00:03:32.520
I think you get it.

59

00:03:32.520  -->  00:03:39.400
And then in terms the target price I had here I just discounted right that number of years until today

60

00:03:39.430  -->  00:03:39.740
.

61

00:03:39.940  -->  00:03:40.740
See.

62

00:03:40.770  -->  00:03:46.770
So the way I personally do it is I like to get my price target five years from now always right.

63

00:03:46.770  -->  00:03:51.990
Because I love to ask myself this question five years now is this company going to be more relevant

64

00:03:51.990  -->  00:03:53.500
or less relevant than it is today.

65

00:03:53.760  -->  00:03:57.540
And then he can kind of ignore the ball till in the middle and just kind of focus on five years out

66

00:03:57.540  -->  00:03:58.580
because most people won't.

67

00:03:58.770  -->  00:04:03.810
Most people focus on one year one quarter next year and there's a lot of volatility and you know they

68

00:04:03.810  -->  00:04:05.400
get fooled by randomness.

69

00:04:05.400  -->  00:04:07.150
I want to see the forest for the trees.

70

00:04:07.560  -->  00:04:08.480
I want to think to yourself.

71

00:04:08.490  -->  00:04:13.480
I don't know the path but I know the destination is much higher or much lower if a shrimp.

72

00:04:13.710  -->  00:04:16.040
And then again you just can't buy four or five years.

73

00:04:16.140  -->  00:04:21.420
And this could be five here if you're in if you're in early 2016 or it can be for if you're in late

74

00:04:21.420  -->  00:04:24.300
2006 you don't know when you're taking this course.

75

00:04:24.480  -->  00:04:25.650
OK.

76

00:04:25.650  -->  00:04:30.390
And that will feed right into this guy here.

77

00:04:30.750  -->  00:04:34.070
And that's the return to your target price there.

78

00:04:34.350  -->  00:04:37.760
And that's basically that divided by the target price there.

79

00:04:37.770  -->  00:04:42.630
Yes you got 490 upside to that is higher price from here.

80

00:04:42.630  -->  00:04:42.980
OK.

81

00:04:42.990  -->  00:04:45.350
And that's the market cap today.

82

00:04:45.570  -->  00:04:45.980
OK.

83

00:04:45.990  -->  00:04:51.720
And then we've calculated the market caps in the future based on different revenue multiple and revenue

84

00:04:51.720  -->  00:04:52.830
numbers.

85

00:04:53.370  -->  00:04:59.970
And then what we'll do is you've got the P exercise coming up next after this one and then we'll take

86

00:04:59.970  -->  00:05:02.160
a blended average of all three.

87

00:05:02.160  -->  00:05:02.620
Okay.

88

00:05:02.630  -->  00:05:07.560
And then we'll get an average of all three there for our combined target price and again I love look

89

00:05:07.560  -->  00:05:12.350
at at least three different valuation methodologies just in case one is way way way off.

90

00:05:12.630  -->  00:05:13.180
Okay.

91

00:05:13.400  -->  00:05:13.620
Go
