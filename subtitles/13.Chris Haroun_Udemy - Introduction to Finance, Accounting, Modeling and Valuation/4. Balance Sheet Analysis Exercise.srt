00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:05,160
Let's talk about the balance sheet exercise so similar to what you did with the income statement exercise

2

00:00:05,220  -->  00:00:06,490
in the previous section.

3

00:00:06,570  -->  00:00:09,980
Take these items which are sorted alphabetically OK.

4

00:00:10,110  -->  00:00:18,630
And these items from 2015 and 2016 and simply paste them directly in the appropriate boxes here.

5

00:00:18,720  -->  00:00:24,210
And if you're worried or have a concern about the year over year change then right.

6

00:00:24,320  -->  00:00:24,830
Yes.

7

00:00:24,840  -->  00:00:30,540
For concern and then write down why and if the answer's no you're not concerned then obviously don't

8

00:00:30,620  -->  00:00:32,280
you know if the document why.

9

00:00:32,580  -->  00:00:36,570
And please make sure that the balance sheet balances right.

10

00:00:36,600  -->  00:00:41,360
So obviously it doesn't balance in both cases because we haven't put all the data in yet.

11

00:00:41,430  -->  00:00:41,660
Right.

12

00:00:41,670  -->  00:00:43,950
But make sure that you don't get an error message here.

13

00:00:43,950  -->  00:00:44,800
I mean they both bounce.

14

00:00:44,820  -->  00:00:49,470
And the reason this one already bounces is it's just a fluke because I guess you got 75 grand on each

15

00:00:49,470  -->  00:00:52,430
side so enjoy the exercise after you're done.

16

00:00:52,440  -->  00:00:57,090
Please take a look at the answers and then come back and see me please in the next lecture and we'll

17

00:00:57,090  -->  00:00:58,640
go through the answers in more detail.

18

00:00:58,650  -->  00:00:58,980
Thanks
