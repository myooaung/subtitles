00:00:00.690  -->  00:00:06.000
Let's talk about amazing formulas to assess financials We'll talk about four categories of formulas

2

00:00:06.000  -->  00:00:06.610
.

3

00:00:06.660  -->  00:00:14.250
The first will be profit How profitable is a company for every $1 in stuff they sell.

4

00:00:14.250  -->  00:00:18.180
The second category is competition or comps.

5

00:00:18.180  -->  00:00:22.160
How is the company doing or valued versus the competition.

6

00:00:22.170  -->  00:00:24.990
The third category is what about time.

7

00:00:25.560  -->  00:00:30.840
How long does it take a company to turn stuff that they create into cash.

8

00:00:31.680  -->  00:00:34.250
And the last section is debt OK.

9

00:00:34.260  -->  00:00:39.230
And how do we know if a company has way too much debt.

10

00:00:39.240  -->  00:00:40.050
All right.

11

00:00:40.230  -->  00:00:42.330
Let's talk about profitability.

12

00:00:42.330  -->  00:00:45.850
How profitable is a company for every $1 in stuff they sell.

13

00:00:46.290  -->  00:00:52.790
So How profitable is the company for every dollar they sell of inventory before expenses.

14

00:00:52.830  -->  00:00:53.800
Right.

15

00:00:53.940  -->  00:01:01.070
That's the cost of goods sold divided by revenue and that's also referred to as gross margin.

16

00:01:01.080  -->  00:01:04.670
Next up how profitable is a company for every dollar they sell of inventory.

17

00:01:04.840  -->  00:01:11.300
Aftermost expenses that's called it's divided by revenue or operating margin.

18

00:01:12.330  -->  00:01:16.800
Okay Ibidem divided by revenue equals operating margin.

19

00:01:17.040  -->  00:01:22.060
And you might ask yourself why I don't understand Chris why don't we just look at at earnings.

20

00:01:22.050  -->  00:01:29.010
We have to look at the well the recent we look at it is because if we compare and contrast companies

21

00:01:29.010  -->  00:01:35.370
in different countries that have different tax rates and different interest rates etc. We don't compare

22

00:01:35.370  -->  00:01:35.800
them.

23

00:01:36.090  -->  00:01:44.010
So for example you got Rolex in Switzerland You've got was there Cartier in France and you've got Mickey

24

00:01:44.010  -->  00:01:45.570
Mouse in the United States.

25

00:01:45.630  -->  00:01:48.930
You can compare all three of them using either the revenue.

26

00:01:49.260  -->  00:01:49.940
Cool.

27

00:01:50.340  -->  00:01:55.210
So next up we've got How profitable is a company for every dollar they sell their mentor.

28

00:01:55.260  -->  00:01:57.450
After all expenses.

29

00:01:57.840  -->  00:02:01.820
And that is net income divided by revenue net profit margin.

30

00:02:01.880  -->  00:02:02.190
Right.

31

00:02:02.190  -->  00:02:09.090
Read the bottom of the income statement and then next up we've got How profitable is a company for every

32

00:02:09.090  -->  00:02:11.490
dollar they have of assets.

33

00:02:11.970  -->  00:02:17.580
Well that's net income divided by assets which is referred to as return on assets.

34

00:02:17.640  -->  00:02:23.100
And similarly How profitable is a company for every dollar they have of equity that is net income over

35

00:02:23.100  -->  00:02:25.900
equity which is called return on equity.

36

00:02:26.010  -->  00:02:33.220
Now which one of these formulas uses the income statement and which formulas use the balance sheet.

37

00:02:34.200  -->  00:02:34.910
Okay.

38

00:02:35.160  -->  00:02:41.490
Well income statement is most of them but the bottom 2 is important because this formula net income

39

00:02:41.550  -->  00:02:49.200
assets and net income to equity uses both the income statement and the balance sheet to assess profitability

40

00:02:49.200  -->  00:02:49.490
.

41

00:02:49.590  -->  00:02:52.330
Pretty cool.

42

00:02:52.350  -->  00:02:52.930
All right.

43

00:02:53.010  -->  00:02:54.630
Let's move on to debt.

44

00:02:54.690  -->  00:02:59.990
How do we know if a company has way too much debt.

45

00:03:00.120  -->  00:03:03.110
Does the company have more debt than assets.

46

00:03:03.570  -->  00:03:08.700
That's total liabilities divided by total assets and that's debt to assets and banks don't want that

47

00:03:08.700  -->  00:03:10.120
number to be greater than one.

48

00:03:10.200  -->  00:03:10.770
Right.

49

00:03:10.770  -->  00:03:12.720
Otherwise they'll say oh you have too much debt.

50

00:03:12.750  -->  00:03:14.530
I'm not going to lend to you anymore.

51

00:03:15.270  -->  00:03:18.430
Also does the company have more debt than equity.

52

00:03:18.510  -->  00:03:20.010
That's a pretty important one.

53

00:03:20.490  -->  00:03:24.010
That's total liabilities to out of my total equity debt to equity.

54

00:03:24.240  -->  00:03:27.630
And the last one is can a company pay the interest on its debt.

55

00:03:27.630  -->  00:03:28.950
This was crucial.

56

00:03:28.950  -->  00:03:33.810
This is called the interest coverage ratio that divided by interest and you want to be many many times

57

00:03:33.810  -->  00:03:35.070
bigger than interest.

58

00:03:35.070  -->  00:03:39.110
Otherwise banks get really worried that you can't pay the interest on your debt.

59

00:03:39.870  -->  00:03:43.150
These formulas use the balance sheet and the income statement.

60

00:03:43.230  -->  00:03:43.740
OK.

61

00:03:43.860  -->  00:03:45.540
Let's move on to what about time.

62

00:03:45.540  -->  00:03:50.430
How long does it take a company to turn stuff they sell into cash.

63

00:03:50.430  -->  00:03:50.730
All right.

64

00:03:50.730  -->  00:03:58.350
So how many days of inventory is a company have on hand inventory divided by the Coskata old times 365

65

00:03:58.380  -->  00:04:01.790
equals inventory days on hand or doh.

66

00:04:02.070  -->  00:04:04.550
I couldn't resist.

67

00:04:05.070  -->  00:04:08.610
And basically this is how it works.

68

00:04:08.640  -->  00:04:10.680
It costs 100 bucks make a watch.

69

00:04:10.890  -->  00:04:15.930
We saw a thousand this year therefore our costs the good soul was $100000 this year.

70

00:04:15.930  -->  00:04:16.890
Right.

71

00:04:16.920  -->  00:04:18.800
That's just 100 bucks times a thousand.

72

00:04:19.200  -->  00:04:19.800
All right.

73

00:04:19.800  -->  00:04:25.660
At the end of the year we have 10 in inventory 10 items a hundred equals 1000.

74

00:04:26.380  -->  00:04:26.900
OK.

75

00:04:26.970  -->  00:04:29.810
Stay with me here.

76

00:04:29.870  -->  00:04:31.730
Costco sold the game 100 grand for the year.

77

00:04:31.900  -->  00:04:33.750
Inventory's a thousand bucks at the end of the year.

78

00:04:33.750  -->  00:04:34.010
OK.

79

00:04:34.020  -->  00:04:35.190
We had 10 left right.

80

00:04:35.240  -->  00:04:39.930
The amatory times under bucks each.

81

00:04:39.930  -->  00:04:41.210
All right.

82

00:04:41.430  -->  00:04:42.490
Creative.

83

00:04:42.930  -->  00:04:52.570
So inventory divided by the cascode sold times 365 equals 3.6 five days of inventory days on hand.

84

00:04:54.300  -->  00:04:55.470
Let's talk about comps.

85

00:04:55.470  -->  00:04:59.180
How is the company doing or valued versus the competition.

86

00:04:59.680  -->  00:05:06.540
And it's tough to compare companies in different countries on all metrics and we talked about this before

87

00:05:06.540  -->  00:05:06.900
.

88

00:05:06.900  -->  00:05:11.730
You can't just look at bottom line profitability you kind of have to look at it because different countries

89

00:05:11.730  -->  00:05:17.160
have different tax rates interest rates but also from an investing perspective.

90

00:05:17.340  -->  00:05:22.230
Some companies trade at a premium and some come in some countries for certain reasons.

91

00:05:22.440  -->  00:05:27.020
Right and so for example for years as a trade at a huge premium to Oracle.

92

00:05:27.030  -->  00:05:28.100
Why.

93

00:05:28.140  -->  00:05:35.700
Because portfolio managers in Germany or in Europe didn't have as many tech or software companies to

94

00:05:35.700  -->  00:05:37.020
choose from to invest in.

95

00:05:37.070  -->  00:05:43.620
A while back and therefore a lot of them piled in the S&P and S&P trade at a premium to Oracle and we

96

00:05:43.620  -->  00:05:45.990
saw some Cognos too years ago in Canada.

97

00:05:45.990  -->  00:05:52.380
Cognos is a or was a business intelligence software company that was based in Ottawa and then IBM bought

98

00:05:52.380  -->  00:05:52.830
them.

99

00:05:53.010  -->  00:05:58.110
But it used to trade at a premium to its Comsat times.

100

00:05:58.110  -->  00:06:03.600
And so SJP based in Germany traded at a premium to Oracle which is based in the US right.

101

00:06:03.690  -->  00:06:06.340
But it also did because Sep was growing a little bit faster.

102

00:06:06.360  -->  00:06:08.500
Just to be fair.

103

00:06:08.660  -->  00:06:09.620
All right.

104

00:06:09.690  -->  00:06:11.690
Price to earnings.

105

00:06:12.090  -->  00:06:14.990
This is the same thing as market cap to net income.

106

00:06:15.000  -->  00:06:16.540
Close enough right.

107

00:06:16.570  -->  00:06:22.590
I put a little footnote down there we know that market cap equal shares time in Cyprus right another

108

00:06:22.800  -->  00:06:28.440
comps when we look at for comparing companies is Peg price earnings to growth and growth is EPS growth

109

00:06:28.440  -->  00:06:28.470
.

110

00:06:28.470  -->  00:06:36.030
We talked about this then there's price to revenue and price price equals market cap right and EDT but

111

00:06:36.240  -->  00:06:37.870
we talked about this as well.

112

00:06:38.160  -->  00:06:41.540
EV equals marketing cap plus debt minus cash and short term investments.

113

00:06:41.670  -->  00:06:42.810
And then EV to sales.

114

00:06:42.840  -->  00:06:45.830
Same thing except with sales the same thing as revenue.

115

00:06:45.850  -->  00:06:50.820
You know that and then we look at price to cash flow and free cash flow I'm sorry it's at the bottom

116

00:06:50.820  -->  00:06:52.350
of our cash flow statement.

117

00:06:52.350  -->  00:06:53.860
I don't want to call it free cash flow.

118

00:06:53.940  -->  00:06:55.260
I mean it's a cash really free.

119

00:06:55.310  -->  00:06:55.960
I don't get it.

120

00:06:56.040  -->  00:06:56.820
All right.

121

00:06:56.820  -->  00:06:59.230
And then they got price to book which we cover quickly.

122

00:06:59.400  -->  00:07:04.980
So book equals book value which is basically assets and liabilities that they're on their way to tangible

123

00:07:04.980  -->  00:07:05.670
assets.

124

00:07:05.670  -->  00:07:10.610
But for simplicity let's just assume that it's just assets and liabilities.

125

00:07:10.650  -->  00:07:12.800
Now don't forget to account for growth.

126

00:07:12.810  -->  00:07:17.490
OK a lot of times companies trade at premies other companies because they're growing faster in the I

127

00:07:17.490  -->  00:07:20.550
guess the best metric to use for this is price earnings to growth.

128

00:07:20.560  -->  00:07:24.330
But when you're looking at price to revenue or but are different metrics.

129

00:07:24.450  -->  00:07:27.450
Always try to see if the growth rate of one company is higher than the other.

130

00:07:27.680  -->  00:07:30.150
And if it is it usually trades at a premium multiple
