1

00:00:00,720  -->  00:00:04,940
So we always start with net income at the top of the cash flow statement.

2

00:00:04,950  -->  00:00:10,140
And this obviously comes from the income statement and then we get one more item usually from the income

3

00:00:10,140  -->  00:00:12,930
statement which is depreciation and amortization.

4

00:00:13,050  -->  00:00:18,420
You just add it back because of course it's not a cash expense and after depreciation what we do is

5

00:00:18,420  -->  00:00:24,420
we look at the change in working capital and working capital means current assets and current liabilities

6

00:00:24,420  -->  00:00:24,450
.

7

00:00:24,450  -->  00:00:24,760
Okay.

8

00:00:24,780  -->  00:00:31,110
So you look at the current assets and current liabilities and the change and add those here okay.

9

00:00:31,320  -->  00:00:37,780
So accounts receivable went up 170000 which means it's cash kind of out of our pocket.

10

00:00:38,040  -->  00:00:43,110
And remember inventory was an absolute disaster last exercise we are looking at the balance sheet and

11

00:00:43,110  -->  00:00:51,170
so where it is deducted here and we owe $15000 more than we did in the previous time period.

12

00:00:51,210  -->  00:00:57,360
When it comes to accounts payable so that's a net cash temporary benefit for us so we put in your pocket

13

00:00:58,170  -->  00:01:01,720
and that gets to cash flow from operations of this amount.

14

00:01:01,770  -->  00:01:02,420
Okay.

15

00:01:02,760  -->  00:01:07,690
Nothing to do here because there are no changes for these items on the balance sheet.

16

00:01:07,770  -->  00:01:10,270
And lastly cash flow from financing.

17

00:01:10,470  -->  00:01:18,930
We actually increased our debt a bit for short and long term as well as common shares and so add all

18

00:01:18,930  -->  00:01:19,970
that stuff together.

19

00:01:19,980  -->  00:01:23,680
This guy this guy and this guy and that gets you negative.

20

00:01:23,730  -->  00:01:25,660
Two hundred ninety eight thousand five hundred dollars.

21

00:01:25,680  -->  00:01:26,550
And I wrote here.

22

00:01:26,550  -->  00:01:32,100
Please note the change in cash flow has to equal the balance sheet from the current year mice to bounce

23

00:01:32,090  -->  00:01:34,190
sheet from last year's cash position.

24

00:01:34,560  -->  00:01:40,620
So our cash position decreased by this much and the beautiful thing about the cash flow statement is

25

00:01:40,620  -->  00:01:44,560
that you actually only need the income statement about you to make it.

26

00:01:44,580  -->  00:01:45,720
So it's really easy.

27

00:01:45,780  -->  00:01:50,760
And when we do the financial modeling section very soon you'll see that we don't really have to look

28

00:01:50,760  -->  00:01:55,680
at the cash flow statement or really spend much time at all preparing it because it's automatically

29

00:01:55,680  -->  00:01:56,540
prepared for us.

30

00:01:56,640  -->  00:02:01,560
Once we create the income statement about the balance sheet it's automatically prepared because it's

31

00:02:01,560  -->  00:02:05,280
all just calculations that are linked between the income statement of balance sheet.

32

00:02:05,280  -->  00:02:07,560
This will make much more sense to you in a couple of sections.

33

00:02:07,560  -->  00:02:07,890
Thanks
