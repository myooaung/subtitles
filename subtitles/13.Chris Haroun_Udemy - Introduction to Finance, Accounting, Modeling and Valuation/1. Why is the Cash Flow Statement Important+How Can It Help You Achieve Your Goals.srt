00:00:03,390  -->  00:00:08,790
Let's talk about the cash flow statement by the end of the section you'll understand why a casual statement

2

00:00:08,790  -->  00:00:14,340
is important and how it's additive to the income statement and what is the relationship between all

3

00:00:14,340  -->  00:00:17,820
three of these financial statements.

4

00:00:17,820  -->  00:00:22,680
And then once we understand the connection between the three financial statements then we can learn

5

00:00:22,680  -->  00:00:24,500
about how to create a financial model.

6

00:00:24,570  -->  00:00:26,180
And that's the fun part.

7

00:00:26,910  -->  00:00:29,370
So what is a cash flow statement.

8

00:00:29,370  -->  00:00:32,580
I'll explain in more detail in the next next lecture.

9

00:00:32,580  -->  00:00:33,880
Why are we doing this.

10

00:00:33,990  -->  00:00:40,110
While we're doing this so that we can understand what is accurate and not accurate about the income

11

00:00:40,110  -->  00:00:46,590
statement because equal statement gives you net income but the net income is not always cash and cash

12

00:00:46,590  -->  00:00:47,140
is king.

13

00:00:47,310  -->  00:00:48,180
OK.

14

00:00:49,260  -->  00:00:53,460
How are we doing this while we're to do it with Excel of course and you'll go through an example with

15

00:00:53,460  -->  00:00:54,420
me.

16

00:00:54,420  -->  00:00:59,460
And basically if I give you the balance sheet and the income statement you can calculate the cash flow

17

00:00:59,460  -->  00:01:00,720
statement from scratch.

18

00:01:01,020  -->  00:01:07,530
And so when you do financial modeling you focus on revenue right in the income statement the balance

19

00:01:07,530  -->  00:01:12,120
sheet then talks to the income statement and you didn't have to worry about forecasting the cash flow

20

00:01:12,120  -->  00:01:15,390
statement because it's all done automatically in Excel.

21

00:01:15,450  -->  00:01:16,260
Right.

22

00:01:16,260  -->  00:01:21,300
So again to make a cash flow statement all you need to have are two things.

23

00:01:21,300  -->  00:01:23,240
Number one the income statement number to the balance sheet.

24

00:01:23,280  -->  00:01:25,250
Then you can make it and we'll make a couple to get
