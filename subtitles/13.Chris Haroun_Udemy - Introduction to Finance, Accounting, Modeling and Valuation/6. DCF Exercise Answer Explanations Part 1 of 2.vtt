00:00:00.300  -->  00:00:06.330
Let's talk about the answers to the discounted cash flow exercise and I really want you to play around

2

00:00:06.330  -->  00:00:07.430
with the numbers here OK.

3

00:00:07.440  -->  00:00:11.260
I want to change numbers on all of these tabs here.

4

00:00:11.340  -->  00:00:13.630
Change the assumptions here as well.

5

00:00:13.800  -->  00:00:15.140
Here here everywhere.

6

00:00:15.150  -->  00:00:21.240
And I really want you understand how all these tabs worked together and how all these different metrics

7

00:00:21.240  -->  00:00:24.310
can change a target price and Keth.

8

00:00:24.570  -->  00:00:30.360
Please learn to read financial statements like a good book and I know it sounds a little crazy but I

9

00:00:30.360  -->  00:00:34.140
just want you to understand this and not memorize never memorize accounting or finance.

10

00:00:34.150  -->  00:00:36.540
Please just understand it and then you'll remember.

11

00:00:36.750  -->  00:00:37.410
OK.

12

00:00:37.740  -->  00:00:39.830
Let's kick it off with this box here.

13

00:00:39.840  -->  00:00:47.700
We hit shift select delete. Oop and free cash flow is always just pulled off the cash flow statement

14

00:00:47.700  -->  00:00:47.890
right.

15

00:00:47.900  -->  00:00:56.630
It's a simple calculation so take command and open in square brackets and then boom your linked here

16

00:00:56.920  -->  00:00:57.250
.

17

00:00:57.930  -->  00:01:03.930
And then basically just double click and it's operating cash flow minus cap X. That's what free cash

18

00:01:03.930  -->  00:01:04.470
flow is.

19

00:01:04.470  -->  00:01:06.660
Right it's a simple calculation down here.

20

00:01:06.810  -->  00:01:10.080
But I don't want to just memorize this I want to really understand what it means.

21

00:01:10.080  -->  00:01:10.670
OK.

22

00:01:10.890  -->  00:01:12.930
So let's look at it this way.

23

00:01:13.200  -->  00:01:21.390
So let's say that you are a company and you make a bunch of money put the money in your pocket the end

24

00:01:21.390  -->  00:01:24.870
of the year and then you want to invest in yourself.

25

00:01:24.960  -->  00:01:25.740
Right.

26

00:01:25.800  -->  00:01:27.910
So you'll invest.

27

00:01:27.980  -->  00:01:29.880
And so what cash you have left over now.

28

00:01:29.910  -->  00:01:36.030
Well it's lever money I made during the year minus the money I use to what was left over to invest myself

29

00:01:36.780  -->  00:01:44.190
and from a company perspective all it is is this operating cash flow minus the amount of money that

30

00:01:44.190  -->  00:01:46.640
we invested or reinvest in the company.

31

00:01:47.120  -->  00:01:49.230
And that's basically equipment CapEx.

32

00:01:49.290  -->  00:01:53.990
Right so operating cash flow modest cap ex is free cash flow and you might ask.

33

00:01:54.000  -->  00:01:57.420
Well Chris I don't understand why don't you just use net income minus what we invested.

34

00:01:57.450  -->  00:02:03.480
Well recall from our early exercise is that your net income is not really cash you have in your pocket

35

00:02:03.490  -->  00:02:03.710
.

36

00:02:03.840  -->  00:02:04.540
Right.

37

00:02:04.560  -->  00:02:06.550
You take when you create a cash flow statement.

38

00:02:06.570  -->  00:02:12.030
You basically start with that income and you add back all the non-cash stuff from your other financial

39

00:02:12.030  -->  00:02:15.480
statements like depreciation which isn't money or your pocket.

40

00:02:15.480  -->  00:02:16.180
Right.

41

00:02:16.210  -->  00:02:19.160
You know that's how we get free cash flow.

42

00:02:19.980  -->  00:02:22.480
And again play around the numbers see what happens.

43

00:02:22.920  -->  00:02:31.890
Let's let's try actually for fun let's just say I went to the revenue tab and for whatever reason I'm

44

00:02:31.890  -->  00:02:34.550
going to delete all these lines here.

45

00:02:34.620  -->  00:02:35.970
Massive product recall.

46

00:02:36.030  -->  00:02:36.300
Right.

47

00:02:36.300  -->  00:02:37.340
Let's see what happens.

48

00:02:37.470  -->  00:02:39.150
It flows through here.

49

00:02:39.150  -->  00:02:40.760
Earnings get hit hard.

50

00:02:40.920  -->  00:02:41.630
Right.

51

00:02:41.640  -->  00:02:45.420
Cash flow statement off obviously gets hit as well.

52

00:02:45.420  -->  00:02:47.600
And let's see what happens.

53

00:02:47.610  -->  00:02:48.610
Free cash flow.

54

00:02:48.830  -->  00:02:49.800
OK.

55

00:02:50.190  -->  00:02:56.760
So free cash flow is now 1 3 3 1 for that year and he controls it and do what we just did.

56

00:02:56.760  -->  00:02:57.130
All right.

57

00:02:57.160  -->  00:02:59.900
Just go back and see how it's higher.

58

00:02:59.940  -->  00:03:05.580
1 4 6 6 so clear out the numbers right and we can even do that again right when we go back here and

59

00:03:07.320  -->  00:03:08.130
get rid of that.

60

00:03:08.160  -->  00:03:08.760
Right.

61

00:03:09.090  -->  00:03:13.350
And what happens is our target price down here.

62

00:03:13.350  -->  00:03:14.650
Right.

63

00:03:14.670  -->  00:03:15.270
It comes.

64

00:03:15.340  -->  00:03:16.410
Twenty bucks.

65

00:03:16.410  -->  00:03:16.790
Right.

66

00:03:16.860  -->  00:03:19.680
But if I can do it go back.

67

00:03:19.680  -->  00:03:20.940
Right.

68

00:03:21.120  -->  00:03:23.630
Price is 22 bucks right.

69

00:03:23.640  -->  00:03:27.580
And you might say well wait a sec I don't understand that's you delete all revenue or part of revenue

70

00:03:27.600  -->  00:03:29.860
enterprise like Only 2 bucks.

71

00:03:30.300  -->  00:03:35.840
Well it did because this revenue line here is pretty small as a percentage of revenue.

72

00:03:35.850  -->  00:03:38.460
Right so only 5 percent of revenue.

73

00:03:38.460  -->  00:03:38.950
Right.

74

00:03:38.970  -->  00:03:42.570
This guy here this line is 95 percent revenue anyway you get the idea.

75

00:03:42.570  -->  00:03:44.800
I want to play around with this a lot.

76

00:03:44.820  -->  00:03:49.670
When can you even use this as a template for yourself when you create your own models right.

77

00:03:49.680  -->  00:03:53.760
Remember every model is different because every model has different number revenue line items in the

78

00:03:53.760  -->  00:03:55.530
way the revenue is always different.

79

00:03:55.530  -->  00:03:59.600
You know you get the idea just play around with this model a lot please.

80

00:04:00.060  -->  00:04:06.210
So let's calculate what the interest rate is we're going to use or discount rate or Waks same thing

81

00:04:06.710  -->  00:04:09.690
to take all of these future cash flows into today's terms.

82

00:04:09.690  -->  00:04:14.430
Remember that we will get the benefit of having that much cash today because of interest rates we have

83

00:04:14.430  -->  00:04:18.360
to discount it a bunch years to today and the same with this one this one.

84

00:04:18.900  -->  00:04:24.470
Let's calculate the whac Remember hit the shift button and hold it down the whole time and hit delete

85

00:04:24.480  -->  00:04:24.560
.

86

00:04:24.570  -->  00:04:26.300
Otherwise it's tricky to get those things off.

87

00:04:26.520  -->  00:04:33.450
OK so the cost of capital for us is going to be a function of well how much equity do we have how much

88

00:04:33.560  -->  00:04:34.920
that we have right.

89

00:04:35.070  -->  00:04:41.750
And then we'll get the percent of debt that we have in our capital structure times the costs of that

90

00:04:42.030  -->  00:04:46.280
plus the percent of equity we have in our capital structure has a cost equity.

91

00:04:46.280  -->  00:04:49.030
And that's our blended weighted average cost of capital.

92

00:04:49.320  -->  00:04:50.530
Okay cool.

93

00:04:50.550  -->  00:04:56.640
So the market cap today is 10000 just Except that that's a given the stock price today is eight fifty

94

00:04:56.700  -->  00:04:57.570
eight.

95

00:04:57.570  -->  00:05:02.330
It's just the market cap divided by the number of shares and you might say we said what if I change

96

00:05:02.340  -->  00:05:03.600
number of shares.

97

00:05:03.660  -->  00:05:07.190
Let's say we have a lot of cash on our balance sheet we're like heck what do we do that cashless buy

98

00:05:07.280  -->  00:05:08.160
some shares.

99

00:05:08.160  -->  00:05:10.110
What happens to the stock price today.

100

00:05:10.320  -->  00:05:10.930
So watch that.

101

00:05:10.990  -->  00:05:15.190
858 Let's see what happens when we go down here.

102

00:05:15.500  -->  00:05:24.570
It's I don't know let's just say I changed this to a thousand shares to let's be crazy and do it everywhere

103

00:05:24.570  -->  00:05:26.060
so we bought 1000.

104

00:05:26.100  -->  00:05:30.470
We bought back one thousand we bought back 165 shares.

105

00:05:30.820  -->  00:05:33.140
We'll see what happens to our price.

106

00:05:33.180  -->  00:05:35.420
Is it still eight sixty five or what it was.

107

00:05:35.420  -->  00:05:39.040
See here now it's 10 bucks.

108

00:05:39.070  -->  00:05:40.370
Is that cool.

109

00:05:41.060  -->  00:05:44.980
So if you buy back shares say company has excess cash right on the balance sheet.

110

00:05:44.980  -->  00:05:48.690
When we do that I don't know when or invest anymore.

111

00:05:48.770  -->  00:05:50.970
Preplan equip and we already have all the stuff we need.

112

00:05:51.350  -->  00:05:55.920
Heck we all own shares in the company and our investors would love us if we buy back shares.

113

00:05:56.060  -->  00:05:56.600
Right.

114

00:05:56.990  -->  00:06:04.430
Let's do it again let's say that we have a crazy amount of cash and we buy back a ton of shares and

115

00:06:04.430  -->  00:06:06.420
now we're actually at 500 shares.

116

00:06:06.440  -->  00:06:09.560
Wow buybacks just a ton to go here.

117

00:06:09.560  -->  00:06:10.220
Wow.

118

00:06:10.460  -->  00:06:11.780
That's right.

119

00:06:11.780  -->  00:06:15.260
We cut the number of shares in half from a thousand to 500.

120

00:06:15.260  -->  00:06:17.050
And of course the stock price doubles.

121

00:06:17.330  -->  00:06:20.560
And do you do again.

122

00:06:20.670  -->  00:06:24.110
There we go and when we're there you are back to normal.

123

00:06:24.550  -->  00:06:25.140
OK.

124

00:06:25.340  -->  00:06:26.630
So back to 858.

125

00:06:26.640  -->  00:06:30.570
And and that's where I mean just really play around this model a lot please because again I really want

126

00:06:30.580  -->  00:06:33.390
to understand how all this stuff works together.

127

00:06:33.500  -->  00:06:38.740
So most of our capital structure is equity only a little bit of debt right you know like.

128

00:06:38.750  -->  00:06:39.920
Well Chris how do you calculate that.

129

00:06:39.920  -->  00:06:45.270
Well the capital structure is a function of equity plus debt.

130

00:06:45.500  -->  00:06:45.740
Right.

131

00:06:45.740  -->  00:06:52.010
And so if we go here to our balance sheet right memory this is just a measure of what we have and who

132

00:06:52.010  -->  00:06:55.430
owns our stuff in and we just take a look here.

133

00:06:55.460  -->  00:06:58.120
I mean assuming that it makes it easier to read for all of us.

134

00:06:58.440  -->  00:06:59.200
Okay.

135

00:06:59.210  -->  00:07:02.450
So let's just pick a quarter here.

136

00:07:02.660  -->  00:07:06.810
So we have five bucks in short term debt and five bucks long term debt.

137

00:07:06.920  -->  00:07:07.710
Right.

138

00:07:07.790  -->  00:07:08.990
That's how much that we have.

139

00:07:09.380  -->  00:07:15.100
Right but remember capital structure is a function of that plus equity or liabilities puts equity.

140

00:07:15.110  -->  00:07:16.130
Same thing.

141

00:07:16.550  -->  00:07:18.940
So 5 plus 5 is our debt.

142

00:07:18.980  -->  00:07:20.260
And our equity is that.

143

00:07:20.270  -->  00:07:20.560
Okay.

144

00:07:20.570  -->  00:07:25.790
While we get that we have way more equity than we have that actually we have close to 90 percent of

145

00:07:25.790  -->  00:07:28.360
our entire capital structure is equity right.

146

00:07:28.370  -->  00:07:31.190
And about 2 percent or 1.7 to be exact.

147

00:07:31.190  -->  00:07:32.000
Is that right.

148

00:07:32.000  -->  00:07:34.330
This just five miles wide wide by that plus 10.

149

00:07:34.370  -->  00:07:34.970
Okay.

150

00:07:35.060  -->  00:07:36.530
So let's look at the math here.

151

00:07:36.530  -->  00:07:39.510
All right so it's the capital structure.

152

00:07:39.790  -->  00:07:40.910
So figure that out.

153

00:07:40.910  -->  00:07:46.790
Ignore this guy for now and this formula you see here is just equity which we talked about in the previous

154

00:07:46.790  -->  00:07:53.390
page which was over 500 bucks divided by short term that long term that plus equity and by the same

155

00:07:53.390  -->  00:07:55.420
token here or this guy for now.

156

00:07:55.440  -->  00:07:55.760
Right.

157

00:07:55.850  -->  00:07:59.020
Focus on the percent your balance sheet.

158

00:07:59.240  -->  00:08:03.200
What percent of your capital structure is debt and it's short term debt plus long term debt divided

159

00:08:03.200  -->  00:08:05.990
by 400 at post-launch or debt plus equity.

160

00:08:06.050  -->  00:08:06.360
Right.

161

00:08:06.380  -->  00:08:08.460
Which is about 2 percent.

162

00:08:09.020  -->  00:08:12.290
And again with all these numbers right now you have everything.

163

00:08:12.350  -->  00:08:12.770
OK.

164

00:08:12.950  -->  00:08:20.840
So we know the percent so the percent that's equity is about 98 percent and its debt is about 2 percent

165

00:08:20.850  -->  00:08:21.160
.

166

00:08:21.450  -->  00:08:21.710
OK.

167

00:08:21.740  -->  00:08:27.050
So we understand the process has the capital structure hey don't memorize this stuff please understand

168

00:08:27.050  -->  00:08:28.990
it remember learning to read financial statements.

169

00:08:29.010  -->  00:08:30.980
Good luck.

170

00:08:30.980  -->  00:08:32.570
All right so we take C40 one right.

171

00:08:32.570  -->  00:08:33.910
That's our cost of equity.

172

00:08:33.980  -->  00:08:34.570
Right.

173

00:08:34.850  -->  00:08:36.770
And then our costs of that's from below as well.

174

00:08:36.770  -->  00:08:38.530
So let's let's start with equity.

175

00:08:38.600  -->  00:08:38.750
Right.

176

00:08:38.750  -->  00:08:41.360
What does that cost of equity there.

177

00:08:41.720  -->  00:08:42.520
See 41.

178

00:08:42.530  -->  00:08:45.880
How do we calculate the cost of equity.

179

00:08:46.110  -->  00:08:46.410
OK.

180

00:08:46.430  -->  00:08:53.390
So what happens is the amount the cost of equity to us is simply a function of this.

181

00:08:53.420  -->  00:08:56.690
What's the lowest interest rate on the planet basically.

182

00:08:56.720  -->  00:08:56.940
Right.

183

00:08:56.970  -->  00:09:03.410
It's the government interest rate because the government is less likely to go belly up than my company

184

00:09:03.410  -->  00:09:04.240
here to.

185

00:09:04.400  -->  00:09:05.190
OK.

186

00:09:05.600  -->  00:09:05.840
All right.

187

00:09:05.840  -->  00:09:10.610
So if I have to calculate my cost of equity I'll start with the government rate which we call the risk

188

00:09:10.610  -->  00:09:16.390
free rate because it's almost risk free because if the government goes belly up then the new world.

189

00:09:16.490  -->  00:09:18.070
The last couple billion.

190

00:09:18.740  -->  00:09:25.730
And then we add back the additional stuff that's going to account for how much more risk there is to

191

00:09:25.730  -->  00:09:28.070
invest in US versus the government.

192

00:09:28.070  -->  00:09:28.250
Right.

193

00:09:28.250  -->  00:09:30.010
Or the lowest risk free rate.

194

00:09:30.380  -->  00:09:31.480
So how do we calculate that.

195

00:09:31.490  -->  00:09:32.710
Well all right.

196

00:09:32.720  -->  00:09:35.370
So are companies on the stock market.

197

00:09:35.510  -->  00:09:36.630
Right.

198

00:09:36.710  -->  00:09:44.660
And I guess that all companies in general if you just ignore beta for now all companies in general you

199

00:09:44.660  -->  00:09:49.550
take the stock market turn minus that risk free rate and that's I guess it's with a general return would

200

00:09:49.550  -->  00:09:50.770
be I guess.

201

00:09:50.840  -->  00:09:51.970
Right.

202

00:09:52.010  -->  00:09:52.490
All right.

203

00:09:52.610  -->  00:09:54.330
I don't understand this well.

204

00:09:54.640  -->  00:09:58.570
Our Ada we're more volatile than the government is right.

205

00:09:58.580  -->  00:10:02.070
So we should put in more risk for owning our stock.

206

00:10:02.450  -->  00:10:03.370
OK I get it.

207

00:10:03.530  -->  00:10:05.260
So Bayda is basically this.

208

00:10:05.280  -->  00:10:10.320
And we talked about this earlier the beta of the stock market is basically one.

209

00:10:10.430  -->  00:10:11.100
OK.

210

00:10:11.270  -->  00:10:14.260
It looks they know it's a nice healthy looking charge whatever.

211

00:10:14.360  -->  00:10:15.440
It's not that volatile.

212

00:10:15.470  -->  00:10:16.250
It's one.

213

00:10:16.310  -->  00:10:16.900
OK.

214

00:10:17.000  -->  00:10:21.200
And it just means the rise over the run or volatility.

215

00:10:21.410  -->  00:10:23.950
And let's not get involved with the calculus.

216

00:10:24.590  -->  00:10:28.930
And so the beat of our company because our company is riskier than the stock market index.

217

00:10:28.940  -->  00:10:34.820
It's riskier than the S&P 500 for example or the footsie or the DAX or whatever are the topics whatever

218

00:10:35.000  -->  00:10:36.740
indexes you cover.

219

00:10:37.200  -->  00:10:44.930
All right so our beta is too which means that our stock is 100 percent more volatile than the market

220

00:10:44.930  -->  00:10:45.110
.

221

00:10:45.110  -->  00:10:45.710
Right.

222

00:10:46.070  -->  00:10:49.060
And you can go to Yahoo Finance and get paid is for different companies too.

223

00:10:49.130  -->  00:10:49.790
Right.

224

00:10:50.220  -->  00:10:51.000
OK.

225

00:10:51.320  -->  00:10:58.450
So it is to great Amber assuming the average stock return is eight and a half percent over time just

226

00:10:58.450  -->  00:10:58.960
accept that.

227

00:10:58.960  -->  00:11:03.070
Don't worry about the logic there and then assume the risk free rate or the lowest rate out there is

228

00:11:03.120  -->  00:11:06.180
about 2 percent which is you know interest rate plus inflation.

229

00:11:06.200  -->  00:11:07.100
Just accept it.

230

00:11:07.270  -->  00:11:12.520
I've seen people use one at least three whatever interest rates will never be this low gain for the

231

00:11:12.520  -->  00:11:17.320
rest of our lives so many years from now when you're doing this exercise you know or create your own

232

00:11:17.320  -->  00:11:17.940
models.

233

00:11:18.040  -->  00:11:19.600
The mystery will be a lot higher.

234

00:11:19.900  -->  00:11:24.700
And by having interest rates really low what the government's basically saying is please invest in stuff

235

00:11:24.790  -->  00:11:26.780
you know invest in the stock market buy real estate.

236

00:11:26.830  -->  00:11:31.050
And that way the stock market is up a bunch because rates are low when rates are high.

237

00:11:31.060  -->  00:11:36.270
People say I'm not going to invest in the stock market I'm going to buy that and buy bonds.

238

00:11:36.630  -->  00:11:37.570
OK.

239

00:11:38.320  -->  00:11:40.520
So let's get into this.

240

00:11:40.720  -->  00:11:44.720
This is tricky will nym shift and then delete.

241

00:11:44.830  -->  00:11:45.820
I still get that.

242

00:11:45.820  -->  00:11:46.650
All right cool.

243

00:11:46.690  -->  00:11:53.190
So all we're doing here is the cost of equity is just the risk free rate right there.

244

00:11:53.350  -->  00:12:00.520
Plus the bad which is to right times whenever the stock market returns is going to be minus the risk

245

00:12:00.520  -->  00:12:01.680
free rate.

246

00:12:02.080  -->  00:12:06.280
And that is fourteen point five that's a high rate because we're a risky company.

247

00:12:06.280  -->  00:12:07.100
Check this out.

248

00:12:07.300  -->  00:12:10.780
Let's say that we were lower risk right lower risk company.

249

00:12:10.780  -->  00:12:15.880
So instead of being a Tesla for example which is a great growth stock we're now I don't know General

250

00:12:15.880  -->  00:12:21.490
Electric or Verizon where you know a higher interest or higher dividend yield company that's low risk

251

00:12:21.490  -->  00:12:21.760
.

252

00:12:21.760  -->  00:12:28.160
If we pretend our bid is one what happens is the rate that our rate goes from 14 percent down to eight

253

00:12:28.160  -->  00:12:29.200
and a half percent.

254

00:12:29.200  -->  00:12:29.770
Right.

255

00:12:29.770  -->  00:12:34.200
Risk has a lot to do with the rate you're supposed to pay right for equity.

256

00:12:34.210  -->  00:12:35.930
So watch this.

257

00:12:36.490  -->  00:12:43.120
If our target price just accept this for now get here a second is 22 bucks right.

258

00:12:43.120  -->  00:12:45.980
Watch what happens if I make it a one.

259

00:12:46.650  -->  00:12:47.140
OK.

260

00:12:47.320  -->  00:12:51.810
If the risk is lower to invest in our company watch your habits.

261

00:12:52.300  -->  00:12:55.100
Our target price goes up enormously.

262

00:12:55.120  -->  00:12:56.600
It's a big deal.

263

00:12:56.650  -->  00:12:57.400
It's a big deal.

264

00:12:57.430  -->  00:12:57.890
OK.

265

00:12:58.090  -->  00:13:02.710
Let's play the game let's say that we were half of all tell the market which almost never happens.

266

00:13:02.720  -->  00:13:06.280
Both you say that you're right that kills the low risk company.

267

00:13:06.280  -->  00:13:06.580
Right.

268

00:13:06.600  -->  00:13:13.330
Made Of One 90 buck target price and believable and then try here and you'll never see beta is higher

269

00:13:13.330  -->  00:13:15.090
let's say a Beta's for though right.

270

00:13:15.290  -->  00:13:17.700
Never seen that high to that.

271

00:13:17.710  -->  00:13:21.310
That means our stock is basically fully valued right now.

272

00:13:21.710  -->  00:13:22.280
OK.

273

00:13:22.400  -->  00:13:29.370
You know let's just stick with this 14 percent is the cost of equity right now.

274

00:13:29.880  -->  00:13:31.330
But Chris why is it lower here.

275

00:13:31.360  -->  00:13:37.080
Because 98 percent of our capital structure roughly is equity.

276

00:13:37.120  -->  00:13:43.270
So you take that times the percent of our capital structure equity and you get that.

277

00:13:43.510  -->  00:13:44.150
OK.

278

00:13:44.410  -->  00:13:45.750
We're to talk about that in a second.

279

00:13:46.000  -->  00:13:50.980
So just remember you know this guy for here for now think the percent of the capital structure it's

280

00:13:51.040  -->  00:13:53.990
that times whatever rate you come up with.

281

00:13:54.030  -->  00:13:54.610
OK.

282

00:13:54.820  -->  00:13:59.540
And we have a tiny tiny percent of our capital structure that's debt right.

283

00:13:59.560  -->  00:14:02.860
So let's go here.

284

00:14:03.160  -->  00:14:04.850
What is the cost of debt.

285

00:14:05.400  -->  00:14:08.630
This one.

286

00:14:08.900  -->  00:14:09.420
All right.

287

00:14:09.610  -->  00:14:19.760
So the cost of debt is basically a function of whatever the bank is going to charge you to get a loan

288

00:14:19.990  -->  00:14:23.240
OK times one minus the tax rate.

289

00:14:23.520  -->  00:14:27.170
And for simplicity let's just assume the tax rates 33 percent.

290

00:14:27.220  -->  00:14:27.900
Right.

291

00:14:28.260  -->  00:14:29.060
OK.

292

00:14:29.380  -->  00:14:34.630
So what happens are costs debts really not 5 percent it's 3.4 percent because the government says Hey

293

00:14:35.290  -->  00:14:36.820
let me give you a tax incentive.

294

00:14:36.880  -->  00:14:37.460
Right.

295

00:14:37.630  -->  00:14:40.060
Whatever interest you pay on debt you can deduct.

296

00:14:40.150  -->  00:14:40.560
Right.

297

00:14:40.570  -->  00:14:41.730
It's just meant.

298

00:14:41.890  -->  00:14:45.450
So let's say Here let's say Well we're a higher risk company.

299

00:14:45.460  -->  00:14:47.920
No one's going to give us a 5 percent.

300

00:14:47.920  -->  00:14:48.380
Right.

301

00:14:48.580  -->  00:14:49.750
Let's say that we're.

302

00:14:50.010  -->  00:14:55.570
Don't know we get like a junk bond rate that junk bond basically means a high rate right for a debt

303

00:14:55.570  -->  00:14:56.080
instrument.

304

00:14:56.080  -->  00:14:57.300
Right we're a high risk company.

305

00:14:57.310  -->  00:14:58.460
Let's say it's 20 percent.

306

00:14:58.490  -->  00:15:04.030
And dude I remember in the early 80s when my dad was paying a 20 percent mortgage on his house in Canada

307

00:15:04.150  -->  00:15:06.260
rates were high then that.

308

00:15:06.310  -->  00:15:13.540
So our cost of debt goes up a lot obviously because look at that our debt now is 20 percent that's just

309

00:15:13.540  -->  00:15:14.950
given us wherever the banks can lend you.

310

00:15:14.980  -->  00:15:15.820
Right.

311

00:15:15.820  -->  00:15:17.320
You're like why is that percent here.

312

00:15:17.380  -->  00:15:18.940
Well because the tax rate.

313

00:15:18.940  -->  00:15:23.770
So what if we took the tax rate and we made it say we're in an awful recession the government decides

314

00:15:23.870  -->  00:15:25.650
let's cut rates to 10 percent which should never happen.

315

00:15:25.660  -->  00:15:33.120
Whatever happens at our cost of debt goes to 18 percent.

316

00:15:33.130  -->  00:15:36.400
You like i understand why would he go up if rates are lower.

317

00:15:36.550  -->  00:15:36.990
Right.

318

00:15:37.180  -->  00:15:40.540
Well what happens is if tax rates are lower.

319

00:15:40.540  -->  00:15:41.940
And you can't deduct as much.

320

00:15:42.010  -->  00:15:46.230
I know it's a weird complex relationship but let's go back here to five.

321

00:15:46.320  -->  00:15:46.520
Right.

322

00:15:46.530  -->  00:15:51.910
So 3.4 percent is what it's going to cost us for debt.

323

00:15:52.690  -->  00:15:57.100
So let's go here and you're like Well Chris I thought was three point four percent down here.

324

00:15:57.100  -->  00:15:57.940
What happened.

325

00:15:58.300  -->  00:16:02.760
Well it's 3.4 percent times the percent of our capital structure which is debt.

326

00:16:02.770  -->  00:16:07.630
Remember when you have like five bucks a short term debt and five bucks long term debt which is 10 divided

327

00:16:07.630  -->  00:16:08.860
by the total capital structure.

328

00:16:08.860  -->  00:16:14.530
So we've got like 1.7 or about 2 percent or so of our capital structure in debt.

329

00:16:14.590  -->  00:16:23.260
So you take 2 percent or 1.7 whatever it is times that and are actually the cost here blended with our

330

00:16:23.260  -->  00:16:28.830
capital structure is only you know point 0 5 7 3 percent some three point four.

331

00:16:29.080  -->  00:16:29.680
All right good.

332

00:16:29.830  -->  00:16:34.030
So now we've got the blended cost of capital for us.

333

00:16:34.090  -->  00:16:39.350
Our interest rate for our company or discount rate or Waks same thing average cost capital right as

334

00:16:39.420  -->  00:16:47.480
a capital we have of it and we've got fourteen point three one is our cost of capital.

335

00:16:47.770  -->  00:16:48.200
Okay.

336

00:16:48.250  -->  00:16:49.950
So we understand how we got our interest rate.

337

00:16:50.050  -->  00:16:55.330
And the reason we have this interest rate is because you can't just add up all these cash flows.

338

00:16:55.330  -->  00:16:59.950
It's not fair that we get that amount today factored into our valuation.

339

00:17:00.250  -->  00:17:02.690
Right we got to discount that over a number of years.

340

00:17:02.690  -->  00:17:03.480
Right.

341

00:17:03.550  -->  00:17:06.090
So what do we discount that well we just calculate the whac.

342

00:17:06.100  -->  00:17:06.500
Right.

343

00:17:06.520  -->  00:17:08.160
The discount rate.

344

00:17:08.160  -->  00:17:10.600
All right let's go through this.

345

00:17:10.870  -->  00:17:11.940
All right cool.

346

00:17:11.980  -->  00:17:21.700
Now the way to discount all of these cash flows right after this cat this once misleader is to use net

347

00:17:21.700  -->  00:17:25.620
present value or discounted cash flow analysis.

348

00:17:25.710  -->  00:17:29.360
Cool so we've got a weighted average cost of capital it's fourteen point three.

349

00:17:29.380  -->  00:17:38.260
So let's figure out what these guys here are valued today because again you can't get that money today

350

00:17:38.260  -->  00:17:38.390
.

351

00:17:38.500  -->  00:17:38.800
Right.

352

00:17:38.800  -->  00:17:42.940
Not fair you can't say well are going to make that money so I shove it today and that's my valuation

353

00:17:43.170  -->  00:17:46.150
so because of the interest rates have to deduct it over time.

354

00:17:46.150  -->  00:17:46.990
Right.

355

00:17:46.990  -->  00:17:49.490
So basically the present value that I should say.

356

00:17:49.630  -->  00:17:50.130
Right.

357

00:17:50.320  -->  00:17:51.630
Let's do that.

358

00:17:52.100  -->  00:17:54.440
So let's click here.

359

00:17:54.690  -->  00:18:00.480
We you get at shift shift click take my finger off shift the elites got a haircut.

360

00:18:00.670  -->  00:18:05.320
So what is the net present value of all those cash flows today.

361

00:18:05.320  -->  00:18:06.430
Well watch this.

362

00:18:06.430  -->  00:18:13.180
If I just add up all these cash flows here righteous mouseover the value is nine thousand one hundred

363

00:18:13.180  -->  00:18:13.960
eighty one.

364

00:18:13.960  -->  00:18:14.440
Right.

365

00:18:14.500  -->  00:18:15.830
That's about you.

366

00:18:15.900  -->  00:18:21.350
And so you can't take the value because we got a whack and interest rate of the debt amount. Alright

367

00:18:22.130  -->  00:18:22.460
.

368

00:18:22.510  -->  00:18:23.700
So let's do that.

369

00:18:23.700  -->  00:18:24.800
So watch this.

370

00:18:24.940  -->  00:18:28.770
If I were to this is just not present by which is the rate and then all the cash flows.

371

00:18:28.770  -->  00:18:29.500
I love Excel.

372

00:18:29.520  -->  00:18:33.700
Basically you're overstating that stuff just click here and Excel will kind of explain it to you and

373

00:18:34.000  -->  00:18:36.280
if this is kind of boring to me whatever.

374

00:18:36.280  -->  00:18:39.240
Just go to YouTube and do a search on MPB Excel.

375

00:18:39.750  -->  00:18:40.060
All right.

376

00:18:40.130  -->  00:18:41.490
So sounds awesome.

377

00:18:41.490  -->  00:18:43.430
So you type in the formula and all the stuff drops down.

378

00:18:43.510  -->  00:18:45.190
So watch this.

379

00:18:45.200  -->  00:18:50.230
Hit it from scratch and leave it equals and the fee it's in the game.

380

00:18:50.650  -->  00:18:52.540
OK open brackets.

381

00:18:52.540  -->  00:18:54.690
And then it tells you get the rate you like what's read.

382

00:18:54.740  -->  00:18:59.050
You can click they're supposed to tell you what it is or a definition what you do is you go up here

383

00:18:59.050  -->  00:19:03.070
you know like OK my rate was this right.

384

00:19:03.220  -->  00:19:04.870
And then it's telling you put a comma.

385

00:19:05.010  -->  00:19:14.200
So either you like helping at them and saying OK go get the values of those cash flows OK go here and

386

00:19:14.200  -->  00:19:18.220
you highlight the mall boom done.

387

00:19:18.430  -->  00:19:23.200
So those free cash flow numbers are worth that much today.

388

00:19:23.740  -->  00:19:27.670
Using the rates you DoubleClick it and excels awesome . See its Color coded very cool
