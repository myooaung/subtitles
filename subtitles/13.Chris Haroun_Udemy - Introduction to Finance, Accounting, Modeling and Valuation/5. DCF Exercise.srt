1

00:00:00,450  -->  00:00:05,250
Next step we have the discounted cash flow exercise I'll go through the instructions quickly and then

2

00:00:05,250  -->  00:00:06,540
please do the exercise.

3

00:00:06,720  -->  00:00:10,160
And after you've completed the exercise please watch the next two lectures.

4

00:00:10,170  -->  00:00:16,080
After the exercise because I'll go into a lot of detail on not just the answers from the exercise but

5

00:00:16,350  -->  00:00:23,400
also a different way to look at relationships between some of the cells and just a better way to understand

6

00:00:23,400  -->  00:00:24,460
financial modeling.

7

00:00:24,600  -->  00:00:31,080
If you have trouble understanding the DCF please make sure that you've watched DCF lectures before this

8

00:00:31,080  -->  00:00:32,030
current session.

9

00:00:32,110  -->  00:00:35,270
OK so in this exercise we'll do step one.

10

00:00:35,280  -->  00:00:38,030
It's optional is read this.

11

00:00:38,070  -->  00:00:38,910
Step one is optional.

12

00:00:38,910  -->  00:00:44,640
Read through the modeling evaluation best practices which I've covered in this course and then step

13

00:00:44,640  -->  00:00:52,890
two what you'll do is you'll go on to the DCF tab here and there's a number of different boxes like

14

00:00:52,890  -->  00:00:58,700
this one can and come up with the answer first and then take the box off to look at the answer.

15

00:00:58,710  -->  00:01:05,520
And the best way to take the box off is to keep your finger on shift keep holding then shift click the

16

00:01:05,520  -->  00:01:11,380
box take your finger off shift and then delete OK that's how it works.

17

00:01:11,430  -->  00:01:13,060
That's a cat.

18

00:01:13,710  -->  00:01:18,960
All right so what you do is you click on the DCF tab and just go through these and complete them from

19

00:01:18,960  -->  00:01:26,940
top to bottom and you can you can move the boxes over by either clicking shift and drag and drop or

20

00:01:26,940  -->  00:01:31,800
you can just delete them by clicking on shift click that take your finger off shift and then hit the

21

00:01:31,800  -->  00:01:32,690
delete key.

22

00:01:32,760  -->  00:01:33,450
OK.

23

00:01:33,780  -->  00:01:38,820
And then again when you're done with this please come back to me for the answers and if you want I strongly

24

00:01:38,820  -->  00:01:45,150
encourage this please go through the other tabs as well and delete certain cells or change things around

25

00:01:45,150  -->  00:01:48,920
to see how your DCF valuation metrics change.

26

00:01:48,970  -->  00:01:54,450
Ok really play around with these because the best way to understand and master financial modeling is

27

00:01:54,450  -->  00:01:56,780
to mess around with a model like this one.

28

00:01:56,920  -->  00:01:57,300
A fun
