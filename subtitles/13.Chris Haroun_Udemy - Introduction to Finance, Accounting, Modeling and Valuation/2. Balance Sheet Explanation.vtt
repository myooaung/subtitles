00:00:00.810  -->  00:00:03.060
Let's discuss a balance sheet in more detail.

2

00:00:03.060  -->  00:00:06.860
Remember a balance has to balance to scale.

3

00:00:07.260  -->  00:00:13.200
All right so a balance sheet will tell you what stuff do I have and do I own it or do other people.

4

00:00:13.310  -->  00:00:13.940
OK.

5

00:00:14.190  -->  00:00:21.180
And so everything in this world is owned by you somebody else a bank or a company or government.

6

00:00:21.210  -->  00:00:22.020
Right.

7

00:00:22.020  -->  00:00:23.660
So let's go through this.

8

00:00:23.700  -->  00:00:31.270
So the stuff that you have is money a factor and a car in terms of who owns that stuff.

9

00:00:31.290  -->  00:00:37.350
It's either the bank right that rich dude smoking whatever is he's smoking.

10

00:00:37.680  -->  00:00:40.620
And then you OK and you're also that gold person there.

11

00:00:40.820  -->  00:00:42.090
So make more sense than saying.

12

00:00:42.510  -->  00:00:43.150
All right so.

13

00:00:43.310  -->  00:00:49.520
So if I have who owns cat and the stuff you have is called assets.

14

00:00:49.590  -->  00:00:50.860
Those are your assets.

15

00:00:52.170  -->  00:00:54.630
In Who owns those assets.

16

00:00:55.050  -->  00:00:58.050
That's called liabilities and equity.

17

00:00:58.050  -->  00:00:58.880
OK.

18

00:00:59.630  -->  00:01:09.330
And so assets is against stuff you own liabilities is a bank that owns your stuff and an equity is people

19

00:01:09.570  -->  00:01:11.220
that own your stuff including yourself.

20

00:01:11.300  -->  00:01:12.200
OK.

21

00:01:12.490  -->  00:01:16.710
And so assets has equal liabilities plus equity.

22

00:01:16.710  -->  00:01:19.410
And so I'll give you example that car there.

23

00:01:19.440  -->  00:01:20.750
Let's pretend it's a Toyota car.

24

00:01:20.950  -->  00:01:21.220
OK.

25

00:01:21.240  -->  00:01:22.010
You own it.

26

00:01:22.140  -->  00:01:22.590
Right.

27

00:01:22.650  -->  00:01:25.430
Well you finance actually writes you own part of it.

28

00:01:25.980  -->  00:01:34.160
So that car is equal to the amount you own of it plus the amount the bank of Toyota is facing you.

29

00:01:34.560  -->  00:01:38.660
Same thing could go for a house that factory pretends the house you own that house.

30

00:01:38.760  -->  00:01:39.400
Right.

31

00:01:39.420  -->  00:01:42.450
It's owned by Wells Fargo partially right.

32

00:01:42.450  -->  00:01:43.830
Big mortgage company for example.

33

00:01:44.100  -->  00:01:45.210
And you.

34

00:01:45.360  -->  00:01:53.190
And so everything that's an asset has to balance with a liability or an equity position in that asset

35

00:01:53.190  -->  00:01:53.480
.

36

00:01:53.490  -->  00:01:59.550
And so the scale has to always bounce and and a balance sheet is a snapshot in time.

37

00:01:59.560  -->  00:02:03.900
And Kate just tells you what do you own or what do you know at this moment.
