00:00:01.200  -->  00:00:05.460
I'm going to teach you accounting and finance in a way that you've never been taught before.

2

00:00:05.490  -->  00:00:07.110
I'm going to teach accounting and finance.

3

00:00:07.140  -->  00:00:13.320
Assuming you have no or very little background or experience in finance and accounting I'm a firm believer

4

00:00:13.380  -->  00:00:16.500
in edutainment meaning education and entertainment.

5

00:00:16.500  -->  00:00:18.240
We have to enjoy the process.

6

00:00:18.420  -->  00:00:23.130
And so I really want to inspire you and teach you to enjoy accounting and finance.

7

00:00:23.190  -->  00:00:25.220
Like a good book.

8

00:00:25.260  -->  00:00:30.210
So this is how I teach accounting and finance at the business schools I teach at nights and I'm humbled

9

00:00:30.210  -->  00:00:35.280
to say that's from the feedback you can find online by searching my name or through LinkedIn for my

10

00:00:35.280  -->  00:00:37.930
students that the feedback is fantastic.

11

00:00:37.950  -->  00:00:43.560
When I teach in these courses and they really enjoy complex classes like finance and accounting and

12

00:00:43.560  -->  00:00:46.570
they learn a lot and they have fun doing it as well.

13

00:00:46.570  -->  00:00:52.410
And so I'm going to take several semesters of university taught accounting classes by his classes valuation

14

00:00:52.410  -->  00:00:57.760
classes and modeling classes and fit them into this simple four to five hour course.

15

00:00:57.780  -->  00:01:01.690
So here's the roadmap of what we're going to cover.

16

00:01:01.740  -->  00:01:06.140
Accounting is really all about what has already happened in the past.

17

00:01:06.200  -->  00:01:06.800
OK.

18

00:01:06.890  -->  00:01:13.200
And it's more of a science meaning you have to be precise and record exactly what occurred now.

19

00:01:13.250  -->  00:01:15.470
Finance is a little bit different.

20

00:01:15.480  -->  00:01:21.060
Finance is more of an art as you're kind of creating and predicting the future through financial projections

21

00:01:21.080  -->  00:01:21.110
.

22

00:01:21.120  -->  00:01:26.440
OK so it's really subject to interpretations and it's based upon your assumptions which I'll teach Ewan's

23

00:01:26.490  -->  00:01:27.630
course.

24

00:01:27.720  -->  00:01:32.820
So the whole point is to really understand how to value and come up with target price for companies

25

00:01:33.120  -->  00:01:34.780
using accounting and finance.

26

00:01:34.860  -->  00:01:37.870
And I actually really enjoyed the process as well.

27

00:01:37.950  -->  00:01:43.440
So we're going to go through from an accounting perspective what an income statement is from scratch

28

00:01:43.450  -->  00:01:43.530
.

29

00:01:43.580  -->  00:01:43.960
OK.

30

00:01:43.980  -->  00:01:46.550
I'm assume you have no background on this topic.

31

00:01:46.620  -->  00:01:48.340
We'll do the same for the balance sheet.

32

00:01:48.420  -->  00:01:53.880
And then the cash flow statement and then we're going to project the future really goes through many

33

00:01:53.880  -->  00:01:58.680
online free resources to help us put together our financial forecasts.

34

00:01:58.680  -->  00:02:03.210
Okay we're going to model financials and predict the future and the stuff that I want you to use and

35

00:02:03.210  -->  00:02:05.650
I'll show you how to use for free online.

36

00:02:05.790  -->  00:02:11.670
Is this stuff I used to pay thousands of dollars for every single month at my hedge fund or when I worked

37

00:02:11.670  -->  00:02:16.230
at Goldman Sachs or when I work currently in the venture capital sector I'm going to give this all to

38

00:02:16.230  -->  00:02:17.110
you for free.

39

00:02:17.130  -->  00:02:20.720
I want to show you where to get online and how to use it.

40

00:02:20.830  -->  00:02:26.430
And so we're going to also assess the financial statements of a company and look at how healthy the

41

00:02:26.430  -->  00:02:27.360
company is.

42

00:02:27.510  -->  00:02:29.370
You know do they need a check up and they need help.

43

00:02:29.370  -->  00:02:31.280
Or not just by looking at the financials.

44

00:02:31.310  -->  00:02:32.230
So a lot of fun.

45

00:02:32.460  -->  00:02:37.200
And again you don't have to have any experience in finance and accounting to take this course and enjoy

46

00:02:37.200  -->  00:02:39.580
the process of learning about this.

47

00:02:39.600  -->  00:02:46.020
OK so we're going to start with accounting in sections 2 to 4 and this course and then we'll move on

48

00:02:46.020  -->  00:02:53.970
to finance and modelling in sections 5 to 8 and then we're going to cover many different valuation methodologies

49

00:02:54.120  -->  00:02:59.400
to come up with the appropriate target price for the companies we're analyzed in section sign to 14

50

00:02:59.400  -->  00:02:59.980
.

51

00:03:00.240  -->  00:03:04.740
And then what we'll do is we'll learn how to use many different cool accounting and finance formulas

52

00:03:04.980  -->  00:03:07.830
to really assess the health of a company.

53

00:03:07.890  -->  00:03:12.780
So I'm really passionate about the way I teach and I know you're not understand and enjoy finance and

54

00:03:12.780  -->  00:03:14.900
accounting after you finished taking this course.

55

00:03:14.940  -->  00:03:19.890
Or else please receive a 100 percent refund which of course is the case with all of my courses.

56

00:03:20.310  -->  00:03:25.380
So this is the way I really wish finances accounting and valuation modeling was taught to me when I

57

00:03:25.380  -->  00:03:26.880
was in university.

58

00:03:27.180  -->  00:03:33.990
So there's can be many different Excel exercises in this course and we're really enjoy a more visualized

59

00:03:34.050  -->  00:03:40.930
approach to learning accounting finance modeling valuation and understanding financial statements.

60

00:03:41.010  -->  00:03:41.410
Thanks
