1

00:00:00,990  -->  00:00:04,750
Why does net income not equal the increase in cash.

2

00:00:05,130  -->  00:00:11,820
If we look at the income statement that we did two sessions ago we had 375 thousand seven hundred fifty

3

00:00:11,820  -->  00:00:14,160
dollars in net income.

4

00:00:14,160  -->  00:00:21,360
And if we look at the balance sheet that we did last exercise the increasing cash from 2014 is 2015

5

00:00:21,390  -->  00:00:23,270
is $200000.

6

00:00:23,850  -->  00:00:26,300
So why the difference.

7

00:00:26,670  -->  00:00:30,420
What explains the increase in cash by $200000.

8

00:00:30,720  -->  00:00:35,460
Well we need to have another statement to help us with this and that statement is called the cash flow

9

00:00:35,460  -->  00:00:38,440
state.

10

00:00:38,490  -->  00:00:43,980
So what we're going to do is we're going to look at the actual income statement and balance sheet examples

11

00:00:44,400  -->  00:00:49,140
from the previous two sections and then we're going to create a cash flow statement right now from scratch

12

00:00:49,710  -->  00:00:54,450
before we do that though let's just take a quick look at the three sections of a cash flow statement

13

00:00:54,450  -->  00:00:55,350
.

14

00:00:55,350  -->  00:00:59,660
So the cash flow statement is made up of three items as false.

15

00:00:59,700  -->  00:01:06,330
Number one cash flow from operations and this basically means stuff that has a duration of under one

16

00:01:06,330  -->  00:01:11,940
year meaning stuff from the income statement and the balance sheets current assets and current liability

17

00:01:11,940  -->  00:01:13,680
sections except for debt.

18

00:01:14,040  -->  00:01:19,740
And I know that sounds like a lot but basically we're just going to look at the cash flow from operating

19

00:01:19,740  -->  00:01:21,590
our business for less than a year.

20

00:01:21,740  -->  00:01:26,200
Okay so the income statement is always for a period of a year or less.

21

00:01:26,720  -->  00:01:31,410
And if you look at the current assets and current liabilities on a balance sheet for the most part those

22

00:01:31,410  -->  00:01:34,470
items all have a duration of less than one year.

23

00:01:34,470  -->  00:01:36,450
Okay that's the first part of the cash flow statement.

24

00:01:36,450  -->  00:01:37,730
Cash flow from operations.

25

00:01:37,770  -->  00:01:42,990
Remember what we're trying to do here is to try to reconcile the difference between net income from

26

00:01:42,990  -->  00:01:47,050
the income statement and the changing cash from the cash flow statement.

27

00:01:47,670  -->  00:01:48,290
Okay.

28

00:01:48,360  -->  00:01:55,110
Now we do is we add cash flow from investing and basically you go to long term assets and if we spent

29

00:01:55,110  -->  00:01:59,640
money investing in stuff like machines or land then we're going to deduct that from our cash flow statement

30

00:01:59,660  -->  00:01:59,720
.

31

00:01:59,760  -->  00:02:02,840
So think of this always as cash in your pocket or cash out your pocket.

32

00:02:02,860  -->  00:02:05,770
And remember a while ago I said that the income statement is a lie.

33

00:02:06,030  -->  00:02:10,440
Well I was half joking because income statement does not tell you the increase in cash.

34

00:02:10,980  -->  00:02:15,300
And neither is a balance sheet the balance sheet will tell you the change from one year to the next

35

00:02:15,390  -->  00:02:19,170
in the cash balance but it will explain how to get that increase in cash.

36

00:02:19,260  -->  00:02:20,820
And that's why we're doing this exercise.

37

00:02:20,820  -->  00:02:23,090
That's why we're creating this cash flow statement.

38

00:02:23,370  -->  00:02:29,260
And the third part is Castro from financing from debt or changes in common stock.

39

00:02:29,310  -->  00:02:29,610
OK.

40

00:02:29,620  -->  00:02:34,070
And let's look at the previous two financial statements the income statement and the balance sheet and

41

00:02:34,070  -->  00:02:36,580
let's create a cash flow say from scratch.

42

00:02:37,110  -->  00:02:42,920
OK let's kick it off with cash flow from operations.

43

00:02:43,440  -->  00:02:49,860
What we do is we always get net income right because what we're trying to do is we're trying to say

44

00:02:50,040  -->  00:02:55,660
why the income statement is not a good representative of the increase in cash that we have.

45

00:02:56,010  -->  00:02:56,250
Okay.

46

00:02:56,250  -->  00:03:04,530
So we we get net income and then what we do is we add back the non-cash items from the income statement

47

00:03:04,530  -->  00:03:04,660
.

48

00:03:04,680  -->  00:03:11,900
So take a look there on the right and tell me what is not cash depreciation and amortization.

49

00:03:12,240  -->  00:03:15,440
Okay those are non cash expenses.

50

00:03:15,440  -->  00:03:19,830
All right so it's not fair it's not a benefit that we get per an increase in cash.

51

00:03:19,950  -->  00:03:22,730
It just decreases our taxable base.

52

00:03:23,000  -->  00:03:23,310
Okay.

53

00:03:23,310  -->  00:03:28,170
So we added that back in then what we do.

54

00:03:28,170  -->  00:03:31,320
Step three Remember we're just looking at stuff that's less than a year.

55

00:03:31,670  -->  00:03:36,120
We go the balance sheets current assets and current liabilities section and we get that on cash items

56

00:03:36,130  -->  00:03:36,220
.

57

00:03:36,300  -->  00:03:37,480
So let's do that.

58

00:03:37,640  -->  00:03:38,500
OK.

59

00:03:38,580  -->  00:03:43,440
So we've got accounts receivable So check it out there on the right accounts receivable increased by

60

00:03:43,440  -->  00:03:44,640
$50000.

61

00:03:44,640  -->  00:03:45,190
Right.

62

00:03:45,510  -->  00:03:49,280
And that means that somebody owes us 50 grand.

63

00:03:49,290  -->  00:03:50,430
From a sale we made.

64

00:03:50,760  -->  00:03:54,960
But we should not have gotten the benefit of getting that 50 in our pocket because we haven't received

65

00:03:54,960  -->  00:03:56,310
that cash yet.

66

00:03:56,610  -->  00:03:58,120
By the same talk with inventory.

67

00:03:58,170  -->  00:04:03,900
We spent an extra 25 grand on it Sasha come out of our pocket and then look down there on the liability

68

00:04:03,900  -->  00:04:07,940
section of the balance sheet accounts payable went up $5000.

69

00:04:08,100  -->  00:04:13,910
And that means that we have five grand more in our pocket because we haven't paid that amount yet.

70

00:04:14,040  -->  00:04:15,280
So let's add this now.

71

00:04:15,630  -->  00:04:16,360
OK.

72

00:04:16,740  -->  00:04:21,430
So what we get is we deduct those first two items because that's cash out of our pocket.

73

00:04:21,810  -->  00:04:25,500
And then we add accounts payable because it's cash in our pocket.

74

00:04:25,710  -->  00:04:28,730
And then what we get is cash flow from operations.

75

00:04:28,740  -->  00:04:28,940
Okay.

76

00:04:28,950  -->  00:04:30,960
So we're done with one third now.

77

00:04:31,170  -->  00:04:32,790
The cash flow statement.

78

00:04:32,860  -->  00:04:36,600
I really tried to understand why this is the case don't just memorize this.

79

00:04:36,600  -->  00:04:41,280
Please try to look through the financial statements and understand why this exists.

80

00:04:41,280  -->  00:04:43,740
Why is it 310000 1750.

81

00:04:43,800  -->  00:04:45,570
What is the purpose of this financial statement.

82

00:04:45,570  -->  00:04:50,220
So if you understand finance and accounting statements then you'll remember them don't memorize them

83

00:04:50,220  -->  00:04:51,110
please.

84

00:04:51,120  -->  00:04:51,630
OK.

85

00:04:51,870  -->  00:04:55,030
Now we move on to Step Two of the cash flow statement.

86

00:04:55,290  -->  00:04:55,530
Right.

87

00:04:55,530  -->  00:04:57,250
So we like cash flow from investing.

88

00:04:57,270  -->  00:05:01,320
We invested in stuff like we bought machines or land that's cash out of our pocket.

89

00:05:01,680  -->  00:05:02,530
So let's check it out.

90

00:05:02,760  -->  00:05:06,190
So of course we get this from the balance sheet.

91

00:05:06,250  -->  00:05:08,030
Let's do this.

92

00:05:08,040  -->  00:05:09,700
So there we go we've got land.

93

00:05:09,750  -->  00:05:15,240
We spent 10 grand more in the past year on land and 50 grand more on the machine.

94

00:05:15,960  -->  00:05:18,320
And so that becomes 60 grand.

95

00:05:18,330  -->  00:05:19,350
OK good.

96

00:05:19,530  -->  00:05:21,930
So we're getting there.

97

00:05:21,960  -->  00:05:23,500
We're two thirds of the way there now.

98

00:05:23,580  -->  00:05:28,470
So we've got one more thing to do in the cash flow statement which is cash flow from financing meaning

99

00:05:28,710  -->  00:05:32,340
if we got a loan or we had a change in common stock.

100

00:05:32,340  -->  00:05:33,760
All right let's check this out.

101

00:05:34,210  -->  00:05:39,330
So we get this from the liabilities and equity section we can see that short term debt went down.

102

00:05:39,330  -->  00:05:40,670
That's a good thing we paid off debt.

103

00:05:40,680  -->  00:05:41,680
But you know what.

104

00:05:41,790  -->  00:05:45,520
That's 10000 and bucks out of our pocket because we paid it back.

105

00:05:46,080  -->  00:05:48,100
Long term debt went down by a hundred grand.

106

00:05:48,100  -->  00:05:54,000
Again it's good we're paying off debt but that's 100 grand out of our pocket and we issued $60000 worth

107

00:05:54,060  -->  00:05:58,760
in new common shares let's just add all of that stuff up right now.

108

00:05:58,770  -->  00:06:07,230
And so for cash flow from financing taking into account all of that that's minus 50000 750 out of our

109

00:06:07,230  -->  00:06:09,430
pocket most of that came from long term debt.

110

00:06:09,720  -->  00:06:10,570
Ok cool.

111

00:06:10,580  -->  00:06:14,460
Now let's add these three items together and what do we get.

112

00:06:14,460  -->  00:06:15,640
There you go.

113

00:06:15,660  -->  00:06:19,100
That explains a $200000 increase in the cash balance.

114

00:06:19,170  -->  00:06:26,660
That explains the increase in the $200000 in our cash balance from 2014 to 2015 and cash.

115

00:06:27,090  -->  00:06:29,820
And I'll show you what that looks like on the balance sheet.

116

00:06:30,150  -->  00:06:30,360
Right.

117

00:06:30,360  -->  00:06:32,020
So there you go.

118

00:06:32,420  -->  00:06:33,410
200000.

119

00:06:33,420  -->  00:06:34,820
That explains the difference.
