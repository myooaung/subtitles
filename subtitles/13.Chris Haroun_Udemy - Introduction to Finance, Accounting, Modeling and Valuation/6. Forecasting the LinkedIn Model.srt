1

00:00:01,220  -->  00:00:02,910
All right this is the fun part.

2

00:00:02,910  -->  00:00:05,620
This is where we get to forecast the future.

3

00:00:05,790  -->  00:00:13,090
OK let's let's do this and just you know when you do this it's often more of an art than a science.

4

00:00:13,130  -->  00:00:13,810
OK.

5

00:00:13,920  -->  00:00:16,550
It's more of an art than a science.

6

00:00:16,920  -->  00:00:22,890
You need to accept the fact that your estimates will be off but you just need to look at historical

7

00:00:22,890  -->  00:00:27,600
trends and do the best you can in terms of projecting what the future might look like.

8

00:00:27,600  -->  00:00:27,890
OK.

9

00:00:27,900  -->  00:00:30,070
So e means expected.

10

00:00:30,660  -->  00:00:37,050
What we're going to do is we're only in a forecast quarterly numbers for this year and can't and then

11

00:00:37,050  -->  00:00:44,080
we'll do is going forward for 2017 18 19 20 We're going to do those on an annual basis.

12

00:00:44,100  -->  00:00:45,780
It's just much easier that way.

13

00:00:45,910  -->  00:00:46,700
OK.

14

00:00:46,920  -->  00:00:51,300
So let's kick it off by forecasting on a quarterly basis.

15

00:00:51,300  -->  00:00:51,990
Okay.

16

00:00:51,990  -->  00:00:57,580
So remember the conventions the convention is that blue means hard coded.

17

00:00:57,690  -->  00:00:58,310
Okay.

18

00:00:58,500  -->  00:01:00,150
And then green is from another tab.

19

00:01:00,180  -->  00:01:08,770
OK so let's let's kick it off by forecasting the revenue line items for for.

20

00:01:08,790  -->  00:01:11,230
We'll kick it off with talent solutions.

21

00:01:11,470  -->  00:01:11,790
Okay.

22

00:01:11,790  -->  00:01:16,350
So this here is blue and I'm going to show you how easy this is.

23

00:01:16,350  -->  00:01:16,620
Right.

24

00:01:16,620  -->  00:01:21,960
And again it's it's more of an art than a science and you will never be 100 percent right.

25

00:01:21,960  -->  00:01:26,700
Nobody is nobody can predict the future and it comes to so many independent variables even the company

26

00:01:26,700  -->  00:01:27,870
itself.

27

00:01:27,870  -->  00:01:33,930
OK so let's go over here and I'm going to forecast these quarters here.

28

00:01:33,960  -->  00:01:35,950
I've already done this.

29

00:01:36,090  -->  00:01:37,860
And so what I'll show you is how I did it.

30

00:01:37,860  -->  00:01:45,180
So you can see that the year over year customer numbers has been decreasing steadily over time from

31

00:01:45,180  -->  00:01:47,820
35 to 34 30 to 30.

32

00:01:47,820  -->  00:01:48,000
Right.

33

00:01:48,000  -->  00:01:49,500
That's the average for the year.

34

00:01:49,800  -->  00:01:56,760
And so it's come down by 2 percent there you know 2 percent there so so let's just continue that trend

35

00:01:56,770  -->  00:01:56,960
.

36

00:01:57,130  -->  00:01:57,840
Okay.

37

00:01:58,200  -->  00:01:59,530
So make it 28 here.

38

00:01:59,550  -->  00:01:59,790
Right.

39

00:01:59,790  -->  00:02:00,600
That's hardcoded.

40

00:02:00,600  -->  00:02:04,350
So if I delete it kind of messes up the numbers there you know everything is fed off of that.

41

00:02:04,400  -->  00:02:05,150
Okay.

42

00:02:05,640  -->  00:02:09,450
And then what we'll do is we'll make its 2 percent less here.

43

00:02:09,480  -->  00:02:09,760
Right.

44

00:02:09,750  -->  00:02:13,860
We're keep up with 2 percent less here and 2 percent less there.

45

00:02:13,950  -->  00:02:14,650
Right.

46

00:02:14,700  -->  00:02:16,140
Makes sense.

47

00:02:16,520  -->  00:02:23,330
And so for the year we're at twenty four point eight percent and going forward for future years.

48

00:02:23,400  -->  00:02:30,750
Deduct 2 percent or so or 1 percent will assume that the slowing of growth will slow down to 20 percent

49

00:02:30,750  -->  00:02:36,180
year over year growth here which is how it works and memory I showed you a couple of graphs of the beginning

50

00:02:36,180  -->  00:02:43,350
their growth is slowing and we're not assuming they're going to make any acquisitions here it's too

51

00:02:43,350  -->  00:02:46,030
hard to incorporate that stuff into our models.

52

00:02:46,440  -->  00:02:48,740
Okay let's look at revenue per customer.

53

00:02:48,870  -->  00:02:49,170
Okay.

54

00:02:49,170  -->  00:02:52,570
So revenue per customer is all over the place.

55

00:02:52,590  -->  00:03:00,780
It is impossible to model in so you see here revenue per customer was down 1 percent year over year

56

00:03:00,790  -->  00:03:00,820
.

57

00:03:00,840  -->  00:03:02,070
Right.

58

00:03:02,070  -->  00:03:06,170
Then it was up 1/2 percent here then it was up 1 that it was up 11.

59

00:03:06,460  -->  00:03:12,510
And so for the year it averaged 2.9 percent up right and so for us what we're going to do is looks like

60

00:03:12,510  -->  00:03:14,780
there's some seasonality here right.

61

00:03:14,910  -->  00:03:16,540
Some seasonality it picks up.

62

00:03:16,620  -->  00:03:19,700
It's at I guess a Q4 seasonal high.

63

00:03:19,730  -->  00:03:25,560
There are a lot of businesses see revenue pick up just temporarily in Q4 especially in the retail sector

64

00:03:25,770  -->  00:03:27,000
given holiday shopping.

65

00:03:27,000  -->  00:03:27,260
Okay.

66

00:03:27,270  -->  00:03:29,960
So I'll do the same similar pattern here.

67

00:03:29,970  -->  00:03:34,890
I'll make it point five or normalized it here I don't know why it was negative that one time there also

68

00:03:34,890  -->  00:03:37,390
may was kind of a one off and then 11 percent there.

69

00:03:37,390  -->  00:03:41,240
And so for the year I'm at 2.9 percent.

70

00:03:41,580  -->  00:03:49,020
And then we'll go down there just very slowly so that you know growth slows like it like it usually

71

00:03:49,020  -->  00:03:49,350
does.

72

00:03:49,350  -->  00:03:49,560
Right.

73

00:03:49,560  -->  00:03:56,250
Okay And then we've got Lynda.com here in Fort Ghiselin this kind of stuff I don't really know what

74

00:03:56,250  -->  00:03:57,530
to do here.

75

00:03:57,540  -->  00:03:59,610
Growth is slowing a lot there.

76

00:03:59,610  -->  00:04:05,010
I only have a couple of data points I assume it slows down more to their end for the year growth is

77

00:04:05,010  -->  00:04:09,990
going to continue that slow year over year but I'm assuming that growth is actually pretty good for

78

00:04:09,990  -->  00:04:16,320
Linda for a while because a big company bought a smaller company and so the big company has bigger distribution

79

00:04:16,320  -->  00:04:20,860
channels and a good example will be to use Coca-Cola.

80

00:04:20,980  -->  00:04:28,380
So Coke introduced or you know invested whatever in dishonesty Coke had incredible distribution channels

81

00:04:28,380  -->  00:04:32,210
around the world so Coke can distribute Dasani water everywhere.

82

00:04:32,400  -->  00:04:38,370
Right and so if Coke were to buy Red Bull hypothetically speaking Coca-Cola has more relationships around

83

00:04:38,370  -->  00:04:44,190
the world and so Red Bull revenues would spike for a while because Coke has bigger distribution deals

84

00:04:44,190  -->  00:04:44,400
.

85

00:04:44,420  -->  00:04:45,900
OK I digress.

86

00:04:45,900  -->  00:04:46,170
All right.

87

00:04:46,170  -->  00:04:48,420
So looks like we're done there good.

88

00:04:48,420  -->  00:04:50,560
We're done and all this stuff.

89

00:04:50,560  -->  00:04:50,900
Right.

90

00:04:50,910  -->  00:04:51,870
It's pretty easy.

91

00:04:51,940  -->  00:04:54,460
Just a couple little line items here it's percent.

92

00:04:54,480  -->  00:04:58,020
It feeds in to the rest of the model.

93

00:04:58,290  -->  00:04:58,830
Right.

94

00:04:58,910  -->  00:05:02,450
Done so we're done with that revenue line item right.

95

00:05:02,460  -->  00:05:07,060
This revenue line item is really simple it's just hard coded.

96

00:05:07,090  -->  00:05:07,660
Right.

97

00:05:07,690  -->  00:05:11,420
So this is all just kind of extra information given right.

98

00:05:11,440  -->  00:05:18,430
So all this information here is give me given in the press release or the 10-Qs we're not going to forecast

99

00:05:18,430  -->  00:05:20,080
this stuff right.

100

00:05:20,080  -->  00:05:25,300
So let's look at pattern recognition remember modeling is basically everything is present a sales or

101

00:05:25,480  -->  00:05:26,870
pattern recognition.

102

00:05:26,920  -->  00:05:31,920
And it looks like marketing revenue growth which is the second line of three.

103

00:05:32,170  -->  00:05:34,760
So it's slowing slowing.

104

00:05:34,810  -->  00:05:35,050
Right.

105

00:05:35,050  -->  00:05:37,770
And so we're following similar patterns here.

106

00:05:37,770  -->  00:05:39,400
We're slowing it down.

107

00:05:40,030  -->  00:05:41,890
And then eventually on annual basis.

108

00:05:41,890  -->  00:05:46,200
And again it's not perfect numbers see our revenue growth slows and we're done with that.

109

00:05:46,330  -->  00:05:47,060
Okay good.

110

00:05:47,320  -->  00:05:53,410
And then premia I think get a drill down on this one if I don't if I remember correctly.

111

00:05:53,590  -->  00:05:54,950
That's right.

112

00:05:54,950  -->  00:05:56,000
There we go.

113

00:05:56,210  -->  00:05:56,960
But.

114

00:05:57,310  -->  00:05:59,300
All right so.

115

00:06:01,060  -->  00:06:01,810
Okay.

116

00:06:02,170  -->  00:06:05,970
So what we're doing now is premium.

117

00:06:06,040  -->  00:06:12,520
We've made a number of assumptions and it's basically the sales navigator products year over year growth

118

00:06:12,520  -->  00:06:13,450
is slowing a lot.

119

00:06:13,450  -->  00:06:17,400
See here I went from 40 to 29 so we're assuming it's going to continue slow.

120

00:06:17,680  -->  00:06:22,480
And then eventually it'll slow by a couple of percent per year and whatnot.

121

00:06:22,530  -->  00:06:28,210
No cake and the same thing with sales navigator the our poor average revenue per month per user per

122

00:06:28,210  -->  00:06:28,990
month.

123

00:06:28,990  -->  00:06:32,930
That will slow as well right over time slowly over time.

124

00:06:33,100  -->  00:06:33,810
Okay.

125

00:06:34,180  -->  00:06:38,050
And then down here the registered number of users will also slow.

126

00:06:38,440  -->  00:06:43,150
So there's $430 million $4.40 register users as of the last quarter.

127

00:06:43,240  -->  00:06:49,330
Right and that growth is 19 percent slowing a little bit over time see it's going to slow it down here

128

00:06:49,330  -->  00:06:49,930
as well.

129

00:06:49,960  -->  00:06:56,270
It's very gradually over time and eventually growth will only be 15 percent year over year there.

130

00:06:56,590  -->  00:07:03,920
And then it's interesting because only point to 5 percent of 0.4 percent of customers pay.

131

00:07:04,100  -->  00:07:06,580
And so I didn't know what the right number was.

132

00:07:06,580  -->  00:07:12,060
Point 2 6 4 so I kept it out there and just had a slowing a little bit over time.

133

00:07:12,220  -->  00:07:16,750
And the average revenue per subscriber has been 30 bucks for ever and so will include that there and

134

00:07:16,750  -->  00:07:22,540
that's you know kind of on on a monthly basis like I showed you my personal subscription where there

135

00:07:22,540  -->  00:07:29,890
was no credit card and that's it that's all you do okay for revenue and revenue.

136

00:07:29,890  -->  00:07:35,480
We spend the most time on because everything is generally speaking a percent of revenue.

137

00:07:35,660  -->  00:07:36,900
Okay great.

138

00:07:36,940  -->  00:07:37,720
So there we go.

139

00:07:37,720  -->  00:07:41,290
We've got these revenue line items here all the way out.

140

00:07:41,380  -->  00:07:42,130
OK good.

141

00:07:42,490  -->  00:07:48,610
All right so let's go to the income statement and let's model the income statement and the rest of the

142

00:07:48,610  -->  00:07:51,000
model is actually pretty straight forward.

143

00:07:51,280  -->  00:07:56,770
And we're going to get rid of this little crystal ball or whatever that thing is called that's called

144

00:07:56,780  -->  00:07:56,890
.

145

00:07:56,980  -->  00:07:57,670
Okay.

146

00:07:57,670  -->  00:07:59,270
So I threw that over there.

147

00:07:59,300  -->  00:08:00,720
Good visualization.

148

00:08:01,210  -->  00:08:06,220
And then we'll do the same thing here as well and everything here is is going to be a percent of revenue

149

00:08:06,230  -->  00:08:06,260
.

150

00:08:06,280  -->  00:08:07,060
Right.

151

00:08:07,060  -->  00:08:09,910
So here we are e We're forecasting the future.

152

00:08:10,030  -->  00:08:11,620
And again your numbers would be a little bit off.

153

00:08:11,650  -->  00:08:13,060
And don't worry about it.

154

00:08:13,370  -->  00:08:14,620
It is what it is.

155

00:08:14,630  -->  00:08:21,550
Right so here Coskata those sales was that amount and it went up you know a little bit whatever and

156

00:08:21,550  -->  00:08:25,510
then backed down and we kind of play around that seasonality here as well.

157

00:08:25,870  -->  00:08:28,570
And then eventually we assume that there's going to be leverage in the model.

158

00:08:28,600  -->  00:08:28,900
Right.

159

00:08:28,900  -->  00:08:34,760
So expenses that's a percentage of revenue will go down and we do the same thing with sales and marketing

160

00:08:34,800  -->  00:08:35,040
.

161

00:08:35,330  -->  00:08:41,100
Prior to Bellemont Junee depreciation again everything is just a percent of revenue.

162

00:08:41,500  -->  00:08:46,370
And so last year for sales and marketing we see the percents come down slowly.

163

00:08:46,780  -->  00:08:50,580
We'll assume that that continues over time on an annual basis.

164

00:08:50,590  -->  00:08:53,740
You see here how it gradually trends lower.

165

00:08:53,740  -->  00:08:55,760
Same with DNA as general minister.

166

00:08:56,200  -->  00:09:03,700
Same with product development which is also called R&D and then depreciation is just a percentage of

167

00:09:03,700  -->  00:09:04,170
revenue.

168

00:09:04,240  -->  00:09:04,810
Right.

169

00:09:04,810  -->  00:09:08,480
Same thing with stock based compensation it's always just a percent of revenue.

170

00:09:08,740  -->  00:09:14,830
And then eventually we come down to our provision for taxes and we don't know what the tax rate is going

171

00:09:14,830  -->  00:09:16,320
to be longer term.

172

00:09:16,390  -->  00:09:18,670
So we assume it will gradually increase.

173

00:09:18,670  -->  00:09:23,920
Most companies pay low 30s percentage whatever it is taxes depends on the country you're in where the

174

00:09:23,920  -->  00:09:28,030
state or municipalities I don't want to spend too much tax time forecasting taxes.

175

00:09:28,030  -->  00:09:34,100
You generally just call up the company or look in the 10-Q or 10k to see what taxes are and then forecast

176

00:09:34,110  -->  00:09:34,700
in that way.

177

00:09:34,780  -->  00:09:38,560
And a lot of times on the earnings calls they'll have taxes as well.

178

00:09:38,560  -->  00:09:38,840
Right.

179

00:09:38,840  -->  00:09:40,780
They'll they'll talk about that at length.

180

00:09:40,780  -->  00:09:41,080
Right.

181

00:09:41,140  -->  00:09:41,440
OK.

182

00:09:41,440  -->  00:09:43,940
So there we go.

183

00:09:44,050  -->  00:09:47,390
We've got our earnings each year going forward.

184

00:09:47,590  -->  00:09:50,370
You can see that year over year growth actually is going accelerate.

185

00:09:50,380  -->  00:09:56,380
And the reason we have it accelerating member when I showed you the charts early on of expenses and

186

00:09:56,380  -->  00:10:00,430
revenue in our model well revenue growth is slowing a lot.

187

00:10:00,460  -->  00:10:00,930
Right.

188

00:10:01,000  -->  00:10:03,240
So the growth is slowing.

189

00:10:03,820  -->  00:10:09,250
And so we're assuming that they're going to be cutting expenses just to make investors happy because

190

00:10:09,490  -->  00:10:14,390
they'll be losing a lot of investors that love the high growth rate of the company.

191

00:10:14,440  -->  00:10:19,000
But they'll be gaining a lot of investors that love the increasing profitability metrics as well.

192

00:10:19,000  -->  00:10:24,930
And that's quite common for a lot of different companies as well as you can see the adjusted EBITDA

193

00:10:25,270  -->  00:10:29,300
which is operating profit margins are increasing nicely over time.

194

00:10:29,530  -->  00:10:34,090
OK so we're done with the income statement again remember that the green numbers are numbers that are

195

00:10:34,090  -->  00:10:37,930
brought forward from a previous tab blue numbers are could it

196

00:11:03,230  -->  00:11:11,960
put it in the balance sheet not as hard as you think it might be a lot lot of people have problems forecasts

197

00:11:11,960  -->  00:11:12,890
and balance sheet.

198

00:11:13,120  -->  00:11:18,250
It's not that difficult because similar to the income statement everything is really just a percentage

199

00:11:18,250  -->  00:11:19,050
of revenue.

200

00:11:19,140  -->  00:11:24,250
And the only reason that we forecast the balance sheet and the capital statement is so that we can do

201

00:11:25,360  -->  00:11:31,430
a certain valuation metric which will cover next class called DCF or discounted cash flow analysis.

202

00:11:31,500  -->  00:11:35,010
The other methodology is we're going to use for valuation like price earnings and price to.

203

00:11:35,050  -->  00:11:39,860
And there's many others don't really use forecasts of the balance sheet.

204

00:11:40,000  -->  00:11:40,680
Okay great.

205

00:11:40,690  -->  00:11:47,210
So these are historical numbers you see they're hardcoded in Blue Angels You don't need to be here it's

206

00:11:47,290  -->  00:11:48,890
just the last data right.

207

00:11:48,940  -->  00:11:51,750
Remember the balance sheet just a snapshot in time.

208

00:11:52,140  -->  00:11:54,050
OK so now we're in a forecast.

209

00:11:54,150  -->  00:11:58,790
And again the green numbers mean it's from another tab right.

210

00:11:59,050  -->  00:12:03,390
And so this green number here is going to come from the cash flow statement.

211

00:12:03,400  -->  00:12:05,440
Okay cash I'll get there in a minute.

212

00:12:05,440  -->  00:12:10,440
You'll see receivables is going to come from the income statement right.

213

00:12:10,460  -->  00:12:14,500
It's just seventeen point five percent times sales.

214

00:12:14,500  -->  00:12:15,520
How did it get that gross.

215

00:12:15,670  -->  00:12:20,700
Well over here you can see that receivables as a percentage of sales changes by the quarter.

216

00:12:20,880  -->  00:12:23,190
So I basically just used a similar pattern there.

217

00:12:23,200  -->  00:12:29,340
It's not perfect but I think you get the idea and then you'll go down through all your assets all your

218

00:12:29,350  -->  00:12:34,540
liabilities and a lot of it is just a percentage of revenue or is pulled from you know somewhere else

219

00:12:34,550  -->  00:12:34,730
.

220

00:12:34,890  -->  00:12:39,080
So in this case 1.8 percent for other assets times revenue.

221

00:12:39,220  -->  00:12:39,760
Right.

222

00:12:39,750  -->  00:12:42,310
How are you going to forecast that is too hard.

223

00:12:42,310  -->  00:12:44,740
Same thing with accounts payables percentage just sales.

224

00:12:44,740  -->  00:12:45,300
Right.

225

00:12:45,310  -->  00:12:48,890
So that is just 4.5 percent tons percentage of sales.

226

00:12:48,900  -->  00:12:53,330
I looked at historical patterns here and tried to model it the best of my capabilities.

227

00:12:53,530  -->  00:12:59,290
Same thing here with and retained earnings which is just pulled from another statement and retained

228

00:12:59,290  -->  00:13:04,990
earnings member is just the increase or decrease in previous years or quarters net income.

229

00:13:05,050  -->  00:13:05,590
Right.

230

00:13:05,620  -->  00:13:10,540
So that earnings earnings or net income are retained and then I add a lot of comments here so I know

231

00:13:10,540  -->  00:13:13,280
exactly where I'm getting the stuff from right.

232

00:13:13,450  -->  00:13:15,540
So here short term investments.

233

00:13:15,630  -->  00:13:20,760
I'm assuming it builds 100 annually hundred million EYLEA as cash flow builds.

234

00:13:21,120  -->  00:13:25,830
And that's just from looking at historical patterns what and again not perfect but close enough.

235

00:13:25,990  -->  00:13:31,210
And then he got deferred commissions which I'm telling you just a percentage of revenue.

236

00:13:31,210  -->  00:13:32,090
Same thing here.

237

00:13:32,110  -->  00:13:36,800
I'm just telling myself reminding myself what all this stuff is from.

238

00:13:37,780  -->  00:13:44,050
OK so I'm not a big fan of forecasting balance sheets or Cashell statements because I'm not a big fan

239

00:13:44,050  -->  00:13:45,710
of DCF which is down here.

240

00:13:45,820  -->  00:13:47,540
But I'm going to show you how to do it anyway.

241

00:13:47,620  -->  00:13:52,630
And the reason I'm not a big fan of it is because there are so many independent variables in DCF.

242

00:13:52,620  -->  00:13:57,060
So if I told you x plus one equals three we all know that X is true.

243

00:13:57,390  -->  00:14:01,800
If I told you x plus why plus Q plus W plus 1 is 3 What is x.

244

00:14:01,870  -->  00:14:02,870
We have no idea.

245

00:14:02,880  -->  00:14:05,380
It's just too many independent variables and that's what DCF is.

246

00:14:05,380  -->  00:14:10,670
But I want to kind of create a menu for everybody here to follow from so I'm including it.

247

00:14:10,740  -->  00:14:14,140
OK let's move on to cash flow and let's forecast the future here.

248

00:14:14,130  -->  00:14:15,900
And you think this might be complicated.

249

00:14:15,940  -->  00:14:23,160
This is actually the easiest one and easiest one because it's actually already calculated for you right

250

00:14:23,170  -->  00:14:23,210
.

251

00:14:23,200  -->  00:14:26,090
Member all the greens are from previous tabs right.

252

00:14:26,190  -->  00:14:29,160
Bleus we don't have any Bleus to enter right.

253

00:14:29,250  -->  00:14:30,090
I just don't know.

254

00:14:30,100  -->  00:14:36,190
I don't know how to you know add a forecast for provision for doubtful accounts just being honest and

255

00:14:36,190  -->  00:14:37,470
sales returns right.

256

00:14:37,480  -->  00:14:38,920
It's kind of all over the place here.

257

00:14:38,970  -->  00:14:40,930
And so are these things excess tax benefits.

258

00:14:40,960  -->  00:14:42,270
I have no idea.

259

00:14:42,350  -->  00:14:45,870
And same with so they they kind of average each other out.

260

00:14:45,880  -->  00:14:49,140
I'm going to make them 0 and they're not going to move that need the needle that much anyway.

261

00:14:49,320  -->  00:14:49,950
OK.

262

00:14:50,260  -->  00:14:52,170
There you go.

263

00:14:52,410  -->  00:14:59,080
And so all these line items are just pulled from previous statements the balance sheet or the income

264

00:14:59,080  -->  00:14:59,450
statement.

265

00:14:59,470  -->  00:15:02,850
And let's double click on them and just see where they came from.

266

00:15:02,870  -->  00:15:03,090
Right.

267

00:15:03,100  -->  00:15:04,840
So let's go here.

268

00:15:04,860  -->  00:15:09,130
DoubleClick at depreciation is right on the income statement we know that right.

269

00:15:09,120  -->  00:15:11,670
Same thing with stock based compensation.

270

00:15:11,740  -->  00:15:12,190
Right.

271

00:15:12,220  -->  00:15:16,730
And that is basically net income from the income statement that's gap right.

272

00:15:16,750  -->  00:15:21,520
Number gap and we're doing all this stuff in the cash flow statement to figure out what real cash flow

273

00:15:21,530  -->  00:15:23,910
is because the income statement is a lie.

274

00:15:23,910  -->  00:15:25,390
That's why we have a cash flow statement.

275

00:15:25,380  -->  00:15:31,440
Ill tell you what the what the real cash is and here you just pull this off your balance sheet was a

276

00:15:31,450  -->  00:15:37,870
change in accounts receivable deferred commission prepaid expenses all the other stuff you can read

277

00:15:37,870  -->  00:15:41,320
that right there it comes right off of the balance sheet.

278

00:15:41,320  -->  00:15:50,380
And then again we've got free cash flow here so free cash flow is basically operating cash flow minus

279

00:15:50,380  -->  00:15:56,410
cap ex remember that free cash flow is operating cash flow of minus CapEx and all this stuff here is

280

00:15:56,400  -->  00:16:01,690
calculated for us so that we can forecast our DCF.

281

00:16:01,720  -->  00:16:02,010
Right.

282

00:16:02,020  -->  00:16:07,240
So the free cash flows will feed into there which I'll cover in the next section and so that's a recap

283

00:16:07,300  -->  00:16:11,160
on how to forecast your financial statements.

284

00:16:11,230  -->  00:16:11,530
Right.

285

00:16:11,530  -->  00:16:15,520
Basically everything is a percent of revenue pretty much.

286

00:16:15,520  -->  00:16:22,250
And then you look for pattern recognition to decide how to forecast it and can and every model is different

287
