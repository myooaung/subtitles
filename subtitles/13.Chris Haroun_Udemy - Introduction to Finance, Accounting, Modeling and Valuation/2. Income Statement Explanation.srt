1

00:00:00,810  -->  00:00:06,330
Let's discuss the income statement in more detail and make him statement we'll tell you how much money

2

00:00:06,330  -->  00:00:07,530
is coming into you.

3

00:00:07,650  -->  00:00:08,500
OK.

4

00:00:08,910  -->  00:00:11,850
And that's called revenue or sales which is the same thing.

5

00:00:12,120  -->  00:00:16,860
And some people call it the top line because revenue goes at the top of the income statement.

6

00:00:16,860  -->  00:00:19,110
And the bottom line what is your bottom line.

7

00:00:19,110  -->  00:00:19,920
That's net income.

8

00:00:19,920  -->  00:00:20,920
At the very bottom.

9

00:00:20,940  -->  00:00:21,850
OK.

10

00:00:22,410  -->  00:00:34,020
And it also tells you money out of cash is revenue or money in minus money out or expenses equals net

11

00:00:34,020  -->  00:00:34,800
income.

12

00:00:34,800  -->  00:00:35,610
Pretty simple.

13

00:00:35,610  -->  00:00:37,610
Great.

14

00:00:37,680  -->  00:00:40,800
So let's drill down a little further.

15

00:00:40,800  -->  00:00:41,190
OK.

16

00:00:41,280  -->  00:00:43,740
And we're going to talk about an example here.

17

00:00:43,740  -->  00:00:46,280
You have a company and you sell apples.

18

00:00:46,370  -->  00:00:49,290
OK and you sell them for $2 each.

19

00:00:49,350  -->  00:00:51,090
And that's a Canadian to our coin.

20

00:00:51,090  -->  00:00:52,160
It's a polar bear.

21

00:00:52,170  -->  00:00:53,050
Pretty cool.

22

00:00:53,580  -->  00:00:57,720
OK so you sell an apple for $2 each cat isn't.

23

00:00:58,100  -->  00:00:59,570
You sold six apples.

24

00:00:59,620  -->  00:01:02,220
OK so that's 12 dollars in revenue.

25

00:01:03,120  -->  00:01:08,960
Now in terms of expenses it costs you a buck to make one apple.

26

00:01:08,970  -->  00:01:09,410
OK.

27

00:01:09,600  -->  00:01:13,510
That's a Canadian $1 bill called Allouni represent canape here.

28

00:01:13,530  -->  00:01:14,090
OK.

29

00:01:14,100  -->  00:01:16,960
So it costs us a buck each to make an apple.

30

00:01:17,040  -->  00:01:17,880
Right.

31

00:01:18,000  -->  00:01:20,330
And we made 6 apples.

32

00:01:20,700  -->  00:01:24,470
And so the costs of goods sold right.

33

00:01:25,080  -->  00:01:26,580
Is 6 bucks.

34

00:01:26,610  -->  00:01:33,750
OK so revenue minus expenses right equals the revenue minus the cost of goods sold right equals your

35

00:01:33,750  -->  00:01:34,690
gross profit.

36

00:01:34,910  -->  00:01:35,580
Okay.

37

00:01:36,020  -->  00:01:36,320
Okay.

38

00:01:36,330  -->  00:01:37,120
Move on.

39

00:01:37,530  -->  00:01:39,380
And then we have labor right.

40

00:01:39,420  -->  00:01:43,260
You work in this great company and you made a buck.

41

00:01:43,590  -->  00:01:44,240
Okay.

42

00:01:44,580  -->  00:01:47,690
And there's another expense called depreciation.

43

00:01:47,760  -->  00:01:48,120
Okay.

44

00:01:48,120  -->  00:01:52,040
And this is a beautiful thing but it's not cash out of your pocket.

45

00:01:52,080  -->  00:01:54,270
Let me drill down explain in more detail.

46

00:01:54,890  -->  00:01:55,280
Okay.

47

00:01:55,290  -->  00:01:58,220
So you buy a truck right.

48

00:01:58,290  -->  00:02:02,130
Your truck is going to last you for 10 years you pay 10 bucks for it.

49

00:02:02,190  -->  00:02:02,830
Right.

50

00:02:03,210  -->  00:02:08,800
And so every year you're allowed to depreciate that truck.

51

00:02:08,950  -->  00:02:09,540
OK.

52

00:02:09,600  -->  00:02:16,370
There's wear and tear on it and basically that means that you're going to pay less tax.

53

00:02:16,770  -->  00:02:18,360
And this all makes sense a second OK.

54

00:02:18,510  -->  00:02:25,640
So over 10 years we get to write off 10 bucks a buck this year.

55

00:02:26,160  -->  00:02:27,680
And then we get back next year.

56

00:02:27,690  -->  00:02:28,610
Yada yada yada.

57

00:02:28,620  -->  00:02:30,960
Rinse lather repeat you get 10 bucks.

58

00:02:30,960  -->  00:02:31,560
Cool.

59

00:02:31,920  -->  00:02:34,210
And so that is depreciation get.

60

00:02:34,350  -->  00:02:40,410
And it's a beautiful thing because what we're to do now is calculate taxes and we're to pay a little

61

00:02:40,410  -->  00:02:44,650
bit less tax if we if we didn't appreciate this truck we pay more tax right.

62

00:02:45,030  -->  00:02:45,620
OK.

63

00:02:45,840  -->  00:02:47,920
So what is our tax going to be.

64

00:02:48,570  -->  00:02:55,220
Well our pretax net income is four bucks fall by six months one month one four bucks.

65

00:02:55,310  -->  00:02:57,580
We're get taxed on that four bucks now.

66

00:02:58,110  -->  00:02:59,610
It.

67

00:03:00,240  -->  00:03:05,430
If we did it and we pay a buck in taxes which is say 25 percent let's pretend the tax rates 25 percent

68

00:03:05,430  -->  00:03:05,830
.

69

00:03:06,150  -->  00:03:14,090
If we didn't depreciate that one dollar right for the truck then we would pay taxes on five bucks.

70

00:03:14,310  -->  00:03:15,020
Right.

71

00:03:15,180  -->  00:03:19,700
Which means that we would have paid more in taxes.

72

00:03:19,710  -->  00:03:20,200
OK.

73

00:03:20,610  -->  00:03:24,460
So now net income is three bucks.

74

00:03:24,460  -->  00:03:27,020
Now let's take a closer look.

75

00:03:27,030  -->  00:03:29,730
Revenue earnings.

76

00:03:29,790  -->  00:03:30,790
OK.

77

00:03:31,390  -->  00:03:35,790
Revenue is what we're going to spend a huge amount of time on in this course.

78

00:03:35,790  -->  00:03:39,650
It's more important than any other line item on any financial statement.

79

00:03:39,900  -->  00:03:46,800
And the reason is that once you forecast revenue everything else in your financial models pretty much

80

00:03:47,280  -->  00:03:48,930
is just a percent of revenue.

81

00:03:49,050  -->  00:03:53,620
OK and this will make a lot of sense to you when we do the modeling section of the course.

82

00:03:53,790  -->  00:03:54,920
So the top line is 12.

83

00:03:54,960  -->  00:03:56,670
And the bottom line is three
