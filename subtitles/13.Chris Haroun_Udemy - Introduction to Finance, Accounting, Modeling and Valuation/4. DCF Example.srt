1

00:00:00,240  -->  00:00:07,700
Let's go to our model and let's do our DCF remember in our cash flow statement we got ahm I'm sorry

2

00:00:07,710  -->  00:00:10,290
here these free cash estimates right.

3

00:00:10,290  -->  00:00:11,560
We calculate those.

4

00:00:11,850  -->  00:00:12,140
OK.

5

00:00:12,150  -->  00:00:16,100
So let's look at a discount of cash for evaluation analysis.

6

00:00:16,110  -->  00:00:20,820
So remember green means it's coming from other Tapps.

7

00:00:20,820  -->  00:00:24,090
Step 1 Get free cash flow from the cash flow statement tab.

8

00:00:24,090  -->  00:00:24,930
Here it is.

9

00:00:24,990  -->  00:00:26,620
That's just link directly there.

10

00:00:26,620  -->  00:00:27,890
See.

11

00:00:27,960  -->  00:00:33,720
Step two is calculate what's called the weighted average cost to capital which is the discount rate

12

00:00:33,810  -->  00:00:37,030
that we're going to use to discount these free cash flows.

13

00:00:37,140  -->  00:00:44,940
These free cash flows today meaning in 2016 should be worth less than they are then because you have

14

00:00:44,940  -->  00:00:49,860
to pay for money there's interest rates we have to discount it but what interest rate do we discount

15

00:00:49,860  -->  00:00:51,290
these values to.

16

00:00:51,750  -->  00:00:57,670
Well there's two things we have to take into consideration here.

17

00:00:58,050  -->  00:01:00,640
There's a cost of equity right.

18

00:01:00,840  -->  00:01:02,620
And then there's a cost of debt.

19

00:01:02,930  -->  00:01:03,520
OK.

20

00:01:03,810  -->  00:01:08,060
So the cost of equity will go with that one first.

21

00:01:08,460  -->  00:01:11,640
The cost of equity is just the risk free rate right.

22

00:01:11,700  -->  00:01:17,820
Which is basically the government rate or a little bit above that plus the Bayda which is how volatile

23

00:01:17,820  -->  00:01:24,780
your stock is times what you think the market return is going to be longer term minus that risk free

24

00:01:24,840  -->  00:01:25,670
rate.

25

00:01:26,050  -->  00:01:33,630
And so in this example LinkedIn oddly enough has a beta below one which means that it's less volatile

26

00:01:33,660  -->  00:01:41,440
than the Standard Poor's 500 and then the stock market return in this hypothetical example is 18 1/2

27

00:01:41,510  -->  00:01:46,260
percent over time minus the risk free rate which let's just call roughly two and a half percent and

28

00:01:46,320  -->  00:01:52,140
that means our cost of capital for equity is 8.2 percent right now.

29

00:01:52,230  -->  00:01:56,110
And that's just just math Mathare and we calculate that there.

30

00:01:56,250  -->  00:01:59,400
Now we have to multiply this right times.

31

00:01:59,400  -->  00:02:06,560
What percent of the enterprise value or value of linked in is equity versus debt.

32

00:02:06,660  -->  00:02:10,420
And so you can see there the market cap is roughly fifteen point nine billion.

33

00:02:10,460  -->  00:02:11,810
It's a little bit off.

34

00:02:12,300  -->  00:02:17,250
I'm not sure exactly when it's actually right now but it's touch off and debt from the balance sheet

35

00:02:17,250  -->  00:02:18,890
is 1.1 3 billion.

36

00:02:19,320  -->  00:02:25,080
So that means the percent of the capital structure for LinkedIn that is equity is fifteen point nine

37

00:02:25,080  -->  00:02:30,420
billion divided by the debt plus equity 1.3 billion plus fifteen point nine billion.

38

00:02:30,420  -->  00:02:34,120
That gets down 3.4 percent so ninety 3.4 percent.

39

00:02:34,200  -->  00:02:34,770
Right.

40

00:02:34,820  -->  00:02:39,660
Times that's OK is the cost of equity at some point 10 percent.

41

00:02:39,860  -->  00:02:46,950
And because we know that ninety three point four percent is our equity as a percentage of our capital

42

00:02:46,950  -->  00:02:50,480
structure we know that debt is just one minus that amount.

43

00:02:50,580  -->  00:02:51,120
Okay.

44

00:02:51,210  -->  00:02:52,000
Thats it.

45

00:02:52,380  -->  00:02:52,860
Okay great.

46

00:02:52,860  -->  00:02:54,530
So lets get to the cost of debt.

47

00:02:54,850  -->  00:03:01,650
Okay so the cost of debt is basically the costs that were calculated a second times one minus the normalized

48

00:03:01,650  -->  00:03:06,370
tax rate because we do get that benefits of having debt.

49

00:03:06,630  -->  00:03:11,570
Okay thats from a tax perspective but it looks like according to this comment they got I wrote this

50

00:03:11,570  -->  00:03:17,180
or I would have forgotten all the debt that LinkedIn has and LinkedIn has is convertible.

51

00:03:17,200  -->  00:03:24,410
Therefore I assume the cost of debt is the same as the cost of equity which is a point 2 percent.

52

00:03:24,580  -->  00:03:25,890
Now we're in a tax effect.

53

00:03:25,920  -->  00:03:30,940
You get a tax benefit for having debt and that gets you to 5.5 percent.

54

00:03:30,960  -->  00:03:32,170
Okay good.

55

00:03:32,190  -->  00:03:40,290
And we take 5.5 percent right and we multiply it by the percent of our capital structure which is that

56

00:03:40,620  -->  00:03:43,880
it's just basically is the or miss the equity portion.

57

00:03:43,890  -->  00:03:49,890
So as a percentage of cabel structure and that gets us to 8 point 0 2 percent.

58

00:03:49,890  -->  00:03:50,470
Okay.

59

00:03:50,550  -->  00:03:56,190
And that's our cost of capital and we're going to use this to discount all of these items back into

60

00:03:56,190  -->  00:03:57,150
today's terms.

61

00:03:57,170  -->  00:03:59,250
Okay cool.

62

00:03:59,610  -->  00:04:01,760
All right let's do it now.

63

00:04:01,770  -->  00:04:02,640
I love this form.

64

00:04:02,650  -->  00:04:03,600
It's the coolest thing ever.

65

00:04:03,600  -->  00:04:09,870
It's called Net Present Value DoubleClick and NPV is equal to the rate and then the discount of all

66

00:04:09,870  -->  00:04:12,920
those amounts in the future and the rate is.

67

00:04:13,170  -->  00:04:15,760
We've already got it's this dude here.

68

00:04:15,900  -->  00:04:16,690
OK.

69

00:04:17,070  -->  00:04:18,180
And he's here.

70

00:04:18,330  -->  00:04:19,270
See that guy.

71

00:04:19,650  -->  00:04:23,540
And then these here are going to be all of the future values were in discount to.

72

00:04:23,760  -->  00:04:26,550
Yes discounted cash flow.

73

00:04:27,000  -->  00:04:28,560
That equals that amount.

74

00:04:28,590  -->  00:04:34,440
However what the heck do we do with years 2021 all the way up to infinity.

75

00:04:34,620  -->  00:04:39,900
Certainly that has to count for something and a much larger portion as well because that's the million

76

00:04:39,900  -->  00:04:42,420
years of free cash flow for Illington.

77

00:04:43,080  -->  00:04:45,330
Well the way this is done is as follows.

78

00:04:45,390  -->  00:04:49,730
You take what you think is the long term growth rate and the long term growth rate for any company is

79

00:04:49,830  -->  00:04:51,020
is 1 2 or 3.

80

00:04:51,110  -->  00:04:55,980
It's usually pretty low and the reason is because when you get a very large entity you get the Law of

81

00:04:55,980  -->  00:04:58,580
Large Numbers and so you look at the U.S. economy.

82

00:04:58,590  -->  00:05:01,980
For example the U.S. economy is big it's mature.

83

00:05:02,010  -->  00:05:05,630
So it's never going to grow more and just say a couple of percent per year.

84

00:05:06,180  -->  00:05:06,920
OK.

85

00:05:07,140  -->  00:05:14,370
So what you do is the terminal value is basically you take the last year which is this guy here last

86

00:05:14,370  -->  00:05:26,070
year the plus one times the growth rate divided by this whack right weighted average cost capital which

87

00:05:26,070  -->  00:05:33,870
is 8.0 2 percent number from up here back to minus minus.

88

00:05:34,140  -->  00:05:35,250
This dude here.

89

00:05:35,310  -->  00:05:35,870
OK.

90

00:05:36,210  -->  00:05:42,040
That's a long term growth and you will never have your long term growth higher than your cost of capital

91

00:05:42,040  -->  00:05:42,060
.

92

00:05:42,060  -->  00:05:43,800
It just doesn't happen.

93

00:05:44,310  -->  00:05:47,630
And so we're discounting this amounts right now.

94

00:05:47,640  -->  00:05:48,710
And this next step here.

95

00:05:48,750  -->  00:05:49,150
Right.

96

00:05:49,170  -->  00:05:51,480
That's the term lie in today's terms.

97

00:05:51,780  -->  00:05:54,420
And we do it over four years is four years in the future whatever.

98

00:05:54,810  -->  00:05:57,550
And then we've got our weighted average cost capital there.

99

00:05:57,600  -->  00:05:58,620
OK good.

100

00:05:58,680  -->  00:06:03,240
So our target equity value the firm is that plus that.

101

00:06:03,240  -->  00:06:05,470
Okay that's discounted in today's terms.

102

00:06:06,200  -->  00:06:09,950
My guess is that that's our target value there.

103

00:06:10,470  -->  00:06:13,650
And then divide it by the number of shares was just from the income statement.

104

00:06:13,650  -->  00:06:18,330
That means our price target for LinkedIn is 157 bucks.

105

00:06:18,330  -->  00:06:19,290
Okay.

106

00:06:19,860  -->  00:06:20,830
Okay cool.

107

00:06:21,120  -->  00:06:27,060
And that's at a growth rate member of 2 percent to long term and a way the average cost capital of 8.02

108

00:06:27,600  -->  00:06:28,290
percent.

109

00:06:28,290  -->  00:06:31,920
That's the whack and 157 bucks.

110

00:06:31,950  -->  00:06:33,550
That's our base case.

111

00:06:33,660  -->  00:06:39,810
Then I create what's called a sensitivity analysis table here and a lot of analysts love to use this

112

00:06:39,810  -->  00:06:39,860
.

113

00:06:39,900  -->  00:06:40,620
Right.

114

00:06:40,770  -->  00:06:45,960
And it's basically breaks you can show your clients Here's a menu of where the numbers could be.

115

00:06:45,960  -->  00:06:48,800
You tell me if you're bearish or you're bullish.

116

00:06:49,230  -->  00:06:55,050
OK so if you're bullish on the economy or this company linked in then longer term you take a 3 percent

117

00:06:55,530  -->  00:07:00,590
right 3 percent long term growth rate and a lower cost of capital which means that your price target

118

00:07:00,590  -->  00:07:02,250
be 320 bucks.

119

00:07:02,250  -->  00:07:08,520
And if you're bearish then linked in is only going to be worth a hundred in one box at a long term growth

120

00:07:08,520  -->  00:07:12,720
rate 1 percent and a weighted average cost capital which is higher of 10 percent.

121

00:07:12,890  -->  00:07:14,140
OK.

122

00:07:14,850  -->  00:07:21,240
So these three numbers are our bullish base and bearish case.

123

00:07:21,660  -->  00:07:21,900
OK.

124

00:07:21,900  -->  00:07:25,090
So if we go here to value metrics this will feed into there.

125

00:07:25,530  -->  00:07:26,810
And of course they'll be green.

126

00:07:26,820  -->  00:07:29,000
And just look here don't look anywhere else.

127

00:07:29,070  -->  00:07:30,000
Thanks.

128

00:07:30,120  -->  00:07:32,580
I'm sorry Ray here.

129

00:07:33,060  -->  00:07:35,190
This is the DCF methodology.

130

00:07:35,190  -->  00:07:36,710
Bullish was that amount.

131

00:07:36,830  -->  00:07:39,920
Bearish is that amount and just right was adamant.

132

00:07:40,320  -->  00:07:44,720
And that came from that the previous tab here that's why it's increased
