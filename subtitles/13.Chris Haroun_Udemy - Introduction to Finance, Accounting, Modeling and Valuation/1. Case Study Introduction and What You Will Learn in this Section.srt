1

00:00:02,670  -->  00:00:07,350
We're going to do a case say now on Linked In Specifically we're going to build a model for Linked In

2

00:00:07,360  -->  00:00:07,510
.

3

00:00:07,650  -->  00:00:08,210
OK.

4

00:00:08,400  -->  00:00:13,770
So by the end of the next two sections you will know how to analyze or build a financial model which

5

00:00:13,800  -->  00:00:18,930
is a crucial skill the analysts should understand in order to be able to value companies.

6

00:00:18,930  -->  00:00:22,380
Once you get past the next two sections you'll know how to model companies.

7

00:00:22,620  -->  00:00:24,630
And then we'll focus on how do you value companies.

8

00:00:24,630  -->  00:00:25,190
OK.

9

00:00:25,530  -->  00:00:30,360
So in terms of the what I going to use Excel and forecast the future.

10

00:00:30,390  -->  00:00:32,500
Okay I remember everything as a percent of revenue.

11

00:00:32,790  -->  00:00:35,510
This will all kind of make sense to you soon.

12

00:00:35,610  -->  00:00:36,360
Okay.

13

00:00:36,810  -->  00:00:40,530
In terms of why are we doing this well well you have to forecast a model if you're going be able to

14

00:00:40,530  -->  00:00:42,240
come up with a target price.

15

00:00:42,240  -->  00:00:42,890
Okay.

16

00:00:43,210  -->  00:00:47,460
And in terms of how we're going to do this well we're going to take everything we've learned so far

17

00:00:47,470  -->  00:00:47,500
.

18

00:00:47,520  -->  00:00:48,020
Okay.

19

00:00:48,180  -->  00:00:49,010
Everything.

20

00:00:49,260  -->  00:00:50,760
And build this model.

21

00:00:50,820  -->  00:00:51,200
Okay.

22

00:00:51,240  -->  00:00:52,600
It's going to be a lot of fun.

23

00:00:53,160  -->  00:00:58,620
Don't worry though if this seems a bit complicate because this will all make a ton of sense by the time

24

00:00:58,620  -->  00:01:02,110
you complete the exercises in this course.

25

00:01:02,840  -->  00:01:03,460
Don't worry.

26

00:01:03,540  -->  00:01:03,990
I'm here to help.

27

00:01:03,990  -->  00:01:05,500
If you have questions.

28

00:01:06,600  -->  00:01:12,120
OK so there's a lot of information in the model I'm going to be showing you in this section OK so please

29

00:01:12,120  -->  00:01:16,350
assume that we are at the beginning of 2016 when we build this model.

30

00:01:16,820  -->  00:01:18,480
Okay.

31

00:01:18,540  -->  00:01:25,420
And please note when you make your models build on them really really slowly take your time okay.

32

00:01:25,590  -->  00:01:28,220
One brick or a step at a time.

33

00:01:28,320  -->  00:01:28,870
Okay.

34

00:01:29,070  -->  00:01:32,620
And we're going to do a more basic model in the next section.

35

00:01:32,780  -->  00:01:40,380
Okay then we'll analyze it in a lot of detail and just remember that after you build your model for

36

00:01:40,380  -->  00:01:45,720
a while once you start piecing it together then what will happen is you'll have this incredible aha

37

00:01:45,720  -->  00:01:46,330
moment.

38

00:01:46,380  -->  00:01:47,070
Okay.

39

00:01:47,370  -->  00:01:53,880
And lastly please keep in mind that Rome was not built in a day. Alright. Let's get started.
