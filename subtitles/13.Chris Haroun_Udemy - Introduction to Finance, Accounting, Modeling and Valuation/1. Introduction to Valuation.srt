1

00:00:06,060  -->  00:00:12,180
Valuation now that you understand financial modeling we can move on and discuss valuation.

2

00:00:12,180  -->  00:00:17,720
So by the end of the section you will have an even better understanding of growth versus value and valuation

3

00:00:17,730  -->  00:00:19,860
best practices in general.

4

00:00:19,860  -->  00:00:20,720
So what are we going to do.

5

00:00:20,850  -->  00:00:25,650
Well we're going to look into how to value companies on several different basis.

6

00:00:25,650  -->  00:00:29,780
OK so price to earnings price Cirebon discounted cash flow Okay.

7

00:00:30,010  -->  00:00:30,710
Why.

8

00:00:30,870  -->  00:00:36,150
Why are we looking at different ways to value companies because different types investors value companies

9

00:00:36,150  -->  00:00:36,930
different ways.

10

00:00:37,080  -->  00:00:42,410
OK so a value investor doesn't value companies the same way that a growth investor does.

11

00:00:42,480  -->  00:00:49,260
When it comes to picking target prices and the reason we look at several different valuation methodologies

12

00:00:49,260  -->  00:00:51,780
is because one of them is going to be wrong.

13

00:00:51,840  -->  00:00:52,550
I don't know which one.

14

00:00:52,680  -->  00:00:53,390
Right.

15

00:00:53,400  -->  00:00:59,190
But if you look at three and take an average of all three you can normalize the error OK minimize the

16

00:00:59,190  -->  00:00:59,600
error.

17

00:00:59,790  -->  00:01:00,690
OK.

18

00:01:01,040  -->  00:01:02,570
All right so how are we going do this.

19

00:01:02,570  -->  00:01:06,190
Well I'm going to talk a lot more about growth versus value.

20

00:01:06,270  -->  00:01:06,570
OK.

21

00:01:06,570  -->  00:01:13,380
Very important topic and I'm going to show you examples within Excel and we're going look at G-III right

22

00:01:13,380  -->  00:01:17,590
which is value ish versus Tesla which is definitely an expensive growth company.

23

00:01:17,790  -->  00:01:18,930
Okay let's get started.
