00:01:02.430  -->  00:01:07.160
Okay

2

00:01:09.960  -->  00:01:16.200
now we're going to discuss building the model what I'll do is I'll discuss revenue down here you see

3

00:01:16.200  -->  00:01:23.610
this tab revenues the most important thing you can build from model because when you forecast the future

4

00:01:23.700  -->  00:01:30.360
in all financial models almost every single line item is a percent of revenue and so modeling is really

5

00:01:30.360  -->  00:01:35.190
easy once you're done with revenue so spend most of your time focused on revenue.

6

00:01:35.910  -->  00:01:41.440
And then what we'll do is I'll discuss the income statement how I built it then the balance sheet and

7

00:01:41.440  -->  00:01:43.850
the cash flow statement and we're big.

8

00:01:43.890  -->  00:01:46.960
Ignore these for now.

9

00:01:47.040  -->  00:01:49.520
Those are valuation metrics.

10

00:01:49.530  -->  00:01:52.180
Let's go through the the model first.

11

00:01:52.350  -->  00:01:52.640
Okay.

12

00:01:52.650  -->  00:01:56.320
So let's kick it off with the revenue tab here.

13

00:01:56.550  -->  00:02:01.760
And as you can see the revenue tab all feeds into the income statement.

14

00:02:01.770  -->  00:02:02.070
Okay.

15

00:02:02.070  -->  00:02:05.000
So the top line on the income statement here.

16

00:02:05.130  -->  00:02:05.340
Right.

17

00:02:05.340  -->  00:02:07.920
That's why they called the top line the top line revenue.

18

00:02:08.220  -->  00:02:11.140
This is actually from this statement here.

19

00:02:11.160  -->  00:02:11.830
Okay.

20

00:02:11.940  -->  00:02:17.270
So we all know there's three different revenue line items for a Linked In.

21

00:02:17.280  -->  00:02:20.310
Remember we did the total addressable market analysis.

22

00:02:20.730  -->  00:02:28.470
So what we're going to do is we're in a look at how to get all the data in here and it's actually pretty

23

00:02:28.470  -->  00:02:35.990
simple because it's all available on that downloadable document we got directly from Lincoln's Web site

24

00:02:35.990  -->  00:02:36.230
.

25

00:02:36.270  -->  00:02:43.890
Or you could hard code it means type it in manually from all the previous press releases and 10-K and

26

00:02:43.890  -->  00:02:45.890
10-Q filings from sec dot gov.

27

00:02:46.050  -->  00:02:48.270
But that will take a lot of time.

28

00:02:48.270  -->  00:02:51.640
So we put in all of our data right.

29

00:02:51.660  -->  00:02:59.940
And again anything Blue is something we hardcoded in meaning it's not a formula that is a formula that

30

00:02:59.940  -->  00:03:01.190
is not.

31

00:03:01.200  -->  00:03:06.730
Let me just go up here and let you see the formula bar.

32

00:03:06.870  -->  00:03:07.640
Okay good.

33

00:03:07.920  -->  00:03:08.300
Great.

34

00:03:08.430  -->  00:03:11.670
Yes so see here this is hard coded.

35

00:03:11.730  -->  00:03:15.140
This is not that's actually a formula out there ya.

36

00:03:15.260  -->  00:03:16.450
Okay.

37

00:03:16.590  -->  00:03:16.860
All right.

38

00:03:16.860  -->  00:03:24.010
So total revenue is quite simply the addition of these three revenue line items right.

39

00:03:24.010  -->  00:03:30.900
LinkedIn has three major revenue line items and we have to answer it all is historical information and

40

00:03:30.910  -->  00:03:35.380
then forecast it next session I'll talk to you about forecasting not this one.

41

00:03:35.790  -->  00:03:42.990
OK so let's take a look at what or how we built tellt solutions right and this is basically Remember

42

00:03:43.260  -->  00:03:46.220
human resource departments using this product.

43

00:03:46.280  -->  00:03:51.510
And so I try to make it as simple as possible and we can drill down and add additional complexity.

44

00:03:51.600  -->  00:03:57.650
And again keep it simple and build on top of it otherwise it gets a little bit overwhelming for for

45

00:03:57.750  -->  00:04:00.440
us and you could always add lots of comments here.

46

00:04:00.540  -->  00:04:00.780
Right.

47

00:04:00.810  -->  00:04:04.330
Especially if you work in big teams had a lot of comments.

48

00:04:04.410  -->  00:04:07.180
Just remember why you entered certain data.

49

00:04:07.590  -->  00:04:08.320
Okay.

50

00:04:08.610  -->  00:04:12.090
In all this information is available from LinkedIn.

51

00:04:12.180  -->  00:04:12.730
Okay.

52

00:04:12.870  -->  00:04:21.070
We've got the total new customers in the quarter or the financial year this quarter that's a year.

53

00:04:21.330  -->  00:04:27.250
We got the average number of customers a year over year change revenue per customer.

54

00:04:27.360  -->  00:04:33.570
That sort of thing and you'll see right here this is a new line item where there's not that much data

55

00:04:33.930  -->  00:04:42.330
and this is because LinkedIn actually purchased a company called Linda dot com and it's part of the

56

00:04:42.330  -->  00:04:44.430
talent solutions that.

57

00:04:44.730  -->  00:04:50.010
And so we really want to document this here because we want to figure what the real growth rate going

58

00:04:50.010  -->  00:04:56.380
forward is for linked in meaning the organic growth rate not growth they purchased.

59

00:04:56.550  -->  00:04:57.370
OK.

60

00:04:57.850  -->  00:05:05.060
So we have all these line items here and again this is hardcoded directly from from LinkedIn.

61

00:05:05.350  -->  00:05:05.670
OK.

62

00:05:05.710  -->  00:05:11.110
So we have all this material member that gave us the geographic information as well which we got at

63

00:05:11.110  -->  00:05:14.330
the bottom of the the press release which we saw in previous section.

64

00:05:14.620  -->  00:05:15.840
Okay great.

65

00:05:15.850  -->  00:05:22.780
So this is one line item and let's just close that out here and now just look at marketing solutions

66

00:05:23.110  -->  00:05:23.440
.

67

00:05:24.060  -->  00:05:26.360
And we'll click on this plus for more details.

68

00:05:26.500  -->  00:05:32.770
And you can get a heck of a lot more details here on marketing solutions which is awesome you get from

69

00:05:32.760  -->  00:05:38.260
the company and their quarterly earnings press releases the number of unique visitors that they get

70

00:05:38.350  -->  00:05:45.190
but 100 million here the mobile unique visitors mobile is the new desktop is very important.

71

00:05:45.190  -->  00:05:48.810
Then you get member page views and this is in the billions.

72

00:05:48.810  -->  00:05:49.280
Wow.

73

00:05:49.330  -->  00:05:55.300
It's a lot of pastries and then sponsored update to the marketing that sort of thing.

74

00:05:55.360  -->  00:05:57.370
And they provide again all this information.

75

00:05:57.370  -->  00:06:02.460
I know it seems like a lot and sometimes I'll just enter in all this information and I don't know how

76

00:06:02.470  -->  00:06:08.970
to use it today but in a future quarter or year I'll look back and analyze the data and build on it

77

00:06:09.490  -->  00:06:11.970
and build on a case that's marketing solutions.

78

00:06:12.000  -->  00:06:17.770
When we scroll back to the top here and the last line item here is Priem solutions and this is the one

79

00:06:17.760  -->  00:06:22.360
where you pay the monthly fee of 29 bucks or more actually.

80

00:06:22.840  -->  00:06:26.650
And that gets you a number of Ishmael's and you could pay more in 29 bucks per month if you want more

81

00:06:27.040  -->  00:06:28.420
than a couple of e-mails.

82

00:06:28.610  -->  00:06:29.630
OK.

83

00:06:29.680  -->  00:06:35.770
So this is hardcoded which is why it's blue and we always track a couple things.

84

00:06:35.760  -->  00:06:43.230
The year over year change in the percentage of revenue so when you and I go to Linked In and we pay

85

00:06:43.240  -->  00:06:45.820
for the Priem subscriptions we could send in mails.

86

00:06:45.850  -->  00:06:48.370
That's actually a small percentage of the business.

87

00:06:48.430  -->  00:06:57.290
In fact in calendar 2015 that was only seventeen point eight percent of revenue.

88

00:06:57.370  -->  00:07:03.100
The big revenue driver is the H.R. department product here talent solutions which most of us don't know

89

00:07:03.100  -->  00:07:05.040
about because we're not all in H.R..

90

00:07:05.130  -->  00:07:11.430
OK let's click plus here to see how we built out Priem solutions or at least get more detail on it.

91

00:07:11.590  -->  00:07:12.930
Right.

92

00:07:12.980  -->  00:07:14.850
It was a lot of information here.

93

00:07:15.390  -->  00:07:24.040
So basically this gives you a breakdown of all the product all the information that goes directly into

94

00:07:24.500  -->  00:07:26.560
that premium subscription revenue line.

95

00:07:26.630  -->  00:07:27.550
Okay.

96

00:07:27.580  -->  00:07:34.360
And I know it seems like a lot but we build on it slowly so that we understand it slowly over time and

97

00:07:34.480  -->  00:07:38.560
again this is from the bottom of the press release . Remember. They gave the additional information

98

00:07:38.980  -->  00:07:44.050
which is geographic breakdown and I'm not using this data but heck I answered all of it in any way so

99

00:07:44.050  -->  00:07:45.300
I can analyze that.

100

00:07:45.390  -->  00:07:51.160
You know if one day if there's a problem of growth slowing materially in one area is it because the

101

00:07:51.150  -->  00:07:54.540
U.S. is slow or international or whatever that sort of thing.

102

00:07:54.550  -->  00:07:56.190
So let me close that out.

103

00:07:56.560  -->  00:07:57.350
So there you have it.

104

00:07:57.370  -->  00:08:00.070
Those are the three revenue line items.

105

00:08:00.100  -->  00:08:05.010
And we can go into a lot more detail on how to build those out as well.

106

00:08:05.080  -->  00:08:09.130
And so down here I wrote click.

107

00:08:09.240  -->  00:08:13.290
Plus the plus for more data from the earnings press release.

108

00:08:13.290  -->  00:08:14.590
So this is additional stuff.

109

00:08:14.590  -->  00:08:16.980
I don't know where to put this.

110

00:08:17.050  -->  00:08:22.190
I know if I should make this a part of the previous three revenue line items are separate.

111

00:08:22.540  -->  00:08:31.210
And so we've got remember revenue by field sales and online sales and this basically means a quota carrying

112

00:08:31.210  -->  00:08:32.980
sales rep that works at LinkedIn.

113

00:08:33.100  -->  00:08:39.880
And this is somebody that does just online sales like tell us sales versus in-person meetings and it

114

00:08:39.880  -->  00:08:44.010
looks like Field Sales is a lot bigger than online sales.

115

00:08:44.430  -->  00:08:45.260
Okay.

116

00:08:45.660  -->  00:08:51.970
And then we've got revenue by geography for all of revenue not just three revenue line items we saw

117

00:08:51.970  -->  00:08:52.630
above.

118

00:08:52.740  -->  00:08:59.250
Right and we can go through this information looks like revenue from the United States growth is 36

119

00:08:59.250  -->  00:09:07.080
percent year over year for Q4 of last calendar year Amia which is Europe Middle East it's 34 percent

120

00:09:07.110  -->  00:09:07.140
.

121

00:09:07.140  -->  00:09:11.430
And then a pack which is Asia and other regions is 29 percent.

122

00:09:11.800  -->  00:09:13.710
And you could also look at quarterly change.

123

00:09:13.740  -->  00:09:19.470
Remember business is seasonal usually so different quarters usually make more revenue than others and

124

00:09:19.480  -->  00:09:21.510
then we got headcount here as well.

125

00:09:21.510  -->  00:09:24.600
And we just hard code that in again that's blue.

126

00:09:24.620  -->  00:09:30.070
So it's hard coded and we can look at year over year is linked in hiring too much or too little whatever

127

00:09:30.070  -->  00:09:31.080
that sort of thing.

128

00:09:31.120  -->  00:09:37.920
Wow look at that like they hired 40 percent more people while a company is growing fast and we can actually

129

00:09:37.920  -->  00:09:42.890
look at revenue growth every year and we could see does that make sense.

130

00:09:42.930  -->  00:09:43.200
Wow.

131

00:09:43.210  -->  00:09:47.810
Revenue growth this 34 percent year over year but headcount growth was 40 percent.

132

00:09:47.830  -->  00:09:53.160
That's that's seems kind of odd or misaligned or or maybe not who knows.

133

00:09:53.160  -->  00:09:55.540
But anyway it's just something to keep an eye on.

134

00:09:55.680  -->  00:09:57.670
And you can see headcount by the vision too.

135

00:09:57.660  -->  00:09:58.470
This is awesome.

136

00:09:58.480  -->  00:10:02.290
I love it when a company gives a lot of information a lot of disclosure.

137

00:10:02.500  -->  00:10:04.780
Sales and Marketing we have.

138

00:10:04.960  -->  00:10:05.390
Wow.

139

00:10:05.430  -->  00:10:09.180
OK so a 38 percent increase in sales and marketing folks.

140

00:10:09.460  -->  00:10:14.570
It looks like they're up increasing the head count for product development a little bit last that sort

141

00:10:14.570  -->  00:10:20.180
of thing and so you can see that there's just a wealth of information provided by LinkedIn for investors

142

00:10:20.180  -->  00:10:23.390
here which is fantastic transparency builds trust.

143

00:10:23.570  -->  00:10:27.730
We're not going to use all of it but we have a bunch of it in our model in case we want to use in the

144

00:10:27.740  -->  00:10:28.080
future.

145

00:10:28.100  -->  00:10:28.850
OK good.

146

00:10:28.900  -->  00:10:32.200
So we just looked at the revenue tab.

147

00:10:32.240  -->  00:10:32.520
Right.

148

00:10:32.530  -->  00:10:38.210
And you want to spend a lot of time again on Rabbenu more time than on any other portion of the financial

149

00:10:38.210  -->  00:10:45.290
statement because revenue basically every other line item becomes a percentage of revenue which I'll

150

00:10:45.280  -->  00:10:46.730
show you here in the income statement.

151

00:10:46.730  -->  00:10:49.410
OK let's move on to income statement now.

152

00:10:49.460  -->  00:10:49.660
All right.

153

00:10:49.660  -->  00:10:53.170
So dinkum statement is pretty straightforward.

154

00:10:53.210  -->  00:10:58.970
And again we get all this information on a quarterly basis from the company when they issue their quarterly

155

00:10:58.970  -->  00:10:59.740
numbers.

156

00:10:59.960  -->  00:11:04.180
And you can see here our quarterly numbers now I'm adding a little bit more complexity for you here

157

00:11:04.190  -->  00:11:04.480
.

158

00:11:04.510  -->  00:11:12.610
OK so green means it came from another tab see that and that's that's a best practice when you model

159

00:11:12.950  -->  00:11:17.850
blue is hard coded meaning there's no formless here but there is formas for everything else.

160

00:11:17.860  -->  00:11:21.230
So the green is from another tab.

161

00:11:21.230  -->  00:11:24.200
This is from the revenue tab right here.

162

00:11:24.570  -->  00:11:25.550
Okay great.

163

00:11:25.550  -->  00:11:32.660
So from the earnings press release we hardcoded in the cost to get sold we put in sales and marketing

164

00:11:32.650  -->  00:11:34.070
product development.

165

00:11:34.340  -->  00:11:38.470
Ne That's general administrative and depreciation right.

166

00:11:38.560  -->  00:11:45.920
We hardcoded all that information and then this is just an addition of all the expenses.

167

00:11:46.550  -->  00:11:48.210
And here we go.

168

00:11:48.290  -->  00:11:53.720
This is income minus all those expenses it's negative here and we haven't even gotten to interests in

169

00:11:53.720  -->  00:11:55.840
taxes yet.

170

00:11:56.090  -->  00:12:02.420
And so what I like to do though is here's Ebbitt.

171

00:12:02.610  -->  00:12:03.160
Okay.

172

00:12:03.350  -->  00:12:07.250
That's earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization.

173

00:12:07.700  -->  00:12:09.690
And this is what's called adjusted Ebbitt.

174

00:12:09.880  -->  00:12:12.880
And remember before I said there was Gap and non-GAAP.

175

00:12:13.100  -->  00:12:19.270
Well I love to look at non-GAAP as a financial analyst account SLUB to look at.

176

00:12:19.580  -->  00:12:28.360
And this is called adjusted EBITDA and it's adjusted because it subtracts stuff that's noncash.

177

00:12:28.580  -->  00:12:30.780
Like when we depreciate a building.

178

00:12:31.040  -->  00:12:31.250
Right.

179

00:12:31.250  -->  00:12:32.840
That's not a cash expense.

180

00:12:32.890  -->  00:12:33.140
Right.

181

00:12:33.130  -->  00:12:39.050
It's just an accounting entry and there's many reasons why that exists and it's good because that means

182

00:12:39.050  -->  00:12:41.680
you pay less taxes because you have higher expenses.

183

00:12:41.690  -->  00:12:47.540
But I want to get rid of that because it's a non-cash expense for now and if you have any additional

184

00:12:47.540  -->  00:12:53.530
questions on this just you know semi messes directly or include it in the Q&A portion of this course

185

00:12:53.520  -->  00:12:53.660
.

186

00:12:53.670  -->  00:12:54.350
Thanks.

187

00:12:54.700  -->  00:13:00.960
OK so we have adjusted Ebbitt which is important and I'll show you why in a minute or so.

188

00:13:01.340  -->  00:13:08.060
And then we've got other income and then we've got our loss and provision for income tax because right

189

00:13:08.060  -->  00:13:19.970
here and then what happens is you get down to your earnings per share and the non-GAAP Clunes per share

190

00:13:19.970  -->  00:13:21.220
is what I care about.

191

00:13:21.230  -->  00:13:27.700
It looks like they made 94 cents last quarter that's the fourth quarter of 2015.

192

00:13:27.710  -->  00:13:34.820
But on a gap basis meaning if we include all the stuff like depreciation and amortization and the non

193

00:13:35.340  -->  00:13:37.820
non-cash stuff they lost money.

194

00:13:37.850  -->  00:13:45.670
I like this slide better because it includes you know basically mainly the non cash items and the items

195

00:13:45.670  -->  00:13:50.090
that quite frankly I can model that are repeatable longer term.

196

00:13:50.090  -->  00:13:56.390
So if there is a one off one event like a big litigation expense one quarter that's not going to be

197

00:13:56.380  -->  00:14:02.380
ongoing that's going to be in gap but not non-GAAP because non-GAAP is just stuff that's ongoing it's

198

00:14:02.380  -->  00:14:03.890
always easier to analyze that.

199

00:14:03.880  -->  00:14:05.500
And so there you go.

200

00:14:05.500  -->  00:14:11.260
This is the this is the income statement and so earnings per share is here and revenue is right at the

201

00:14:11.260  -->  00:14:11.640
top.

202

00:14:11.630  -->  00:14:13.430
And we talked about the expenses in between.

203

00:14:13.580  -->  00:14:20.690
It's really important to monitor the year over year growth for every line item as well as the percentage

204

00:14:20.690  -->  00:14:22.390
of revenue.

205

00:14:22.550  -->  00:14:27.950
And I'll explain why next section when we do the forecasting in the future we need to look at historical

206

00:14:27.950  -->  00:14:32.050
trends see here trend is a trend as well.

207

00:14:32.090  -->  00:14:33.820
So we can predict the future.

208

00:14:33.830  -->  00:14:34.460
Okay.

209

00:14:34.790  -->  00:14:39.860
So we're done with the income statement for now and again here is where we forecast stuff which we'll

210

00:14:39.860  -->  00:14:42.710
do next next section.

211

00:14:42.710  -->  00:14:49.930
So let's take a quick peek here at the balance sheet and similar to the income statement we have all

212

00:14:49.970  -->  00:14:54.100
the quarterly numbers here and blue means hardcoded right.

213

00:14:54.110  -->  00:15:01.390
And you know we've got the assets liabilities into total liabilities plus all those equity and we know

214

00:15:01.390  -->  00:15:08.180
that the shareholder's equity plus liabilities has equal assets.

215

00:15:08.210  -->  00:15:11.360
Right and that's our sanity check to see if we are right here.

216

00:15:11.410  -->  00:15:11.670
Right.

217

00:15:11.670  -->  00:15:14.400
So make sure that this this dude here.

218

00:15:14.650  -->  00:15:20.470
That's total assets is equal to liabilities plus equity which it is here.

219

00:15:20.480  -->  00:15:20.980
Great.

220

00:15:20.990  -->  00:15:21.300
Sorry.

221

00:15:21.320  -->  00:15:22.720
But to keep doing that.

222

00:15:23.140  -->  00:15:24.050
Ok cool.

223

00:15:24.110  -->  00:15:27.120
And lastly let's look at the cash flow statement.

224

00:15:27.130  -->  00:15:32.450
And like I said before the cash flow statement we'll be able to tell you where the income statement

225

00:15:32.440  -->  00:15:36.760
is misleading because not everything is a cash item.

226

00:15:36.880  -->  00:15:44.750
And so the cash flow statement starts with you take you take the gap not the I get the Gatun gap net

227

00:15:44.750  -->  00:15:50.720
income and then you add back all the stuff that's non-cash write depreciation is not cash like we have

228

00:15:50.720  -->  00:15:56.540
to give money to anybody and we depreciate stock based compensation we give when we give equity to employees

229

00:15:56.570  -->  00:15:56.670
.

230

00:15:56.660  -->  00:16:02.560
We're not we're not giving them cash we're just kind of creating more shares and other stuff here that's

231

00:16:02.570  -->  00:16:05.760
noncash and that gives you a adjusted net income.

232

00:16:06.710  -->  00:16:12.860
And then what happens eventually is you add back some of the changes in working capital from the balance

233

00:16:12.860  -->  00:16:13.540
sheet.

234

00:16:13.580  -->  00:16:13.840
Right.

235

00:16:13.840  -->  00:16:19.640
And so if you have a big increase or decrease in accounts receivable that can increase cash or decrease

236

00:16:19.630  -->  00:16:20.080
cash.

237

00:16:20.090  -->  00:16:21.320
And so there we go.

238

00:16:21.320  -->  00:16:28.750
We've got net cash from operating activities and then here it looks like we purchased a bunch of equipment

239

00:16:29.140  -->  00:16:30.630
and so we have to deduct that.

240

00:16:30.620  -->  00:16:35.770
And that's called net cash for investing and then financing as well.

241

00:16:35.890  -->  00:16:40.260
You know if we got a loan or whatnot we could make that change here.

242

00:16:40.630  -->  00:16:45.520
And then what happens is you get the net increase or decrease in cash by adding those three line items

243

00:16:45.530  -->  00:16:46.250
together.

244

00:16:46.250  -->  00:16:51.110
Net cash from opera activities investing and in financing activities.

245

00:16:51.190  -->  00:16:54.280
And then you've got the cash at the beginning of the year and then cash at the end of the year and this

246

00:16:54.290  -->  00:16:58.700
is going to be that the cash from last year or last quarter I'm sorry for the balance sheet and this

247

00:16:58.690  -->  00:17:00.030
quarter from the balance sheet.

248

00:17:00.110  -->  00:17:03.000
This is from being the year on the balance sheet.

249

00:17:03.000  -->  00:17:03.560
And then.

250

00:17:03.680  -->  00:17:04.300
Okay.

251

00:17:04.720  -->  00:17:10.440
And then we calculate free cash flow and free cash flow is just cash from operating activities.

252

00:17:10.610  -->  00:17:11.120
Right.

253

00:17:11.330  -->  00:17:14.930
And then you can deduct the cap ex.

254

00:17:15.020  -->  00:17:20.360
So it's basically cash flow from operating activities minus CapEx is free cash flow and we're taking

255

00:17:20.360  -->  00:17:22.290
note of these line items here.

256

00:17:22.370  -->  00:17:27.660
Free Cash flux that's going to be later into our evaluation which I'll discuss later on.

257

00:17:27.940  -->  00:17:33.230
Okay so that does it for the financials and how we create.

258

00:17:33.260  -->  00:17:39.460
Again you get all this information directly from the company's Web site linked Web site or whatever

259

00:17:39.470  -->  00:17:46.140
company you're analyzing or you can go to SCC and go to the 10 Cayne 10-Q and manually hard code.

260

00:17:46.180  -->  00:17:47.370
All that information
