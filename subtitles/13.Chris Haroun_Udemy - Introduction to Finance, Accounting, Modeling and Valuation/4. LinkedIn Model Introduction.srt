1

00:00:00,660  -->  00:00:06,100
So what you can do is you can either go to LinkedIn Investor Relations Web site or you can go to as

2

00:00:06,100  -->  00:00:06,890
he said.

3

00:00:07,320  -->  00:00:12,950
And look at the press releases and hard code or manually type in your model with all the numbers are

4

00:00:12,950  -->  00:00:13,570
.

5

00:00:14,010  -->  00:00:18,960
Or you can do something else which is you can go to the Web site and you see the top left hand corner

6

00:00:18,970  -->  00:00:24,960
there on the left hand side it says export financials what we can do is we can actually export the financials

7

00:00:25,560  -->  00:00:28,920
and then point them into our model and then build the model from scratch.

8

00:00:28,920  -->  00:00:36,040
So before we build the model what I want to do is just give you a quick introduction to my model.

9

00:00:36,240  -->  00:00:42,930
And so I have always put a little introduction here to the model what we're looking at and then we'll

10

00:00:42,930  -->  00:00:47,190
do is we'll talk about the revenue drivers income statement a bouncy castle statement and just how to

11

00:00:47,190  -->  00:00:51,500
value a company and I'll break it down into very easy to understand components.

12

00:00:51,500  -->  00:00:57,760
Now before we get started I wrote here please note that every model for every company is different.

13

00:00:57,920  -->  00:01:01,640
And so not all companies provide the same amount of data.

14

00:01:01,770  -->  00:01:07,650
You want to look at all the press releases and all the filings on the FCC website and listen to all

15

00:01:07,650  -->  00:01:12,900
the earnings calls and then just kind of build that into your model before diving in the model.

16

00:01:12,910  -->  00:01:17,550
I always love looking at charts and this is live data from the model.

17

00:01:17,550  -->  00:01:18,350
OK.

18

00:01:18,450  -->  00:01:20,070
I love looking for patterns.

19

00:01:20,070  -->  00:01:24,450
Pattern recognition is always great and so this is total revenue for the company you can see growth

20

00:01:24,450  -->  00:01:28,190
is great up to here and this is the future were in a forecast together.

21

00:01:28,560  -->  00:01:33,690
This is revenue for the first line item enterprise which is also called Tower solutions.

22

00:01:33,690  -->  00:01:36,760
Its pretty good marketing solutions.

23

00:01:36,780  -->  00:01:38,680
So that looks pretty good.

24

00:01:39,270  -->  00:01:44,950
And then the last section here is pre-New subscriptions which looks great as well.

25

00:01:45,000  -->  00:01:50,250
And then we can look at the percent growth rate of change and because this is a big publicly traded

26

00:01:50,250  -->  00:01:55,550
companies company you see that growth is slowing and that's perfectly normal.

27

00:01:55,650  -->  00:02:01,620
In fact companies usually go public when growth is slowing and this is another revenue line item growth

28

00:02:01,620  -->  00:02:02,190
is slowing here.

29

00:02:02,190  -->  00:02:05,790
And the third revenue line is ooh what happened here.

30

00:02:05,850  -->  00:02:08,280
It looks like growth accelerated temporarily.

31

00:02:08,300  -->  00:02:11,430
Well good analysts would look into why and you're a great analyst.

32

00:02:11,430  -->  00:02:19,020
So it looks like LinkedIn bought a company called Linda da comp for $1.5 billion here in 2014 and that's

33

00:02:19,020  -->  00:02:20,100
why revenues spiked.

34

00:02:20,140  -->  00:02:20,680
Okay.

35

00:02:20,850  -->  00:02:26,670
It's important to always understand why revenues spiking because usually growth is pausa but it's slowing

36

00:02:26,820  -->  00:02:31,830
for companies that are big publicly traded and that just shows you what happens and this year we got

37

00:02:31,830  -->  00:02:35,060
premium subscriptions slowing and that's actually a bit of a concern.

38

00:02:35,360  -->  00:02:35,700
Okay.

39

00:02:35,700  -->  00:02:37,640
So that's the revenue side.

40

00:02:37,860  -->  00:02:40,500
Let's look over here on the expense side.

41

00:02:40,500  -->  00:02:47,250
So this is operating margins are basically revenue minus most expenses that are repeatable.

42

00:02:47,430  -->  00:02:47,820
Okay.

43

00:02:47,820  -->  00:02:51,300
At least before taxes and interest depreciation amortization.

44

00:02:51,310  -->  00:02:57,480
So revenue minus most of repeatable expenses and although revenue growth is slowing we saw over here

45

00:02:57,480  -->  00:02:58,290
that might be a concern.

46

00:02:58,290  -->  00:03:01,730
It's okay because we believe the company didn't tell us this.

47

00:03:01,770  -->  00:03:08,830
We believe that the company will cut expenses at least as a percent and margins will expand.

48

00:03:08,970  -->  00:03:13,860
If this doesn't make perfect sense you don't worry we'll cover in great detail in sales and marketing

49

00:03:13,860  -->  00:03:15,170
as it presents just sales.

50

00:03:15,180  -->  00:03:18,690
This is all data from our model is going to decrease a little bit.

51

00:03:18,690  -->  00:03:22,010
Right so I'll help out to drive these higher margins up here.

52

00:03:22,230  -->  00:03:27,150
And then there's some called product development or research and belt and R&D that's going to decrease

53

00:03:27,150  -->  00:03:27,190
.

54

00:03:27,210  -->  00:03:31,990
We think as a percent of revenue as well and then Same thing with General administrators.

55

00:03:32,070  -->  00:03:36,390
And you'll notice that everything in a model is just a percent of sales and so modelling is actually

56

00:03:36,390  -->  00:03:37,190
pretty easy.

57

00:03:37,190  -->  00:03:39,780
Scott to have two rules in mind number one.

58

00:03:40,160  -->  00:03:42,120
Everything almost as a percent of sales.

59

00:03:42,120  -->  00:03:44,430
Right so I spent a lot of time working on predicting sales.

60

00:03:44,430  -->  00:03:46,350
And secondly just look for patterns.

61

00:03:46,580  -->  00:03:47,690
It's not that hard.

62

00:03:47,790  -->  00:03:55,170
And then here we can see our EPS growth analysis and it seems to be accelerating because we think the

63

00:03:55,170  -->  00:03:57,280
company is going to cut expenses.

64

00:03:57,420  -->  00:04:02,400
The blue line here is revenue from model and the light blue line or that's like gray or whatever is

65

00:04:02,400  -->  00:04:05,500
expenses or I should say margins.

66

00:04:05,580  -->  00:04:10,860
And so although revenue growth is slowing which is okay it's big company margins are going to increase

67

00:04:10,860  -->  00:04:12,930
which is normal when growth slows.

68

00:04:12,930  -->  00:04:14,700
Usually you get margins increasing
