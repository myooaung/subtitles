1

00:00:00,510  -->  00:00:02,630
Let's talk about the quarterly earnings call.

2

00:00:03,000  -->  00:00:04,250
It's an amazing resource.

3

00:00:04,260  -->  00:00:05,410
It's incredible.

4

00:00:05,460  -->  00:00:10,530
It's amazing for many analysts on the buy side and the sell side because what happens is by law the

5

00:00:10,530  -->  00:00:16,800
company reporting earnings and companies report four times here they have to disclose all material risks

6

00:00:16,800  -->  00:00:16,850
.

7

00:00:16,860  -->  00:00:17,500
Right.

8

00:00:17,850  -->  00:00:24,450
And so sometimes the only opportunity investors get to listen to managements you know talk about how

9

00:00:24,450  -->  00:00:26,770
business is is during this call.

10

00:00:26,850  -->  00:00:27,490
OK.

11

00:00:27,670  -->  00:00:33,660
And so Horatio will get on the call and listen and so will know but sadly the sell say Alice will more

12

00:00:33,660  -->  00:00:36,150
than likely ask questions for the rest of us.

13

00:00:36,160  -->  00:00:36,700
OK.

14

00:00:37,050  -->  00:00:41,430
And she'll help us understand complex accounting issues as well.

15

00:00:41,670  -->  00:00:45,060
These earnings calls are usually save for at least 90 days.

16

00:00:45,060  -->  00:00:47,890
In case you missed the call and couldn't listen to it live.

17

00:00:48,000  -->  00:00:48,520
OK.

18

00:00:48,750  -->  00:00:51,780
And again we had the same access that everyone else does at the same time.

19

00:00:51,780  -->  00:00:56,910
So you can listen online live or you can listen later on in some companies even provide podcast which

20

00:00:56,910  -->  00:00:58,060
is awesome.

21

00:00:58,860  -->  00:01:01,540
And what happens is they start with the prepared script.

22

00:01:01,640  -->  00:01:02,040
OK.

23

00:01:02,040  -->  00:01:07,380
Investor Relations and a friend of mine Matt Sonnenfeld who's is probably the best investor relations

24

00:01:07,380  -->  00:01:08,880
guy out there.

25

00:01:09,030  -->  00:01:12,350
He'll read a script and he'll introduce the management team.

26

00:01:12,360  -->  00:01:17,610
And I'll also read some legal disclosures as well because they might be making comments about future

27

00:01:17,610  -->  00:01:18,180
guidance.

28

00:01:18,180  -->  00:01:18,570
OK.

29

00:01:18,570  -->  00:01:22,690
And lawyers love to get involved whenever that sort of thing happens.

30

00:01:22,740  -->  00:01:27,020
And so the sell side analysts will then ask questions towards the end of the earnings call.

31

00:01:27,030  -->  00:01:27,800
Right.

32

00:01:27,840  -->  00:01:30,400
It's also ask questions for us on our behalf.

33

00:01:30,490  -->  00:01:33,470
So which facial yields listener earnings calls anyway.

34

00:01:33,870  -->  00:01:37,360
Well it's usually just the sell side and the buy side.

35

00:01:37,460  -->  00:01:37,890
OK.

36

00:01:37,980  -->  00:01:42,850
That's obviously Sally and Horatio and not our bodies that are analysts.

37

00:01:43,140  -->  00:01:45,330
So the CEO talks about qualitative stuff.

38

00:01:45,330  -->  00:01:50,520
Then the CFO gets on and talks about quantitative stuff and then all three of those EXACT is we'll take

39

00:01:50,520  -->  00:01:53,870
questions at the end of the call and the call is usually less than an hour.

40

00:01:54,300  -->  00:02:02,070
So we're to listen to a little clip from an investor relations earnings call hosted by linked in OH
