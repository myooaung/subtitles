1

00:00:00,720  -->  00:00:05,670
The most successful financial analysts are very good at figuring out the size of the market that they're

2

00:00:05,670  -->  00:00:06,880
going to invest in.

3

00:00:06,990  -->  00:00:14,460
And we call this the Tambe or ATHM which stands for total addressable market and it's good to calculate

4

00:00:14,460  -->  00:00:17,990
the total addressable market before you do due diligence on a company.

5

00:00:18,330  -->  00:00:23,940
And after you make the financial model for that company a good sanity check is to make sure that the

6

00:00:23,940  -->  00:00:28,880
revenues for that company in the long run are way way smaller than the total addressable market.

7

00:00:29,310  -->  00:00:36,960
And so our case study in this section is linked and linked in is got three separate divisions right

8

00:00:36,970  -->  00:00:43,350
so it's a little bit complicated to calculate the total addressable market for LinkedIn but those are

9

00:00:43,350  -->  00:00:49,140
the three segments and I'll explain to you exactly what they do and then we'll discuss how to calculate

10

00:00:49,140  -->  00:00:50,490
the TAM.

11

00:00:50,580  -->  00:00:55,290
So after we look at the total addressable market we'll look at the financial model which is in the next

12

00:00:55,290  -->  00:00:57,080
lecture for Lankton.

13

00:00:57,150  -->  00:01:06,480
So let's kick off with the enterprise market the enterprise market for LinkedIn is basically human resource

14

00:01:06,480  -->  00:01:08,480
managers that use LinkedIn.

15

00:01:08,490  -->  00:01:16,290
In fact you can actually replace sometimes a bunch of human resources executives by just using LinkedIn

16

00:01:16,290  -->  00:01:18,770
to find potential recruits.

17

00:01:18,810  -->  00:01:22,700
So for recruiting prospective LinkedIn is amazing.

18

00:01:22,830  -->  00:01:28,260
Secondly we've got what's called the prosumer market and many of you and I actually use LinkedIn for

19

00:01:28,260  -->  00:01:33,700
this which allows you to contact strangers using in emails which is a great way to network.

20

00:01:33,720  -->  00:01:38,310
And number three the last total addressable market will be looking at is just the advertising market

21

00:01:38,340  -->  00:01:42,750
which means on the right hand side in LinkedIn you could see commercials or advertisements.

22

00:01:42,750  -->  00:01:43,930
It's that market.

23

00:01:44,190  -->  00:01:45,610
Ok cool.

24

00:01:45,930  -->  00:01:51,140
Let's size these markets and we'll kick it off with the enterprise market.

25

00:01:51,150  -->  00:01:53,380
Let's look at the total addressable market for this.

26

00:01:53,430  -->  00:01:54,630
How are we going to calculate that.

27

00:01:54,630  -->  00:02:02,760
So let's go to the World Bank's Web site and we can see the number of new companies being registered

28

00:02:02,850  -->  00:02:05,190
every single year in every country.

29

00:02:05,190  -->  00:02:05,580
OK.

30

00:02:05,580  -->  00:02:14,340
And so the average number of companies register as you can see there in each country is roughly 200000

31

00:02:14,370  -->  00:02:19,980
You could say it's to 50 or to 60 let's be conservative let's say 200000 companies are registered each

32

00:02:19,980  -->  00:02:22,390
year in about 200 countries.

33

00:02:22,560  -->  00:02:25,920
That gives you 40 million new companies every year.

34

00:02:26,400  -->  00:02:27,370
Okay great.

35

00:02:27,660  -->  00:02:30,740
And now we have the number of companies.

36

00:02:30,780  -->  00:02:37,950
Next up we need to find out the number of human resources employees that work at these 40 million companies

37

00:02:37,970  -->  00:02:38,550
.

38

00:02:39,090  -->  00:02:40,920
OK let's see how we're going to quantify this.

39

00:02:40,920  -->  00:02:41,510
OK.

40

00:02:41,670  -->  00:02:50,280
So in the Financial Times we can see here that the average company in Europe for example has six employees

41

00:02:50,290  -->  00:02:50,500
.

42

00:02:50,730  -->  00:02:51,380
OK.

43

00:02:51,540  -->  00:02:52,620
All right let's use that.

44

00:02:52,710  -->  00:02:54,130
Let's use that.

45

00:02:54,840  -->  00:02:55,450
OK.

46

00:02:55,500  -->  00:03:03,690
Here we go according to Business Management Daily It looks like if you take 2.4 percent of every company

47

00:03:03,860  -->  00:03:07,080
is an H.R. executive OK let's play around these numbers.

48

00:03:07,080  -->  00:03:07,520
Cool.

49

00:03:07,530  -->  00:03:09,030
I think what we're getting somewhere.

50

00:03:09,030  -->  00:03:09,450
All right.

51

00:03:09,510  -->  00:03:16,560
So if we take 40 million companies being created every year and we multiply those 40 million companies

52

00:03:17,160  -->  00:03:24,390
by six people and then 2.4 percent of those companies are H.R. executives then that's 5.7 million H.R.

53

00:03:24,480  -->  00:03:25,530
executives.

54

00:03:25,770  -->  00:03:27,480
Ok cool.

55

00:03:27,480  -->  00:03:28,230
Great.

56

00:03:28,230  -->  00:03:35,010
Now it looks like the average human resources employee makes about 50 grand per year.

57

00:03:35,010  -->  00:03:40,290
So let's just simply multiply those together to get our total addressable market and there you have

58

00:03:40,290  -->  00:03:40,580
it.

59

00:03:40,620  -->  00:03:43,130
It's $288 billion.

60

00:03:43,140  -->  00:03:47,300
That's the total size of the enterprise market for Linked In.

61

00:03:47,610  -->  00:03:49,770
Okay great.

62

00:03:49,770  -->  00:03:54,000
So we've done one third of the work here for our TAM or total just bull market.

63

00:03:54,000  -->  00:03:59,610
Next up let's look at the prosumer market and within the prosumer market.

64

00:03:59,670  -->  00:04:05,610
We can see that linked in has about just over 400 million subscribers right.

65

00:04:05,610  -->  00:04:09,870
They're not all paying subscribers but they're their users on the platform it's an amazing platform

66

00:04:09,870  -->  00:04:11,790
I love it in.

67

00:04:12,140  -->  00:04:19,080
It looks like their user total goal according to LinkedIn is $3 billion people I guess at a $7 in the

68

00:04:19,080  -->  00:04:23,690
world that they figure that just under 50 percent are potential customers.

69

00:04:24,420  -->  00:04:30,490
OK so if we look at for example how many credit cards if you're I don't think so.

70

00:04:30,930  -->  00:04:31,170
All right.

71

00:04:31,170  -->  00:04:37,170
So if we look at my LinkedIn account we can see that I pay twenty nine dollars per month.

72

00:04:37,920  -->  00:04:44,220
So if we assume that we have 3 million potential users if you get 100 percent penetration which will

73

00:04:44,220  -->  00:04:46,800
never happen but it's you know something we can aspire to here.

74

00:04:46,800  -->  00:04:55,330
Times 29 times 12 months equals a total addressable market of wait for it wait for it.

75

00:04:55,830  -->  00:04:57,930
So I'm trying to lose a little bit of humor here.

76

00:04:57,930  -->  00:05:00,100
I'm not sure if it's working out.

77

00:05:00,260  -->  00:05:03,800
Oh well here comes.

78

00:05:04,680  -->  00:05:05,390
Really.

79

00:05:05,440  -->  00:05:05,930
OK.

80

00:05:06,060  -->  00:05:13,190
It's jabbing here but it's there we go ah it's one point oh eight trillion dollars.

81

00:05:13,380  -->  00:05:13,900
Wow.

82

00:05:14,030  -->  00:05:16,140
That's a crap load of yeah.

83

00:05:16,210  -->  00:05:20,240
Anyway so that is the prosumer market.

84

00:05:20,250  -->  00:05:21,310
OK two for three now.

85

00:05:21,480  -->  00:05:24,330
And now let's calculate the advertising markets.

86

00:05:24,660  -->  00:05:26,220
OK.

87

00:05:26,220  -->  00:05:26,630
All right.

88

00:05:26,630  -->  00:05:27,540
Here we go.

89

00:05:27,930  -->  00:05:29,490
So this one's a lot easier.

90

00:05:29,490  -->  00:05:36,990
There's a ton of statistics out there so according to Zenith up to media there is an advertisement size

91

00:05:36,990  -->  00:05:43,560
of fifty seven point six billion dollars as of last year a little bit stale that's OK for the Internet

92

00:05:43,620  -->  00:05:47,970
ad spending market and so and of course linked they will never go 100 percent share of that but if you

93

00:05:47,970  -->  00:05:53,640
add up all three of these total addressable markets then there you go the total addressable market for

94

00:05:53,640  -->  00:05:58,690
LinkedIn is about 1.4 trillion dollars which is absolutely enormous.

95

00:05:58,980  -->  00:05:59,860
OK.

96

00:06:00,150  -->  00:06:04,770
So from a quantitative analysis perspective we've just done the total addressable market.

97

00:06:04,770  -->  00:06:10,130
And so the next step is to build the financial model which will start in the next section.
