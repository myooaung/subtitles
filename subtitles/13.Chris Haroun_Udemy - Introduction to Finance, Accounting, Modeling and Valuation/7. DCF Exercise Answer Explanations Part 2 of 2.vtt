00:00:00.870  -->  00:00:01.650
Just for fun.

2

00:00:01.710  -->  00:00:02.600
Watch this.

3

00:00:02.610  -->  00:00:03.070
OK.

4

00:00:03.300  -->  00:00:06.230
So if I had that all these again right.

5

00:00:06.240  -->  00:00:07.870
The value is nine.

6

00:00:07.890  -->  00:00:13.740
So if I'm not discounting any value at any rate right whatever happens.

7

00:00:14.010  -->  00:00:20.730
So I'm going to go here if I make this zero what happens.

8

00:00:20.880  -->  00:00:22.850
See it's the same thing.

9

00:00:23.010  -->  00:00:29.070
If I didn't have to pay interest on that right if I didn't use a discount rate and that 9 1 A 1 is net

10

00:00:29.070  -->  00:00:30.720
present by today.

11

00:00:30.980  -->  00:00:32.800
Control-C OK.

12

00:00:32.850  -->  00:00:34.650
Now watch this.

13

00:00:34.650  -->  00:00:39.100
Let's pretend that our rate was a lot higher.

14

00:00:39.210  -->  00:00:39.480
Right.

15

00:00:39.480  -->  00:00:44.680
So this is telling us our target price I'll get here second is 22 bucks.

16

00:00:44.680  -->  00:00:48.120
Can I assume orange is what we're looking at 20 bucks is our target price.

17

00:00:48.270  -->  00:00:55.110
Watch what happens if our rate goes from four teen to 20.

18

00:00:55.110  -->  00:01:00.060
Do you think our target price is going to go up or down from 22 bucks.

19

00:01:00.060  -->  00:01:01.990
What do you think.

20

00:01:02.160  -->  00:01:03.240
Right.

21

00:01:03.480  -->  00:01:07.150
If our interest rate is higher here that means that we're riskier company.

22

00:01:07.230  -->  00:01:12.920
So that means higher price should go down a lot and it does.

23

00:01:12.960  -->  00:01:14.900
We went from 22 to 13.

24

00:01:15.240  -->  00:01:17.760
So he controls igo back to 13.

25

00:01:17.760  -->  00:01:18.700
Now watch this.

26

00:01:18.750  -->  00:01:21.720
Let's pretend we're a much better company right.

27

00:01:21.720  -->  00:01:27.600
We're actually just take the beta take the beta and cut in half whatever happens the interest rate here

28

00:01:29.340  -->  00:01:32.530
goes down 8.4 percent where lower risk company.

29

00:01:32.640  -->  00:01:33.150
Right.

30

00:01:33.420  -->  00:01:37.850
And then let me ask you this if our bet is one which means our interest rate is lower here.

31

00:01:37.890  -->  00:01:44.500
Our blended cost capital interest rate what happens to our target price.

32

00:01:44.970  -->  00:01:46.700
What happens to the free cash flows.

33

00:01:47.500  -->  00:01:52.500
Well the value free cash flows can be a lot higher because our interest rate is lower now because our

34

00:01:52.810  -->  00:01:57.980
IT says look the NPV first see what we calculate and then move it into Tartarus.

35

00:01:58.140  -->  00:02:00.330
So NPB before was 5000 something.

36

00:02:00.380  -->  00:02:03.090
This is now six thousand close to 7000 right.

37

00:02:03.090  -->  00:02:09.540
It went up because our cost of capital went down a lot and our tire price went from 20 bucks that weren't

38

00:02:09.570  -->  00:02:13.980
sell them much higher 46 than that on a level.

39

00:02:14.610  -->  00:02:19.340
So let me just and do that's Ccapac make sure all of this is cleared like that.

40

00:02:19.380  -->  00:02:19.780
Great.

41

00:02:19.830  -->  00:02:23.700
So we've got our net present value right and again that's all the future cash flows.

42

00:02:23.810  -->  00:02:27.120
This count using the rate we calculated into today's terms.

43

00:02:27.620  -->  00:02:28.700
Okay.

44

00:02:28.710  -->  00:02:33.760
And then you're like well hold on Chris it doesn't make sense because why are you assuming the company

45

00:02:33.760  -->  00:02:35.790
is valued off of these cash flows as well.

46

00:02:35.790  -->  00:02:41.460
I mean only but what would happen if like the company operated for a long time like for infinity and

47

00:02:41.460  -->  00:02:43.760
then you know the answer there is you're right you're right.

48

00:02:43.800  -->  00:02:48.930
We have to account for the 2021 to 22 all the way up until like for ever.

49

00:02:48.930  -->  00:02:49.830
Right.

50

00:02:49.830  -->  00:02:50.730
So how do we do that.

51

00:02:50.880  -->  00:02:52.600
Well that's called the terminal value.

52

00:02:52.620  -->  00:02:57.030
It's kind of a dumb name terminal value.

53

00:02:57.060  -->  00:02:57.590
All right.

54

00:02:57.810  -->  00:03:00.360
So we have to calculate with the terminal values.

55

00:03:00.480  -->  00:03:04.050
And once we find out what that terminal value is right it's right here right.

56

00:03:04.050  -->  00:03:09.180
Basically in this year you can take all the future cash flows this comes to this term you have the discount

57

00:03:09.210  -->  00:03:11.280
that's that one big number two today.

58

00:03:11.430  -->  00:03:14.120
So let's do it.

59

00:03:16.740  -->  00:03:17.000
Yes.

60

00:03:17.010  -->  00:03:17.780
First try.

61

00:03:18.090  -->  00:03:18.300
OK.

62

00:03:18.300  -->  00:03:22.610
So our long term growth the company in this assumption what's the long term growth of our company.

63

00:03:22.620  -->  00:03:23.490
Well it's 2 percent.

64

00:03:23.490  -->  00:03:24.140
Right.

65

00:03:24.600  -->  00:03:28.890
And I gave that to you and you could say well wait a second because you know the long term growth rate

66

00:03:28.890  -->  00:03:30.520
the companies 2 percent that's pretty low.

67

00:03:30.540  -->  00:03:32.540
I'm sure some companies will grow much faster that.

68

00:03:32.560  -->  00:03:35.810
Well the answer is no they don't and it's not their fault.

69

00:03:35.810  -->  00:03:36.940
They just got too big.

70

00:03:36.990  -->  00:03:37.300
Right.

71

00:03:37.310  -->  00:03:43.490
And big companies just can't grow unless they buy other companies right and use their own cash.

72

00:03:43.770  -->  00:03:44.460
And so.

73

00:03:44.460  -->  00:03:46.080
Or shares whatever it is.

74

00:03:46.080  -->  00:03:50.400
So if you think about the U.S. economy and I mention this before it the U.S. economy is massive it's

75

00:03:50.400  -->  00:03:56.120
25 percent of the revenue of the world and the revenue of the world is just gross domestic product.

76

00:03:56.160  -->  00:04:04.080
So 25 percent of the world's market cap so to speak is or revenue is in the United States and the United

77

00:04:04.080  -->  00:04:08.370
States because it's so big it just can't grow rice can't grow anymore it's huge.

78

00:04:08.380  -->  00:04:09.410
It's like IBM.

79

00:04:09.420  -->  00:04:14.040
IBM doesn't really grow as much in Oracle to grow or ACL it's not growing as much because they're just

80

00:04:14.040  -->  00:04:16.140
big mature companies because they're successful.

81

00:04:16.140  -->  00:04:17.650
They cut back.

82

00:04:17.820  -->  00:04:21.300
And so that's why companies like like Oracle buy a lot of other companies just to grow.

83

00:04:21.390  -->  00:04:22.800
And that's a off topic sorry.

84

00:04:23.080  -->  00:04:25.660
But anyway so our long term growth rate is 2 percent.

85

00:04:25.680  -->  00:04:26.000
Right.

86

00:04:26.010  -->  00:04:30.270
And I've seen numbers that are two and a half three percent whatever and as low as 1 right your personal

87

00:04:30.270  -->  00:04:35.850
company longer term you're look to short it just assume 1 percent and we'll play around these numbers

88

00:04:35.850  -->  00:04:36.320
in a second.

89

00:04:36.390  -->  00:04:36.630
OK.

90

00:04:36.630  -->  00:04:41.520
So our launch and growth rate is that right in our terminal value.

91

00:04:41.520  -->  00:04:44.780
Is this calculation ready.

92

00:04:45.690  -->  00:04:54.270
What you do is this you take our final year 2020 you grow it one more year which is 2 percent growth

93

00:04:54.630  -->  00:05:01.290
and then you divide it by the cost of your capital which is 14 percent minus the growth rate.

94

00:05:01.420  -->  00:05:10.080
Okay let's go up here and take a look see what's covered that that show you taking your final year you're

95

00:05:10.080  -->  00:05:16.740
growing at one more year which means one plus the growth rate which is there.

96

00:05:17.340  -->  00:05:23.640
And then what you're doing is you're dividing it by this interest rate minus the growth rate which is

97

00:05:23.760  -->  00:05:29.130
to the get an answer and that's a terminal value.

98

00:05:29.120  -->  00:05:29.810
Right.

99

00:05:29.810  -->  00:05:37.040
So in the year 2020 or so right here or whatever right around this level here you're terminal value

100

00:05:37.050  -->  00:05:39.990
is all future cash flows right.

101

00:05:39.990  -->  00:05:45.120
Using the long term growth rate and the way the average cost capital right and then you're like well

102

00:05:45.140  -->  00:05:47.210
pull a second you got to discount that as well.

103

00:05:47.250  -->  00:05:47.710
Right.

104

00:05:47.730  -->  00:05:50.370
So we did it we just count it by four years.

105

00:05:50.430  -->  00:05:54.110
We took thirty three point eight which is right here right.

106

00:05:54.120  -->  00:05:54.940
Thirty three point eight.

107

00:05:54.940  -->  00:05:58.130
Count one two three four actually before because to be right here.

108

00:05:58.370  -->  00:05:59.280
OK.

109

00:05:59.690  -->  00:05:59.920
All right.

110

00:05:59.940  -->  00:06:03.810
So that is what she got.

111

00:06:03.810  -->  00:06:04.620
Now watch this.

112

00:06:04.620  -->  00:06:10.980
It's the long term growth rate went from two to three and I'm going to hold down as well or this three

113

00:06:12.220  -->  00:06:13.240
right.

114

00:06:13.420  -->  00:06:17.300
It's now terminal light is 37.

115

00:06:18.560  -->  00:06:22.230
Pretty amazing if it was one.

116

00:06:22.230  -->  00:06:26.110
Whatever happens our value goes down.

117

00:06:26.250  -->  00:06:28.050
Right because our long term growth rate is lower.

118

00:06:28.130  -->  00:06:31.980
And the reason I want to pull this up here is because this is the sense to me and also I'll get to in

119

00:06:31.980  -->  00:06:36.460
a second but I want to show you have got growth here and we average cost capital.

120

00:06:36.470  -->  00:06:40.290
What happens if I increase or decrease our discount rate.

121

00:06:40.280  -->  00:06:42.440
And what happens if I increase or decrease or growth what happens there.

122

00:06:42.530  -->  00:06:42.740
Right.

123

00:06:42.750  -->  00:06:44.370
And you'll see in a second.

124

00:06:44.980  -->  00:06:45.910
OK.

125

00:06:45.950  -->  00:06:51.740
Now what is the value of our company based on all that research.

126

00:06:52.560  -->  00:06:55.180
Well we just took this off here.

127

00:06:55.230  -->  00:06:55.800
Sorry.

128

00:06:56.150  -->  00:07:03.480
So the value is going to be the target equity value minus debt right and the equity value.

129

00:07:03.490  -->  00:07:05.220
Is that right.

130

00:07:05.390  -->  00:07:06.660
Plus Net Present Value right.

131

00:07:06.690  -->  00:07:09.050
That's these years here.

132

00:07:09.060  -->  00:07:10.440
That's the MPB we calculate.

133

00:07:10.470  -->  00:07:13.010
And then right here in infinit has Tourmalet.

134

00:07:13.010  -->  00:07:13.810
Right.

135

00:07:13.820  -->  00:07:15.610
So those two values.

136

00:07:15.690  -->  00:07:16.330
Right.

137

00:07:16.390  -->  00:07:18.240
Boom boom.

138

00:07:18.690  -->  00:07:22.010
That's our Yes count minus that which is the minimum.

139

00:07:22.010  -->  00:07:25.080
It's like 10 bucks and that's the target value of the company.

140

00:07:25.120  -->  00:07:25.420
Right.

141

00:07:25.440  -->  00:07:26.700
And the number shares is there.

142

00:07:26.860  -->  00:07:27.370
Right got it.

143

00:07:27.380  -->  00:07:31.970
And there what happens if we have only 100 shares much higher.

144

00:07:31.980  -->  00:07:34.090
So that's why I mean play around these numbers a lot.

145

00:07:34.130  -->  00:07:34.620
OK.

146

00:07:34.710  -->  00:07:37.880
I really want you to understand finance and not memorize it.

147

00:07:37.880  -->  00:07:40.370
It makes it so much more fun to tap.

148

00:07:40.440  -->  00:07:43.590
You'll find most your competitors will just memorize this stuff they don't really understand it.

149

00:07:43.680  -->  00:07:48.240
And I wrote here what's the target price per share assuming we have cost cut costs capital of 11 percent

150

00:07:48.620  -->  00:07:49.210
.

151

00:07:49.280  -->  00:07:52.620
I should actually see eleven point three sorry three percent.

152

00:07:52.630  -->  00:08:00.470
In long term growth rate of 3 right and the math here is it looks complicated.

153

00:08:00.470  -->  00:08:00.770
Right.

154

00:08:00.770  -->  00:08:02.390
I know it's complicated right.

155

00:08:02.430  -->  00:08:05.650
It's basically just everything we've done right.

156

00:08:05.660  -->  00:08:10.400
It basically says well the value of the company is going to be the net present value right of those

157

00:08:10.400  -->  00:08:14.550
cash flows Plus the terminal value discounted as well.

158

00:08:14.610  -->  00:08:15.410
Right.

159

00:08:15.410  -->  00:08:17.730
Minus the debt we have right.

160

00:08:17.730  -->  00:08:19.750
Divided by the number of shares.

161

00:08:20.060  -->  00:08:25.730
And if you didn't divide by the number of shares what happens is it's going to give you the target market

162

00:08:25.760  -->  00:08:26.690
cap of the company.

163

00:08:26.730  -->  00:08:27.590
Right.

164

00:08:27.770  -->  00:08:33.990
If that's the target market cap of the company market cap memories just shares times the times the price

165

00:08:34.190  -->  00:08:40.870
happens if go here and divide it by 1 1 6 5 is the number of shares wups miscue.

166

00:08:40.910  -->  00:08:49.300
So I go here divide by 1 1 6 5 thirty three point four seven right there.

167

00:08:49.320  -->  00:08:50.670
Three three fourths of the.

168

00:08:50.730  -->  00:08:52.190
Got it.

169

00:08:52.270  -->  00:08:56.060
And so remember here with our terminal value right.

170

00:08:56.100  -->  00:08:58.620
You divide it up by the discount rate.

171

00:08:58.640  -->  00:09:00.820
Modest long term growth rate and you might say hello.

172

00:09:00.860  -->  00:09:02.200
And Chris.

173

00:09:02.250  -->  00:09:05.550
What if the discount rate is less than the growth rate.

174

00:09:05.970  -->  00:09:07.080
It never will be.

175

00:09:07.290  -->  00:09:14.300
It never will be because in the long run companies can't grow more in a couple percents right now.

176

00:09:14.880  -->  00:09:17.980
OK so if we go here we play these numbers you like Chris.

177

00:09:17.990  -->  00:09:18.780
I disagree.

178

00:09:18.770  -->  00:09:21.770
Going up 4 percent lower to type that up.

179

00:09:21.750  -->  00:09:22.340
Look what happens.

180

00:09:22.350  -->  00:09:24.380
All these numbers change right.

181

00:09:24.440  -->  00:09:25.620
It can.

182

00:09:25.760  -->  00:09:26.760
And then watch this.

183

00:09:26.820  -->  00:09:30.920
If you're like OK Chris I get it you've got all these levels you're deducting kind of 300 basis points

184

00:09:31.010  -->  00:09:32.040
here from each one of us.

185

00:09:32.180  -->  00:09:38.210
When they say three basis points I mean three percent a basis point is point 0 1 of a percent 100 basis

186

00:09:38.220  -->  00:09:39.310
points is just one percent.

187

00:09:39.410  -->  00:09:41.510
Just nerd finals talk.

188

00:09:41.900  -->  00:09:42.630
OK.

189

00:09:42.870  -->  00:09:47.580
You play these numbers but this is awesome so portfolio managers love this stuff.

190

00:09:47.730  -->  00:09:48.530
Right.

191

00:09:48.540  -->  00:09:52.900
Because you know a lot of times I'll disagree with you when you do a model with a few with them.

192

00:09:52.890  -->  00:09:53.220
Right.

193

00:09:53.230  -->  00:09:54.530
And it looks like we'll see.

194

00:09:54.540  -->  00:09:59.140
Chris I don't agree with your your rate and you're like ok that's cool.

195

00:09:59.150  -->  00:10:01.710
Look here's a sense saving us a bunch of other rates.

196

00:10:01.740  -->  00:10:04.100
They'll say Well I'll agree with your growth rates.

197

00:10:04.130  -->  00:10:06.120
Long term I mean up the discount rate you like.

198

00:10:06.180  -->  00:10:06.640
OK.

199

00:10:06.640  -->  00:10:10.230
So we meant well look at this here either different growth rates.

200

00:10:10.300  -->  00:10:15.560
And so what I always do is I love to look at this table because there's three different cases.

201

00:10:15.560  -->  00:10:17.690
Remember Goldilocks and three bears right.

202

00:10:17.790  -->  00:10:20.600
There is just one suit to suit cool.

203

00:10:20.610  -->  00:10:22.070
This was just right.

204

00:10:22.080  -->  00:10:26.670
So I usually take this is the ace case target price.

205

00:10:27.300  -->  00:10:30.850
And that's the bullish target price and that's the bearish target price.

206

00:10:30.880  -->  00:10:31.450
OK.
