00:00:00.240  -->  00:00:03.270
Yahoo Finance is an amazing free resource.

2

00:00:03.300  -->  00:00:03.880
OK.

3

00:00:04.080  -->  00:00:07.380
And a lot of information you can get for free and Yahoo Finance.

4

00:00:07.380  -->  00:00:10.160
You have to pay thousands of dollars for it for Bloomberg.

5

00:00:10.290  -->  00:00:11.020
OK.

6

00:00:11.220  -->  00:00:14.040
So since our case staying this course is linked in.

7

00:00:14.310  -->  00:00:18.390
Let's check out linked in using Yahoo Finance.

8

00:00:18.390  -->  00:00:23.160
Yahoo isn't the only one I mean there's a lot of other great finance websites out there but you can

9

00:00:23.160  -->  00:00:25.640
get almost everything for free now.

10

00:00:25.800  -->  00:00:28.710
OK so let's check out linked in here.

11

00:00:28.800  -->  00:00:29.550
OK.

12

00:00:29.970  -->  00:00:36.840
And we already went to see talk of an Investor Relations Web site so this is just another way to find

13

00:00:36.840  -->  00:00:38.850
cool information on the company.

14

00:00:38.970  -->  00:00:39.180
Right.

15

00:00:39.180  -->  00:00:43.950
And so you can do information on options if you're interested in doing options.

16

00:00:43.950  -->  00:00:45.480
This used to only work on Bloomberg.

17

00:00:45.480  -->  00:00:50.850
Years ago we seize a function called O M O and or options monitor all of this stuff is available now

18

00:00:50.860  -->  00:00:52.240
it's unbelievable.

19

00:00:52.410  -->  00:00:52.650
Right.

20

00:00:52.650  -->  00:00:59.340
And so from an analyst due diligence perspective you can read the press releases here or you can just

21

00:00:59.340  -->  00:01:01.850
go to cover the company's Web site.

22

00:01:01.860  -->  00:01:06.220
This is kind of a cooler easier to use portal than the aforementioned sources though.

23

00:01:06.240  -->  00:01:08.070
You can read up on the company here.

24

00:01:08.070  -->  00:01:12.000
Find out who the competitors are if they list it actually it's soothsayers.

25

00:01:12.030  -->  00:01:13.410
Be interesting.

26

00:01:14.070  -->  00:01:16.580
Montsoreau what that really Facebook.

27

00:01:16.590  -->  00:01:18.740
Well you got to do your own research as well it's not.

28

00:01:18.780  -->  00:01:23.730
It's not the absolute best resource when it comes to due diligence from a qualitative perspective but

29

00:01:24.030  -->  00:01:30.540
the quantitative perspective you can get a lot of cool stuff here for free like statistics on different

30

00:01:30.540  -->  00:01:33.750
profitability metrics which we talked about earlier in this course.

31

00:01:33.780  -->  00:01:34.610
Right.

32

00:01:34.650  -->  00:01:35.590
Pretty cool.

33

00:01:35.850  -->  00:01:36.730
Well now check this out.

34

00:01:36.780  -->  00:01:39.300
You can see how many shares are short as well.

35

00:01:39.450  -->  00:01:44.500
And that's important because if you look at the average daily trading volume and the number of shares

36

00:01:44.500  -->  00:01:47.670
that are short you can figure out what's called the short ratio.

37

00:01:47.670  -->  00:01:48.370
Right.

38

00:01:48.400  -->  00:01:54.190
And so only 3 percent of the old saying shares are short right now it's not that much.

39

00:01:54.240  -->  00:01:54.870
Right.

40

00:01:55.260  -->  00:02:00.560
So it's not as if companies have a large percentage of their shares that are short then.

41

00:02:00.570  -->  00:02:07.140
I personally don't like to short those companies because if any slightly less bad news or slightly good

42

00:02:07.140  -->  00:02:10.350
news occurs everybody covers the stock was up a lot.

43

00:02:10.850  -->  00:02:12.900
Let's see what else we have here.

44

00:02:12.900  -->  00:02:21.180
All right we've got the industry analyst opinion with us so we can find out what analysts think of stocks

45

00:02:21.630  -->  00:02:26.010
right and what the recent upgrades or downgrades have been and this is.

46

00:02:26.010  -->  00:02:27.510
This is from the sell side right.

47

00:02:27.510  -->  00:02:31.560
So remember early in this course we talked about Salyer or sell side analyst.

48

00:02:31.650  -->  00:02:37.470
She she covers a lot of these Internet stocks all these downgrades.

49

00:02:37.470  -->  00:02:40.780
I love buying stocks when Wall Street downgrades them.

50

00:02:41.160  -->  00:02:47.100
So I think what happened was when LinkedIn reported their Q4 results early in 2016 the numbers went

51

00:02:47.100  -->  00:02:47.940
down a lot.

52

00:02:48.150  -->  00:02:52.770
And you can take a look at that chart you'll see that it gapped down and so a lot of analysts downgraded

53

00:02:52.770  -->  00:02:52.920
it.

54

00:02:52.980  -->  00:02:59.640
But my my personal perspective is that you know if if my numbers in five or ten years from now are going

55

00:02:59.640  -->  00:03:03.960
down a lot because of what earnings call maybe I look to sell the stock otherwise I'll see this as a

56

00:03:03.960  -->  00:03:05.920
great buying opportunity to be honest.

57

00:03:06.240  -->  00:03:10.130
And you can see here even how many buy ratings are in the stock.

58

00:03:10.140  -->  00:03:12.470
How many holds that sort of thing.

59

00:03:12.630  -->  00:03:15.000
And how many underperforms or sells.

60

00:03:15.030  -->  00:03:20.510
Not that many it's not a surprise because this is a secular growth companies and this is cool here.

61

00:03:20.520  -->  00:03:23.100
You can find out the analysts estimates.

62

00:03:23.100  -->  00:03:23.970
Right.

63

00:03:23.970  -->  00:03:27.400
So you can find out what the Street is thinking.

64

00:03:27.680  -->  00:03:28.080
OK.

65

00:03:28.080  -->  00:03:35.190
On each quarter each year and then you can compare and contrast what your estimates are for that current

66

00:03:35.190  -->  00:03:41.790
quarter or current year or next year or even care to see if your estimates are above or below the street

67

00:03:41.810  -->  00:03:41.930
.

68

00:03:42.030  -->  00:03:43.230
OK.

69

00:03:43.530  -->  00:03:46.470
So let's see what else we have got major holders.

70

00:03:46.470  -->  00:03:48.490
This is a great resource.

71

00:03:49.500  -->  00:03:55.860
OK so you can tell that you know Jeff Wiener is a big holder obviously he's a CEO there's a CFO there

72

00:03:56.190  -->  00:03:58.110
the top institutional holders.

73

00:03:58.110  -->  00:04:03.030
You've got capital which is in Los Angeles are probably the best mutual fund out there.

74

00:04:03.030  -->  00:04:05.270
You to euro price which is also great.

75

00:04:05.310  -->  00:04:10.830
They're located in the Maryland area on the East Coast the United States and you can just see the rest

76

00:04:10.830  -->  00:04:12.320
here.

77

00:04:12.660  -->  00:04:13.420
Pretty cool.

78

00:04:13.470  -->  00:04:14.440
Pretty cool.

79

00:04:14.490  -->  00:04:20.220
And you can see insider transactions here as well meaning which executives were buying or selling the

80

00:04:20.220  -->  00:04:21.390
shares.

81

00:04:21.570  -->  00:04:26.040
You have the CEO selling some shares here at $6 is not a good sign.

82

00:04:26.040  -->  00:04:30.710
That being said that's a small percent for him of the number of shares he has.

83

00:04:30.740  -->  00:04:32.180
Yes a ton right.

84

00:04:32.190  -->  00:04:33.000
Amazing.

85

00:04:33.020  -->  00:04:38.970
Anyway there's something called behavioral finance where you can map what management has done with their

86

00:04:38.970  -->  00:04:43.020
shares historically and decide if it's a good time to buy or sell the stock.

87

00:04:43.020  -->  00:04:48.090
It doesn't always help though in terms of calling tops and bottoms and stocks.

88

00:04:48.090  -->  00:04:53.860
I remember when I was an investor in Activision years ago the CEO his name was Bobby Kodak.

89

00:04:53.850  -->  00:04:57.510
And every time he bought shares we would buy it every time he sold shares.

90

00:04:57.510  -->  00:04:58.160
We would sell.

91

00:04:58.180  -->  00:05:02.210
There is a high correlation there and you can also get press releases here.

92

00:05:02.220  -->  00:05:04.950
And I love using Yahoo for press releases.

93

00:05:04.950  -->  00:05:08.410
Yahoo finance that is because it's a free repository.

94

00:05:08.430  -->  00:05:14.640
And most major press releases that matter are listed here such as when the company releases earnings

95

00:05:14.850  -->  00:05:19.110
that sort of thing and that summarizes Yahoo Finance.

96

00:05:19.110  -->  00:05:20.770
But Yahoo finance isn't the only one.

97

00:05:20.770  -->  00:05:25.470
Obviously there are a lot of other great ones out there but I've been using this one for years and I

98

00:05:25.470  -->  00:05:27.650
think it's probably one of the better ones.
