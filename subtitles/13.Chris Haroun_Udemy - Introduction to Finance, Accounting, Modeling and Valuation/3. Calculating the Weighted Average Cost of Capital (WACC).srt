1

00:00:00,270  -->  00:00:02,210
All right we're almost done with DCF.

2

00:00:02,340  -->  00:00:06,910
One more thing though and that one more thing is the interest rate.

3

00:00:07,080  -->  00:00:10,180
Remember before it was 7 percent we just accepted that.

4

00:00:10,440  -->  00:00:12,410
Well now you're going to calculate an interest rate.

5

00:00:12,450  -->  00:00:13,000
OK.

6

00:00:13,170  -->  00:00:16,320
And that's called the weighted average cost of capital.

7

00:00:16,410  -->  00:00:16,730
OK.

8

00:00:16,740  -->  00:00:20,460
So your interest rate was seven we also call that the discount rate.

9

00:00:20,460  -->  00:00:20,670
Right.

10

00:00:20,670  -->  00:00:21,620
Just another word for it.

11

00:00:21,630  -->  00:00:23,920
The discount rate was 7 percent OK.

12

00:00:24,270  -->  00:00:29,810
So now that was your whack also by the way the discount rate is also called the whack.

13

00:00:29,820  -->  00:00:30,120
OK.

14

00:00:30,120  -->  00:00:33,720
So from now on when we talk about the interest rate which is the same thing as discount rate.

15

00:00:33,720  -->  00:00:34,620
It's called the whack.

16

00:00:34,770  -->  00:00:35,260
OK.

17

00:00:35,490  -->  00:00:37,910
The weighted average cost of capital.

18

00:00:37,920  -->  00:00:39,250
So how do we calculate the work.

19

00:00:39,330  -->  00:00:44,760
Well the weighted average cost of capital or the W.A.C.C. equals the cost for your company to use debt

20

00:00:45,270  -->  00:00:48,130
plus the costs for your company to use equity.

21

00:00:48,240  -->  00:00:51,520
When that door will go in more detail in a second.

22

00:00:51,630  -->  00:00:52,400
All right.

23

00:00:52,760  -->  00:00:59,280
So you take the costs for your company use debt and then you multiply it by the percent of capital that

24

00:00:59,280  -->  00:01:00,560
you're going to use that's debt.

25

00:01:00,570  -->  00:01:01,060
OK.

26

00:01:01,230  -->  00:01:03,960
So your capital is either debt or equity.

27

00:01:03,990  -->  00:01:05,390
Stay with me here.

28

00:01:06,000  -->  00:01:06,630
OK.

29

00:01:06,840  -->  00:01:07,690
Simplify it.

30

00:01:08,040  -->  00:01:15,030
So the cost used that times the percent of your capital structure that's debt plus the cost use equity

31

00:01:15,030  -->  00:01:18,130
times the percent of your capital structure that's equity.

32

00:01:18,130  -->  00:01:18,960
Okay.

33

00:01:19,560  -->  00:01:22,710
So costs are used at plus the cost use equity.

34

00:01:23,370  -->  00:01:30,690
Okay costs to use debt times the percent of that cost to use debt including tax benefits times the percent

35

00:01:30,690  -->  00:01:31,610
of debt.

36

00:01:31,920  -->  00:01:34,640
Now we use debt you get a tax benefit for using it.

37

00:01:34,710  -->  00:01:35,610
Right.

38

00:01:35,760  -->  00:01:39,240
So cost used at times when my tax rate.

39

00:01:39,570  -->  00:01:45,640
Now let's assume that 40 percent of the capital in our company is debt and 60 percent is equity and

40

00:01:45,640  -->  00:01:46,390
cash.

41

00:01:47,250  -->  00:01:51,760
So we'll replace that there. Times 40 percent and we'll put 60 percent there for that.

42

00:01:51,810  -->  00:01:53,370
Boy OK.

43

00:01:53,820  -->  00:01:56,880
And let's assume that the tax rate is 30 percent never calculate tax rate.

44

00:01:56,880  -->  00:02:01,100
Just ask the company or look at historical tax rate they use this to heart.

45

00:02:01,230  -->  00:02:08,400
So 30 percent right cost used debt times one minus 30 percent which is point three times 40 percent

46

00:02:08,400  -->  00:02:09,470
.

47

00:02:09,480  -->  00:02:09,720
All right.

48

00:02:09,720  -->  00:02:12,100
We're getting there now.

49

00:02:12,180  -->  00:02:14,600
Let's assume a bank loan would be 5 percent.

50

00:02:14,710  -->  00:02:16,980
OK someone's going to give you access to that right.

51

00:02:16,980  -->  00:02:19,250
They set the terms because you're getting a loan from that.

52

00:02:19,710  -->  00:02:21,530
So 5 percent.

53

00:02:21,750  -->  00:02:28,980
So 5 percent Times point seven percent times 40 percent . OK OK we're getting there. We're getting there

54

00:02:28,980  -->  00:02:30,710
.

55

00:02:30,900  -->  00:02:32,130
All right so we're done with debt.

56

00:02:32,220  -->  00:02:34,620
Our debt is 1.4 percent.

57

00:02:34,890  -->  00:02:36,740
Let's focus on the cost to use equity now.

58

00:02:36,810  -->  00:02:37,440
OK.

59

00:02:37,710  -->  00:02:44,170
So the cost to use equity time 60 percent is the remainder of the equation.

60

00:02:44,370  -->  00:02:47,250
And once we calculate that then we have the weighted average cost capital.

61

00:02:47,250  -->  00:02:50,340
So let's just tuck away the debt up in the corner of Erica.

62

00:02:50,460  -->  00:02:51,630
All right.

63

00:02:51,630  -->  00:02:52,610
So.

64

00:02:53,300  -->  00:02:55,090
So how do you calculate the costs of equity.

65

00:02:55,170  -->  00:02:57,490
Well here's how you do it cost.

66

00:02:57,510  -->  00:02:58,980
Equity equals 60 percent.

67

00:02:59,000  -->  00:02:59,220
Right.

68

00:02:59,250  -->  00:03:02,450
Which is remember 60 percent of our capital structure is equity 40 percent.

69

00:03:02,460  -->  00:03:06,570
That 60 percent times the cheapest rate out there.

70

00:03:06,780  -->  00:03:12,390
Plus how volatile the stock is compared to the stock market times what we think the stock market will

71

00:03:12,390  -->  00:03:13,290
do.

72

00:03:13,350  -->  00:03:15,490
Mine is the cheapest rate out there.

73

00:03:15,540  -->  00:03:18,520
Let me add to this to simplify it.

74

00:03:18,870  -->  00:03:23,400
The cheapest rate out there is called the risk free rate and it's basically the government rate of interest

75

00:03:23,480  -->  00:03:23,720
.

76

00:03:23,710  -->  00:03:25,770
OK you can use one two or three percent.

77

00:03:25,770  -->  00:03:29,800
I've seen people use 1 percent and two and a half percent recently in cash.

78

00:03:30,000  -->  00:03:34,400
So let's just use 2 1/2 percent.

79

00:03:34,710  -->  00:03:36,540
Then you add how volatile the stock is.

80

00:03:36,540  -->  00:03:38,100
That's called the base of.

81

00:03:38,880  -->  00:03:39,610
What is the beta.

82

00:03:39,620  -->  00:03:40,890
Let's talk with us.

83

00:03:40,940  -->  00:03:48,900
OK well the bay that measures how your stock that you're analyzing moves relative to the stock market

84

00:03:48,910  -->  00:03:48,970
.

85

00:03:49,020  -->  00:03:49,630
OK.

86

00:03:49,890  -->  00:03:52,520
And let's look at a little example here.

87

00:03:52,590  -->  00:03:56,220
You've got time on the x axis and the price of a stock on the waxes.

88

00:03:56,300  -->  00:03:56,910
OK.

89

00:03:57,240  -->  00:03:59,920
That is the S&P 500 that's the index let's just say.

90

00:04:00,060  -->  00:04:00,530
OK.

91

00:04:00,720  -->  00:04:04,400
And that represents all stocks out there in a certain index.

92

00:04:04,800  -->  00:04:05,430
There it is.

93

00:04:05,490  -->  00:04:06,620
The stock market.

94

00:04:06,750  -->  00:04:09,090
So the beta of the stock market is one.

95

00:04:09,330  -->  00:04:10,390
OK.

96

00:04:10,710  -->  00:04:15,690
It's always one because we're going to calculate or actually we're going to show you what the fate of

97

00:04:15,690  -->  00:04:16,750
our company is.

98

00:04:16,830  -->  00:04:20,030
Our company is at orange line there is really volatile right.

99

00:04:20,040  -->  00:04:21,610
It's a high risk company.

100

00:04:21,870  -->  00:04:26,070
So we're twice as volatile as the market right.

101

00:04:26,150  -->  00:04:29,710
It's just calculous the rise over the month were prices of all time as the market.

102

00:04:29,730  -->  00:04:30,330
Right.

103

00:04:30,930  -->  00:04:35,100
And so our stocks Bayda in this case is too right.

104

00:04:35,490  -->  00:04:40,670
And usually you can get Beta's from free sources out there but you can even calculate if you wanted

105

00:04:40,680  -->  00:04:40,950
to.

106

00:04:40,950  -->  00:04:42,480
But it's not worth your time.

107

00:04:42,480  -->  00:04:45,810
So again our stock is twice as risky as the market right.

108

00:04:45,870  -->  00:04:50,970
So we're going to multiply two times the rest of the stuff there if our stock was less risky than the

109

00:04:50,970  -->  00:04:57,900
market so it was only a beta a point eight right then our overall weighted average cost capital be lower

110

00:04:58,180  -->  00:04:58,580
cut.

111

00:04:58,710  -->  00:05:00,750
So we're factor in volatility here.

112

00:05:00,840  -->  00:05:02,130
Pretty cool.

113

00:05:02,130  -->  00:05:02,460
All right.

114

00:05:02,460  -->  00:05:04,260
What do the stock market will do now.

115

00:05:04,380  -->  00:05:11,520
OK so this is debatable and I'm I'm not the hugest fan of DCF to be honest because there's so many independent

116

00:05:11,520  -->  00:05:12,080
variables.

117

00:05:12,090  -->  00:05:15,200
You know if X plus one equals four we know exis three.

118

00:05:15,260  -->  00:05:18,660
I tell you x plus why post Q plus W. equals for what is X Exactly.

119

00:05:18,660  -->  00:05:20,130
There's a lot of independent variables here.

120

00:05:20,580  -->  00:05:23,850
All right now what do we think the market will do.

121

00:05:23,970  -->  00:05:25,100
And this is debatable.

122

00:05:25,140  -->  00:05:27,480
Just assume eight and a half percent over time.

123

00:05:28,290  -->  00:05:36,360
And then we've got 6 percent there and we're getting there almost or wait for it 14 1/2 percent is our

124

00:05:36,360  -->  00:05:37,210
cost of equity.

125

00:05:37,230  -->  00:05:39,290
Right it's high that's pretty high cost of equity.

126

00:05:39,480  -->  00:05:44,490
But if our beta was lower right if our stock was less volatile than our cost you'd actually be a lot

127

00:05:44,490  -->  00:05:44,950
lower.

128

00:05:45,150  -->  00:05:47,700
So 60 percent times that's right.

129

00:05:47,760  -->  00:05:50,470
Plus the debt you've seen already.

130

00:05:50,520  -->  00:05:54,790
That means our weighted average cost of capital here is ten point one percent.

131

00:05:54,840  -->  00:05:58,740
That's our discount rate which is the same thing is that's our interest rate which is the same thing

132

00:05:58,770  -->  00:06:02,660
as that is our whac weighted average cost of capital.

133

00:06:02,660  -->  00:06:03,090
All right.

134

00:06:03,150  -->  00:06:10,410
Now that we've covered how to calculate free Cashell and how to calculate the terminal value and how

135

00:06:10,410  -->  00:06:14,010
to calculate the weighted average cost of capital.

136

00:06:14,010  -->  00:06:16,280
Now let's look at DCF valuation.

137

00:06:16,330  -->  00:06:16,720
Okay.

138

00:06:16,770  -->  00:06:20,400
And we are going to use LinkedIn as our example and the next exercise.

139

00:06:20,430  -->  00:06:21,960
And then there'll be an exercise for you to complete
