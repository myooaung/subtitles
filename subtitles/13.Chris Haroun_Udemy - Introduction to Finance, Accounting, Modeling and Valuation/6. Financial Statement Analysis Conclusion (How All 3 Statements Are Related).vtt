00:00:00.770  -->  00:00:02.550
All right let's put this puzzle together.

2

00:00:02.580  -->  00:00:03.450
OK.

3

00:00:04.080  -->  00:00:09.560
We talks about three financial statements and all three of them are linked to each other.

4

00:00:09.620  -->  00:00:10.470
OK.

5

00:00:10.950  -->  00:00:14.150
We've got the balance sheet which tells you what you own.

6

00:00:14.160  -->  00:00:18.210
You've got the income statement which tells you how much you make and then you've got the cash flow

7

00:00:18.240  -->  00:00:23.330
telling you will hold on to second what you told me I make is not cash.

8

00:00:23.520  -->  00:00:25.550
And here's how we reconcile that.

9

00:00:25.620  -->  00:00:27.470
Ok cool.

10

00:00:27.540  -->  00:00:30.870
Now all of these statements are related.

11

00:00:31.110  -->  00:00:36.270
And if you understand the relationship between the three financial statements you can test to see if

12

00:00:36.270  -->  00:00:37.500
you made mistakes.

13

00:00:37.680  -->  00:00:38.340
OK.

14

00:00:38.610  -->  00:00:41.760
And so the relationships are as follows.

15

00:00:42.510  -->  00:00:49.410
So we've got the balance sheet there and that basically has retained earnings and that is connected

16

00:00:49.410  -->  00:00:51.370
to the bottom of the income statement.

17

00:00:51.440  -->  00:00:51.960
Okay.

18

00:00:52.230  -->  00:00:54.970
Think about the wording to retained earnings.

19

00:00:55.050  -->  00:00:55.680
What does that mean.

20

00:00:55.780  -->  00:00:57.990
It's earnings we've retained.

21

00:00:57.990  -->  00:01:03.000
And so if you look at the difference between retained earnings on the balance sheet between one year

22

00:01:03.000  -->  00:01:07.800
and the previous year it's the exact same thing as net income from the income statement.

23

00:01:07.800  -->  00:01:08.490
Okay.

24

00:01:08.580  -->  00:01:12.480
So that's your check and balance for that your link between the two statements and I know there's an

25

00:01:12.480  -->  00:01:14.610
exception if you have dividends it's a little bit different.

26

00:01:14.610  -->  00:01:16.200
We're not going to.

27

00:01:16.230  -->  00:01:20.850
All right let's talk about the next relationship the next relationship is between the cash flow statement

28

00:01:21.360  -->  00:01:22.770
and the Steve Case.

29

00:01:22.770  -->  00:01:26.850
Remember the Cashell statement you start with then income and then you add back all that stuff.

30

00:01:26.970  -->  00:01:27.440
Okay.

31

00:01:27.600  -->  00:01:33.510
And so net income in the bottom of the income statement is connected to net income at the top of the

32

00:01:33.510  -->  00:01:34.240
cash flow statement.

33

00:01:34.380  -->  00:01:35.380
Right.

34

00:01:35.430  -->  00:01:36.170
All right.

35

00:01:36.390  -->  00:01:44.110
And we also have that changing cash flow right at the bottom of that cash flow statement right.

36

00:01:44.130  -->  00:01:49.260
The change in cash flow of one year the next should be equal to the change in cash flow from one year

37

00:01:49.260  -->  00:01:49.720
to the next.

38

00:01:49.710  -->  00:01:53.690
Or change in cash I should say from one year or the next on the balance sheet there.

39

00:01:53.910  -->  00:01:54.780
Ok cool.

40

00:01:54.990  -->  00:01:59.770
Now we understand the relationship between all three of these financial statements.

41

00:01:59.850  -->  00:02:00.560
Right.

42

00:02:00.600  -->  00:02:01.750
So what can we do now.

43

00:02:01.890  -->  00:02:04.290
Well this is where it gets really cool.

44

00:02:04.410  -->  00:02:07.920
Now we can forecast the future by making financial models.

45

00:02:08.370  -->  00:02:12.990
And once we've done that once we've mastered the financial model process then we can pick target prices

46

00:02:12.990  -->  00:02:16.950
meaning what are companies we are looking at should be worth
