1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,050
All right.

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:07,080
So in this lesson I'm going to talk a little bit more about the data that we're working with.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,460
And I'm also going to show you how you can get hold of it in terms of where we are in the project.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,350
Well we've got our objective sorted and we've clarified what it is that we're going to do.

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:27,390
In other words we've nailed down the question that we're looking to answer that is is an e-mail spam

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:35,580
or is an email legitimate how we're gonna go on to the next step which is gathering the data to answer

7
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,300
this question.

8
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,700
Remember the premise is that a company has provided the data for you.

9
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,880
And I'm going to play the role of the company here.

10
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:52,530
So in this lesson's resources there is a zip file that you can download with everything that you need

11
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,200
for this module.

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:00,670
Now I highly encourage you to pause the video and do that right now just download the lesson resources.

13
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,230
But this isn't what this video is about right.

14
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:11,130
What I really want to show you is where I got the data from in the first place and that way you'll know

15
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:18,120
how to source the data and how you can pull up detailed information about the data yourself.

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,890
You never know this kind of stuff might really come in handy with future projects of your own.

17
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,220
Right.

18
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,290
OK.

19
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,680
So let's dive right in.

20
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,290
So where does the data actually come from.

21
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:35,760
Well all the e-mail data that we're gonna be working with actually comes from an open source anti spam

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,240
platform called Spam Assassin.

23
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,410
Now I know that in terms of design this Web site doesn't look like much but I think this is a really

24
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,050
really great project.

25
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:53,700
And the other thing is that Spam Assassin actually have a huge data set of spam emails and legitimate

26
00:01:53,730 --> 00:02:01,350
e-mails that they're making available to the public to do things like train a spam classifier.

27
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:10,110
The easiest way that you can find this data set is to google the words Spam Assassin public corpus.

28
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:16,680
And if you do that the top results should look something like this.

29
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,570
If I click on this link I could take you to this page here.

30
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,610
Mind you the euro up here might change right.

31
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,750
That's completely up to the people who are behind Spam Assassin.

32
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:36,330
So hence googling Spam Assassin public Corpus is a surefire way to find the right Web site.

33
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,360
Again the design here can be a little bit off putting it looks a little bit dodge but what you've essentially

34
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:49,860
got here are a list of archives you've got a list of collections of spam e-mails that you can download

35
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:58,520
the file naming here gives a little bit of a clue to the recency of the archive itself.

36
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:58,740
Right.

37
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:06,960
So sometimes you'll see like a duplicate because the archive was actually updated for example this file

38
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,470
here.

39
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,690
It's probably just an updated version of this one here.

40
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,020
I'm just going by the file name here.

41
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,380
I don't think the last modified column is actually that useful in this case.

42
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:24,600
Now a moment ago you saw me use the word corpus in my google search query and you see that word again

43
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,070
here.

44
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,950
Corpus.

45
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,060
Right.

46
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,720
This is actually quite an important piece of jargon to know because it'll come up again and again when

47
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:43,080
you're working with text datasets a corpus is defined as a large and structured set of texts.

48
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,240
You'll hear the word corpus also used when people refer to see all the written works of a particular

49
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,380
author like Shakespeare.

50
00:03:50,430 --> 00:04:00,100
Right now a related term that you'll come across as well when gathering text data is the word document.

51
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:08,730
Now this actually means something quite specific in this context a document refers to a particular email

52
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,420
in our corpus to the Corpus refers to a set of all documents.

53
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,250
A document refers to a particular item in the corpus.

54
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,150
So you'll see both of these two pieces of jargon come up again and again in this module.

55
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,560
And here's a bonus question for you.

56
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,980
Can you guess the plural of the word Corpus.

57
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,780
I'm not gonna leave you hanging there.

58
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:46,160
It's a a core poorer one corpus three core poorer not corpses or core Pi or what have you.

59
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:53,350
I found this out the hard way by the way with people giving me quite funny looks at a conference and

60
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,970
I don't want the same thing to happen to you.

61
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,840
So there you go.

62
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:03,760
Core poorer height you know back on the spam assassin website let me point you towards the detailed

63
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,630
description of the data set that we're working with.

64
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:12,950
It's right here under this unassuming read me HMO.

65
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:20,650
This is where you can see the revision history of the dataset and a brief explanation of what's actually

66
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,010
in the archive files.

67
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:31,240
Now speaking of archives you might be wondering how to actually download and open these files to look

68
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,640
at an individual email.

69
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:41,380
It's actually not that straightforward because you don't tend to see these dot TAVR dot visit to file

70
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,920
types very very often and it's not an extension you come across every day a hint.

71
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,490
So let me show you how you can work with these files on a Mac.

72
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,550
First and after that I'll show you the workflow on a Windows machine too.

73
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,330
Obviously the first thing you have to do is download one of these files.

74
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,980
So I'm gonna click on this spam archive here.

75
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:10,990
The most recent one from 2005 and I'm going to save it to my downloads folder.

76
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,780
If I pull up my downloads folder I can see it sitting right here.

77
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:22,470
It's got the icon of a zip archive and it's two point one megabytes on Mac.

78
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:29,860
All you have to do is pretty much double click on it it expands it meaning it on archives or unzips

79
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,390
it and it'll create a new folder for you like so.

80
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,250
So let me open this folder.

81
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:41,290
You can really see here it contains a thousand three hundred and ninety seven items.

82
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:47,050
There's quite a few things in here and they all look like this.

83
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,960
That's a pretty intimidating.

84
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,380
And looks like complete junk when you see it for like the first time.

85
00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:02,110
So let me show you what these files actually are and how you would look at them to open one of these

86
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,590
files.

87
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:09,040
You need to use a text editor on Windows notepad comes pre installed on Mac.

88
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:16,150
It's text edit but the thing is if you're right click on this and you go to open with my operating system

89
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,410
isn't even suggesting a text that it's here to open it with.

90
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,760
So I manually have to choose it.

91
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,860
One of my favorite text editors these days is actually called atom so you can download and install this

92
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,390
thing if you like.

93
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:36,150
Let me show you what it looks like when I open this file with this text editor this is pretty much what

94
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,290
you'll see.

95
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:43,610
You'll see the top of the e-mail here followed by the body text of the email.

96
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,720
Like so.

97
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:53,610
So we've successfully opened one of these emails any text editor after an archiving the thing that we

98
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,950
downloaded from the spam assassin Web site.

99
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,990
This is the workflow on Mac.

100
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,070
In any case everybody who's on Windows.

101
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,030
I apologize for making you wait this long.

102
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,890
I'm going to get to that right now.

103
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,250
All right.

104
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:16,770
So this is a Windows 8 machine but Windows 10 isn't so different and all the same principles apply.

105
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:23,940
We first have to extract the zip file and then we can open a file in a text editor like notepad or yes

106
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,370
ATM.

107
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:32,550
So I'm going to download this t r dot be set to file and save it to my downloads folder which I've got

108
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,750
open for you right here and then I can open it with an unmarked server of my choice.

109
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,910
So I've got a couple.

110
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,510
There's quite a few options here.

111
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:49,980
I'm gonna use a program called seven zip and you can follow the two step process here with me.

112
00:08:49,980 --> 00:09:00,180
So this is the seven zip program with the archive file inside and I'm going to say extract and I'll

113
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:08,310
extract it to my downloads folder and you should see the T A R file pop up here.

114
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:17,060
So this is actually another archive so I wouldn't have to repeat this step one more time so I'm going

115
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:25,890
to open this again with seven zip and then I'm going to extract my spam email folder from inside this

116
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,390
one and put it into say my downloads folder.

117
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:38,070
So this is the process that I have to follow on my windows machine to get to my spam emails extracting

118
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:47,140
him twice how let me show you how you can pull up one of these emails in notepad if I double click on

119
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:55,600
this thing I'm going to have to choose what program I want to use to open this file the file extension

120
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:03,010
of this particular file isn't helping windows figure out which program is appropriate to open this file

121
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,580
with by default.

122
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:12,670
So again we have to choose it manually if I go to more options I can scroll down here and I will find

123
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,820
the notepad program listed here.

124
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,600
So this is notepad.

125
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,960
Uh good ole good ole notepad.

126
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,640
And it does open the file perfectly.

127
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:32,580
It's not formatting it uh in a very friendly way but it is opening it.

128
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:40,270
So this is how you can look at a particular email with a default program not having to install anything

129
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,920
on your machine.

130
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,190
Right.

131
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:49,660
So you shouldn't have a problem opening any of these files and looking at the emails individually if

132
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,580
you want to know how I think you'll tire of notepad pretty quickly.

133
00:10:54,580 --> 00:11:00,310
So you know if you have a decent text editor like ATM or say notepad plus plus or what have you then

134
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,620
it formats it for you a lot more user friendly.

135
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:11,470
And this is what I would encourage you to to use rather than the uh the default program that's installed.
