00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.350
A key part of data exploration that you want to do in conjunction with data visualization is looking

2
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.010
at some descriptive statistics of the data that you're working with.

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.660
In the previous lessons we saw that our data set contained everything from price data to indexed data

4
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.670
to dummy variables.

5
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.210
And these were all measured in different ways.

6
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.810
So in this lesson I'm going to show you how you can pull up various different statistics on a data frame

7
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.100
which you could have a look at in conjunction with your data visualizations and how I personally think

8
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.360
this topic of descriptive statistics can be so utterly dull that I want to introduce it to you with

9
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.280
a short story imagine that it's an election year and the two leading political candidates are having

10
00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.540
their big debate on television the very fictional conservative candidate by the name of Ronald dump

11
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:09.120
starts off the debate and says Friends Romans countrymen lend me your ears under my leadership the economy

12
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:16.660
has been doing splendidly and the average family is reaping the benefits over the past four years.

13
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.090
Average income has increased by over thirty thousand dollars.

14
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.480
Vote for me and then it's the opposition candidates turn candidate artillery Hinton takes the floor

15
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.050
and says don't listen to Ronald.

16
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.740
Today middle income families are earning thirty thousand dollars less than when Ronald took office.

17
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:45.790
My policies will help the typical family vote for me so hearing these two statements you might wonder

18
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.100
is one of the politicians lying or can both of these statements be true at the same time.

19
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.400
How can we reconcile these two seemingly contradictory claims.

20
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:04.080
Now it turns out that even though the two statements sound very similar these two politicians are not

21
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.870
talking about the same thing.

22
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:15.630
The Ronald is talking about the mean while artillery is talking about the median the mean is another

23
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.960
word for average and to calculate the mean income.

24
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:26.840
You simply add up all the families incomes and you divide them by the number of families the median

25
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.650
income on the other hand is calculated by arranging all the family incomes from lowest to highest and

26
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.810
then picking the one in the middle.

27
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.910
So in contrast to the mean the median is not affected so much by big outliers this whole discussion

28
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:52.630
in fact goes back to this idea of a distribution the shape of a distribution determines statistical

29
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.700
measures like the mean or the median.

30
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.970
Remember the screen histogram that I created with imaginary house price data.

31
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.800
This is in the shape of our old friend the normal distribution.

32
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:13.790
In this case both the median and the mean would be the same however.

33
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.300
What if this distribution was not normal.

34
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:24.460
What if we didn't have this pretty handy imaginary bell shaped curve for family incomes.

35
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.880
In that case the mean and the median won't be the same.

36
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:37.090
And this is a story of the politicians so the distribution is the second part of our answer.

37
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:44.270
The thing that happened to reconcile the two politicians statements is that the income distribution

38
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.190
has changed.

39
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:53.660
This is how it is possible for the average and the mean to move in separate directions.

40
00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:02.590
You see if most people got slightly poorer but then very very few people become enormously wealthy going

41
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.370
all the way out to the right of this distribution into the tail then the mean and the median could be

42
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.760
trading places like in this slide.

43
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.940
So I hope this little story got you a little bit more interested in this topic of descriptive statistics.

44
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.640
So at this stage you might be asking well then what are a couple of good things to look at to better

45
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.960
understand the data we're gonna be looking at for things for now.

46
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:36.490
We're gonna be looking at the smallest value the largest value the mean value and the median value in

47
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.340
our dataset.

48
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:45.160
Lucky for us the python Panda's module makes all of the super easy and the panda data frame already

49
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.170
has a number of handy methods which we can use to instantly pull up this kind of information in our

50
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.580
notebook.

51
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.600
Let me show you how the first thing I want to do is going to add a little section heading here that

52
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.330
reads descriptive statistics

53
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.880
and now let me show you how we can pull up the smallest value in a particular column all of our data

54
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.990
frame say we want to know the smallest house price.

55
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.500
We can select a particular column or a series object with the square bracket notation.

56
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:30.570
If I type data square brackets price in all caps it's fronted by single quotes and then put a dot after

57
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:39.930
it and call the min method Min parentheses and hitting shift into we can see that the smallest house

58
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.860
price is five thousand U.S. dollars.

59
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.830
Now I don't know about you but I'd really like to see this house.

60
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.060
I mean for five thousand dollars in Boston.

61
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.920
I'm imagining some sort of rusty trailer on the outskirts of the city without running water and electricity.

62
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.610
Maybe with one of the radial highways on a bridge overhead.

63
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.800
But anyhow let's see what the largest value is using the system method Max.

64
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:23.910
So data square brackets quote price dot Max parentheses but bring up 50 Hatten since this is in thousands.

65
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.580
This is fifty thousand dollars.

66
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.790
How I know this doesn't sound like a lot but this isn't the 1970s.

67
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:36.860
So things were a bit cheaper back then now the cool thing about pandas is that you don't have to do

68
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.380
this for every single column in the data frame.

69
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:46.190
You can actually pull up the minimum and maximum values on the data frame object itself.

70
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:52.950
You can pull it up on the data frame as a whole so that right data dot Min parentheses.

71
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.400
I can see the minimum value in every single column at the same time.

72
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.210
Of course the same thing goes with data dot Max.

73
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.070
Which brings up the largest value in every single column.

74
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.020
So that's the largest and smallest values covered.

75
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.640
The other descriptive statistics that we've talked about that can be pulled up really easily were the

76
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.840
mean and the median.

77
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.770
So data don't mean parentheses.

78
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:29.850
We'll bring up the average value of every single feature and data dot median will bring up the typical

79
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:36.490
value or the middle value of every single feature in the data frame.

80
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:46.020
Now that's all very well and good but the thing is what if you're like me what if you're lazy typing

81
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:52.230
all this stuff in and getting out the above output is not very satisfactory.

82
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:59.190
What I want is I want all my stats at the same time and I want it to be formatted in a way that I can

83
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.300
easily read.

84
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.630
This is where the described method comes to the rescue data.

85
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:13.620
Don't describe parentheses well bring up a whole bunch of summary statistics from the data frame all

86
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.280
at the same time.

87
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.410
I love this method.

88
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.680
This is super super useful.

89
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:25.230
Now you may be looking at this and thinking hey wait a minute where is the median.

90
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.180
Don't cheat me out of the median.

91
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.040
Well not to worry.

92
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.790
It's right here in this 50 percent row.

93
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.020
This is where the median values are hiding.

94
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.990
Cool.

95
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:42.390
So this table is something very handy to pull up when you're working with a new data frame that you

96
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.790
haven't seen before.

97
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:51.360
You take the data frame and simply call the describe method and this will generate the descriptive statistics

98
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:58.860
that summarize the central tendency dispersion and the shape of the data sets distribution.

99
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:05.550
Just note this excludes not a number or non values if there are any in your data frame.

100
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.310
So it's quite clever.

101
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.600
Good stuff.

102
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:14.250
Now looking at this one of the things that I found quite interesting and that I'm noting down for later

103
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:21.240
is that there is an outlier in the number of rooms category that might be worth investigating.

104
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:29.420
We can see this in the summary statistics right here the reason I say it's an outlier is because the

105
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:34.600
average number of rooms and the median number of rooms is around six.

106
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:42.720
You can also see that most of the properties have between five point nine and six point six rooms.

107
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:51.230
So this property here with almost nine rooms is gigantic and also quite far from the norm.

108
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:56.900
So yeah I'm going to make a mental note of this for the analysis stage in the next lessons we're gonna

109
00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:07.190
be looking at if and how our explanatory variables are 13 features move together we're gonna be looking

110
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.840
at their correlation I'll see you there.
