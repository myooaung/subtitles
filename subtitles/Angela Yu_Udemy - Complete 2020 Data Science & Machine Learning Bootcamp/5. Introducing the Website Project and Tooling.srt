1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:07,170
In this lesson I'm gonna go over the tooling that we need for our web development work and most gonna

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,640
give you a brief tour of the stop project for this module.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,360
Now to create a Web site we're gonna have to write our code somewhere.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,940
So the first thing we're going to need is a decent text editor and there's actually two text editors

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,340
that I quite like and can recommend.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:30,690
And the first one is called Atom Atom was developed by the team at GitHub and it's completely open source.

7
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:37,050
It supports a large number of languages including all the languages that we need including javascript

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,710
each LCROSS and of course python.

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:47,160
Now the really nice thing about atom is it has a really cool real time collaboration feature so you

10
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,190
can work with others like in Google Docs which is great for team projects and if you're working on something

11
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,390
with friends it's really quite neat.

12
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:02,100
But GitHub the organization behind atom was actually recently acquired by Microsoft which brings me

13
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,660
to the second text editor that I'm quite partial to and that's the s code.

14
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,660
This code pretty much does everything atom does except maybe slightly faster.

15
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,080
Microsoft seems to have done some optimization behind the scenes.

16
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,200
So for this module I'm going to be using V as code now as always you can find the links to all of these

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,810
Web sites to download your favorite text editor on our course resource page.

18
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,690
The next thing that we're gonna need for this module are the Chrome developer tools.

19
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,530
Chrome is the browser I'm going to be using for this project.

20
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,860
So if you haven't got it already then install it now.

21
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:46,690
And once you've done that head over to the lesson resources and download the math underscore garden

22
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:53,870
on the score stub zip file in here you're gonna find the stop project that we're going to use.

23
00:01:53,910 --> 00:02:00,060
So go ahead and extract the zip file and then you should get a folder with a bunch of files that we're

24
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,410
going to need.

25
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:07,020
Now you can put this folder anywhere you want on your harddrive but I recommend just putting it into

26
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:11,760
the MLK project folder that you're using for all your Jupiter notebooks.

27
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,790
That way all the work that you're doing is gonna be in one place.

28
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,400
If I take a look inside the stop project then you should see a number of files.

29
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,670
You've got this index that each to a nail file.

30
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:30,390
You've got a folder called C Ss and inside is a style starts the SS file and then you've got this folder

31
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,910
called images where there are some dots as Fiji files.

32
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,300
All right.

33
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,880
So let's take a look at all of these files in V.S. code.

34
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:46,580
Fire up visual studio code and then click on open folder on the welcome screen.

35
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:56,450
Or alternatively go to file open and then select the math on a square garden discourse stuff folder.

36
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,600
And after you've opened the folder you should see all the files and all the contents of that folder

37
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,090
come up here in the Explorer pane and now you can navigate between the files simply by selecting them

38
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,140
or double clicking on them.

39
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,700
If you double click on the files then they show up in this kind of like tab view on the right hand side.

40
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,570
Just kind of like browser tabs.

41
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:22,120
So this explorer pane is really handy for navigating between the different files and if it gets in your

42
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,520
way or you want to size it a bit differently than you can just click on the margins here and drag it

43
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,250
around or you can click on this icon here to hide it.

44
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,340
So now let's take a look at the different kind of files in the stop project.

45
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,580
So on one hand we have this index that each terminal file on the other hand.

46
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:47,680
We have this styles that see us as file and then thirdly we have these six different SPG files.

47
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:53,800
Now I personally think that SPG files are probably the coolest thing since sliced bread because even

48
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,830
though it looks like code it's actually an image.

49
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,650
Now images there usually in the more familiar formats of j peg or PSG.

50
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,380
So what's so great about SPG files.

51
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,580
Well let's compare a PSG file to an SPG file.

52
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,470
I've got an image here in my downloads folder and I'm just gonna open it with Firefox and I'm going

53
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,470
to zoom in.

54
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:22,960
So what you can see here is this whole thing pixilated the quality degrades as you zoom in to 300 percent.

55
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,840
But if I do the very same thing with an SPG file let's see what happens.

56
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,190
Again I'm going to 300 percent and it just stays tack shop.

57
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:38,800
It's almost as if we're in an episode of CSI and they're zooming in on the security camera footage and

58
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,200
able to see all this detail.

59
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:47,500
The reason that the SPG files don't pixilated is because they're actually code as Fiji is a vector image

60
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:54,070
format and we're going to be using this in our project so that our images stay sharp and looking good

61
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,800
no matter what type of screen that they're displayed on.

62
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,830
Now let's take a look at the second most important tools that we're gonna be using as part of this module.

63
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,200
And those are the Chrome developer tools.

64
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:13,550
So go ahead and right click on the next thought HCM Mal file and open it with Google Chrome at this

65
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:19,390
point you should see a website that looks something like this to pull up the Chrome developer tools.

66
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:26,240
Click on the overflow menu right here on the right hand side and then go to more tools and then developer

67
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,250
tools.

68
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:32,080
You can also make a note of the keyboard shortcut right here to bring them up more quickly.

69
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,780
Now the developer tools that you're seeing on your screen should look something like this.

70
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:41,210
You can of course position them anywhere you fancy so you can either have them on the right hand side

71
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:47,270
like me or look at them below like this but I prefer them docked here on the right.

72
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,350
It's quite good.

73
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,110
Now what are the Chrome developer tools really useful for.

74
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:58,560
Well first off we're seeing the code side by side with the browsers interpretation of our code.

75
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:05,810
So on the right hand side I've got the HMO and on the left hand side I've got what the user will eventually

76
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:11,960
see if they pull up the Web site and what's really really useful about the Chrome developer tools is

77
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:18,560
that when you hover over a particular bit of the code it will highlight that part on the left hand side

78
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,560
on the actual Web site.

79
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:27,180
So for example I've got the body of my web site right here and my body has two sections.

80
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,170
It has this section and it has this section.

81
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:36,080
If I click on the little arrow here I can expand the particular section to take a peek inside and see

82
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,660
what's contained therein in my first section.

83
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:45,320
I've got a heading which I can also expand and there I can hone in on a particular element like the

84
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:52,570
three here or the plus sign or the number two and in the second section I've got my button right here

85
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,410
so you can see that the different parts of code are highlighted on the right hand side.

86
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,730
But the really neat thing about Chrome is that I can also go the other way around.

87
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:08,210
So if I click on this little icon here where I can select an element in the page to inspect it then

88
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:14,800
I can highlight a particular element and it will point me to the line of code in the index that H.M.

89
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,190
l file where that pertains to this element.

90
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:26,760
So here for example I'm hovering over the button and this part of my index H2 mail file is highlighted.

91
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:33,350
I can even double click into here and change something so what says button text here I can overwrite

92
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:38,020
this and type something like Hello exclamation mark.

93
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:45,710
And when I hit enter then my render here on the left hand side will be updated but one thing to note

94
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,120
is that this actually has not changed the file that's saved on my computer.

95
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:57,500
So if we go back to visual studio code and I scroll down in the index that each time l file to where

96
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:04,400
I've got the button which is on line number 28 then I can still see that this is the original text.

97
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,760
So anything you do here does not actually get saved on the file.

98
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:14,140
So let's take a look if we can identify these elements in Visual Studio code.

99
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:21,110
So we've already identified the button which is right here and we can also identify our heading which

100
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:30,410
contains the number three plus the two and the equals the really nice thing about the S code is that

101
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,320
C you know this code is looking a little bit strange and you haven't seen it before.

102
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:41,650
One of the things you can actually do is just hover over one of these elements and read a short description.

103
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:49,000
So for example the H2 element represents a section heading and if I hover over this bit here that I

104
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,380
can read that the button element represents a button labeled by its contents and if I hover over body

105
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,350
that I can see the body element represents the content of the document.

106
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,420
So it actually is this index that each time l file.

107
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,820
Well this is the structure of our website.

108
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:14,840
It's in this file that we've got the different elements that are going to be displayed to the user.

109
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,740
So at this point there's only one file left to talk about right.

110
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,510
And that's the styles don't see ISIS file.

111
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:27,280
You can already tell from the name that this file is probably something to do with styling the SPG files

112
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,860
are the image files the index that each time all file is the structure of our website.

113
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,560
So the CSX file actually has something to do with the styling.

114
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,680
And we can see this again in the Chrome developer tools.

115
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,580
So if I've got the button highlighted here then a little bit further to the right I can see a bunch

116
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,970
of the buttons properties and these are the properties that style the button and we can actually see

117
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:00,730
what each of these properties does by taking her and taking any of them right here.

118
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:06,970
So let's take this border radius for example the border it is is 20 pixels and if I un ticket then I

119
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:12,810
can see that we've got a square with no rounded corners.

120
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,260
Now what about the padding.

121
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,940
What is the padding do.

122
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,590
Well let's find out.

123
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:23,960
We can simply take an antic the padding property and we can see the difference that it makes to the

124
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:33,230
styling of our button same with the font size if I uncheck font size of 70 pixels then the button gets

125
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:40,530
his default font size and the same of course is true of the font family simply by UN taking this style.

126
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:47,870
We go from the custom font which is called Just another hand to the default font and then I sing with

127
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:52,220
the Chrome developer tools as we can pretty much do this for every other element.

128
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:58,640
So let's take the body for example if we go to the body and we unstick the background color which is

129
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,830
this nice blue.

130
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,930
Then we simply get a white background.

131
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,990
So now that we know that these are the different styles.

132
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,910
Let's take a look at what this styles that CSX fire looks like in Visual Studio code.

133
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,870
And it looks something like this.

134
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:20,900
We've got a particular element C like the body and it's got a bunch of properties here that we're setting

135
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:27,370
like the background color and down here we have the styling for the button.

136
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,940
And just like with the index that each time l file a visual studio code is very very good at giving

137
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:38,150
us a little bit of background and quick help if we hover over any of these things.

138
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:45,240
So background hyphen color as the name suggests sets the background color of an element and the border

139
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,920
radius defines the radius of the outer border edge.

140
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,620
So every time you see something that you're not quite sure about.

141
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,080
Visual Studio code is really really good at helping you out and giving a little bit of background information

142
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,200
without having to go into Google and searching for it there.

143
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:08,220
So this concludes the very very quick tool of the stop Project and the tooling that we're gonna use

144
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,620
namely the US Code and the chrome developer tools.

145
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,520
And if you're gonna remember one thing from this lesson then remember this.

146
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:23,670
Remember that HDL has everything to do with the structure of the website.

147
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:29,490
It's in the H Jamelle file where all the elements of the website are listed like the headings and the

148
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,610
titles and the buttons and so on.

149
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,860
And in the SS file we've got the styling for all of these elements.

150
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:44,040
It's in the C Ss file where we set the font size and the padding and the colors and so on.

151
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,800
Now in the next lesson we're going to learn a lot more about each team L and C CFS and we're gonna be

152
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,440
writing some of our own code to style our website.

153
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,270
I'll see you there.
