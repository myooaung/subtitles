1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:08,940
So the next question is how well does the model fit to data now has a challenge.

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,900
Do you remember how to print out a regressions r squared value from the previous lessons.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,160
I want you to print out two different r squared values.

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:25,550
I want you to print out the r squared value for the training data set and the r squared value for the

5
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,610
testing dataset.

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:37,060
I'll give you a few seconds to pause the video and give us a shot and here's the solution to obtain

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,100
the r squared.

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,490
We access it through the regression objects score method.

9
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,120
So my first print statement is gonna read

10
00:00:49,850 --> 00:01:04,410
training data all squared colon comma rigger dot score parentheses x on the school train comma Y on

11
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,350
a school train.

12
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:15,060
So this will be the r squared of the training data set and the r squared off the testing data set will

13
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:29,720
be test data r squared colon comma regular dot score parentheses x underscore test comma Y underscore

14
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,310
test.

15
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,910
So let's take a look at what these turn out to be.

16
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:45,270
For our training data we get an R squared of zero point seven five and for our test data set we get

17
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,370
an r squared of zero point six seven.

18
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,340
Now these values are actually both quite high.

19
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,270
I mean when you think about it the real world is a very very complicated place.

20
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:09,380
But we've been able to explain approximately 75 percent of the variance in our house prices with just

21
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:21,590
13 features 13 things and we can explain a lot of what's going on in the real world how a question that

22
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:31,180
you might ask looking at these two values is why is the r squared lower for the test dataset.

23
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:39,220
And the answer is is that what we've done so far is calculate the status only on our training data.

24
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,650
The algorithm hasn't seen the test data before.

25
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:50,170
As such the performance of our model on the data that a model hasn't seen is always gonna be worse.

26
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:56,480
It makes sense for the r squared to be lower on the test data than on the training data.

27
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,320
However running the model on data that's not in the sample actually gives us some idea of its predictive

28
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,180
power.

29
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:10,110
We get a little bit of a feeling for how our model would fare in the real world.

30
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:17,280
And it's very encouraging to see that the r squared even on the test data is still quite high.

31
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,530
So our model actually performs relatively well.

32
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,300
Okay so we SPECT out our model and we've run our first regression.

33
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,870
We did a quick sense check and looked at the performance.

34
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:37,720
Now we're getting to the evaluation stage now before we move on to the next lesson.

35
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:47,530
Let's add another markdown cell above this one here and add the section heading multi variable regression.

36
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,270
That way we can keep track of what we're doing.

37
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,950
The other thing I'm going to do is take these two lines of code.

38
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,670
Cut them and paste them down here.

39
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:08,620
That way when I had shift enter we'll be able to see our data frame of coefficients.

40
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:14,430
Otherwise the output is hidden by the print statements.

41
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,780
There we go.

42
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,520
Now we're ready to move on.

43
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,900
I'll see you in the next lessons.
