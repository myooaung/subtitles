00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:08.280
All right so in this lesson what we're gonna do is we're gonna run this gradient descent without sin

2
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.200
pie.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.000
We're going to look at making our Jupiter notebook a little bit more performance.

4
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.250
This gives us a chance to solve this problem the old fashioned way the way we've done it for the previous

5
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.270
examples.

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.020
And one reason to do this is that you'll notice this performance difference in your Jupiter notebook

7
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.700
because it turns out running it without some pie is actually much faster.

8
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:42.990
But first let's add the markdown for partial derivatives in late tech notation.

9
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.380
So when I go back to this section heading here and we're going to write down the partial derivatives

10
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.620
in mathematical notation because it will give us a good opportunity to see a few more of these late

11
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.790
tags in action in our print statement on the cell below.

12
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.110
We've got the partial derivative with respect to x and it looks like this.

13
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:14.250
So the question is how to translate this very little bit ugly and unreadable equation into late tax

14
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.150
notation.

15
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.500
The first thing I want to do is use the opening double dollar sign tax and I'm going to have a little

16
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.120
fraction here.

17
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:35.550
And I say backslash frank open curly braces f closing curly braces opening curly braces X closing curly

18
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.100
braces and then two more dollar signs let's see what this looks like.

19
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:48.320
So we can see that our fraction tag and the dollar science together center our equation like this.

20
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.110
So let's take a look at this as we get a bit bigger.

21
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:58.910
And when you add the two pound symbols before this thing and press shift and take in so we can see it

22
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.670
a bit larger.

23
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.820
Now I'm going to add the mathematical notation for the partial derivatives so I can go back into my

24
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:16.750
fraction and use the backslash again and before the f I may use a tag called partial and have a space

25
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.920
and you can see that the markdown actually highlights this tag differently.

26
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.900
Highlighted in green just like it does with the fraction tag.

27
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.270
So that way I know just from the syntax highlighting that this is a legitimate late hash tag.

28
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.230
And then also add the partial tag to the bottom.

29
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.020
So when see backslash partial Space X and then after the curly braces are going to put an equal sign

30
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.590
and I'm going to press shift enter and see what it looks like in here we go here we can see the partial

31
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.120
tag translates into these little delta symbols for the equation.

32
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.970
Okay so now we can have the top part of the fraction on the right hand side.

33
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:06.810
And that was two X and then we had log when is the natural log here.

34
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:20.320
So backslash Ellen and it was three times three to the power of and then curly braces minus X to the

35
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:28.320
power of two minus Y to the power of two closing curly braces.

36
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.770
Let's see what this looks like now.

37
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.930
Now one thing I don't like is this time symbol that we've got here would be much nicer to have a dot

38
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.700
and there is a latex tag for that as well.

39
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.930
And it's backslash C dot pressing shift enter.

40
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.690
We can see that it now looks like this which is a lot nicer.

41
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.400
So we've got our top part of a fraction now.

42
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.630
Now all I have to do is actually.

43
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.170
Well now all I have to do is actually put it in a fraction.

44
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:10.580
So I'm going to say backslash Frank open curly braces and at the end closing curly braces.

45
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:18.320
And when I open another pair of curly braces at the end this is going to be for the bottom part of our

46
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.050
fraction at the bottom we had three to the power of.

47
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:34.910
And then it was curly braces minus X to the power of two minus Y to the power of two closing curly brace

48
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.350
plus one.

49
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.960
Let's press shift enter and see what this looks like.

50
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.070
So in our equation looks like that we've got a fraction.

51
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.670
We've got the top part and we've got the bottom part but this isn't quite correct.

52
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.950
We have to add a little bit more notation since the bottom is actually squared.

53
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.310
So how do we do that.

54
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:06.910
One of the things I can do is I can take a parentheses here and a parentheses at the end and then have

55
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.690
that whole thing to the power of two and pressing shift enter.

56
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.270
It would then look like this.

57
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.900
I have the parentheses and then the two.

58
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.200
Like so.

59
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.860
And you know the thing is this isn't even all that terrible.

60
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.380
But I can use latex notation again to style these parentheses a little differently.

61
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:40.900
So instead of having just a normal parentheses here I can actually have a backslash and say left parentheses.

62
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.530
So this is one of the tags.

63
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:50.720
And then at the end here instead of having the closing parentheses I can actually also put backslash

64
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.740
right and then have the closing parentheses like so.

65
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:04.960
So this code here this markdown now refers to the right or closing parenthesis then you press shift

66
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.740
enter to show what this looks like in comparison.

67
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:16.030
You can seen how with the left parentheses and right parentheses using the latex tags it actually looks

68
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.620
a lot better.

69
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:25.240
And just like that where we're done we have cut our partial derivative with respect to x formatted very

70
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:35.180
beautifully in latex notation let's add the partial derivative with respect to y now so so this is the

71
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:44.150
really easy part because all we have to do is copy this paste it and change this X to a Y and change

72
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:54.850
this X to a Y and press shift into how we've got both our partial derivatives displayed here.

73
00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:01.960
Now if you're suspicious and you don't believe me that this is indeed the partial derivative for Y then

74
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:09.460
you can go down here and you can refresh this cell here just by changing this a her where we're calling

75
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:16.630
the differentiation function from simplify to be hitting shift enter and then you should be able to

76
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.510
confirm that this indeed is the partial derivative with respect to y.

77
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:27.970
So now that we've figured out the functional form for both of these partial derivatives can you as a

78
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:34.830
challenge can you write these partial derivative functions as Python functions.

79
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.970
I'll also give you a hand when you're writing the python functions.

80
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:44.680
There's actually one additional requirement that you have to consider also for the function names use

81
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:51.470
the names FP X and FP y for the names of the partial derivative functions.

82
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.640
I'll give you a few seconds to pause the video and give this a shot.

83
00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.400
All right you ready.

84
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.310
Here's the solution for the solution.

85
00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:05.280
I'm going to add a little Python comment.

86
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.310
Now let's just say partial the root of functions.

87
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:12.790
Example for

88
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.720
and here they are.

89
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:29.090
It's gonna be d f FP X which needs two inputs an X and a Y colon and to write the partial derivative

90
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:35.380
for this I'm going to again use a little simplification and define a variable called R and that's gonna

91
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.070
be equal to part of my expression.

92
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:47.630
I'm going to have three to the power of minus X squared minus Y squared.

93
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:57.510
So then my derivative is going to be two times x times log three times are.

94
00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:10.680
This is the top part and the bottom part of that fraction is gonna be r plus 1 squared and that's it.

95
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:17.490
That's my partial derivative with respect to x and as we've already discussed this is very very similar

96
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.260
to the partial the root of.

97
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:28.530
With respect to y so I'm just going to copy this and change this to Y and change this X in my written

98
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.590
statement to y as well.

99
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:39.330
Now I said there was one requirement that you have to take into account and this is the log function

100
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.730
here.

101
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.260
This comes from the math library.

102
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:50.510
The math module and we have to import this functionality in our Python notebook for it to work.

103
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:57.660
Otherwise when it comes to running FP X or FP y to evaluate one of these functions you're actually gonna

104
00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.180
get an error.

105
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:06.330
So if I had FP X and one point eight and one point zero and a head shift enter on this cell I'm actually

106
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.640
going to get an error.

107
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.330
And the reason is is that log is not defined.

108
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:17.380
I can't just use the log functionality like I would up here without importing the module first.

109
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:23.540
So let me go back up to the very very top and then down here.

110
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:28.290
I'm going to say from math import log.

111
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:35.520
Then when minute shift enter on this and I can scroll back down again I can try rerunning this cell

112
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:43.770
here and I can see that my slope my partial derivative with respect to x is equal to zero point zero

113
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.410
three seven.

114
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:50.900
Which is exactly what I am getting here.

115
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:57.510
In this case I'm using simplified to evaluate my partial derivative.

116
00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:04.650
And in this case I've already got my partial derivative here as a function and I can just plug in the

117
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.240
values.

118
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:12.420
So on question you might ask is Well why did you use log wise it's not Ellen and the answer is is that

119
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:20.010
if I check the documentation on this then you see here if I hit that little plus sign that if the base

120
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.400
is not specified.

121
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:27.920
So if there's no second argument being passed to this function it returns the natural logarithm.

122
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:31.350
So Ellen base e of X..

123
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:42.240
So in fact this log 3 is the natural logarithm or Ellen which is what we've got up here for our partial

124
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.740
derivative function in the latest notation.

125
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:52.050
So now we've got that out of the way we can do a bit of a horse race between these two methodologies

126
00:11:52.530 --> 00:12:00.570
we can namely take this cell here and we're gonna copy it when I copy this cell and what we're gonna

127
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:05.090
do is we're gonna paste that cell here.

128
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:09.220
I don't need this one I'm going to delete that.

129
00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:19.170
So when I go to edit delete cells and then I'm going to modify this cell in particular I want to modify

130
00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.670
these two parts

131
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:30.630
to use my FP X and my FP y functions instead.

132
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:31.400
You know what.

133
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:36.490
Maybe you should give this a quick shot see if you can figure out what code should go here in order

134
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:43.300
to use FP X and FP y the partial derivative functions instead of what we had before.

135
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:49.500
I'll let you pause the video and I'll show you how to do it in a second all good.

136
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.130
Here's the solution.

137
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:59.180
You simply call the two functions and supply the x value and the y values.

138
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.470
So the X value was under her arms.

139
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:09.730
Square brackets zero and the y value was under paradigms square bracket one.

140
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:11.280
And that's it.

141
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:19.750
That's the gradient or partial derivative with respect to x and for our gradient in the y direction

142
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.150
we do exactly the same thing with one difference.

143
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.660
We're gonna use FP y.

144
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.360
The partial derivative with respect to y.

145
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:35.560
And we're gonna supply the same two inputs the first value in our array and the second value in our

146
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:36.890
array.

147
00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:43.310
Now I'm going to run the cell with 500 iterations and see how well it performs.

148
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:53.890
Ready steady go hand it's done going back up here to where we're using simple high I can change the

149
00:13:53.890 --> 00:14:02.620
maximum number of iterations to 500 and rerun the cell thinking thinking thinking thinking thinking

150
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.050
there we go.

151
00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:11.320
So you can see that Python is actually doing a lot of extra work in this case every single time this

152
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:18.790
loop runs it has to differentiate our cost function and then evaluate that cost function.

153
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:25.540
And these instructions actually are a little bit more resource intensive than if it already knew from

154
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:29.360
the get go what the partial derivative was.

155
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:36.400
And this is one of the drawbacks of why you might not want to use simple high in your loop if you're

156
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:41.190
running an optimization algorithm many many many times.

157
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:42.980
So I hope you enjoyed that.

158
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:47.650
So I really think this is an interesting exercise because it really shows some of the pros and cons

159
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.890
of the different tools that are at our disposal.

160
00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:59.680
On one hand simple it can make our life a lot easier when it comes to calculating derivatives and doing

161
00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.370
symbolic mathematics and much much more.

162
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:09.460
But on the other hand it does show that you have to be clever when it comes to running your optimization

163
00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.270
algorithm.

164
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:17.410
You do have to think about a little bit about the resources that you're using and running your optimization

165
00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.940
and this kind of goes back to thinking like an engineer.

166
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:28.270
Thinking about the resources that are at your disposal and how you can write your code and how you can

167
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:35.070
choose your algorithm to make the most use of the resources that you have OK.

168
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.780
So what's left to do.

169
00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.150
Well only one thing right.

170
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:46.080
Plotting the gradient descent on our wonderful 3D chart and this is what we're going to do next lesson.

171
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:51.260
So I still got that coffee pumping through my veins so I hope I'll see you there.
