00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.090
Okay so we've SPECT out our model and ran our first regression.

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:12.450
We did a quick sense check of what we got back and we looked at the performance of our model.

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:20.550
Now we're getting to our model evaluation stage evaluating and deploying the model is the final part

4
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.060
of our workflow.

5
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.480
We've done a lot of legwork up till now.

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.380
We formulated our question.

7
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.840
We've gathered our data.

8
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.460
We've cleaned our data.

9
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.190
We've explored and visualized our data made sense of it.

10
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.260
We've trained our algorithm and now we're getting to the point where we can evaluate our results refine

11
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.110
our model look for problems look for improvements and deploy our model.

12
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.400
So what kind of things do we do at this stage.

13
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.660
Where do we take it from here.

14
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.900
Well we're going to start by asking a series of questions about our model and about our results.

15
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.130
We're going to be checking for some problems and looking for improvements retraining our algorithm as

16
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.300
necessary.

17
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.430
The approach that we're going to take is kind of like going for a medical checkup.

18
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.030
When you go see a doctor the doctor's typically ran some tests on you.

19
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.520
Right.

20
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.200
They measure your height your weight listen to your breathing take an X-ray measure your blood pressure

21
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.880
measure your heart rate.

22
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.170
Run a blood test hit your knee with a tiny little hammer and so on.

23
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.100
The point I'm trying to make is that the doctor will look at various stats to make their diagnosis.

24
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.480
They will look at these stats.

25
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.960
They will check if these stats are too high or too low.

26
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.490
There there's a problem all in light of your overall condition.

27
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:52.020
Now it turns out that just like your body hate regression model also has a number of stats that we can

28
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.260
look at.

29
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.640
In fact there are loads and loads of statistics that we can look at.

30
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.210
Like a scary amount.

31
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.100
But my goal is to show you a couple of these statistics that are relevant to our regression model and

32
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.630
also show you how to interpret them and how to make sense of them.

33
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.340
The first one where we are quite familiar with because we've looked at r squared extensively but as

34
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.590
part of this evaluation process I want to introduce you to several other stats as well.

35
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:27.540
For example the p values of the coefficients the variance inflation factor and the Bayesian information

36
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.010
criterion.

37
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.100
We're going to dip our toes into the murky waters of statistics and get a taster for how to evaluate

38
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.570
a regression model.
