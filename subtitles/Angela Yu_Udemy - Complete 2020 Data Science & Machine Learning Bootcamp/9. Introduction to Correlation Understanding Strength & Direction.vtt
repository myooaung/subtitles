00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.650
Before running our regression analysis there's another thing that we should seek to understand.

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:14.790
Prior to feeding our data into our machine learning algorithm as part of the data exploration we need

3
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.030
to understand to what extent our variables move together.

4
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:30.990
We should look both at the correlation of our features with our target but also at the correlation between

5
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.610
our different features.

6
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.440
So what is correlation and why should you give excuse me.

7
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.280
That was my inner Bostonian coming out but let's talk about what correlation is first.

8
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.060
Correlation is the degree to which things move together and I think you can see this best through some

9
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.620
pictures.

10
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.510
It's no coincidence that a lot of these pictures might look quite similar to what we saw on our lessons

11
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.150
on uni variant linear regression.

12
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:07.620
So here in our first picture on correlation we have a chart showing two variables how much side get

13
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.870
and how much ice cream I eat.

14
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.470
These variables clearly have a relationship.

15
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.430
The amount of sun and the amount of ice cream tend to move together if one of these values is high then

16
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.950
the other value tends to be high too.

17
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.140
If one of them is low then the other one tends to be low as well.

18
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.490
This is called a positive correlation.

19
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.660
The amount of sun and the amount of ice cream I eat are positively correlated.

20
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.400
Okay so what about a negative correlation a negative correlation.

21
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.980
Looks like this the resulting graph will be downward sloping.

22
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.500
What we're looking at here is the amount of time I spend on a packed train carriage hunched over with

23
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.800
my face and somebody else's armpit on the London Underground.

24
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.940
And how happy I am and looking at this graph.

25
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.610
The more time I spend on the London Underground the less happy I am.

26
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.060
If one of these variables has a high value than the other one tends to have a low value.

27
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.110
The variables tend to move in opposite directions.

28
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:24.360
Now the emphasis is on the words tends to when X is high y tends to be low.

29
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.450
You see correlations have a like a strength to them magnitude correlations can be strong or they can

30
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.730
be weak if the value of x is high then the value of Y can be low but it doesn't have to be.

31
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.820
But you know what I'd say this graph that we're looking at here is not an accurate representation of

32
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.240
how I actually feel on the London Underground.

33
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.340
The correlation with my happiness is actually much stronger than what I've represented him.

34
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.160
When I have a guess as to what this graph would look like if these two variables were in fact perfectly

35
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:07.320
negatively correlated at the moment we kind of see a bit of a band cloud of data points as the correlation

36
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.550
gets stronger.

37
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.100
This cloud of data points actually becomes more and more narrow in the extreme.

38
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.850
All the data points would line up to pretty much form a straight line.

39
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:28.560
Now this is a much more accurate representation of how I feel about British transport infrastructure

40
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.510
from the tails of Queen Victoria.

41
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:39.510
Okay so we've looked at a picture of perfect correlation perfect negative correlation at that.

42
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.500
What do you think the graph would look like if the reverse was true but would this graph show if there

43
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.570
was no correlation between the two variables at all.

44
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.550
It would actually look like this.

45
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:59.970
Remember how I said that the cloud of data points narrowed as the strength of the correlation increased.

46
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.370
If there is no correlation then we get a plot that looks somewhat like this.

47
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.120
We get a cloud of points with no clear pattern.

48
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.960
In other words the number of divorces in the state of Maine are uncorrelated to the amount of margarine

49
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.800
consumed.

50
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:23.850
Now so far I've been explaining the intuition behind correlation in a very visual manner.

51
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.320
However you'll typically see correlation written about in mathematical notation and the notation for

52
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.890
correlation tends to look like this.

53
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.280
We tend to use the Greek letter row for correlation.

54
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:46.980
Also the correlation is actually calculated as a single number between minus one and positive one minus

55
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:55.440
one is a perfect negative correlation and positive one is a perfect positive correlation and a correlation

56
00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.580
of zero means that there's no correlation at all the variables are uncorrelated.

57
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.510
Okay so I hope that makes sense.

58
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:12.690
Now we know that the correlation is a statistical measure of a linear relationship between two variables.

59
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.940
Why does correlation matter.

60
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.810
Why should we care about correlation.

61
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:23.730
Why should we look at the correlations of our features during the data exploration stage.

62
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.140
The answer is is that we primarily care about two things.

63
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:37.380
One the strength of the correlation and to that direction since our goal is to be able to predict house

64
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:46.970
prices and build a valuation tool our model should include features that are correlated with house prices.

65
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:54.210
We want to include features in our model whose movement is associated with a big movement and house

66
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.080
prices.

67
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.480
We want magnitude.

68
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.520
We want a correlation that is not close to zero.

69
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:06.120
So strength is important because it tells us how much correlation there actually is.

70
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.410
What's the extent of the movement.

71
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.300
The other thing that we want to know of course is the direction.

72
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:19.710
If there is an increase in x does Y go up or does Y tend to go down that direction is important because

73
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.860
it tells us if the moves are in the same or in the opposite direction.

74
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.510
In other words is the correlation positive or negative.

75
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:28.940
But enough talking.

76
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:35.790
How do we actually find these correlations in two ways by calculating them and by visualizing them in

77
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.490
Jupiter and notebook let's do that now.
