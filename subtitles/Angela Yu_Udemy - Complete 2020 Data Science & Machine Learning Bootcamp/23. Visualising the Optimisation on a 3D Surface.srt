1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,650
All right.

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:07,410
So in this lesson it's finally time to plot our gradient descent.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,620
Here's how we're gonna do it.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,910
The first thing is we're going to add two more variables these variables will collect all the values

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:22,480
that are being calculated within our for loop so that we can plot our algorithms progress on the chart.

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:31,730
I'm gonna call the first one of these plot vowels and this is gonna be our fate as Array reshaped into

7
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,030
a one by two array.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,430
So one wrote two columns.

9
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:44,690
This is we're gonna add on all the theta values that we calculate in the for loop and then the second

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:54,740
variable is gonna be called MSE vowels and this is going to start out simply as our first mean squared

11
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,530
error calculation from our initial guess.

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:12,730
So it's going to be y underscore five comma theta is zero plus theta is square brackets 1 times X underscore

13
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:21,350
5 now that we've defined are two variables and given them some starting values and then add a little

14
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:30,200
comment I'm going to say collect data points for scatter plot because that's ultimately what we're gonna

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:43,760
use these ones for now within our loop what we need to do is append the new values to our num pi arrays

16
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:52,610
so I'm going to use our old friends concatenate and append let's use concatenate on plot values so plot

17
00:01:52,710 --> 00:02:03,080
underscore values it's gonna be equal to end p dot concatenate parentheses and then we need to supply

18
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,900
two things.

19
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:12,980
The first is that tuple that it's going to consist of the old value of plot false so all the previous

20
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:19,680
values that we calculated in the loop plus are updated theta is array.

21
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:29,900
So this is gonna be theta is dot reshape parentheses one comma 2 and then outside of this tuple we're

22
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:37,940
gonna have to specify the x's instead of equal to zero what this line of code will do is it will take

23
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:46,400
the existing array of plot values which is a 1 by 2 array and l concatenated with the new theta values

24
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:54,710
which we've reshaped into a one by two array now we need to capture our mean square error calculations.

25
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,500
So it's gonna be MSE Vals.

26
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:04,910
And just to mix things up I want to use n Pitot append and accomplish the very same thing namely append

27
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,060
values to our array.

28
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,480
So first I have to specify where I want to spend the values to.

29
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:19,350
And this is going to be the MSE underscore values array and then the second thing after specifies which

30
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,980
values I want to append.

31
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,270
So the values are gonna be equal to the new set of calculations.

32
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:34,520
So I'm gonna call our MSE function passin the Y underscore five actual y values and then when a pass

33
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:43,880
in that y hat values and if you remember with four linear regression this was theta zero which was fetus

34
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:56,540
square brackets zero plus theta is square brackets 1 times X on the score 5 and that's it.

35
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,930
Let me press shift enter and try to run this.

36
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,890
See if I've made any errors no.

37
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,860
So far so good.

38
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,430
Now it's time to pull lots the thing.

39
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:14,970
So in order to plotted Umno use an existing cell that we've already made copy it pasted in and then

40
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,520
had the scatter plot to modify the code scrolling up.

41
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,770
I'm going to take this cell right here.

42
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,900
Copy it.

43
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:34,780
Come down here and then I'm going to paste the cell below to add our gradient descent algorithms progress.

44
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:44,380
I just have to add one line of code a scatter plot someone to do that on the axes so a X don't scatter

45
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,170
parentheses.

46
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:56,140
And then I have to supply three things I have to supply the x values the y values and the z values.

47
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:03,250
So our X values are not chart where the theta zeros and we've stored this in a variable called plot

48
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,950
underscore values and we've stored that as the first column.

49
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:22,260
So to select the entire column I can add a colon comma and then a zero to select all the rows in column

50
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:30,240
0 within this array and then for our theta one values I'm going to select plot on the score vowels and

51
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,450
then I'm going to choose the second column so all the values in the second column.

52
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,680
So these are all the rows.

53
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:41,580
Once again a colon to select all the rows at column index 1.

54
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,820
And finally we need the values for the z axis.

55
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:50,760
And this was our MSE on a score vowels variable and that's pretty much it.

56
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,970
That's the key information already supplied.

57
00:05:53,970 --> 00:06:01,110
Now in terms of sizing up all scatter plot I mean choose 80 for the size of the dots.

58
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:06,680
And in terms of color I'm going to go for I don't know black.

59
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,690
Now let me hit shift enter and see what this looks like.

60
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:22,140
Now if you're looking at this chart and you don't see any changes the problem might not actually be

61
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,430
with our code.

62
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,290
The problem might be with our visualization.

63
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:33,570
So I've chosen a black color for the dots and we've got quite a dark chart.

64
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:39,790
So let's change the color and also the transparency of our chart.

65
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:47,250
So I'll set the transparency of the plot surface with an alpha value having a pass and an alpha argument

66
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,700
of zero point four.

67
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,590
Now let me hit shift enter and see if we can track our gradient descent algorithm.

68
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,160
Now

69
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,400
ah now this is already much more clear.

70
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,370
Brilliant.

71
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:12,420
Now given that this is our crowning achievement for this lesson I think we're gonna have to style our

72
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,710
chant in a different way.

73
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:24,990
So I'm gonna go with a psychedelic theme by changing the color map from hot to Rainbow in honor of the

74
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:33,710
final race track in Mario Kart and take a look at our wonderful rainbow colored half pipe here.

75
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,830
Brilliant.

76
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:41,820
So we can clearly see our step size which is initially large as we're far away from the minimum decrease

77
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,470
as we're getting closer and closer.

78
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,270
And the interesting thing about our gradient descent here is that we seem to be reaching the bottom

79
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,170
of this half pipe but there's still some way to go.

80
00:07:52,170 --> 00:08:00,420
The only thing is that the slope is so shallow that all the steps at this point are very very small.

81
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:06,180
So even though we progressed very very quickly to this point down here from there on we have to take

82
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,750
many many steps to get to the actual minimum.

83
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,710
Now all of this was a very very technical section.

84
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:20,820
We've covered quite a lot of mathematical topics and we've really peered under the hood of what goes

85
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,890
on in a machine learning algorithm.

86
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:30,360
We've looked at various different cost functions and we've reviewed some calculus and we've played with

87
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,720
an optimization algorithm by turning various knobs including the learning rates.

88
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,320
The starting point.

89
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,400
And finally even the cost function.

90
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,840
So where do we go from here.

91
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,180
Where do we go next.

92
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:48,520
In the next section we're going to return to do something a bit more practical.

93
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:55,350
We're going to look at a house price data set for the city of Boston in the United States and we're

94
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:02,340
going to get into the business of predicting how much a house is worth based on its characteristics

95
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,230
and the technique we're going to use.

96
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,330
It's called multi variable regression.

97
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,300
So congratulations for making it this far.

98
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,850
I hope you're ready for tackling the challenges coming up in the next lessons.

99
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,870
Looking out the window I can see that the almost never ending London drizzle seems to have stopped.

100
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:29,130
So I think I'm going to take this opportunity to pop out to the shops and restock the coffee that's

101
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,100
slowly running out here.

102
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,770
See you soon.
