1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,330
In this lesson we're going to do the setup on our local machines on our very own computers.

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:14,220
I want to talk you through how to get your laptop or your desktop to run tensor FLOW AND CARIS previously

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:21,120
we've been using the Google collab notebooks to play around with the pre trained models and for most

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,870
of this module you can actually still use the Google collab notebook.

5
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:30,090
In fact if your computer is a bit older and you want to make use of the jeep use that are available

6
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,660
through Google collab then I recommend using Google collab in your browser.

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,890
However the reason I really want to run things locally this time around is because Jupiter notebook

8
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,740
is a little bit snappier than Google collab.

9
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,460
And in addition we're gonna be learning to use a tool called tense board.

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,620
You see neural networks are actually really complicated and tense a board is going to be our flashlight

11
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,290
that will help us monitor and compare different versions of our model.

12
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:09,750
So tensor board is what we're going to use to spot problems to fine tune our parameters to check how

13
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,890
our training is going and to try out different datasets.

14
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,700
Now the distribution that we've got installed that came with a lot of different packages was called

15
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,300
Anaconda and Anaconda comes with a lot of stuff.

16
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:32,310
But at the moment it still doesn't come bundled with tensor flow and carries these are the two packages

17
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,610
that will need to download and install.

18
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,720
How are we gonna do that.

19
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,000
Well we're going to do it the same way that we can download install pretty much any package we're going

20
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,410
to use the command prompt if you're on Windows or the terminal if you're on Mac post the command prompt

21
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,870
and the terminal pretty much look the same.

22
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,170
They're both going to expect you to put in some sort of command some sort of instruction.

23
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:03,420
And the way this works is we're going to supply three things we're going to supply the key words Conda

24
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:10,440
install then we're going to supply one argument with hyphen C followed by the channel name and then

25
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,870
followed by the package name.

26
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:19,530
So to install tensor flow this whole thing is going to read Conda install hyphen C Conda hyphen forge

27
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,320
and then tensor flow.

28
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,330
So here's the plan I'm going to show you how to install tensor flow first and then you can follow the

29
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,270
same process and install Caris on your own afterwards.

30
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:38,840
The reason I recommend going through the command line is because if you go and open the anaconda navigator

31
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:45,260
go to environments and then search for tensor flow then you might find that installing the package doesn't

32
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:52,400
quite work as expected because it's looking towards like a particular channel or what have you and configuring

33
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,240
the anaconda Navigator is a little bit more tiresome going straight to the command prompt and just installing

34
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,240
the package directly with the right instruction.

35
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:09,650
So once I open terminal on my mac or if you've got a Windows computer you just opened and a kind of

36
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:18,800
prompt instead there you'll just simply type condo space install space hyphen see space condo hyphen

37
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:27,110
forge space tensor flow then you'll hit enter and then you'll wait and you'll notice that you might

38
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,080
actually wait for quite a while.

39
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:37,220
So in my case it definitely took several minutes for it to solve my environment for me once that was

40
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,400
finished and all done.

41
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,010
You're going to be prompted to proceed or not.

42
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,700
Yes or no.

43
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:52,010
So type Y and hit enter and then what you'll see is all the dependencies of tensor flow being downloaded

44
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,410
among those dependencies.

45
00:03:54,410 --> 00:04:01,220
You're actually going to spot a tensor board which we're in to use later on in this module again this

46
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,540
installation can actually take quite a bit of time.

47
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:10,640
Tens of low is no small package but it's worth the wait I promise.

48
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,290
But uh yeah just let your computer run and get a coffee in the meantime when it's all done.

49
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:23,720
You should see three messages that read something like preparing transaction done verifying transaction

50
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:31,810
done executing transaction done and your cursor will blink on the next line in your command prompt so

51
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,870
congratulations on successfully installing tensor flow.

52
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:43,010
Now you've got one more thing you've got to do and that's installing Charisse constellation for the

53
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:48,560
carrier's package will work pretty much exactly the same way you're gonna fire up the command prompt

54
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:57,780
put in kinda install high fancy condo forge Caris and then follow the prompts until it's all done.

55
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:05,120
And after all that when you're ready you can fire up a brand new Jupiter notebook and we'll get on that

56
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,410
in the next lesson.

57
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,180
I'll see you there.
