1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:09,380
All right so how do we get to making a prediction or a forecast we have to provide.

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,820
Two things.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:17,290
The estimated property price and the range that goes with the price.

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:24,550
Because this is what the pros do and will also provide an estimate of what the home was worth plus a

5
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,600
degree of uncertainty around that number.

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,820
The estimated price is easy enough right.

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:36,760
Because once we have the theta parameters for the model all we have to do is plug them in and then together

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,220
with the values for the individual features we get an estimate we get our y hat.

9
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,430
But what about the range.

10
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,970
What does that come from.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,950
The range will actually depend on the shape of the distribution that you're working with.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,430
If we know the distribution we can estimate the range very accurately.

13
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,710
And here's the thing.

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:06,730
Our go to distribution is usually the normal distribution because the very very nice thing about the

15
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,550
normal distribution is that we know its shape.

16
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:20,000
We know that for a normal distribution 68 percent of the observations are between these two points.

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,440
Sixty eight percent of all the values in this distribution are within this purple range right here.

18
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:36,580
And for normal distribution we also know that around 95 percent of the values are between these two

19
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,280
points here.

20
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:45,220
Ninety five percent of the observations fall within this pink range that I've highlighted right here.

21
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,670
The individual points that I've drawn on this histogram right here actually have a name.

22
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:56,200
They quantify the amount of variation around the mean.

23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:03,090
The mean is right here in the middle of the distribution and the distance from the mean to that bright

24
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:09,690
purple point is called one standard deviation for a normal distribution.

25
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:16,210
You'll usually see the Greek letter sigma used to denote the standard deviation.

26
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,940
Now what about the other points that I had drawn on here earlier.

27
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:29,140
Well the left purple point is at minus one standard deviation minus one standard deviation from the

28
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:38,080
mean and for normal distribution as we said before around 68 percent of all the observations lie between

29
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,210
minus and plus one standard deviation.

30
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:42,480
OK.

31
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,960
What about the pink points.

32
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:52,510
Well the right pink point is that two standard deviations and the left pink point is at minus two standard

33
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,600
deviations.

34
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:59,680
And as we've said before approximately ninety five percent of observations lie between plus two and

35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,090
minus two standard deviation is for a normal distribution.

36
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,740
Now let me ask you this.

37
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:13,360
If this green point here right in the middle is our estimate for the property price from our model are

38
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,500
y hat What is the distribution that we're gonna be looking at here.

39
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:29,710
Any guess once the distribution that tells us something about the variance in our price estimates how

40
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,060
we're going to be coming full circle here.

41
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:37,210
It's actually the distribution of the residuals from our regression.

42
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:44,880
This is the reason why we care so much about whether the distribution is a normal distribution or not.

43
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,100
Now the next question you might ask at this point is well.

44
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,400
OK.

45
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:56,980
So if the distribution is the distribution of the residuals then what do the purple and pink dots represent.

46
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,090
How do we get our range.

47
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,580
Do you remember our mean square error.

48
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:09,380
And then the mean square is not the purple dot but we can make one small modification to the mean square

49
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:16,010
error and get something very very handy for calculating the range and making predictions.

50
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:23,300
And that small modification is by taking the square root of this thing by taking the square root of

51
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,040
the mean square error.

52
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,500
We get another metric and this one is called yes surprise surprise.

53
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:39,710
The root mean square error or our MSE and it's this metric the RNC that has a really really nice interpretation

54
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:48,110
because the root mean square error represents one standard deviation of the differences between our

55
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,750
actual and our predicted values.

56
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:58,160
The root mean square error is one standard deviation in the distribution of our residuals.

57
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:06,260
So let's look at the chart again to create our range around our estimated price our so-called prediction

58
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,430
interval.

59
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:16,610
The first thing we choose is how wide we want that interval to be say we want to cover around 95 percent

60
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,440
of the observations.

61
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,170
Then we would use two standard deviations either side.

62
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:30,080
And this means taking our prediction and adding two times the brute mean square error to it for the

63
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:38,310
upper bound and subtracting two times the root mean square error for our lower bound on our prediction.

64
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,060
And that's how we get the range in our Jupiter notebook.

65
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:50,840
This means simply taking the square root of R means quite error that we've already calculated coming

66
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,100
to the cell where we've got our data frame with our mean square error.

67
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:02,180
What I'm going to do is add another column so I'll put a comma here go to the next line single quotes

68
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,670
and put R and S E here and then a colon.

69
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,580
Now I can take this entire list here.

70
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,430
Copy it.

71
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:19,830
And then here what I want to do is I want to use num pi and call the square root function from num Pi.

72
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:28,030
And as an argument I'm going to pass in the list that I just copied and what this will do is I'll take

73
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,320
the square root of all the items in the list.

74
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,660
Let me refresh the cell.

75
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,950
Here we go.

76
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:41,310
Now that we've done that I want to give you a challenge.

77
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,070
Suppose we have an estimate from our model.

78
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,530
Yeah for a house price of thirty thousand dollars.

79
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:57,940
Can you calculate the upper and lower bound for a 95 percent prediction interval using the reduced log

80
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,170
model.

81
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:06,890
In other words can you calculate the upper and the lower bound for the range around this estimate.

82
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,810
I'll give you a few seconds to pause the video before I show you the solution

83
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:13,980
all right.

84
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,950
Let's take it from the top.

85
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,980
Someone out of print statement and to spell it out.

86
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:28,440
Someone say one standard deviation in log prices because we've got two units is and that will be the

87
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,790
square root of our log means quote error.

88
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:44,290
So end p dot square root reduced underscore log MSE agreed What's that equal to it's equal to this much.

89
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,050
Now what about two standard deviations.

90
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:54,160
I can calculate that simply by taking the first print statement copying it and then multiplying this

91
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,280
whole thing by two.

92
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:56,770
Here we go.

93
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:05,140
This is two standard deviations the upper bound for the prediction interval will be equal to our White

94
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,990
Hat plus two times the route means squared error.

95
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,340
Now I've been pretty sneaky and I've given you the y hat in dollar values.

96
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:23,320
So you actually have to use a log transformation and put out log 30 since our model is given in thousands

97
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:33,790
and then you have to add two times and p dot square root reduced underscore log underscore MSE So this

98
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:42,540
is our y hat plus two times the root means squared error let me print that out so I'm going to say print

99
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:58,310
the upper bound for a ninety five percent prediction interval is comma upper and a score bound that's

100
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:07,070
equal to three point seven eight approximately how if we wanted to see this and dollar values then we

101
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:15,200
can say well the upper bound in land prices for a 95 percent prediction interval is this much and I

102
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:27,020
can copy this pasted in and I can say the upper bound in normal prices is and p dot e to the power of

103
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,310
upper bound.

104
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,180
So let's see what that is.

105
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:36,880
I can make that more explicit by multiplying this whole thing times 1000.

106
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:43,910
Putting a little dollar sign here and there I've got my upper bound the lower bound is very very similar.

107
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:52,010
Can you copy these three lines paste them in and change this to lower bound is equal to N.P. dot log

108
00:09:52,190 --> 00:10:01,430
thirty minus two times the root mean square area then I can change my print statements to read the lower

109
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:09,110
bound and log prices for 95 percent prediction interval is lower underscore bound and the lower bound

110
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:16,990
in normal prices is end p r e times times lower I just go bound times 1000.

111
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,110
Let's see what this reads.

112
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:25,140
The lower bound in this case is twenty thousand and six hundred and thirty five dollars.

113
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:32,360
Now the trick with this challenge is to do the addition of the root mean square error and the transformation

114
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,600
in the right order because otherwise you'll get a very very different result.

115
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,910
The incorrect way of calculating the upper bound would have been to take two times the root mean square

116
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:51,440
error and simply say well okay we've got a estimate of thirty thousand and then we're going to add to

117
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:59,130
it the transformed value and Piedmont e times times and then the root mean square error.

118
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,230
Times 1000.

119
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:11,120
So this was the little trick in how I phrase this challenge in summary we often look towards the root

120
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:18,110
mean square error when we're interested in the predictive power of our models and to some extent we

121
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,790
can use the root means squared error.

122
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:26,630
To also compare the models and the reason is is that the root mean square is a very good measure of

123
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:36,390
how accurately the model predicts the target because we can determine a range the width of this range

124
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,490
is a very important criterion.

125
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:44,370
If the main purpose of the model is prediction and this is a big contrast to something like r squared

126
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,690
because r squared says absolutely nothing about the predictive power of the model or the prediction

127
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,070
error.

128
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:53,780
Okay.

129
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:59,290
So we're slowly coming towards the end of the section in the next lesson.

130
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:08,100
We're gonna finish it up by building a valuation tool for our boss and our real estate office and that's

131
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,930
going to involve probably updating the prices to reflect today's dollar values a little bit.

132
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:21,600
I think the past an upper price of fifty thousand dollars is not really that accurate anymore.

133
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:29,310
And we're also going to be looking at how we can create a python function with optional arguments.

134
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:35,820
So arguments where there's already default values set similar to what we've seen with seaborne and my

135
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:42,930
plot lib and we're going to cover the syntax the python syntax how we can create functions like this

136
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,190
ourselves have see in the next lessons care.
