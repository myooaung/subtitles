1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:08,400
So now that we've plotted our actual prices versus our predictions and we've generated this chart here

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:19,470
let's move on in our residual analysis to the CIS the chart of this one because in this chart we can't

3
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,580
actually see the residuals explicitly right.

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,350
We can see kind of how far the data points are from the sine line here.

5
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,910
But our residuals are actually not on one of the axes.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,870
Let's make this much more explicit and plot our residuals versus the predicted values that come up here.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,510
Add a comment that reads residuals versus predicted values.

8
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,890
To take these lines of code copy them paste them below.

9
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,350
And how I'm going to modify them a little bit.

10
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,520
So want to get rid of this line on the x axis.

11
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:14,010
I want the label to read predicted lock prices and then slash had y underscore I font size 14 on the

12
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,090
y axis.

13
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:28,030
I wanted to read just residuals and for the title I wanted to read residuals versus fitted values.

14
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,780
Now let's update the arguments in the scatter plot.

15
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:39,220
So for the x axis you've already guessed it's gonna be results dot fitted values and for the y axis

16
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,590
it's going to read results.

17
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,430
Dot visit for the color.

18
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,530
I want to go with navy for the Alpha.

19
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,530
I'll leave it at zero point six.

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,410
Now let me hit shift enter.

21
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:01,700
So this is the chart that you can compare to the charts that you've seen in the slides earlier on in

22
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,560
the lesson.

23
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,220
How do we interpret what we're looking at here.

24
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,600
Are you seeing any obvious patterns.

25
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:15,710
I think it's actually pretty ok the residuals look fairly random for the most part and the residuals

26
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,800
are actually centered around zero.

27
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:27,050
So looking at the y axis here we can see that a lot of the residuals are centered around zero the residuals

28
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,980
are also fairly symmetric.

29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,980
They don't seem to be systematically high or systematically low.

30
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,040
So the model is kind of correct on on average.

31
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:44,090
But in this chart we also see the issue with the high price bracket homes filtering through.

32
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,530
No surprise there.

33
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,710
Can you spot them.

34
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:54,200
Which data points on this chart correspond to all the fifty thousand dollar homes.

35
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,790
They're actually right here.

36
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:03,320
You see how this almost traces out a line these data points on this chart correspond to these data points

37
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:10,010
on this chart that shows fifty thousand dollar properties that were bad at predicting seemed to be lining

38
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,820
up.

39
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:15,410
Now let's to our next check on the residuals that we talked about.

40
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,750
Let's check for normality.

41
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:26,210
Let's see if our normality assumption is satisfied or close to satisfied because in the beginning of

42
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,980
the lesson we said well we kind of want these residuals to be normally distributed.

43
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,070
Let's check out if they really are or not.

44
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:44,390
And the sub below went out a comment and that's going to read distribution of residuals lock prices

45
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:55,690
hyphen checking for normality a normal distribution if you remember has a mean and a skew of what 0.

46
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,760
Right.

47
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,850
The skew should be zero and the mean should be zero.

48
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,520
How do we print out the mean and the skew.

49
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:09,570
We'll take our results objects results dot reside get the residuals and then we can change a method

50
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:18,730
onto this for the mean would use dot mean parentheses me shift into what's printed out here.

51
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,190
Is in scientific notation.

52
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:30,990
So let's round this let's say round parentheses results dot raise it don't mean comma and then let's

53
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:38,430
round to three decimal places and have the closing parentheses at the end shift enter and we see here

54
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:44,570
that the mean of our residuals is indeed very very close to zero.

55
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,350
Mr. This and a variable called reside and a score mean.

56
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:59,880
And now let's print out the skew so results start reserved don't skew parentheses should be our skew.

57
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,390
See what that is.

58
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,060
Huh.

59
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,610
Okay.

60
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:11,740
Zero point one two approximately calls around that round to three decimal points.

61
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:18,530
And I'm also going to store this in a variable visit on the score skews equal to this whole thing.

62
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,170
So fair enough.

63
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,620
The mean is equal to zero.

64
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,690
The skew is not equal to zero but it's not too far off.

65
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:34,450
Now looking at these two numbers is helpful but it's even better if we complement this with a plot with

66
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,470
a graphic.

67
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:43,630
So when you born here as an S dot just plot distribution plot parentheses and then as the arguments

68
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,870
will provide our residuals.

69
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,820
So results don't resist.

70
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:55,310
And for the color we'll go with the Navy again.

71
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:03,820
I think every plot needs a title so appeal teed up title and then as a title we'll say single quotes

72
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:10,440
long prize model colon residuals.

73
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:17,740
Now let's go with L teed up show and see what this looks like.

74
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,770
Here we go.

75
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,840
Here we see the distribution of our residuals using C Bourne's disk plot function.

76
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,750
I can come back up here make this an F string by putting the little f in front and add our residuals

77
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:42,880
mean and the skew into the title so I'll go with SKU parentheses curly braces wristed underscore SKU

78
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:55,280
and mean parentheses curly braces Sid on a school mean we didn't calculate the mean in this Q and rounded

79
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,060
for nothing after all let's show it in our chart.

80
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,560
There we go.

81
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,880
So how are we doing.

82
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,980
Well the mean is equal to zero but that's no surprise.

83
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,030
That's actually by design.

84
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,950
That's how the regression models best fit line his calculated.

85
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:20,220
No matter how bad your regression line the mean is gonna be equal to zero by design but I think the

86
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:27,680
skew being close to zero is a result of our data transformation and I'm going to prove this to you shortly.

87
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:36,570
Looking at this histogram and the estimated distribution for the residuals by seaborne what's really

88
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:44,550
comforting to see is that the residuals are fairly symmetrical right and they have a fairly constant

89
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,240
spread throughout the range.

90
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,450
So I think we're doing pretty ok.

91
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:56,940
The thing that you do notice however is that this distribution in contrast to a normal distribution

92
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,350
has much longer tails.

93
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:07,680
So there's more values in the extreme left and the extreme right than what you would see with a normal

94
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,640
distribution.

95
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:13,880
You've got a bigger peak in the middle and then you've got longer tails on either end.

96
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:21,120
So this is where the similarity to the normal distribution is much much weaker.

97
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,580
Okay.

98
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:28,650
So we've looked at three charts of our residuals but I think what we really really need to do is we

99
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:34,920
need to compare how these charts looked like four different models because if these three charts are

100
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,220
all we've ever seen we don't really have much context right.

101
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,520
And so on that note I'd like to pose a challenge to you.

102
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,840
I want you to generate these three plots right.

103
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:57,570
So this distribution the residuals versus the fitted values and the fitted values versus the observed

104
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:03,240
values for the original model that we had.

105
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:11,630
So this was the model with all the features using normal prices not the transformed log prices.

106
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:19,200
And after you've generated those charts I want you to analyze and interpret the results that you're

107
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,960
getting back so I'll give you a few seconds to pause the video and give this a shot.

108
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,970
OK ready.

109
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,130
Here's the solution.

110
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:45,550
Use the lazy man's approach and copy this entire cell when going to then come here and paste it in and

111
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:51,340
I'm going to modify the code a little bit when I change my comment here.

112
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,640
See original model

113
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:04,320
normal prices and all features to use normal prices.

114
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:12,960
I have to not just get rid of this comment but we have to get rid of this and Dot log here and to use

115
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:25,690
all the features I'm going to delete in this and age from the arguments under the drop method scrolling

116
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,170
down.

117
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,830
Tony this comment anymore.

118
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,050
Don't read these comments anymore and then forward the scatter plot.

119
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,910
I'm gonna go with a different color.

120
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,300
I'm gonna go with uh Indigo for the labels on this chart.

121
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:51,850
I want to see actual prices thousands predicted prices thousands for the title.

122
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:56,410
I to see actual versus predicted prices coming down.

123
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:03,310
I'm going to delete this line of code which we don't need for our second chance.

124
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:11,830
I'm also gonna go with indigo when I update the labels and now all I have to do is have the distribution

125
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,360
graph.

126
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:21,100
So that's gonna be a residual distribution chart which I'm going to grab from up here.

127
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,820
I'm going to grab these lines of code here.

128
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,820
Copy them put them down here paste them in again.

129
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,800
Change the color to indigo to set them apart a little bit.

130
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:42,770
I think my title haven't read residuals and print out the skew and the mean in the title.

131
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,480
And that's pretty much it.

132
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,910
The coding side of this challenge is pretty trivial because we're using a lot of the code.

133
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:57,260
But let's take a look at what the charts look like and see what the differences are between what we

134
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,910
are doing here and what we did earlier.

135
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,110
First up our actual versus our predicted prices.

136
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:12,020
Now visually the first graph and this one here actually seem quite similar.

137
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:18,320
And that's no surprise given that the correlation between the fitted values and the observed values

138
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,810
is around the same.

139
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:26,690
Yes it's a bit was we know that from the r squared that we calculated and it has a little bit lower

140
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:33,980
correlation but it's not super dramatic on the differences the predicted and the actual values are actually

141
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:42,110
fairly close to the sine line as they were with the log prices now coming down on the second chart here.

142
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,880
This one is much more interesting here we're definitely starting to see a little bit of a difference

143
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,380
compared with the log prices.

144
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:58,690
The cloud of residuals looks almost like it's got a little bit of a parabolic shape to it.

145
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,490
It's kind of subtle and you almost have to kind of squint a little bit.

146
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,730
But what we're seeing here doesn't look entirely random.

147
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:15,830
This provides further justification that the log transformation for the target values that we did was

148
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,350
indeed appropriate.

149
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,940
Now what about the third chart.

150
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:27,200
What about the histogram and the distribution of the residuals coming down.

151
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,980
We see that.

152
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:28,540
Yeah.

153
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,090
The mean is equal to zero.

154
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,680
But what about the skew.

155
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:40,600
And here we need to see that with a skew of one point five approximately the distribution of the residuals.

156
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,180
It's actually fairly lopsided.

157
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:51,170
This makes this distribution a lot more dissimilar from a normal distribution because the skew of a

158
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,480
normal distribution is zero.

159
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:59,350
And we've got one point five approximately a distribution of residuals.

160
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:07,910
That's not close to a normal distribution makes things much more difficult when it comes to making predictions

161
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:12,820
and making forecasts which is ultimately what we wanted to do right.

162
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:20,920
This is t assignment that our Boss gave us in our imaginary real estate office.

163
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,370
So I hope this was a helpful contrast to what we saw earlier and provides a bit more context.

164
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:31,610
But I want to show you one more example because before we finish this lesson I want to show you the

165
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:39,950
kind of pattern that you could see in your residuals when you're missing important features or omitting

166
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:44,180
kind of key variables in your regression.

167
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:53,150
So let me come back up here copy this paste it and then I'm going to update my comment here.

168
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,920
I'm going to say model

169
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:05,130
omitting key features using log prices

170
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:15,110
and now what I'm going to do is start dropping quite a few features from our dataset.

171
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:26,550
I'm going to drop not just in this day and age but I'm also going to drop else that I want to drop our

172
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:34,270
am I going to drop an o x and I want to drop crime.

173
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,600
Now we said we'll use log prices.

174
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:45,580
So I'm going to add and p dot log pack here where we're getting our prices and then just as a review

175
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:51,730
you don't actually have to stick to the named colors that are in matte plot lib.

176
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,750
You can actually specify any color you want any shade you want.

177
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:02,680
If you go to a Web site like Flat UI colors dot com you can grab a particular hex code that identifies

178
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:10,210
a particular shade of a color the hex codes or start with this pound symbol and then there are six letters

179
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,150
or numbers following that.

180
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:20,600
So I'm going to take a closer in here which I can then paste in here where I've referenced Indigo.

181
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:31,620
So c is equal to LB e 7 for c 3 C. This is this shade of Algerian that we've copied from the other website

182
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,590
coming down.

183
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:38,860
I'm also gonna replace the color in our second chant so that way each of our models has a certain theme

184
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,890
going on and I'm also gonna delete this block of code at the bottom.

185
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,880
Finally just gonna update the title here.

186
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:58,030
So I want that title to read actual versus predicted prices with or Mitt 2D variables hand the very

187
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:03,520
last thing we have to do on the labeling front is change our X and Y labels.

188
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:13,640
So these are gonna be back to log prices X label is gonna read actual log prices and r y label is gonna

189
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:19,260
read print Dick Ted log prices.

190
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,290
Let's take a look at our charts.

191
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,000
There we go.

192
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,250
So this is interesting right.

193
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:34,610
As before we see this banding here on the top right with a very expensive properties at fifty thousand.

194
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:43,080
We also see that as expected the correlation between our fitted values and our observed values is much

195
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:50,340
much lower because we're leaving out a lot of information a lot of explanatory features from our model

196
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,260
but not only that we see this kind of like banding here.

197
00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:05,570
So you've got all these data points lining up here and here and even inside this cloud here scrolling

198
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:13,790
down we see that this is even more extreme when we look at the residuals versus the fitted values.

199
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:21,770
Here you can see the banding very very clearly in the residual chart instead of a completely random

200
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,450
distribution of residuals.

201
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:29,240
What we see in this chart here are clusters.

202
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:35,450
This is a very very clear pattern and it's telling us that there's some important information that's

203
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:42,790
missing from our model and this information has somehow found its way into the residuals.

204
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:51,380
And this kind of brings me to my final thoughts on the banding that we see with the fifty thousand dollar

205
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,710
homes.

206
00:18:52,820 --> 00:19:01,220
My hypothesis as to why we see these properties lining up like this is because there's something maybe

207
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:08,870
missing from our model maybe there is some feature that these are homes all have in common or there

208
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:14,900
was something in the way that the data was collected or there is some sort of interaction between a

209
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:20,900
feature of these homes that we're not capturing in our model.

210
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:27,380
If I wanted to kind of dig into this further and improve this model that we have further this would

211
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,510
be one of the things I would be looking at.

212
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,950
This would be something I could dig into.

213
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,160
But we have more important things to do.

214
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,950
You and I we're gonna be moving on to bigger and better things.

215
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:45,490
We're gonna be moving on to making predictions from our regression model.

216
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,340
This is what we ultimately set out to do right.

217
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,480
I'll see you in the next lesson.

218
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,050
Take her.
