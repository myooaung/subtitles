00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,130
Over the next couple of lessons we're going to talk about Python programming in depth.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,960
The aim of this section is to make sense and explain the code that we wrote in the previous lessons

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,040
when we we're estimating the movie revenue.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,680
As such the next lessons are not going to teach you more machine learning concepts.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,530
Instead the lessons will focus on the Python programming fundamentals.

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:31,380
We're going to take a deep dive into the python code that we wrote for visualizing our data and for

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,410
running our aggression in the Jupiter notebook.

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,980
What Python programming fundamentals will we look at.

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:45,930
We're going to discuss programming concepts such as variables data types functions methods and objects.

10
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:51,050
These are the fundamental stepping stones on which all the other future lessons are going to be built

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,180
for these lessons.

12
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,540
I will assume no prior programming knowledge.

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:02,000
So if you've already got some programming experience feel free to skip ahead through the upcoming videos

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,160
or just watch the videos at double speed.

15
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:10,560
How I also tried really really hard to find you guys some interesting data sets for us to look at hand.

16
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:16,610
I came across a pretty weird medical study that was done in the United States in 1968.

17
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:23,930
So for her programming exercises we will use the data from this study which examines how math test scores

18
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,190
were affected by the use of psychedelic drugs.

19
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,400
Now without further ado let's jump straight into how to get set up.

20
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,130
Let's fire up a new Jupiter notebook.

21
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:42,870
This time we're going to use the locally installed version instead of the try.

22
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,470
Don Jupiter dot org Web site.

23
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,770
Now there's different ways you can do this.

24
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,400
First let me show you how to do it with the anaconda Navigator.

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:59,930
So simply open the anaconda navigator and then click on launch Jupiter notebook at this point.

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,900
The Jupiter notebook will open in your browser but you'll notice if you look at your address bar instead

27
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,900
of it reading tried out Jupiter dot org.

28
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:16,140
It will read local host the other way to open a Jupiter notebook without going through the anaconda

29
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,460
navigator is simply by going through the terminal or the command prompt.

30
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,560
First let me show you how to do this on a mac on a Mac.

31
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,880
You'd open the terminal

32
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:37,610
and then you would type Jupiter notebook and hit enter and you'll get exactly the same result as going

33
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,260
through the anaconda navigator.

34
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,310
Since loading the anaconda navigator can be a bit slow at times.

35
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,810
I actually prefer this as a way of getting to the Jupiter notebook very very quickly.

36
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,750
Now if you're running a Windows machine you don't have a terminal.

37
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,630
Instead you'll have something called the command prompt.

38
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,740
In fact when you installed Anaconda it would have actually given you something called the anaconda prompt

39
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:07,710
as a convenient shortcut you'll find this Anaconda prompt in your start menu.

40
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,990
So if I go to show all my apps it's right here Anaconda prompt

41
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,200
and this is what it looks like since I use this Anaconda prompt quite a bit.

42
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,450
I've actually pinned it to my taskbar for easy access and this is what I'll recommend for you guys as

43
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,580
well in the anaconda prompt.

44
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,980
You simply give the same command as on Mac.

45
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,210
You're right Jupiter notebook

46
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,650
when you hit enter you do put a notebook should fire up in your default browser.

47
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:44,020
Now what we're gonna do is we're going to create a folder where we're gonna save all our work and we're

48
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:52,680
gonna call this folder AML projects the way to create this folder is to go to new and then go to New

49
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,420
Folder.

50
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,130
You should then see an untitled folder appear.

51
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,490
But instead of leaving it as untitled folder you're going to put a tick box next to it and then you

52
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,180
get ahead rename.

53
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:12,710
And here you're gonna give it the name M.L. projects and confirm so click on your MLK projects folder

54
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,830
to open it.

55
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,950
And then once inside you're going to create a new Python notebook.

56
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,410
Click on you then Python 3

57
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:35,130
and then let's rename this notebook to zero to Python intro hit rename and then let's navigate back

58
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,040
to the MLK projects folder.

59
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:43,620
You've probably done some work in the previous lesson when we were working on tried on Jupiter dot org

60
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:51,930
and you've probably downloaded your notebook at the time what you can do now is upload that notebook

61
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,600
to your M.L. projects folder.

62
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,460
That way you can keep all your coursework together.

63
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,110
So just click upload.

64
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:05,340
Select your python notebook and select the cost underscore revenue underscore clean data set as well

65
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,440
that see as the file that I provided previously and then click open.

66
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:16,290
You should see the two line items appear in your AML projects folder where you can confirm by hitting

67
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:23,820
the blue upload button how you've got your previous work accessible here together with the data set

68
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,630
that we used great.

69
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,350
Now we're all set to dive into Python programming.
