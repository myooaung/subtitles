00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.960
The first step in data science and machine learning is always defining the problem that you want to

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.800
solve and making sure that you're asking the right questions.

3
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.460
So in this video let's specify the exact question that we want to answer.

4
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.870
We're going to formulate our goal and we're going to set the context for the upcoming videos.

5
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.470
Imagine that you're living in the beautiful city of Boston Massachusetts in the United States.

6
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.880
You moved there a number of years ago and you're doing your best to pick up the local accent.

7
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.550
Now I am told that you can't really do a Boston accent without liberal use of profanity so I will resist

8
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.360
the temptation of doing an impression of one right now anyhow.

9
00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.030
Imagine you're living in Boston and you're working in the real estate business and you have this friend

10
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.910
who recently moved to the city.

11
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.300
So you decide to meet up with them and one of the local coffee shops you two get talking and he asks

12
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.040
you.

13
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.650
So uh I'm looking to buy a place to live here.

14
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.580
How much does a house cost in Boston how this is the opportunity that you've been waiting for all your

15
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.190
life.

16
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.850
So you grab your little calculator and your little model house from your bag and you put it onto the

17
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.040
table and coyly respond.

18
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.790
Well it depends what kind of house are we talking about.

19
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.180
I don't know.

20
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.460
Says your friend.

21
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.900
How much does a house cost around here.

22
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.000
You work in real estate.

23
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.720
You should know your friend has completely ignored your request for more information and to be more

24
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.700
specific and continues to press you on an answer.

25
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.570
So you respond.

26
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.420
It depends on the size of the housemate.

27
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.660
What are we talking about.

28
00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.540
A shoebox of an apartment or an MTV Cribs style mansion also.

29
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.460
Which part of town do you want to buy a house in downtown or in the suburbs.

30
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.700
Your friend just stares you down and says Just give me a number What are you gonna say to that with

31
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.460
no information about the kind of house.

32
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.350
No information about the home's features.

33
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.510
No information on the location.

34
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.680
What's the best possible answer that you can give your friend.

35
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.370
What's the most truthful way to answer this question.

36
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.540
The answer is just the average home price in Boston right.

37
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.970
So you turn to your friend smile and say five hundred and sixty seven thousand five hundred dollars

38
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.980
and you silently decide that you never want to meet somebody who is so poor at phrasing their questions.

39
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.190
Ever again.

40
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.100
The next morning you roll into your snazzy downtown office and your boss calls you over and says I've

41
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.730
got a new project for you.

42
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.340
Our real estate agents need a software tool that helps them value homes in the Boston area.

43
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:11.510
At the push of a button this tool needs to output a benchmark price based on the characteristics of

44
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.540
the home and by characteristics.

45
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.030
I mean things like how many rooms the home has or how much crime there is in the area plus a whole bunch

46
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.880
of other factors also.

47
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.340
We want to see the contribution of each factor in your model so don't create a magic black box that

48
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.190
just spits out a number.

49
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.200
Our agents each know which features of a house are more important in determining the house price and

50
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.960
which factors are less important in determining the house price.

51
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.950
Our real estate agents need to know what the premium is for living in a home where parents can send

52
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.370
their kids to a good school.

53
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.190
In other words this valuation tool needs to be tractable.

54
00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.450
Also if your tool doesn't completely suck then we might even put it up on our website for anyone to

55
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.240
get a valuation for their home.

56
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.980
The same way that companies like Zillow do it or zoo in the UK can you do this.

57
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.630
Do you accept this mission.

58
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.760
So you look at your boss and you think yourself.

59
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.600
You know what this sounds like the kind of thing that my friend from the coffee shop would have needed.

60
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.120
And also this sounds like an awesome project.

61
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:34.650
So you look your boss square in the eyes and say Roger that I can do this hand you fist bump your boss

62
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.850
because that's what people do in Boston and in stock photography.

63
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.230
Also the intern standing next to you joins in with the fist bump and off you go.
