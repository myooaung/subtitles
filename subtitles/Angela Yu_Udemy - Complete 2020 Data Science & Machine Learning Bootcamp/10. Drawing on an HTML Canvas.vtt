1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.550
All right.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:10.650
So welcome back for the second part of writing the drawing logic on our web application.

3
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.250
The goal of this lesson really is to make sure that we only draw when we're actually clicking and dragging

4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.850
rather than we're just mousing over the canvas.

5
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.650
So we only want to draw when the mouse button is held down and there's actually three other things we're

6
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.590
gonna cover in this lesson as well.

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.350
We're going to cover how to respond to touch events for tablets and phones.

8
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:38.640
We're going to introduce the programing concept of scope in JavaScript and we're also gonna learn how

9
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.020
to refactor and reorganize code in this code.

10
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.920
So to start this lesson off I'd like to pose a challenge to you.

11
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.540
I'd like you to implement the following functionality on this Web site.

12
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.940
Here's the behavior that I'm looking for.

13
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:04.170
By the time that you've finished the challenge you should be able to click and drag on the canvas in

14
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.560
order to draw and in the console over here you should be able to see mouse pressed when you push the

15
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.520
button down and you should be able to see mouse released when you lift your finger off the mouse button.

16
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.380
So this is what we're after for this challenge.

17
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.370
So in order to complete this challenge you're going to have to do three things.

18
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.810
First you can have to listen for one more mouse event in your code.

19
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.590
So I recommend you pull up the documentation from NBN or W3 schools to check what mouse event that could

20
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.560
be second.

21
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.640
You're also going into a way of tracking the state of the Web site.

22
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.660
Meaning is the button currently being pressed or is it not currently being pressed.

23
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.840
So you're gonna have to add some code around that in order to track that.

24
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.510
And thirdly you're going to have to change the code inside mouse down a little bit in order to get that

25
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.810
the behavior that we're looking for.

26
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.790
But I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give you a couple of seconds to pause the video and give this a go.

27
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.880
But if you're unsure because this is a bit more of a complex challenge I'm going to give you two hints.

28
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.710
So I'm going to give you the first hint after a couple of seconds and then will give you the second

29
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.100
hand.

30
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.830
After a couple of further seconds so positive.

31
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.060
Now if you want to tackle the challenge without any of the hints

32
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.320
so here's hint number one.

33
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.760
The event that you're looking for is called mouse up.

34
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.910
It's this one right here.

35
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.880
Now pause the video and see if you can complete the challenge.

36
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.690
The second hint I'm gonna give you is you're gonna have to create a variable to track if the mouse has

37
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.360
been pressed so I'm going to create a variable here and I'm going to call it is painting and I'm going

38
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.730
to store a boolean in here.

39
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.740
And I'm simply going to store false.

40
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.350
Of course you can use any name that you'd like.

41
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.630
But the important thing is that you're going to change the value of this variable depending on the mouse

42
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.990
events

43
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.710
all right.

44
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.040
So here's the solution.

45
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.730
The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to add that second mass event and I'm simply going to copy

46
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.160
this line of code here actually.

47
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:30.840
And when I come down here and I'm going to add the mass event just above this curly brace and it's not

48
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.860
gonna be mass down.

49
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:40.140
It's gonna be a mouse up and I want to change the console log message here to mouse released.

50
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.980
And when the mouse has been released then is painting should be equal to False.

51
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.540
So I'm gonna make sure that the variable that I'm using to track whether the mouse is being pressed

52
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.620
is set to false when the button is released.

53
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.460
So when should is painting be equal to true.

54
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.220
Well of course when the mouse has been pressed down when the button has been pressed down it's in this

55
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.920
case that is painting should be equal to true.

56
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.130
So now we're able to track whether the mouse is being dragged or not.

57
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.260
I'm also gonna change the console log message here to mouse pressed.

58
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:28.020
Now that we're tracking whether or not we are dragging the mouse we can check against is painting to

59
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.920
see whether we should draw something inside.

60
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.720
Mouse move.

61
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.830
So what we want to do is we only want to execute these lines of code as long as his painting is true.

62
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.670
So if is painting.

63
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:51.750
So if true then execute these lines of code it's going to move these up here and then what I'll do is

64
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:58.510
I'm going to reinvent my code so I'm going to right click here and I'm going to format my document.

65
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.000
So if you're right clicking as well then check with the keyboard shortcut is here because you're probably

66
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.490
gonna be using it quite often.

67
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:12.000
So for me it's the option key shift and F but if you're in Windows just check what it is that you see

68
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.120
here.

69
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.500
All right.

70
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.330
Perfect.

71
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.650
So let's test this out.

72
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.990
Let's save our progress head back into chrome and let's refresh our site.

73
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.010
So I'm going to refresh and then I'm going to try and clicking and dragging.

74
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.380
But what I'm seeing here is that nothing has changed.

75
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.610
Nothing has changed at all.

76
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.350
So what's going on.

77
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.320
Well maybe I'm actually still getting the old version of my web site.

78
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:45.630
So one of the things you might have to do is you might have to actually clear your cache so in Chrome

79
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.200
go to the overflow menu and more tools and go to where it says clear browsing data.

80
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:58.800
And I'm just gonna clear the last 24 hours and then I'm going to refresh and then my changes have been

81
00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.880
applied.

82
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.190
So this is a good thing to be aware of.

83
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:08.820
You can get very very confused by chrome just giving you the previous version of your Web site and not

84
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.570
really reflecting the changes.

85
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.630
So this is a good one to remember.

86
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.910
If you get some unexpected behavior just clear your browsing data and refresh the site again.

87
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:19.200
All right.

88
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.790
So clicking and dragging.

89
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:21.060
Right.

90
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.860
This is where we're at.

91
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.030
If I click in the middle of my canvas I press my mouse and I move.

92
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.570
Then I get this line up here from the top left corner.

93
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.960
And if I let go and then press again and I move I get a line appearing between the point I was last

94
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.520
at and where I clicked.

95
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.810
So why is this why is their connecting line coming in from the top left.

96
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:51.760
When I first click somewhere on my canvas Well this all has to do with the initial values of the current

97
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:58.900
X and the current Y when we click down and we move our mouse we're essentially grabbing the top left

98
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.270
corner and we're drawing a line to where our mouse has moved to.

99
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.870
So obviously we need to think very carefully about what the starting values for these two variables

100
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:14.890
should be and the place that we would ideally set this in order to avoid the strange behavior is when

101
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:21.660
we first press our mouse down it's here that we actually want to execute this line of code.

102
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.520
And this line of code.

103
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.640
So the current X and the current Y should be set to the coordinates of where we've actually clicked

104
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.270
with our mouse.

105
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:38.200
Let me save our changes head back into chrome refresh and just check whether this hypothesis is true.

106
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:43.890
So I'm going to click again somewhere on my canvas and the behavior is now what you would expect it

107
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:44.660
to be.

108
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.280
And that completes the first challenge.

109
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:53.880
So well done if you were able to solve it without the hints but no worries if you needed a couple of

110
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.050
hints to help you along the way.

111
00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:03.180
JavaScript is something that's new after all but I think this is a good point to actually try and solve

112
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:09.800
another challenge namely how do we stop the mouse drawing when it leaves the canvas.

113
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.820
Here's what I mean at the moment.

114
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:18.600
If I click down and I move my mouse off the canvas and I come back then I'm still drawing.

115
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:21.080
As long as I'm still dragging my mouse.

116
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:27.040
Right now the behavior that I'm challenging you to implement would be something more like this.

117
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:31.870
You click down and if you don't release it stops drawing.

118
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:37.540
So as soon as you move off the canvas I'd like the drawing behavior to stop.

119
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.880
I'll give you a few seconds to pause the video and try and implement this for yourself

120
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:44.950
ready.

121
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.860
Here's the solution.

122
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:53.580
So if we look at the MDA documentation we see there is one event here called Mouse leave and the description

123
00:08:53.580 --> 00:09:00.060
is a pointing device is moved off the element that has the listener attached.

124
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.440
So what does this mean.

125
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.220
Well let's take a look at the documentation for attaching a listener.

126
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.230
So this is the page on adding an event listener from MGM.

127
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.550
And what we see here is that the syntax looks something like this.

128
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:20.570
We have a target and then we have a dot and then we have add event listener.

129
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.740
So what's the target that we've been using so far.

130
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:30.000
If we look at this code we can see that our target was the entire Web site it was the entire document.

131
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:38.010
But if we want to get the behavior that monitors whether we leave the canvas what do you think the target

132
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.330
should be.

133
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.270
Well it should be the canvas right.

134
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.650
So let's implement this.

135
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.300
I'm going to come down here and I'm going to copy this bit of code here.

136
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.080
And I'm just going to paste it below.

137
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:53.130
I want to change it from document to canvas.

138
00:09:53.130 --> 00:10:01.350
And I'm also going to change the mouse event from mouse up to mouse leave and delete this console log

139
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.210
statement here.

140
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.340
But I'm going to leave this line.

141
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:10.260
I'm going to leave his painting is equal to False because what this will do is we'll make sure that

142
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.820
we can no longer draw.

143
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.670
Once we have left the canvas with our pointer.

144
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.330
So let's see if this indeed works.

145
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.670
I'm going to save my changes.

146
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:28.240
Come back here and refresh my site once again and when I click and drag and a move off the canvas and

147
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.120
I come back and voila no more painting.

148
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:39.440
So this indeed works the reason I wanted to show you this is because you can actually attach an event

149
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.650
listener to any number of targets.

150
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:43.530
It could be the document as a whole.

151
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.520
It could be the canvas or it could be our button.

152
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:48.400
Right.

153
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:54.860
In fact let's go ahead and attach an event listener to our button and we actually gonna do this in the

154
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.840
index thought each time El file.

155
00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:03.170
So down here where I've got my script I'm going to add a listener to our button.

156
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.880
So first I'm gonna have to get hold of my button.

157
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:10.040
It's gonna be document and then get element by I.D..

158
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.240
And what's the idea of the button.

159
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.760
Well I'm gonna go up here and just check what it is.

160
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:20.540
So I've got my button here and it has the I.D. check answer.

161
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:27.380
So that's the idea I'm going to supply its check answer and everything's case sensitive.

162
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.220
And it has to be spelled exactly the same of course.

163
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:36.320
And once I've got my button here I can then add an event listener.

164
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.620
So what event am I going to listen for.

165
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:47.150
On my button I'm going to listen for so-called click events and what do I want to happen once I click

166
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.670
on the button.

167
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:54.950
So what I'm thinking is we should follow through to the last step of working with the canvas namely

168
00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.550
clearing it resetting it for the next number that we're going to draw.

169
00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:02.860
So when I had my callback function here that's going to be a function.

170
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.530
And it's not going to have a name.

171
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:12.890
And it's also not going to have any parameters but what it will do is it will clear the canvas.

172
00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.070
So how we're gonna do that.

173
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.110
So how we're gonna do that.

174
00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:22.930
Well let's call a function called Clear canvas and the semicolon at the end.

175
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.990
Now clear canvas actually doesn't exist yet.

176
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:33.710
I've added it here but we still have to create it and I'm going to create clear canvas inside the drawing

177
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:34.070
Dot.

178
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:35.410
J ust file.

179
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:41.170
Let me scroll up and just click the minus sign here to collapse prepare canvas.

180
00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:48.530
And when I want to do is blow the closing curly brace of prepared canvas I'm going to add this function

181
00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:55.250
clear canvas so function keyword and then a clear canvas and the name of the function here.

182
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:59.190
And the spelling has to match what I'm using here.

183
00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:03.470
So clear canvas has to be spelled exactly the same as this one right write.

184
00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:10.170
And it's gonna be the job of this function to reset everything we have on the drawing front.

185
00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.150
So what does that involve.

186
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.210
Well we're gonna have to reset two things.

187
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:21.230
We're gonna have to make the canvas black again but we should also reset the coordinates that we've

188
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:22.070
been tracking.

189
00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.120
So the current x.

190
00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.010
The current Y and so on.

191
00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:29.610
So when I take these guys up here and copy them paste them below.

192
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:35.220
And then what I'll do is I'm going to delete the keyword here because we're reusing them we're not going

193
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.040
to create them.

194
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.600
And I want to format my code so that it's indented properly.

195
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:47.720
And now what I've got is I've got four lines of code that are resetting these variables to their starting

196
00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.230
values namely zero.

197
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:57.070
So that's step one step two is going to be making this canvas all black.

198
00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.870
How do we do that in prepare candidates.

199
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.570
How do we make it all black.

200
00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.220
We used this line of code right here.

201
00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:03.690
Right.

202
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:10.880
Context thought Phil rect and then we provided the width and the height of the canvas to fill the entire

203
00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.530
canvas with it's background color.

204
00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.990
So let's try and copy this line here.

205
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.460
Paste it inside clear canvas.

206
00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:29.910
So right here and then we can try and save our changes and see if this will work on our site.

207
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:37.640
So when I refresh and then when I click here draw something and then I'm gonna press the mouse button

208
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.590
what's going on.

209
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:41.160
Let's check.

210
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:41.910
OK.

211
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:48.260
So I've saved my changes in this file but I haven't saved my changes in the index that each terminal.

212
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.670
You still see that circle over here.

213
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.440
So I'm actually not getting any code being executed when I press the button.

214
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.340
So my save the changes here and then I'm going to try again.

215
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.170
I'm going to come back.

216
00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:07.450
I'm going to refresh and I'm going to click here draw something and then press the button.

217
00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.460
And what happens at this point we get an error.

218
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:19.710
It says on caught reference error context is not defined at Clear canvas on line number 17.

219
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:25.160
So in this code if we look down here we go to the drawing not just file.

220
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.660
We look at line number 70 and it's complaining about this line.

221
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.950
It's saying that the context is not defined.

222
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.220
So this thing isn't defined as no context is.

223
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.250
So why not.

224
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.040
We've created a context right.

225
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.260
It's right here.

226
00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:41.530
So what's going on.

227
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:47.700
Why is it that it has a problem with context but it doesn't have a problem with the current Y or the

228
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:48.820
current X..

229
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.260
Why are these fine.

230
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:56.890
And this is not well let's collapse this function and let's collapse this function.

231
00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:03.990
So what we see at this point is that we've got current X and current Y being defined outside of prepared

232
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:05.100
canvas.

233
00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:11.220
So that means that we can access them inside clear canvas on the other hand.

234
00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:16.830
The context was declared inside prepare a canvas with this constant keyword.

235
00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:25.740
And what this means is that we can only access the context inside of prepare canvas in programming.

236
00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:30.250
This has to do with something called scope but what does that mean.

237
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:38.900
Well the scope for these variables here is the entire file the entire drawing not just file.

238
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:48.710
We can use them anywhere inside but the scope for the context is only this prepare a canvas function.

239
00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:53.490
In other words const context is a local variable.

240
00:16:53.490 --> 00:17:02.400
It's local to prepare a canvas and var current ex up here is a global variable.

241
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:07.110
It is accessible in the entire file.

242
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:13.570
So what if we actually want to use the context and the canvas inside clear canvas.

243
00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:17.310
Well we can try and promote these two guys.

244
00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:23.940
We can make canvas in context global just like the current ex and the current Y.

245
00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.720
So how would we do that.

246
00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:33.010
Well we can create a canvas here and we can create a context here.

247
00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:34.820
So I've created two variables.

248
00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:40.860
They're global because they're outside of prepare canvas on the same hierarchy as my other variables

249
00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:41.190
appear.

250
00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:45.560
And what I want to do is inside prepare canvas.

251
00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:49.280
I'm going to delete my keyword cons too.

252
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:56.790
And what this does is it will take the existing canvas that I've got him and it's at this point where

253
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.490
it gets a value.

254
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:04.500
So initially the canvas is empty and then we're storing the canvas that we're getting from the document

255
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:11.880
inside this variable on line 15 and just below the context which previously didn't have a value gets

256
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.140
his value from the canvas with get context.

257
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:22.470
So let's save these changes and head into chrome and refresh and let's see if we get the same error

258
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.840
again.

259
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:29.650
So I want to draw something here and then press the button and behold there is no error.

260
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:36.480
And also we're successfully filling the canvas with the background color so we're erasing all that was

261
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.600
drawn on the canvas successfully.

262
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.610
Brilliant.

263
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.480
So we're almost done.

264
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:47.830
But there's one thing we haven't thought about yet namely does everybody use a mouse when they're gonna

265
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.370
interact with this Web site.

266
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.680
Well not really right.

267
00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.110
If you have a phone or tablet you'd use your finger instead.

268
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.820
You wouldn't be using a mouse.

269
00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:03.340
So let's check how our Web site behaves on a phone or a tablet.

270
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.980
The Chrome developer tools can actually help us with this.

271
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.710
So do you see the symbol up here.

272
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:14.890
It says toggle device toolbar and if you click on it you get to choose a device to simulate.

273
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:21.780
So at the moment you can see that I've got responsive selected here but here I have a whole choice of

274
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.830
tablets and phones I can use instead.

275
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.640
So let's leave it on responsive for the time being.

276
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:35.720
And then if we look over here we see this menu says mobile mobile no touch desktop and desktop touch.

277
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:41.760
If you don't see this menu by the way if you're looks like this then simply go here and say ad device

278
00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:44.220
type then it will appear.

279
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.760
So many select desktop.

280
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.380
And this is the desktop version of our website.

281
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:54.620
And if I click and draw I have everything working as it should.

282
00:19:54.930 --> 00:20:01.340
But if I select mobile and I try to draw on my canvas.

283
00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.190
Nothing happens.

284
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.400
But if I press mobile and say no touch.

285
00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:12.080
So in this case it seems to be working but mobile touch doesn't work.

286
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.760
So why is that.

287
00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:20.790
Why does my canvas not like it when I'm using it on an iPad or on a phone.

288
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:25.260
The reason is is that if I use it on an iPad I'm not using a mouse.

289
00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:31.600
I'm using my fingers and and that means we're not getting a mouse event.

290
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.670
We're getting a touch event.

291
00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.950
The browser will actually make this distinction.

292
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:39.430
It'll distinguish between mouse events and touch events.

293
00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.880
But we should really make our website work on a tablet as well right.

294
00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:48.720
We might want to pull us up on an iPod one day and be able to draw something on this canvas.

295
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.300
So how can we do that.

296
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:54.230
Well let's check what kind of touch events there are.

297
00:20:54.250 --> 00:21:01.480
So if I go to the MDMA documentation again and a search for touch then I can see that there are in fact

298
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:09.750
four different kinds of touch events there's touch cancel touch and touch move and touch start.

299
00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:14.580
At this point I'd like to pose a challenge to you again.

300
00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:21.670
Can you use these touch events here to make our website work for the iPod.

301
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:26.240
Can you make it behave as it should on an iPod using these touch events.

302
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.980
That way everyone can use their fingers to draw into the canvas.

303
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.970
Now the code is going to be very very similar to how you were working with the mouse events before but

304
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:40.960
there's only going to be one small twist in order to get this working.

305
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:47.800
Have a google and check stack overflow for the difference in syntax on how to get the touch coordinates

306
00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.170
versus the mouse coordinates.

307
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.570
I'll show you the solution in a few seconds.

308
00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:56.700
All right.

309
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:59.320
So here's the solution.

310
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:07.150
I'm gonna come down into yes code on the drawing dot j ust file and I'm going to copy this bit of code

311
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:14.240
here where I'm checking for mouse down and then I'm going to paste it below.

312
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:21.920
I'm going to add a little comment here with two forward slashes that says touch events and instead of

313
00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:29.330
checking the document I want to check the canvas and instead of checking for mouse down I'm going to

314
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:38.880
check for touch start and what I'll do is I'm going to log touchdown instead of mouse press.

315
00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:45.290
Now if you did a little bit of research on how to get the coordinates for the finger touching the canvas

316
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:50.560
you would realize that this isn't going to work.

317
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:54.060
Instead you have to use a slightly different syntax.

318
00:22:54.110 --> 00:23:01.940
You have to go and get the coordinates via something called a touch scrolling down on the site.

319
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.090
I can see that in order to get the coordinates from a touch you have the event and then you have top

320
00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:14.880
touches and that the square brackets zero and then dot client x.

321
00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:16.340
So why is that.

322
00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:21.080
Why is the syntax different for the mouse events and the touch events.

323
00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.650
Well with a mouse you've only got one mouse right.

324
00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:26.620
So there's only one set of coordinates.

325
00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:29.350
But with a touch there's multi touch right.

326
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:33.640
You can touch the screen with one or two or three or four fingers.

327
00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:40.190
So that means that the touch events actually store the coordinates for the different fingers in something

328
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:41.060
called an array.

329
00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:45.410
So you get a whole list of coordinates to choose from depending whether it was the first touch or the

330
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:51.860
second touch of the third touch and the first touch you would always get with the first item in this

331
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:52.270
list.

332
00:23:52.610 --> 00:24:00.260
So if I just take what it said in the documentation and I write event dot touches square brackets zero

333
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:06.740
and I get the coordinates for the first touch which is all I care about everybody is gonna draw with

334
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:15.020
one finger not two or so I'm led to believe and I want to find my current y here as well then I can

335
00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:23.690
try this out on the iPod going to save the changes and I'm going to head back here when I refresh and

336
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.520
then I want to click and drag.

337
00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:31.460
So what am I seeing well I'm seeing this I'm seeing touchdown.

338
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:37.260
So this means that touch start is working but of course not painting it.

339
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:43.700
And the reason we're not painting it is because we have to implement the other touch events namely touch

340
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:48.380
move touch and and touch cancel so let's do that.

341
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:53.080
Let's take mouse leave and it's pasted below.

342
00:24:53.090 --> 00:25:01.710
And instead of mouse leave Let's go for touch end and let's add the touch cancel as well.

343
00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.800
So that leaves touch move.

344
00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:11.150
Well let's come up here where we've got our mouse move because the logic is going to be very very similar.

345
00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.850
And I'm going to added below I'm going to add at the bottom.

346
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.470
Once again I want changes to canvas so we're only listening for.

347
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:26.040
Touch move events on the canvas and then it would have to change this to touch move as per the documentation.

348
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:31.460
And of course in order to get the coordinates I'm going to have to make sure I get the coordinates for

349
00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.660
that first finger touching down.

350
00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:39.860
So for my current ex I'm gonna paste that here and from my current why when a pace that here.

351
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:47.620
So now it can save the changes head back into my browser refresh and try.

352
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:49.070
And it works.

353
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.910
Brilliant.

354
00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:55.040
So this is the behavior that we're looking for after the challenge.

355
00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.210
Fantastic.

356
00:25:56.210 --> 00:26:02.900
So now our Web site will work on both mobile and on desktop.

357
00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:09.510
You can either draw on this canvas using a mouse or you can draw on this whole thing with your finger.

358
00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:15.680
Let's have a look at our drawing logic one final time what we notice at this point is that we've got

359
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.130
the same code pasted in two different places.

360
00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:24.950
We've got these five lines of code here and we've got the same five lines of code right here.

361
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:31.100
Let me show you how to reorganize your code and simplify this whole thing a little bit.

362
00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:36.990
Using this code it has some really great tools that will make this really really easy.

363
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:43.400
Instead of having the same code in two different places let's refactor our code so that we have a separate

364
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:50.930
function that's called draw and we can call that function on both the touch move and the mouse move

365
00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:51.920
the way to do this.

366
00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:58.520
The easiest way is to right click and go to refactor and then you're going to select extract to function

367
00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:00.530
in global scope.

368
00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.630
There's that scope word that we learned about earlier.

369
00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.670
It's been selected.

370
00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:10.710
And when I call my function draw and hit enter.

371
00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:17.000
So now I've got a function call here that says draw and if I scroll down then I see this draw function

372
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.870
right here at the same hierarchy as clear canvas.

373
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:25.550
It's a clear canvas has global scope and draw has global scope.

374
00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:34.490
And what this means is that I can come to my touch move and I can replace these five lines with a call

375
00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:36.560
to my draw function.

376
00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:42.590
So I think this is quite nice and makes our code quite readable if this painting set your coordinates

377
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:48.890
and then draw scrolling to the top and collapsing of three functions you can see the structure of the

378
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:51.280
entire file very very clearly.

379
00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:57.200
We've got our constants appear where we're sitting a few values on how to color our canvas and how thick

380
00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.540
the lines should be.

381
00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:04.400
Then we have some global variables and then we have three functions prepare canvas where we're setting

382
00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.220
the listeners and formatting the styling.

383
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:13.460
We have the draw function which draws our lines and we have the clear canvas function which resets everything

384
00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:16.350
so that we can draw something on a blank canvas.

385
00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:20.740
So that's it for the drawing logic of the Web site.

386
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:24.020
Hope you enjoyed the challenges and I'll see you in the next lesson.
