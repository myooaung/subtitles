1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
Ok so, in this follow-up tutorial

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,404
We are gonna be doing this same thing as we did before

3
00:00:07,454 --> 00:00:10,451
However, we are going to do it in a windows machine

4
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:16,937
And be honest with you, most likely you will be doing this in a windows machine

5
00:00:16,987 --> 00:00:19,361
As a post Linux machine is primarily

6
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:24,599
Because when Linux users forget their passwords

7
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:25,649
That is quite ware

8
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:32,577
Primarily because they have to type it in over and over and over again to utilize to use varies things

9
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:38,461
Where is on windows it's not default feature it can be setup that way

10
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:43,867
But it is not by default, that you need to type in your administrator password for things

11
00:00:43,917 --> 00:00:47,063
Rather instead, you can just click yes and go through it

12
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,755
Which is a bit stupid in my opinion

13
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:52,050
And opinion for a lot of people out there

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:58,998
But as well there is definitely a feature where you can enable but i really think that it should enabled by default

15
00:00:59,048 --> 00:01:07,834
Anyway, what i seen people do lately, is ... not lately but they have doing this for a while

16
00:01:07,884 --> 00:01:14,862
They take passwords they take hash passwords of windows and then they crack them else where

17
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:20,715
Once they crack them, they billing on what sort of protocol they have setup on that machine

18
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:24,092
They able to gain remote access or something of a kind

19
00:01:24,142 --> 00:01:28,344
For example, in class rooms, in internet cafes

20
00:01:28,394 --> 00:01:34,259
You can really access that machine from outside world

21
00:01:34,309 --> 00:01:40,201
It’s cool facility or corporate building or something of a kind

22
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:45,870
If you have a password for that machine, if you have the authentication credentials

23
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,584
If you manage to get in the same lan , you can actually connect with that machine

24
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:55,644
Specially you have a lot of shared folders, disks, and so on and so forth

25
00:01:55,694 --> 00:01:58,379
That can be very problematic

26
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:06,439
The biggest danger of that happening is , well probably you have heard about support guys

27
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:10,576
People misrepresenting  themselves, that static support

28
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:14,462
but really the biggest danger are they employees them selves

29
00:02:14,512 --> 00:02:19,154
and sometimes responsible behavior and sometimes deliberate actions

30
00:02:19,204 --> 00:02:26,143
primarily , as i said in internet cafes , schools and in corporate buildings

31
00:02:26,193 --> 00:02:33,440
it can be pretty bad because i have seen people utilize like 100 or 200 schools computers

32
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,944
and they become their broad spaces basically they control them

33
00:02:36,994 --> 00:02:38,718
for a central point

34
00:02:38,768 --> 00:02:42,119
or as they have these days , they have decentralize broads

35
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:46,359
and then those computers stand to do all those things for them

36
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:54,070
which is really bad for that university because all traces all clues will end up to [unheard] to wards

37
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,478
them for whatever activity that person has conducted

38
00:02:57,528 --> 00:03:13,153
and that is why that sort of attack is useful will be able to recreate steps of such people

39
00:03:13,203 --> 00:03:17,669
and steal the hashes and then they are very sub reaction for those hashes

40
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:20,711
what you can do , where you can apply them , how you can utilize them

41
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:30,839
i mean it's  , i can't even possible count them all here , but it's really doesn't matter

42
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:35,263
i just want to give you brief intro  of what people actually use these hashes for

43
00:03:35,313 --> 00:03:37,905
on windows machines

44
00:03:37,955 --> 00:03:43,397
and they are also crackable primarily because people for windows they don't put any sort of complex passwords

45
00:03:43,447 --> 00:03:47,051
most of the time , so they are crackable more than less

46
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,721
anyway , but that further with you , let's just go ahead and jump in to it

47
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:54,843
open up your browser , i have internet explorer here

48
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:57,288
i have been trying it out lately and

49
00:03:57,338 --> 00:04:02,445
they have remold it quite well but i still don't like its security wise

50
00:04:02,495 --> 00:04:12,556
anyway , this is my virtual machine , i don't really have a lot of stuff installed here so i just use the default internet explorer and that’s it

51
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:19,235
anyway , you need to go to this website www.openworld.com

52
00:04:19,285 --> 00:04:25,023
and you can navigate to this link , if you wish , if not , you can immediately type in this link

53
00:04:25,073 --> 00:04:30,749
where you can actually navigate to it in the website , it is pretty simple , they are in tiny problems

54
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:38,660
anyway, you need to scroll down and what you need if you're

55
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,823
ops , where is it, where is it, where is it , come on there we go

56
00:04:42,873 --> 00:04:48,553
so that's , PwDump 7 , and i want you to download that one

57
00:04:48,603 --> 00:04:54,237
there is 6 there is 5 and so on and so forth , but you see 6 is Windows 2000

58
00:04:54,287 --> 00:05:06,412
XP/2003/Vista, and nothing further , Pwdump5 is NT/2000/XP/2003 nothing further

59
00:05:06,462 --> 00:05:11,242
that's why you don't need Pwdump7

60
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:20,025
there's a question mark after vista , pretty sure that's like for everything that came afterwards as well

61
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:30,596
and Quarks PwDumps something’s , i don't know what is this [unheard]

62
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:34,964
ok i guess you can download the bottom one's as well , but it doesn't really matter

63
00:05:35,014 --> 00:05:40,154
i realize that PwDumps7 actually does work without any sort of problem  , so what's ever

64
00:05:40,204 --> 00:05:45,194
On windows 8.1 Ultimate with all upgrades done

65
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:54,127
that maybe not all of them but i think i didn't make my upgrades for this week or this half of the month or something like that

66
00:05:57,968 --> 00:05:57,968
anyway, it does work with windows 8.1 , you don't have to worry about that

67
00:05:58,018 --> 00:06:03,901
you just go ahead and click on ( Download local copy of pwdump7 )

68
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:06,726
save as

69
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:13,954
it's going to go ahead and save it into your downloads folder , go ahead and click on save

70
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:18,323
i already have it , " Do you want to replace it " , Sure why not

71
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:24,682
running security scan , i wonder what sort of security scan is internet explorer doing

72
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:30,202
has completed , Excellent , so i need a

73
00:06:30,252 --> 00:06:34,075
this is a zip file so i need a definitely something to open it

74
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:46,948
i would recommend using 7zip , but 99.99% sure all of you out there have some sort of zipping and unzipping software for

75
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:55,510
whether it's a , whether it's , property  one or free version like mine which is 7zip

76
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,556
i am pretty sure that you all have it out there , that's why i am not going to include it in that tutorial

77
00:07:00,606 --> 00:07:02,771
primarily , because pretty much already has it

78
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:09,060
is somebody needs , is somebody needs instructions on how to download and install 7zip or unzipping files

79
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,948
just leave it in the discussion i will be more than happy to help you out there

80
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:17,116
anyway navigate over to your downloads folder

81
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:22,529
no not here , ah yea right

82
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:28,635
Users/Creator/Downloads

83
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:33,931
so got a lot of things here , actually i don't need to be here , i need to open 7zip

84
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:34,981
sorry about that

85
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:39,381
let me just go ahead and find it , 7-zip

86
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:43,212
File Manager , Excellent

87
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:49,755
So i open it by 7-zip and you need to find pwdump7

88
00:07:49,805 --> 00:07:53,974
and then you need to download John the Ripper as well

89
00:07:54,024 --> 00:08:03,050
just download John The Ripper 1.7.9 (Windows binaries ZIP ) and download the latest official free versions

90
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:08,310
but go further down below where it says ( Download the latest community-enhanced version)

91
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,086
and then download the latest one here

92
00:08:11,136 --> 00:08:18,034
after that is down , go back to your , just click just click on that link and it will download

93
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:21,945
go back to you extraction software using 7-zip

94
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:26,692
find the file here , where ever it maybe

95
00:08:26,742 --> 00:08:35,418
so it's pwdump7zip and i need one more , i need john179j5w.zip

96
00:08:35,468 --> 00:08:36,468
Excellent

97
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:44,503
click on extract and i don't need this folder , i am gonna go ahead and open my command line

98
00:08:44,553 --> 00:08:51,629
and i have taken the liberty of actually reconfiguring the command line for windows a bit for mine

99
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,966
all need some purposes , i can like it this way , so just go ahead and , ops

100
00:08:56,016 --> 00:09:03,366
navigate back to your root directory , the root directory here is actually C , just a drive

101
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:10,484
unlike Linux you will notice that the command is so slightly different and i have no idea

102
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:13,977
why that Microsoft actually use backslash instead of slash

103
00:09:14,027 --> 00:09:16,079
that's so weird

104
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:20,248
i wish they would change that and make my life so much easier

105
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:26,998
anyway , what i wanted to do here is do "dir" for directory listing

106
00:09:27,048 --> 00:09:29,002
you can actually use this command in Linux as well

107
00:09:29,052 --> 00:09:31,144
dir and it will list them

108
00:09:31,194 --> 00:09:35,690
so i have created a file here ,  i think it called pass

109
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:49,258
so , just type in "mkdir" like in Linux , space , pass , i am gonna name mine pass , you can name this folder whatever you want

110
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:54,915
this folder name can be anything , you can just smash the keyboard , here we go

111
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:57,845
and once you have the name of the folder , just press enter

112
00:09:57,895 --> 00:10:02,922
[unheard] for me it says "are you save directory file pass  already exists"

113
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:06,868
Primarily because it does already exists, you can actually see it here

114
00:10:06,918 --> 00:10:11,132
but doesn't matter for you , i will created it

115
00:10:11,182 --> 00:10:16,622
and one more thing is necessary i need to close this terminal , i completely forgot about this

116
00:10:16,672 --> 00:10:21,587
you need to actually run " as administrator " on the terminal

117
00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:28,559
you will need it for the creation of the folder but you do need it for [unheard] about to do

118
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:39,139
anyway , we are now , the extraction select pass , it will be ... local drive C

119
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:44,677
the folder that you have created mine is "pass" just click Ok , that will extracted there

120
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:52,042
that will extract both of the files there , you can see that i have already have them extracted , both are already there

121
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:56,814
anyway, i am just gonna ahead cancel this , close this , doesn't matter

122
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:04,350
if you encounter any problems with file extraction or if you need help in installing 7-zip for file extraction

123
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:11,100
you can use any other software that can unzip file weather if property or free or open source

124
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:16,926
well maybe  it can be property or open source in any case , if it property or for free

125
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:22,449
doesn't really matter , as long as it can do the job feel free to do it without software

126
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:28,992
if you , again if you failed to do this , just post in discussion section and i will be more than happy to tell you how to unzip it

127
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:35,873
anyway let's just go back here, one more, one more , Excellent

128
00:11:35,923 --> 00:11:42,184
so we will back and see , let's change directory to what we created folder

129
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:47,089
dir for listing , i am gonna have one extra folder here , it's pwdump3v2

130
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:52,911
i have just forgot that , there's previous attepmts to see and test out versions , will they work or not

131
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:56,686
so they don't pwdump7 works

132
00:11:56,736 --> 00:12:05,711
anyway what we are about to do , is actually dump the password files , so go ahead and type in

133
00:12:05,761 --> 00:12:14,968
go ahead and enter pwdump, nope pwdump7

134
00:12:15,018 --> 00:12:25,357
Excellent , so dir , just a few files here there's an exe file you need , the exe file so type in

135
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:29,648
Pw , pretty show the windows is case insensitive , unlike Linux

136
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:32,737
but i am just gonna be , just gonna play it safe here

137
00:12:32,787 --> 00:12:40,337
and i wish to create a file , same with Linux , i am gonna name it test.txt

138
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:47,112
Press Enter, opss , what is it ? it is ...

139
00:12:47,162 --> 00:12:51,432
Dump is some passwords , have you done that

140
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:54,304
dir

141
00:12:54,354 --> 00:13:01,586
now you haven't .. why not ? why ? what is the matter ?

142
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:05,468
ahh , ok , so

143
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:15,590
no , it's not the case for this dump system passwords

144
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,208
why ? why not ?

145
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:25,739
come on , come on , don't do this to me

146
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:29,161
it's dump system passwords

147
00:13:29,211 --> 00:13:39,464
Excellent , so like this , oh i see what the problem was

148
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:44,914
of course , of course , i need to redirect the standard output

149
00:13:44,964 --> 00:13:47,337
into a file

150
00:13:47,387 --> 00:13:52,867
so you see a better of very stupid mistake in my part there , take away sometimes

151
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:55,373
but doesn't matter , i decided not get it out

152
00:13:55,423 --> 00:14:01,731
just showing this things can happen , and i do have a time for not cut out my mistake from this tutorial

153
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:07,646
just so  you can learn from them , all there is much you can learn from this other things to see that i am

154
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:09,760
that i can be rather stupid from time to time

155
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,315
anyway you don't need to upgrade to their sign in between this commands

156
00:14:13,365 --> 00:14:24,650
because you want dump the output of pwdump7.exe into test.txt not to exe

157
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,920
if you don't do that , it's just gonna print out these things , out to this screen

158
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,005
and you can't really utilize them , you just printing out there standard output

159
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:36,484
unless you have replace it in file or something of a kind

160
00:14:36,534 --> 00:14:37,626
it's completely useless to you

161
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:43,190
So Press Enter , this is happened , dir , do i have text out exe

162
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:58,460
no, fantastic , i have a text.txt and if i type in "notepad text.txt"

163
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:04,460
Press Enter, there we go , we have pretty much the same information that we have printed out

164
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,856
on the standard output

165
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,946
anyway, when not really interesting in looking on that file

166
00:15:10,996 --> 00:15:16,824
to closely , but one good thing is , you can actually get the usernames which is fantastic

167
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:23,671
so all the usernames are here and you can use them as you choose and please all you need is passwords

168
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:28,529
but when you once have the usernames you can even preform some sort of brut force attack

169
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:32,861
on FTP or mail server or whatever

170
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:36,554
i showed you how to do that with hydra on webserver

171
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:42,435
the procedure is a pretty much too same for any other service , you just type in the parameters

172
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:45,242
just change the parameters a little bit , and that's it

173
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:50,915
probably most complex attack is on webs , web log , and service

174
00:15:50,965 --> 00:15:54,190
on websites that we have log in service on them

175
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,286
everything else like attacking on FTP or [unheard] or something like that

176
00:15:58,336 --> 00:16:05,510
is peace of cakes setup with hydra , but depending on the password string can take a while

177
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,829
anyway, just go ahead and close this file

178
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:18,326
now i need to go back , and go into , actually no i am gonna do this with anther way around

179
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:28,607
pwdump7 , there and now i am gonna need to type in

180
00:16:28,657 --> 00:16:34,242
back, i am gonna go back once , that's going to send me into pass

181
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:46,072
and then i am gonna need to go into , john and john again and dot , i need , run , sorry

182
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:54,126
oh come on , where is it

183
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:57,550
i am just missed it , john.exe

184
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,930
and to this i am gonna to pass the file test.txt

185
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:12,016
Excellent, so we have loaded to password hashes with no different souls

186
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:18,932
administrator , creator , ahh ok so i need to actually expand this

187
00:17:30,346 --> 00:17:37,347
ok so that's doesn't really matter , you can see everything that you  need to see here , see a less

188
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:48,403
and , show souls port, where is it ? come on help me out here ..

189
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:53,762
show , ok , show eq... , aha ok so i see i see i see

190
00:17:53,812 --> 00:18:02,392
ok course, i need "test.txt" i need --show space

191
00:18:02,442 --> 00:18:10,334
i need to give it the file from which to read of course, i can't just expected figured it out

192
00:18:10,384 --> 00:18:14,823
that is a bit stupid again from my part, and my part , but press Enter, and there you go

193
00:18:14,873 --> 00:18:22,729
now by default i can selecting this here whichs very annoying , i need to go into edit and click on mark

194
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:26,277
and i can select things , amazing system

195
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:30,679
anyway, it says "Administrator : NO PASSWORD"

196
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:36,995
"Creator : Test" so i have a password for my user "creator"

197
00:18:37,045 --> 00:18:44,137
its "test" , i have found it , and now i can use it for whole sources of generally wrong things

198
00:18:44,187 --> 00:18:48,941
what you can use them for and how you to actually compromise

199
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:54,626
how to attempt to compromise systems , and what you can actually do

200
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,158
how you can explore them , should i say

201
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:02,578
we will explore a bond that further in the chapter on matesployed

202
00:19:02,628 --> 00:19:08,892
and reverse shells, but on time being , i am just want to show you how you can acquire this passwords

203
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:10,487
how you can crack them

204
00:19:10,537 --> 00:19:14,049
and later on , we will actually utilize them

205
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:18,393
but this is very useful skill to have to figure out how to get these passwords

206
00:19:18,443 --> 00:19:25,503
anyway , i bid you all farewell , and i hope to see you in the next tutorial
