00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,530
Hello everybody, and
welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:10,020
Today, I will open up a chapter
on attacking your home routers,

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,730
and not only home routers but
routers in general.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,990
Why is this important?

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:20,060
Well, routers are the first line of
defense for any major network out there.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,420
And if you can break into them,

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,420
you can generally do pretty much
whatever you want on the network.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,760
You can actually exclude people from
the firewall rules on the network and

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,260
access them directly as well.

10
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,140
That can be a painful experience for
anyone on the other side.

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,798
It can also change the DNS settings.

12
00:00:38,798 --> 00:00:45,300
You can set up proxies or something
of a kind, redirection of traffic.

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,300
You can serve them whatever
information you want because, for

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,360
all intents and purposes,
you are able to decide on what is what.

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,120
So when a router requests a URL,
you can tell it it's on this IP address.

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,400
Or it's on that IP address.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,310
Or you need to go here.

18
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,950
Or you need to log in here before
you can go there, or whatever.

19
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,400
It provides for all sorts of shenanigans.

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,778
Now, before we begin, I would like you all
to go ahead and open up your web browser.

21
00:01:13,778 --> 00:01:18,498
You will need two websites,
nmap.org and Exploit Database.

22
00:01:18,498 --> 00:01:22,243
I have opened up both of
these websites before, but

23
00:01:22,243 --> 00:01:25,039
we haven't actually went over them.

24
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:28,067
We haven't actually used
much from these websites,

25
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:31,037
from all the vast resources
that they have to offer.

26
00:01:31,037 --> 00:01:37,473
And if you wish to follow this tutorial
through and do the things that I am doing,

27
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:41,618
you will need to modify
your commands to an extent.

28
00:01:41,618 --> 00:01:45,981
And you will need to just pay attention at
what you are using, primarily because I

29
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:49,830
have a router that is set up in my home
for the purposes of this tutorial,

30
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,998
that I have configured for
the purposes of this tutorial.

31
00:01:52,998 --> 00:01:57,430
But your home routers
are likely to be different, and

32
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:02,353
provided, of course,
that you own your own home router and

33
00:02:02,353 --> 00:02:07,098
that you legally can actually
do whatever you want to it.

34
00:02:07,098 --> 00:02:09,098
Because not all telecoms allow that.

35
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:14,682
You can then feel free to play around
with it and see what you can do.

36
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:18,901
You can lock it yourself,
know the password, but

37
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:21,870
then you can try to break into it.

38
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,790
That's one of very good exercises.

39
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,228
Sometimes, you won't be
able to break into it.

40
00:02:28,228 --> 00:02:32,635
There simply won't be any
vulnerabilities out there, and

41
00:02:32,635 --> 00:02:38,560
you won't have a suitable target for
social engineering or anything of a kind.

42
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,170
But, more often than not, what you
are able to do is fool credentials from

43
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,370
the router, without actual authentication.

44
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,340
These are also some of the exploits that
usually are referred to by link traversal.

45
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,600
And by modifying the URL requests of

46
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,060
the web server of the router,
you are able to pool

47
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,360
certain information from it which
ordinarily would not be available.

48
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,130
Now, a key thing to mention here
is that it is a lot easier to

49
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,290
break into the home routers
as opposed to breaking into

50
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,000
the routers of bigger companies whose
networks are protected by such firewalls.

51
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,398
Primarily because those routers, and
the companies, they are maintained.

52
00:03:23,398 --> 00:03:27,140
Somebody takes care of them, somebody
takes care of the updates, and so on and

53
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,660
so forth.

54
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,130
While, on the other hand, home routers, I
mean, how many, be honest with yourselves,

55
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,880
again, and how many of you
actually conduct upgrades or

56
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,160
firmware on your routers?

57
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,460
And usually there's one exploit.

58
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,940
If you don't update it,
it's gonna stick around there for

59
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,460
a long line of years to come.

60
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,950
Also, if you are wondering, why should
you attack home routers as opposed to

61
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:57,930
attacking, for example, companies,
organizations, or something of a kind?

62
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,010
Well, if you are providing a pen testing
service, and if you are attempting

63
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,700
to prove that the network is vulnerable
of a certain company who has hired you,

64
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,190
you might not be able
to attack it directly.

65
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:13,830
But you might be able to attack
the employees' home routers,

66
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,570
where you can actually gather
information on them, and

67
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,990
later on utilize that
information in order to break

68
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:24,310
into the routers on the main network
within the building of the company.

69
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,590
Anyway, as I said,

70
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,820
if you have permission from your home
router, feel free to play around with it.

71
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,310
If not, then don't.

72
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,832
Feel free to buy a router somewhere for

73
00:04:35,832 --> 00:04:40,480
20 bucks, something of a kind, and you
can set up a pretty decent lab at home.

74
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,215
If you want to figure out what your
home router's IP is, as before,

75
00:04:45,215 --> 00:04:46,640
just type in route.

76
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,668
And after route, nothing really,
just press Enter.

77
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:51,428
You will get default Gateway.

78
00:04:51,428 --> 00:04:54,643
It's 192.168.1.1.

79
00:04:54,643 --> 00:05:00,300
If you go ahead and copy that,
I'm just gonna start nmap scan of it.

80
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,440
Nmap and paste this.

81
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,050
Give me forward boost output.

82
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,470
So while it's doing that,
let's just go over to our browser, and

83
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,170
here I actually already have it up.

84
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,800
Here I've tried it, if I just reload it.

85
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,200
You see, it says here a username and

86
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,070
password are being requested
at this IP address.

87
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,920
The site says, and

88
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,920
whoever made this router is a true genius,
because it immediately gives me the brand.

89
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,340
Not only the brand, but it actually
gives me the model number of the router.

90
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,310
I mean, this is a technique
called banner grabbing.

91
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,740
Or at least it falls into that category,
I would say.

92
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:48,390
I can just see the model number here
in clear text, quite literally.

93
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,140
And of course,

94
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,070
when I know this, I don't need to perform
some complex nmap scans to figure it out.

95
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,236
Rather instead, I can just do this,

96
00:05:56,236 --> 00:06:01,760
> Copy > Cancel, and
go over to the Exploit Database.

97
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,990
Click on Search.

98
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,580
It says here, Free Text Search,
> CTRL+V > Search, and there we go.

99
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,450
It says CSRF Vulnerability.

100
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,830
Let's see what this one has to offer.

101
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,860
It says Introduction, TP-Link,
Description of Vulnerability.

102
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,137
And look at the description,
you can easily change the default user's

103
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:30,360
(admin) password by the default
router page listening on port 80.

104
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,791
In here you the GET will change
the password for you and

105
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:43,370
the POST request method is not needed for
changing the router pass.

106
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,650
Excellent.
So, through a simple GET` request,

107
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,520
you can change the default admins
password, which is a bit ridiculous.

108
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,770
And here is all the,
here is the exploit, and

109
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,480
here is pretty much everything
that you need to do.

110
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,150
That's it.

111
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,860
Nothing, nothing else.

112
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:07,300
Here, it's completely described in how
to implement it, and so on and so forth.

113
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,436
But, keep in mind,
that just because there's only one

114
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:15,925
vulnerability with the exact
specific name of this router,

115
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:22,103
that does not mean that that is the only
vulnerability that applies to that router.

116
00:07:22,103 --> 00:07:23,764
Always and always,
this is a good practice.

117
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:28,945
Open up another window,
type in the model number and

118
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:31,784
type in vulns, there we go.

119
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,843
Press Enter.

120
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:40,372
So okay, I have

121
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:45,248
CSRF Vulnerability

122
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:49,549
listed here, but

123
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:54,147
lets see this one.

124
00:07:54,147 --> 00:07:56,626
What do we got here?

125
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,640
Excellent.

126
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,520
So here is another one.

127
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,233
It says Default Admin Credentials,
web interface default, if you request,

128
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:08,860
there we go.

129
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,530
So this is, again, a modified URL request.

130
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,150
Let me just show you what I mean.

131
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:20,324
I would, of course,
do this in a different manner, but for

132
00:08:20,324 --> 00:08:27,169
the purpose of this tutorial,
I'm just gonna do this manually, /rom-0.

133
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:33,428
Because I'm a genius who typed a dot.

134
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:40,750
Excellent, so it says problem
loading the page, unable to load it.

135
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,820
But, see what I got.

136
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,510
I am able to download the rom-0 file and
save it to my computer.

137
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:53,185
From that point on, I just need a program
which would read through it and interpret

138
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:57,980
it for me to be able to read it and get
the pass and get the credentials from it.

139
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,750
I will demonstrate this in the follow-up
tutorial, but for the time being,

140
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,980
I just wanted to show you how you
can banner grab, and then search.

141
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,840
And the places that you should search.

142
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,760
You see, it's not actually listed here.

143
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,485
It's probably listed under
a different router name.

144
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:17,300
Probably just tp link td,
but it doesn't matter.

145
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,490
So, in the follow-up tutorial, I will show
you how we can break into this router of

146
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:26,307
mine, that I have set up for
this tutorial, by utilizing the rom-0

147
00:09:26,307 --> 00:09:31,820
download runnability, let's call it so,
and actually reading from it.

148
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,110
We're gonna need some tools here in
order to be able to interpret it.

149
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,780
In any case, I bid you farewell, and
I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
