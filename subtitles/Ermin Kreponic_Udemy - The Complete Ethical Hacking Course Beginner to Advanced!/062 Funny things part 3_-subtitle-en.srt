1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,720
Hello everybody and welcome to
this tutorial, this is part three.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,950
Anyway today we're just gonna do
a little bit more configuration.

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,710
So just do commands,
you need to do this one.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,510
So you need to make an adjustment
to your firewall and

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,180
make sure that you have this port here,
and port 80 here.

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,206
You can follow through exactly
the same command as I have,

7
00:00:26,206 --> 00:00:28,632
except you need to change
the interface here.

8
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:33,176
And you can see I've been testing
this on my physical machine so

9
00:00:33,176 --> 00:00:38,592
I've used the wireless interface there,
but here it would be eth, oops.

10
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:40,594
A moment.

11
00:00:40,594 --> 00:00:43,081
Here it would be eth0, and

12
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:49,139
likewise you will adapt it to
whatever you your operating system,

13
00:00:49,139 --> 00:00:54,352
your markation for
that interface that you are using is.

14
00:00:54,352 --> 00:00:57,446
If you are using Kali Linux as I am for
this for

15
00:00:57,446 --> 00:01:02,132
the purposes of this tutorial, and
if you have a default install,

16
00:01:02,132 --> 00:01:07,752
then you can type in exactly the same
command as I have typed in now, with eth0.

17
00:01:07,752 --> 00:01:12,952
Anyway, [SOUND] don't need
to reset the service again.

18
00:01:12,952 --> 00:01:18,674
In addition to that command,
[SOUND] where is it?

19
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:19,594
Here.

20
00:01:19,594 --> 00:01:24,210
Excellent, so
you will need to do this as well.

21
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,520
I know that we've done this
in the previous tutorial but

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,574
I take it that we're
doing it from scratch.

23
00:01:30,574 --> 00:01:35,518
So it's echo 1 and
just put it into ip_forward.

24
00:01:35,518 --> 00:01:37,316
I'm not gonna go too much into this or

25
00:01:37,316 --> 00:01:41,156
how you can check it because I already
explained it in the previous tutorials.

26
00:01:41,156 --> 00:01:46,125
Down below are just some scripts, some of
which we have downloaded from the net and

27
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:49,090
the rest you can download
on your own if you wish.

28
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,300
But in any case,
I want to actually get this started.

29
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:02,162
And before I can do that I just need
to do a budget configuration quickly.

30
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:04,300
Nothing really special about that.

31
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,210
You make this directory.

32
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,180
So, like this.

33
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:12,020
Mkdir /var/www/tmp, press enter.

34
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,720
Okay, cannot create directory
because I have already created it.

35
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,780
And down below is the mod change for
permissions actually.

36
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,878
You are changing permissions for
that directory.

37
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:25,742
So nothing frightening there.

38
00:02:25,742 --> 00:02:28,870
It's just chmod 777 and

39
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,502
make sure that it's /var/www/tmp.

40
00:02:33,502 --> 00:02:35,180
That's it.

41
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,780
The mod was already 777 there,
but whatever.

42
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,400
I'm just gonna do it one more time.

43
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,188
Anyway, go ahead and clear your screen.

44
00:02:43,188 --> 00:02:50,390
Service httpd restart.

45
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,380
Oh, it's not httpd, sorry.

46
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,860
Httpd is for Fedora.

47
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,670
Here, it's apache2,
just the name of the package.

48
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,654
Come on.

49
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:05,390
There we go.

50
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,721
It's gonna, yep.

51
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:08,940
It's going to restart.

52
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,680
Anyway, it's going to bump up a warning.

53
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,300
It says could not reliably determine
the server's fully qualified domain name.

54
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,340
It doesn't matter.

55
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,900
That's just a warning.

56
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,490
You are not required to
actually set that up.

57
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,600
The server will run just fine without it.

58
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,100
Go ahead and clear the screen.

59
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,070
We have a squid that is
running at the moment,

60
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,920
since we have restarted it a moment ago.

61
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,200
Now, we need to conduct an ARP spoof here.

62
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,998
I've been conducting a bit of ARP
spoofing myself prior to this

63
00:03:41,998 --> 00:03:45,902
tutorial just to make sure
that everything works.

64
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:47,742
And I do believe, here we go.

65
00:03:47,742 --> 00:03:51,534
I have it.
So type in arpspoof -i for interface,

66
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:55,670
-t for a victim, and
-r for a default gateway.

67
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:03,630
Then just flip them around, and,
come on, tell me I have them flipped.

68
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,774
I do have them flipped.

69
00:04:04,774 --> 00:04:06,217
Wow, this is amazing.

70
00:04:06,217 --> 00:04:06,811
Excellent.

71
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:10,032
In the previous tutorials I have
explained why this is necessary,

72
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:11,193
why you need to do this.

73
00:04:11,193 --> 00:04:15,460
I know that my victim's IP address is,
the last octet is 101.

74
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,810
If you don't know what
it is just use nmap and

75
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,340
figure out which hosts
are alive on the network.

76
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,180
Go ahead and press enter here,
press enter here.

77
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,030
The ARP spoofing process is alive and
rolling.

78
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,620
Go ahead and click on your Windows 8,
well I'm using Windows 8.1 machine,

79
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:42,020
you could be using something else,
completely irrelevant what we are using.

80
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,490
Plenty of operating systems out there.

81
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,592
Now keynote here.

82
00:04:47,592 --> 00:04:50,547
These scripts are not always gonna work,
and

83
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:53,590
not all of them will work
with the same things.

84
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,930
So just read through the files
when you download them.

85
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,090
Read what they say.

86
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,200
If there are any readme files or
if it doesn't work with something,

87
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,740
just type it out on the forums, type it
out on your favorite search engine and

88
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,630
you will see that people before you
have encountered similar problems.

89
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,934
And they will, you will pretty much
be able to see what is going on.

90
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:25,080
So I do need to show you
something with this terminal here.

91
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,480
I need a large one.

92
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,940
Tell me you're gonna increase.

93
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,400
No, you will not.

94
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,390
Properties.

95
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,950
Oh this is a cursor size, sorry.

96
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:40,190
I need a font, I need a lot larger
font cuz I am apparently blind.

97
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,134
No, larger than this.

98
00:05:45,452 --> 00:05:47,054
Give me this.

99
00:05:47,054 --> 00:05:48,640
Excellent.

100
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,110
So I'm just going to
clear the screen here.

101
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,832
CLS this here.

102
00:05:52,832 --> 00:05:57,072
And this is how I know for
sure that this computer is ARP spoofed.

103
00:05:57,072 --> 00:05:59,887
This is something that I've
been meaning to tell you, but

104
00:05:59,887 --> 00:06:01,674
I just never got around to it really.

105
00:06:01,674 --> 00:06:07,672
You type in arp -a, for
all, and press enter.

106
00:06:07,672 --> 00:06:11,834
OK, so this is one interface,
another, another.

107
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:15,032
We're not interested in those,
we are interested in this one.

108
00:06:15,032 --> 00:06:17,400
How do I know that I am
interested in this one?

109
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,900
Well, you type in ipconfig.

110
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,490
And you go to the,
you have the names of the adapters here.

111
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,170
So ethernet adapter virtual
box is the only network.

112
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,850
Not that.
I need ethernet adapter ethernet.

113
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,906
And that's going to be 192.168.0.1.

114
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:42,353
I can't select things on
this wretched CMD, but

115
00:06:42,353 --> 00:06:47,130
that is completely inferior
to the Linux terminal.

116
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,380
What can I really do about it?

117
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,170
Anyway, type in arp -a,
scroll up to the top,

118
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,346
and you will see that there is
an IP address 192.168.0.101.

119
00:06:58,346 --> 00:07:04,408
Now in the Linux we have been able to
establish what is the default gateway.

120
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:07,067
And the default gateway is,
of course, the same for

121
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:09,248
all the machines here on the same network.

122
00:07:09,248 --> 00:07:14,590
So the default gateway is 192.168.0.1.

123
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,700
That is the very first IP
address that you see, and

124
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,760
right next to is on the right side,
it says physical address and

125
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,716
then it says 90-f6-52-c1-bb-18.

126
00:07:27,716 --> 00:07:31,722
Okay, so that is our default gateway.

127
00:07:31,722 --> 00:07:39,010
Down below you have a,
that's a host computer and

128
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:44,770
below it is actually 104,
which is supposed to be exactly the same.

129
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,020
Oh, apparently this is not ARP spoofed,
I wonder why.

130
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,154
Let's do ipconfig.

131
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:55,930
It's still 101.

132
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,140
Let's see if this is gonna work.

133
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,270
I don't know,
let's just type in Google web search.

134
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,254
Google, Linux has indeed added it,
but why hasn't it arp spoofed?

135
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,772
That is what I want to know.

136
00:08:11,772 --> 00:08:14,572
arp -a, press enter.

137
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:23,993
Hm, this is

138
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:31,420
quite strange.

139
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,560
The MAC addresses are actually
exactly the same, how I have no idea.

140
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,310
Apparently it's not registering it.

141
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,930
Probably because it's a virtual machine.

142
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,640
But usually when I do
168.0.104 will be the same,

143
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,760
will have the same MAC address
as the default gateway.

144
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,460
Why isn't it showing here,
I have literally no idea.

145
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,090
But I'm doing this segment for fun anyway.

146
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,634
So we're not gonna get into that too much.

147
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:07,100
Usually it would show on a physical
machine, it will show here for

148
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,710
some strange reason.

149
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,400
Maybe, that's just an assumption,
I'm not too sure.

150
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,662
Because the virtual machine
that it's not showing.

151
00:09:12,662 --> 00:09:18,414
But anyway, if you see that anybody on
your ARP list has the same MAC address

152
00:09:18,414 --> 00:09:24,650
as your default gateway, you know that
there is something the matter with it.

153
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:28,884
You know that there is a problem,
that there's something going on,

154
00:09:28,884 --> 00:09:32,832
because the odds of that are,
well, actually non-existent.

155
00:09:32,832 --> 00:09:38,069
Because MAC addresses are regulated by
manufacturers and it's not possible for

156
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:43,392
two devices to have the same MAC address,
especially not for two recent devices.

157
00:09:43,392 --> 00:09:50,912
Anyway, I'm gonna go ahead and
close this frustrating CMD.

158
00:09:50,912 --> 00:09:53,792
And you see, it says here Google and I've.

159
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:58,512
Okay, so I'll just go back to the MSN.com.

160
00:09:58,512 --> 00:10:04,472
Anyway, my search query was Google and
if I press web search.

161
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:09,152
No, no, no, don't fix it.

162
00:10:09,152 --> 00:10:10,754
I don't want you to fix it.

163
00:10:10,754 --> 00:10:12,792
You never fix anything.

164
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:16,916
So Google, I press Websearch and

165
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,752
the page cannot be displayed.

166
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:23,114
Make sure the http.

167
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:30,072
Ping google.com, does it work?

168
00:10:30,072 --> 00:10:31,632
Yes, yes it does work.

169
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,952
What is the problem?

170
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:36,592
Why?

171
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:38,350
Why, Explorer, why?

172
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,580
There we go.

173
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,780
It is open now.

174
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,180
Yeah, I just figured out
why this is happening.

175
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:50,870
If you are performing this sort
of an attack, your victim might,

176
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:56,030
like I have here,
might experience slight delays or

177
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,720
temporary loss of connection for a couple
of seconds or something like that.

178
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,330
I wouldn't call it loss
of connection completely.

179
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:08,130
It would just be unable to load
the website from the first try,

180
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,300
but, instead of giving you
the reload option here apparently

181
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,960
it just gives you fixed
problems which it doesn't fix.

182
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,290
If I was using Chrome or

183
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,540
something like that I would just
get an option to reload the page.

184
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,442
If you press reload the page
it will succeed, no problems.

185
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:29,402
Now, my search query was Google and
on top of that it has added a word Linux.

186
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:31,764
How does it know which words to add?

187
00:11:31,764 --> 00:11:33,084
Well, simple enough.

188
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:36,122
We can go ahead and
modify the script ourselves.

189
00:11:36,122 --> 00:11:40,564
So I'm back in the Kali Linux machine.

190
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:43,604
And if just do ll, whoops, ls.

191
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:45,682
My Google search is here.

192
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:52,244
Let me just nano google search.

193
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,204
Excellent.

194
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:55,482
So, it says extra text.

195
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:58,042
Extra text is Linux.

196
00:11:58,042 --> 00:12:01,804
I can put whatever I want there,
it's completely irrelevant.

197
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,562
I'm gonna put, what am I gonna put?

198
00:12:05,562 --> 00:12:08,202
Smurf.

199
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:09,604
Blue.

200
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,282
Black.

201
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:12,442
Gray wall.

202
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:16,004
I am running out of ideas.

203
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:18,724
What am I gonna put there?

204
00:12:18,724 --> 00:12:22,122
Six.

205
00:12:22,122 --> 00:12:26,042
Let's put the number six.

206
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:29,604
Just because I'm completely
flushed out of ideas tonight.

207
00:12:29,604 --> 00:12:33,271
Anyway, if you wish multiple words,

208
00:12:33,271 --> 00:12:37,402
you can type in +, and
I can type in seven.

209
00:12:37,402 --> 00:12:40,674
That's like super original for my side.

210
00:12:40,674 --> 00:12:41,950
I am all original tonight.

211
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,430
Note that this is not
actually six plus seven.

212
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,800
This is the word six and then plus seven.

213
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,530
Let me just think of something else.

214
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,520
Let's type in brick.

215
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,573
So six+brick and then I can type in space.

216
00:12:56,573 --> 00:13:04,477
Then I can type in blackhole.

217
00:13:04,477 --> 00:13:09,042
And I can type in plus, I don't know,

218
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:12,477
alcohol, or I don't know.

219
00:13:12,477 --> 00:13:13,100
I have no idea.

220
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,990
It doesn't really matter.

221
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,740
This is how you would add multiple words.

222
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,004
So with a plus sign, you can add
pretty much as many words as you like.

223
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:26,004
Eventually there is a limit somewhere
out there, but nothing meaningful.

224
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:28,604
You can add pretty much as
many words as you like.

225
00:13:28,604 --> 00:13:30,764
I'm just gonna leave it six,
not gonna bother.

226
00:13:30,764 --> 00:13:32,404
But you can try an experiment.

227
00:13:32,404 --> 00:13:35,682
Type in different things and
see what you get, the results.

228
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:41,082
Don't give it too long of a string
because it might not work.

229
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:44,482
Anyway, Windows 8.

230
00:13:44,482 --> 00:13:46,404
Oh, wait, I need to reset.

231
00:13:46,404 --> 00:13:49,592
And remember, once you change
the configuration files, or

232
00:13:49,592 --> 00:13:53,157
pretty much anything related to
the configuration files from which

233
00:13:53,157 --> 00:13:56,534
the configuration file takes something,
such as this script,

234
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:59,242
because the configuration
is taking this script.

235
00:13:59,242 --> 00:14:01,162
You need to restart the service.

236
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:09,884
So service squid3 restart.

237
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:15,824
Notice that also my ARP spoofing
is going on in the background and

238
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:23,310
I can just reset the squid proxy without
pausing the ARP spoofing process at all.

239
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,907
I'm not gonna do anything to it.

240
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,055
I'm not gonna touch it.

241
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:29,600
I'm just gonna leave it running while
the squid proxy is actually resetting.

242
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,860
And, I don't know.

243
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,924
Last time, it took maybe 30 seconds,
something like that.

244
00:14:36,924 --> 00:14:40,060
This time, hopefully, it's gonna take
a bit of a shorter amount of time.

245
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,620
And there we go.

246
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,570
It's done, complete.

247
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:47,360
Let's go over to Windows 8.

248
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,670
I'm gonna close this, and
let's perform a web search.

249
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,740
Why are giving me fix connection?

250
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,564
Just reload the page.

251
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,324
And there we go.

252
00:14:58,324 --> 00:15:03,190
Once you like press just Ctrl+R, once you
actually reload the page, it's gonna work.

253
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,010
So you see, it says Google and
then it says six.

254
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,090
Anyway, that would be it.

255
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,510
Before I wrap this tutorial up,

256
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:16,380
please let me urge you all to
experiment as much as you can.

257
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,930
Try all the other scripts
that you can find.

258
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:23,714
But please, and I mean please,
do not just download

259
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:28,192
a script from a random
link somewhere on the net.

260
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:30,072
Don't do that.

261
00:15:30,072 --> 00:15:32,832
You have seen where I found the script,
where I have downloaded it.

262
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:35,354
I mean, you can find the script elsewhere,
that's not a problem.

263
00:15:35,354 --> 00:15:40,217
But be very specific as far as
the places from which you download

264
00:15:40,217 --> 00:15:42,432
the scripts are concerned.

265
00:15:42,432 --> 00:15:46,825
So as you've seen, I've downloaded it from
Google Code, which is pretty safe, and

266
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:50,192
plus I can actually read the script and
see what's written in it.

267
00:15:50,192 --> 00:15:53,211
And you can in such a way be safer, but

268
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:58,290
if you can't read the script it
doesn't really do much good.

269
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,786
Anyway, I am urging you once again,

270
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:01,970
be very careful from where
you download the scripts.

271
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,920
But please do experiment as well.

272
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,700
Try, try a lot of other varieties.

273
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:12,292
One more thing to say is that
browsers are getting updated.

274
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:15,088
There are security precautions
which are being put in place, so

275
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:16,450
not all the scripts will work.

276
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,100
This attack won't work forever, and
it won't work on all machines, and

277
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,220
it won't work against anyone.

278
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,820
So please keep that in
mind when attempting this.

279
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,270
Usually best to go against somebody
who doesn't have the latest updates.

280
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,180
But that's a pretty general sentence, and

281
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,240
you might think that that is such a far
fetched idea that that's impossible.

282
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,690
But let me tell you something.

283
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,510
Most people don't have the latest updates.

284
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,840
They don't have the latest software.

285
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,700
There are multiple reasons for that.

286
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,230
Sometimes it's money, but most of
the time it's just that people are lazy.

287
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,703
They don't perform regular updates and
even though it cost them literally

288
00:16:58,703 --> 00:17:02,974
nothing, maybe like five minutes of
their time or something of a kind.

289
00:17:02,974 --> 00:17:07,452
Another thing is that people
are using operating systems for

290
00:17:07,452 --> 00:17:10,452
which the security support has ran out.

291
00:17:10,452 --> 00:17:14,031
So there are no more security updates for
those operating systems,

292
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:15,170
which is fantastic.

293
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,630
And you might think that I'm talking
about Windows XP or something of a kind.

294
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,320
No, I'm not talking about Windows XP.

295
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,790
If you're using Windows XP your machine
is practically public property.

296
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,630
Primarily because there are a lot
of people out there scanning for

297
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:36,030
those machines as they are extremely
vulnerable to all sorts of attacks.

298
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,080
But I'm talking more about, for
example, let's say Windows 7.

299
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:45,838
Security support still hasn't ran out but
they're not exactly enthusiastic about it.

300
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:50,920
Windows 8.1 is fairly good with security
but it still has some loopholes,

301
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,390
and if not updated on a regular
basis it can encounter problems.

302
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,930
And even if it is upgraded,
I mean my system here, it's upgraded.

303
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,000
