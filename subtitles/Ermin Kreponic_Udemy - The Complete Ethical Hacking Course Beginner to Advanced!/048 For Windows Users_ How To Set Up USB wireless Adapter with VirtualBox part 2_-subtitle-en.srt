1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Welcome back everybody to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,240
Today I am going to actually show you
how to

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,300
Well everything is pretty much set up.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,469
You just need to do a few more things in VirtualBox

5
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:15,330
in order to have a proper setup

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,800
but down below in the bottom right
corner

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,300
if you are using a desktop machine and not a laptop

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,660
and if you didn't have wireless previously on your desktop machine

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,900
upon installing these drivers and plugging in this USB adapter

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,700
you will, from this point on

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,900
actually have wireless access on your physical machine as well.

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,300
Not on your physical machine, sorry

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,510
on your desktop machine

14
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,800
because a lot of the desktop machines come without any wireless

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,190
as they are workstations

16
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,059
so this might be also a helpful bit of information to know.

17
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:51,600
Anyway, let's just go ahead and right click on our Kali machine

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,949
Go into "Settings"

19
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,000
Click on "USB"

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,200
This will be disabled and you won't have anything selected here.

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,100
So just go ahead and click on "Enable 20 EHCI controller"

22
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,920
If things are not configured properly with the extension pack

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,100
you will get a...hmmm, how is it

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,920
A triangle. A yellow triangle with an exclamation mark in the center

25
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,600
next to your "OK" button down at the middle.

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,160
So right on the left of the "OK" button, you will get that triangle

27
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,000
which means that you don't have the
extension pack installed

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,100
You can, aside from going to the VirtualBox site

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,960
where they have these three versions here: 4.2,  4.1, 4.0

30
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,200
You can also go to the official Oracle site

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,120
and download the VirtualBox extension pack from there

32
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,009
where they actually have 4.3.26, which is very nice

33
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,800
which is the latest one

34
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,070
Just go ahead and head over to the official Oracle site

35
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,800
and find the VirtualBox section there.

36
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,060
From there, you can actually download the extension pack

37
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,800
Anyway, just minimize this.

38
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,100
We have enabled the USB to support

39
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,250
and now let's go ahead and add our device.

40
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,000
So here you have a listing of devices:

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,200
Headset, keyboard, some unknown device, something generic

42
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,200
and down below you have 11m USB.

43
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,700
That is the one that I'm going to add here.

44
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,250
Click on "OK"

45
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,630
There we go.

46
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,800
All you have to do from this point on is
power your machine on

47
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,300
and that's it.

48
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,600
So it might take a while for it to boot.

49
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,500
This is my friend's computer.

50
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:38,000
I haven't really installed Kali here, but instead I am using a live version.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,480
As I have stated previously, I'm doing this on Windows 7

52
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,000
but you can do it in Windows 8, Vista, whatever

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,800
it's gonna work, no problems.

54
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,700
I believe it's gonna work on XP as well

55
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,580
but no guarantees for XP and Vista

56
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,700
as those systems are quite old, and I
don't know

57
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,970
you might have some problems with VirtualBox or something a kind.

58
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,200
That's a topic for another day.

59
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,230
Anyway, the boot process here is in route

60
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:13,200
and, I don't know, live versions usually take a bit longer.

61
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,440
I would have put it up prior to this, so you wouldn't have to wait for the process.

62
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,800
However, then I couldn't actually show
you

63
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,300
how I configured VirtualBox to function with this

64
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,400
because if you go ahead and right click on Kali now

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,349
and go into "Settings"

66
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:29,200
and go down to the USB

67
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,400
you can see that the  "Enable USB controller"

68
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,300
and the "Enable USB 20" are greyed out

69
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,300
and you can't actually take anything there, which can be problematic.

70
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,380
Although you can add new USB devices if you want

71
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,600
even after the machine is actually turned on.

72
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,000
So the boot process is en route

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,370
Any moment now. Come on.

74
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,100
Please! Begging you.

75
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,000
Today. Some time.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Perhaps. Maybe not.

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,239
Ah...the beauty. The beauty of Windows machines.

78
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,889
Anyway, Kali has booted.

79
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:09,000
Almost

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,200
There we go.

81
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,800
So Kali is up and running now.

82
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,500
If I just go ahead and click on the terminal  as we did before.

83
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,389
Just gonna go ahead and magnify it.

84
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:22,079
Don't have the extensions here

85
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,000
So don't have the full screen, but if I just do this

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,300
I believe this is sufficient for this additional tutorial.

87
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,190
You can actually see clearly what is going on.

88
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,900
If I type in "ifconfig", I believe that you can all read this text, no problems.

89
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,400
If you can't, let me know.

90
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,700
You see that I have wlan0 adapter here.

91
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,000
That is my wireless adapter.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,200
If I scroll upwards, I can see that I also have eth0

93
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,500
which is my wire network adapter

94
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,340
which is currently in the bridged mode with my Kali machine.

95
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,600
If I go to "Devices"

96
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,300
"Network"

97
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,000
"Network settings"

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,090
This is very important

99
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,600
I need to say attached bridged adapter

100
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,800
as I have stated several times before

101
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,850
but felt like I should just say it one more time.

102
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:11,000
No big deal there.

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,300
So, Bridged Adapter

104
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,500
Select your adapter

105
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,700
Allow all

106
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,100
Okay

107
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,000
Excellent!

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,900
Oh yeah, one more thing --

109
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:28,100
I've noticed a lot of people have been asking me about

110
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,000
the mac addresses of their virtual machines.

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,500
So if you are using a live CD or something like that

112
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,000
you could generate your own mac address with a mac changer

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,229
as I have showed you before

114
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:40,600
but if you're using a virtual machine,
you can just

115
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,800
while the machine is powered off

116
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,500
you can generate a new mac address.

117
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,800
It says here you can change it here without any problems.

118
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,290
It functions a bit differently because this is a virtual machine

119
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,320
but you can just change the mac address here randomly

120
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,669
to your heart's content.

121
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:59,200
Anyway, as I said, you can see to the wlan0

122
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,600
So let's just perform a bit of a test here.

123
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,500
A test run

124
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,000
Let's type in "iwlist"

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:17,139
and then I'm gonna type "wlan0 | grep ESSID"

126
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:18,200
and if I press up

127
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Unknown command

128
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,200
Oh yeah, of course

129
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,500
Scan

130
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,210
and there you go!

131
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,780
I can actually scan for all the wireless
networks in my area

132
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,100
and I can connect this machine to them.

133
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,410
This virtual machine, that is.

134
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,100
To them, without any problems.

135
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,900
I believe that this should solve any problems

136
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,000
that any Windows user has had with wireless configuration

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,300
with their virtual machine

138
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,500
in regard to their virtual machines

139
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,100
and if you have any questions

140
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,700
if you have any problems, or anything of a kind

141
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,550
feel free to talk to me in the discussion section.

142
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,810
I will, as always, be more than happy and willing to help you out

143
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,000
in anyway I can.

144
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Until then, I would like

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,200
I would like to say "Until next tutorial"

146
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,600
but I don't know, you never know

147
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,800
I could add some new ones in the future

148
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,200
but for the time being, I just made this
addition to help you out.
