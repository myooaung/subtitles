00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,630
Hello everybody, and
welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,871
Let's just go ahead and
start our configuration.

3
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:10,415
Before we can start the configuration,
we just need to go ahead and

4
00:00:10,415 --> 00:00:13,180
download some of these scripts.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:18,900
So you have ASCII images,
basically converts all images

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,490
to ASCII text which can be kind of funny.

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,330
Blur images makes them blurry so
you can't see anything on it.

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,630
I personally like this one,
it's Google search.

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,130
You are able to add extra words
to whatever somebody's search is,

10
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,470
you can add extra words to it.

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,090
I've seen people do all
sorts of things with this.

12
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,630
And yeah.
Let's just go over onto the net.

13
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,180
Let me just show you where you can
download these sort of things, and

14
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,830
don't download them from anywhere else,
as they are executable scripts that

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,420
you will give execution privileges and
that you will run on your system.

16
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,620
So that can be a pretty big problem.

17
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,963
Anyway, go ahead,
use your favorite search engine.

18
00:01:06,963 --> 00:01:13,170
Type in googlesearch.pl and
I already visited the page.

19
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,762
It's googlesearch.pl on Google code.

20
00:01:16,762 --> 00:01:19,720
Let me just zoom in.

21
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,280
Here you can actually see the script.

22
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,184
You can read it, you can

23
00:01:27,184 --> 00:01:31,780
see the code,
you can see everything that it does.

24
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:38,610
It doesn't really do much it just adds
extra words to the Google search.

25
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,560
You can view raw file.

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,928
You can zoom in, and you can press Ctrl+A,
select all here, Ctrl+C, to copy it.

27
00:01:47,928 --> 00:01:53,020
Then you could open your terminal back up,
and I do believe I have some of them here.

28
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,720
Yep, there we go.

29
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,420
I have ASCII images, I have Google search,
no Internet, and Tourette images.

30
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,490
I got no idea what that does.

31
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,530
But I do believe I've tried
it out since it's here.

32
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,590
In any case,
you will need to of course type in nano.

33
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,630
And then you will need to use this name or
this name.

34
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,390
You can actually name
it whatever you want.

35
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,790
It doesn't matter as far as I know.

36
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,910
Although you do need .pl extension.

37
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,190
But try to keep the name consistent,
there is no need for you to change it or

38
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,070
anything of a kind.

39
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,888
You see, I basically just copy-pasted
this text here previously.

40
00:02:30,888 --> 00:02:36,290
If you didn't, you would have an empty
file here, you would just right click,

41
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,140
paste and copy everything into it.

42
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,240
There are no modifications that you need
to do to this one however, internally.

43
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,160
But externally,
you would need to type in chmod plus x and

44
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,950
then googleSearch in order to
give it execution privileges.

45
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,220
With some of these other scripts,
you do need to make certain modifications.

46
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,908
They're not extreme, but you do need
to actually go into the script and

47
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:05,440
change a thing or two,
depending on the script.

48
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,521
So let's just take asciiImages,
nano, asciiImages.

49
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:17,002
And you see here, it says $ourIP.

50
00:03:17,002 --> 00:03:21,840
I think the default one here is 33.

51
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,520
But you do need to change it to whatever
the LAN IP address of your device is.

52
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,950
Of your computer is that is.

53
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,310
Mine is 104 at the moment, but

54
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,660
these things tend to change, so
make sure to keep the paste up.

55
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,680
You can also assign IP addresses
statically to your computers, but that's

56
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,400
gonna present a problem when you connect
to a public Wi-Fi or something of a kind.

57
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,320
Anyway, doesn't matter, don't change the
IP addresses of your computer, just take

58
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,860
a look at what it is and type it in here
in order to render the script effective.

59
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,520
In order for it to start functioning.

60
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,940
You do need to probably just change
the last octave but I don't know.

61
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,670
Depends what your LAN IP address is.

62
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,090
Just type it in here.

63
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,990
This is how you can check
your LAN IP address ifconfig.

64
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,410
Press enter and there you go.

65
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,150
This is my LAN IP address,
the one that I am selecting at the moment.

66
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,460
Anyway, now that we have
some of the scripts here,

67
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,520
there's no installation procedure,
anything of a kind.

68
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,610
You basically copy, paste the script
into the matching name, and that's it.

69
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,710
As I said,
you can name it whatever you want, but

70
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,320
I would suggest that you name
it with a .pl extension.

71
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,877
And you can find all sorts of
these scripts, I mean, names,

72
00:04:34,877 --> 00:04:37,000
you can just type in your
favorite search engine.

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,240
Flip images squid.

74
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:52,130
Let's see if that's gonna help us out.

75
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,922
There you go,
somebody has April Fool's Day.

76
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,110
Redirecting.

77
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,370
Do they have the list of scripts here?

78
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:07,390
No, they do not.
Let's just go over, let's just go over.

79
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,650
Don't give up so fast.

80
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,770
Apparently they do not
have it here either.

81
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:20,690
Do they have it on Google Code?

82
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,650
Yep, there you go.

83
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,560
Actually, you have them.

84
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,485
It says Fight Club, Blur Images, ASCII.pl.

85
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:30,390
Google search no Internet,
or something like that.

86
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,500
If you're wondering
what the Fight Club is,

87
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,200
basically just substitutes
all of your images on a site.

88
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,460
If I'm not mistaken, with the imagery
from The Fight Club movie.

89
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,130
It definitely does something of a kind.

90
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,010
I'm not too sure about that.

91
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,870
But you can take a look at
the descriptions if you want for

92
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,830
every individual script.

93
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,600
There are a lot of these scripts
that you can find on the net.

94
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,810
And depending on what you wanna do, you
can implement each one of them separately.

95
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,690
Anyway, next step we
have to configure this.

96
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,990
We have to configure Squid.

97
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,910
As I've written here.

98
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:09,163
If you install then you
need to type in nano space

99
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:13,913
slash etc slash squid.

100
00:06:13,913 --> 00:06:16,740
And then again, squid3 actually.

101
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,410
Sorry.

102
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,480
And then squid.com.

103
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,160
Press enter and then her we're
gonna be doing some of the editing.

104
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,770
There are 5,782 lines.

105
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,234
So, I'm just gonna go ahead and
search for what I need,

106
00:06:30,234 --> 00:06:34,581
in order to save us a bit of time,
actually, I don't need to search for

107
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:38,510
the first one, because it should
be straight off the bat here.

108
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,390
Apparently not.

109
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,510
Do forgive me,
I've been modifying this yesterday.

110
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,350
So a few things have slipped my mind.

111
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,470
Nope, give me Ctrl+V, paste, go.

112
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,710
Okay excellent.

113
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:04,950
So these basic things,
how do you call them?

114
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,550
These bars represent
comment without lines.

115
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,320
They are the lines which the program
will not take into consideration.

116
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,251
All you need to do is un-comment it.

117
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:16,311
There you go.

118
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:22,200
This line will be taken
into consideration.

119
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,323
And if you don't want it to
be taken into consideration,

120
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:29,880
just put a bar there and it will not be.

121
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,840
I have un-commented this particular
line because this is my network.

122
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:44,441
So when I do 168.0.0
with the subnet mask 16.

123
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:50,756
Anyway, depending on what
your configuration is,

124
00:07:50,756 --> 00:07:54,780
make sure to choose a proper one.

125
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,580
You should be able to find it,

126
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,730
these are ranges for
home IP addresses, most of them.

127
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,400
If not, I'm pretty sure you
can add your own as well.

128
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,280
And I'm not too sure about that.

129
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,190
That doesn't really matter.

130
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:13,986
You will find yourselves there as
most likely it will be in this one.

131
00:08:13,986 --> 00:08:17,577
192.168.0.0/16.

132
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:18,357
So yeah.

133
00:08:18,357 --> 00:08:20,920
That's a lot of bits.

134
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,490
16, both of these ranges will change.

135
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,602
This is the host part of the IP address,
and

136
00:08:27,602 --> 00:08:30,632
these are the amount of host you can have.

137
00:08:30,632 --> 00:08:37,670
So 255 here and 255 here, and
then you get the combination.

138
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,890
That's a lot of hosts.

139
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,230
I don't know how many,
but a lot in general.

140
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:47,710
Let's go ahead and find our next
thing that we need to modify so

141
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:54,590
http access allow, copy, paste.

142
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,130
Where is it, excellent.

143
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:02,380
So this line, this can be a commented
line so that can be a problem like this.

144
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,670
You need to un-comment it and
have it run as it is.

145
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,550
Okay, so the next step, what we
have to do is change the port 3812.

146
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,150
No, not the port, but we need to
make sure that it is transparent.

147
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,350
So let me just show it to
you what I mean by that.

148
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:25,115
Excellent, so usually you will have
only this line that I have selected

149
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:29,995
without the one that I am selecting now,
so the word transparent will not be here.

150
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:35,065
You literally need to just type it in
there, just type in transparent right

151
00:09:35,065 --> 00:09:39,935
next to port with a space in between.

152
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:46,509
We are doing this, so computers
that we are spoofing would not at

153
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:52,213
all need any sort of configuration with
their browsers or anything of a kind.

154
00:09:52,213 --> 00:09:55,100
It will use proxy by
default when we spoof them.

155
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:01,150
Anyway, that's it as far as
the squid proxy is concerned.

156
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,990
We don't actually need
to do any other changes

157
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,740
aside from assigning it a script to use,
and that's gonna be the end of it.

158
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,950
But this we are going to change.

159
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,640
This you can actually change
multiple times if you wish.

160
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,647
And this is where all
the changes come into play.

161
00:10:18,565 --> 00:10:20,965
Oh, come on!

162
00:10:20,965 --> 00:10:22,845
Don't do this to me.

163
00:10:25,045 --> 00:10:27,390
Excellent.
There we go, at the end.

164
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,026
So, this one will actually
needs to be at the end,

165
00:10:31,026 --> 00:10:34,850
and most likely,
it will not be written by default.

166
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,498
So, the command that I am selecting now,

167
00:10:38,498 --> 00:10:43,830
just write it down at the bottom
of this configuration file.

168
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,870
If it's not there just write it in.

169
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,560
Just write it down and that's it.

170
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,980
This here is the path and

171
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,870
this here right next to it is
the script that I'm going to be using.

172
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,530
The one that I have just
fetched from the Internet.

173
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,790
Now the path can be different of course.

174
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:05,360
Since this is Kali Linux with a default
installation, pretty much everything goes

175
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,480
into the root folder and
from there it gets used elsewhere.

176
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,250
But anyway, this is just the path and
over here is the script itself.

177
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,350
Nothing more.

178
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,660
And this, you need to write in here if
you wish to use any external scripts,

179
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,170
and that's it.

180
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,960
Now, when you change a script,
just change the path if necessary.

181
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,100
If they're at the same place,
just change the name of the script.

182
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,755
That's all, but you do need to reset
the script proxy server in order for

183
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:36,374
changes to take effect.

184
00:11:36,374 --> 00:11:40,850
So, press Ctrl+O to save, Enter.

185
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,710
Ctrl+X to exit.

186
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,510
Now we have completely configured squid.

187
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:53,990
Let me just type in
service squid3 restart.

188
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,610
This can take up awhile, I don't know.

189
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,770
Depending on what is going on.

190
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,000
As I said the configuration
file is rather lengthy.

191
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,260
And this is a virtual machine.

192
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:07,086
So it's gonna take awhile for
it to actually reload or restart.

193
00:12:07,086 --> 00:12:11,950
Until then, I'm gonna bid you farewell and
continue in the follow up tutorial.
