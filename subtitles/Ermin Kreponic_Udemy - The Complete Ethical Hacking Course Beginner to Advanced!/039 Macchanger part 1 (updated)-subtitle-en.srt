00:00:00,315 --> 00:00:04,445
Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial, today I'm gonna go ahead

2
00:00:04,445 --> 00:00:12,963
and talk a little a bit about MAC addresses, what they are and why they

3
00:00:04,445 --> 00:00:12,963
are important to us and how can we change them, this is all

4
00:00:12,963 --> 00:00:19,601
in order to increase our level of anonymity, sort to put it.

5
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:31,083
You might among other things, you might notice that this is a bit of a different

6
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:31,083
interface and this is an updated version of this section.

7
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:41,194
There were a lot of people who had requested it so I figure I would update this

8
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:41,194
part with the Macchanger and simplified a little bit, also includes some

9
00:00:41,194 --> 00:00:44,335
additional explanations.

10
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:51,272
Before we actually begin, let me just go ahead and delete my setup

11
00:00:51,272 --> 00:01:01,284
I have a virtual machine running just as before, it is setup...

12
00:00:51,272 --> 00:01:01,284
Yep, there we go, you can see this is a virtual machine

13
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:09,839
My host operating system is completely irrelevant in this case, it is

14
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:09,839
Fedora 22 but completely irrelevant, just note that this is a virtual

15
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:21,642
machine of Kali Linux operating withing virtual box and it does not

16
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:21,642
matter if your host is Windows or Mac, completely irrelevant

17
00:01:24,162 --> 00:01:33,125
So just go ahead and open up the terminal, that is the very first thing that we

18
00:01:24,162 --> 00:01:33,125
will need to do and let's go ahead and take a look at our MAC address here

19
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:36,295
ifconfig

20
00:01:36,295 --> 00:01:49,468
Press Enter, and you will see that it says hardware address or burnt in address

21
00:01:36,295 --> 00:01:49,468
there are multiple names by which it is referred so no big deal there

22
00:01:49,468 --> 00:02:00,702
You can see that this is it, the first portion of it, the first three sets represent the

23
00:01:49,468 --> 00:02:00,702
manufacturer

24
00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:13,321
This is not the hardware address of my machine, this is the hardware

25
00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:13,321
address of my network card, of my integrated network card

26
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:21,210
It can be either your ethernet card or your wireless card or your

27
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:21,210
wireless adapter, whatever

28
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:30,324
These things have MAC addresses and by them you can be identified

29
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:30,324
on the network

30
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:41,050
As I said, the first three sets identify the manufacturer of the particular

31
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:41,050
hardware in question so by just looking at the first three sets

32
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:56,477
you can search it on the net and see who the manufacturer is

33
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:56,477
just type it into Google and you will get a list of something like that

34
00:02:56,477 --> 00:03:02,532
It doesn't really matter, you will get like a hundred thousand results

35
00:02:56,477 --> 00:03:02,532
and you will be able to figure out who the manufacturer of that

36
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:13,113
particular card is. Now the last three sets, they're left to the will of

37
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:13,113
the manufacturer, they can do with them pretty much whatever

38
00:03:13,113 --> 00:03:23,446
they want and you cannot utilize them yourself for any further

39
00:03:13,113 --> 00:03:23,446
identification in that sense, so you won't be able to see which

40
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:38,840
device in particular is being used however, this MAC address is

41
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:38,840
visible on my local network and somebody can use it to

42
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:53,228
restrict access to completely ban me from the network or to

43
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:53,228
identify me, to identify me by name, that would be very difficult

44
00:03:53,228 --> 00:04:01,576
but they would be able to, somebody who would be investigating

45
00:03:53,228 --> 00:04:01,576
or the admin would be able to see this hardware address and

46
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:07,943
then if somebody takes a look at your laptop they would be able

47
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:07,943
to see the same address which is a problem because then there's a

48
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:10,253
direct link.

49
00:04:10,253 --> 00:04:20,973
Now, they can be changed, they can be altered to your heart's content

50
00:04:10,253 --> 00:04:20,973
which is very good news indeed, but please, keep in mind, just understand

51
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:29,842
that this address does not leave your local network, it does not go further

52
00:04:29,842 --> 00:04:38,156
If was somewhere on the net out there on the internet I would not be able

53
00:04:29,842 --> 00:04:38,156
to see this MAC address nor you will be able to see mine

54
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:48,273
this is only for local network, in fact, it does not leave the first jump in

55
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:48,273
your house, this network does not leave the default gateway

56
00:04:48,273 --> 00:04:56,675
This address does not leave the default gateway which is your ISP router

57
00:04:48,273 --> 00:04:56,675
so you can actually go to your ISP router, your ISP router has this MAC

58
00:04:56,675 --> 00:05:06,585
address but it does not go any further than that, it stays there, so there is

59
00:04:56,675 --> 00:05:06,585
no way for me to actually see it directly on the site

60
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:13,933
shenanigans sent went in to the router itself, grabbed it from the router itself.

61
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:29,685
Anyway, keep in mind that changing a MAC address in a virtual machine

62
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:29,685
is rather pointless I would say, but it is very useful if you have a USB

63
00:05:29,685 --> 00:05:41,819
installation or a bootable USB or if you have this installed in your physical

64
00:05:29,685 --> 00:05:41,819
machine and it is very useful in the real world to know how to do this

65
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:52,560
But since we have a virtual machine for learning purposes we are going to

66
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:52,560
use it as our test subject, and in the real world as you have mastered this

67
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:01,556
of course, you won't be using a virtual machine, you will be using a real machine

68
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:01,556
not to say virtual machines are useless. I'm not saying that the virtual machine

69
00:06:01,556 --> 00:06:08,935
is useless, I'm just saying that we're using this one for learning purposes

70
00:06:01,556 --> 00:06:08,935
and then in some later point of time when all of this is mastered you will

71
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:16,422
be able to switch to your bootable USB if you haven't already, or to a

72
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:16,422
physical machine.

73
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:28,618
But, the way to change an address is to, you can do this manually but

74
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:28,618
you can also use a macchanger, with a maccchanger you can...

75
00:06:28,618 --> 00:06:40,019
It's a tool to change the MAC address, so let's go ahead and take a look

76
00:06:28,618 --> 00:06:40,019
at this tool, type in maccchanger -h (h for help)

77
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:51,197
So the first option just prints this whole menu, the second one is gonna give you

78
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:51,197
the version, and this is gonna give you the MAC addresses, in fact, let's

79
00:06:51,197 --> 00:06:56,603
go ahead and use this option so do the s

80
00:06:56,603 --> 00:07:03,927
Ok fine, 'show', have I miss type something?

81
00:07:03,927 --> 00:07:07,699
macchager -s eth0

82
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:17,825
Ok so I didn't pass the interface along, sorry If you type in ifconfig

83
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:17,825
and you can take a look at the interface or you know the interface

84
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:27,931
in advance, you can of course see the address here as well but if you

85
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:27,931
just want the macchanger to show it you would just use maccchanger

86
00:07:27,931 --> 00:07:38,207
and type in the name of the interface here, you don't need this whole

87
00:07:27,931 --> 00:07:38,207
thing, you just need that -s and there we go it says that the current MAC

88
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:45,294
is this one and that the permanent MAC is this one, the MAC address

89
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:45,294
so you might wonder, well why would I want to look at it here if I can

90
00:07:45,294 --> 00:07:58,339
just type in ifconfig and look at it and take a look at it here, well,

91
00:07:45,294 --> 00:07:58,339
when you change it you want to be able to see what is your current

92
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:08,788
MAC address and what is your permanent MAC address, so when the

93
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:08,788
MAC address is changed here in the output of the ifconfig you'll only

94
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:15,898
see the changed one, you won't be able to see the original one, so if

95
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:15,898
you want to see the original one you can have a look at it here

96
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:29,127
that's the permanent MAC, so no worries there, let's go ahead and

97
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:29,127
clear this, macchanger -h, there we go

98
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:41,910
And this is e, ending ''Don't change the vendor bytes'', ok fine, whatever

99
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:41,910
You're rarely going to use that, I mean, we're gonna go ahead and skip that really

100
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:53,320
There's no point, ''another set random vendor MAC of the same kind'', ok so this

101
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:53,320
is actually not a bad idea, sometimes, in some cases, so it says

102
00:08:53,320 --> 00:09:10,397
"Set random vendor MAC of the same kind", so for example if on the network

103
00:08:53,320 --> 00:09:10,397
only a certain type of devices are allowed from certain vendor you can

104
00:09:10,397 --> 00:09:21,148
you can actually go ahead and change the MAC of your card and have it stay

105
00:09:10,397 --> 00:09:21,148
within these parameters of the same vendor even thought it would be

106
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:27,556
a completely different MAC address.

107
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:37,799
For example, if you're in an office building or something like that and they only

108
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:37,799
allow certain hardware to go and function there from certain vender you can

109
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:49,673
go to that particular machine, it is possible to go if you have permission of course,

110
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:49,673
to that particular machine and actually change the MAC address and have it stay

111
00:09:49,673 --> 00:10:01,335
within the confines of the same vendor so it will be a completely different MAC

112
00:09:49,673 --> 00:10:01,335
and it will help in terms of anonymity and you will still have connectivity on the network.

113
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:08,118
But these are rather rare cases and again you won't actually need to use this one

114
00:10:08,118 --> 00:10:15,612
This is -A ''Set random vendor MAC of any kind" that's pretty much self-explanatory

115
00:10:15,612 --> 00:10:29,407
and this is an option which you will use as well, this is -p, quite important actually, it

116
00:10:15,612 --> 00:10:29,407
will ''Reset to original, permanent hardware MAC'', it will bring about your original

117
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:39,653
MAC address if you've changed it or if you've changed it several times, it will

118
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:39,653
restore the original one on demand.

119
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:54,295
-r is just to ''Set fully random MAC'' address, this is something you're going

120
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:54,295
to use, so -p and -r are a good option, so this is a fully random MAC

121
00:10:54,295 --> 00:11:06,471
and if you're wondering what the -A is, this will give you a random

122
00:10:54,295 --> 00:11:06,471
MAC address, but this MAC address will be in the pool that has been

123
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:21,251
assigned to vendors so your network card will be identified as belonging

124
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:21,251
to at least some vendor as opposed to this, this is just a random set

125
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:30,186
completely random set, doesn't necessarily need to belong to any

126
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:30,186
vendor or anything like that.

127
00:11:30,186 --> 00:11:43,715
What do I mean by that? well, -A, for example if you did this, like Realtek,

128
00:11:30,186 --> 00:11:43,715
a company that produces network hardware, they have a fixed amount

129
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:57,304
of MAC addresses that have been given to them that they can use to identify

130
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:57,304
their devices and if you say -A for example, you might get the first three sets

131
00:11:57,304 --> 00:12:12,833
from the Realtek and then the last three sets will be completely random again

132
00:11:57,304 --> 00:12:12,833
so your card will be identified as being from Realtek as opposed to belonging

133
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:26,438
to some other company, and down below all six sets will be completely

134
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:26,438
random, so -A will ensure that the first three sets belong to a vendor

135
00:12:26,438 --> 00:12:34,393
and then the last three sets are completely random with -r all the sets

136
00:12:26,438 --> 00:12:34,393
are random.

137
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:47,323
Ok so this will print known vendors, you can type in macchanger -l

138
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:47,323
and there you go, so this are all known vendors there quite a bit

139
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:54,459
of them, and these are vendor bits, so the first three sets.

140
00:12:54,459 --> 00:13:09,489
If you use the -A you will be identified as having a network card that

141
00:12:54,459 --> 00:13:09,489
belongs to some of these vendors which is not a bad idea at all

142
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:21,165
You could actually use these bits to fake the MAC address of your hardware

143
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:21,165
as belonging to some of these vendors so if you want to pretend to be

144
00:13:21,165 --> 00:13:32,755
a Belkin, you could use these bits to actually pretend to be Belkin,

145
00:13:21,165 --> 00:13:32,755
if you want to be Netgear you could use these, so on and so forth.

146
00:13:32,755 --> 00:13:35,948
I'm sure you get the idea here.

147
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:41,232
maccchanger -h

148
00:13:41,232 --> 00:13:54,588
And in case of pretend to be a burnt in address, you can use that as well

149
00:13:41,232 --> 00:13:54,588
but down below you have -m, and -m actually sets the MAC address

150
00:13:54,588 --> 00:14:09,153
which is a very, very, very nice option, it can be extremely powerful,

151
00:13:54,588 --> 00:14:09,153
if can have a tremendous effect, why? well, here's something that I will

152
00:14:09,153 --> 00:14:21,453
share from... Well, it is my experience because I have seen it happened

153
00:14:09,153 --> 00:14:21,453
and this keeps happening, there are tools to combat it

154
00:14:21,453 --> 00:14:35,983
but, it's just the price and the amount of effort that you have to put into

155
00:14:21,453 --> 00:14:35,983
fighting it, it's difficult, here's what I mean, let's say you are in a school

156
00:14:35,983 --> 00:14:49,619
network,in some facility, some building, in a school during a lecture

157
00:14:35,983 --> 00:14:49,619
during some of my lectures I've seen people, I've seen this done, let's put it

158
00:14:49,619 --> 00:15:04,353
like that, basically we had these wireless projectors and people would,

159
00:14:49,619 --> 00:15:04,353
in the beginning people would just jam the wireless and they noticed

160
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:14,301
and when they jammed the wireless the problem was that the professor's computer

161
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:14,301
could no longer connect to the wireless projector so the lecture was hinder

162
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:24,689
it was very difficult to perform because the connection would break every

163
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:24,689
minute or so and the professor didn't figure out, just figured ''oh, must be

164
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:32,715
some sort of technical problem or something like that!" then he went to the

165
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:32,715
administrator and administrators have taken a look at it and they realized they

166
00:15:32,715 --> 00:15:45,524
were being jammed, so what they did was implement MAC filtering and

167
00:15:32,715 --> 00:15:45,524
this caused further problems, why?, because anyone caught jamming

168
00:15:45,524 --> 00:15:54,819
that MAC address would be permanently banned, however, someone came

169
00:15:45,524 --> 00:15:54,819
with an idea and it's a fairly simple idea, it's a very old idea, they didn't

170
00:15:54,819 --> 00:16:09,934
came up with it they just used it to actually scan the network, figure out

171
00:15:54,819 --> 00:16:09,934
the MAC address of the professor's computer, take a look at it and then

172
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:22,135
set that address as their own address, so they take a look at his MAC address

173
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:22,135
they've taken it and then they've used the m option, the maccchanger to set

174
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:33,197
the interface MAC address of their own computers to be exactly the same

175
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:33,197
as the professor's and they begun doing shenanigans pretending to be

176
00:16:33,197 --> 00:16:44,230
the professor's PC, what the administrators would do then is permanently

177
00:16:33,197 --> 00:16:44,230
ban that MAC address which would create a very significant problem because

178
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:51,596
not only could he longer connect to the projector, not only the professor could

179
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:51,596
not longer connect to the projector, but, the professor could not longer

180
00:16:51,596 --> 00:17:01,759
connect to pretty much any wireless network or any network at all within the

181
00:16:51,596 --> 00:17:01,759
school facilities because on every router in the school that particular MAC

182
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,758
address was banned so this created an even bigger problem.

183
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:16,663
So now you see how the -m option can be extremely useful and extremley

184
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:16,663
powerful.

185
00:17:16,663 --> 00:17:28,893
Anyway, I'm running a little bit short on time here so I would cut the tutorial

186
00:17:16,663 --> 00:17:28,893
here and we would elaborate further on this matter in the follow-up tutorial.
