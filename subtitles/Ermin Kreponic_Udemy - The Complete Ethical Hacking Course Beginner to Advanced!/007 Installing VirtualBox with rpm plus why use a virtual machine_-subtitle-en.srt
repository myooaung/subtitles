00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,500
Hello everybody and welcome to this
tutorial today.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,900
Today I will be talking about our working environment.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,230
I will show you how you can set it up.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,599
So first off, we will need to install VirtualBox

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,459
Now it doesn't matter if you're running
Mac OS X, Linux or Windows

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,000
you will still need to do this

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,430
for several reasons, really.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,400
First of all

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,130
I mean , we're gonna be doing a lot of stuff

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,300
and we're gonna be doing it as root.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,800
So we are always facing the prospect
that we might break something

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,190
that we might mess something up

13
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,370
I will show you how you can set it up.

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,800
because even if you do mess something up

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,420
and even if you don't know how to fix it

16
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,900
it doesn't really matter

17
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,300
It is only a virtual machine

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:55,100
You don't really have any data of
importance on it.

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,600
However if you mess something up on your main machine

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,890
However if you mess something up on your main machine

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,300
If you're forced to reinstall it or something of a kind

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,000
then you need to back all your data up

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,470
you need to figure out where everything is, etc

24
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,729
or you can try fixing the problem

25
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:14,200
and depending on what that is

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,820
it could consume a large amount of your time

27
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,100
So, just take my advice for it

28
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,500
and go ahead and install VirtualBox.

29
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,800
It's not that complicated.

30
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,600
It's pretty simple.

31
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll show you how to do it in a minute.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There's another reason why we're installing a virtual machine

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,540
and that is safety.

34
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,600
We're gonna be downloading a lot of stuff from the net

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,759
and even though I will be using sites that I consider to be safe

36
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,000
and that a lot of other people consider
to be safe

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,130
it is always good to have that extra layer of protection.

38
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,840
So even if something happens and your virtual machine

39
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,549
even if it gets compromised or something of a kind, it's fine.

40
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:57,800
It's a virtual machine

41
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,700
No problems there.

42
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,300
There's nothing of importance there.

43
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,500
Your private information is not there.

44
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,149
Your credit card is not there.

45
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:09,500
There is literally nothing there aside from the tools that you are using

46
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,950
that can be obtained from the internet.

47
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,700
Anyway

48
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,370
So, without further adieu

49
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,000
let's just go ahead and see how VirtualBox is installed.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,080
Now there are two ways of doing this.

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,100
One is preferable over the other.

52
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,250
So the first method is a lot simpler.

53
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,050
So you can just go ahead and open up your favorite browser.

54
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,700
Mine is Firefox.

55
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,200
Use your favorite search engine.

56
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:45,000
Type in "VirtualBox"

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,820
Press enter

58
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,000
and there you go!

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Straight off the bat!

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,300
You have official site - VirtualBox.

61
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,200
Just gonna go ahead and open it.

62
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,400
In the left corner, it says "About", "Screenshots"

63
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,100
There's a ton load of documentation here.

64
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,500
For the time being, there really isn't any need to go over it.

65
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,230
Rather instead, just click "downloads"

66
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,100
Excellent

67
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,700
So here you have a list of host machines.

68
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,310
You have "VirtualBox for Windows hosts", for "OS X hosts"

69
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,000
for "Linux hosts", "Solaris hosts"...

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,100
Actually for Solaris, you can just use it from repositories immediately

71
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,700
but for the time being, we cannot use the repositories.

72
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,800
We need to configure them in Linux

73
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,400
and repositories in Linux are places

74
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,930
from where you pull your software for your Linux distro.

75
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:42,000
Anyway, we will need VirtualBox for Linux hosts.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,700
I have already downloaded it in order to save time in this tutorial

77
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,640
but you just click on it, and then it
pops.

78
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,100
So you have

79
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,000
These guys are amazing

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,360
They have this virtual machine manager setup

81
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,500
for multiple Linux distributions.

82
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,000
So you have Ubuntu

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,959
You have Debian

84
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,900
Not sure why they actually separated Ubuntu and Debian

85
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,400
but it doesn't really matter since Ubuntu is based on Debian.

86
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,200
Pretty much everything that works in Debian will work on Ubuntu as well.

87
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,760
You have openSUSE

88
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,900
Wow, you even have Enterprise

89
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,000
but for the time being, I am interested in Fedora

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,200
and even though Fedora 21 came out

91
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,660
and it says here Fedora 18

92
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,520
that's perfectly fine.

93
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,900
It's gonna run. No problems.

94
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,600
Anyway, right next to it

95
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,000
you have i386 and AMD64.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,200
What do these marcations mean?

97
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Well basically, they're just references to 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.

98
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,000
If you do not know what your machine is

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,100
whether it's 32-bit or 64-bit

100
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,600
well, no problems there.

101
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,970
Just go ahead and open up your terminal

102
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,800
Type in "uname -a"

103
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,900
Press "Enter"

104
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,300
You don't need to be root to do this.

105
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,400
You do this as pretty much any user

106
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,800
and you get a listing of information here.

107
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,000
So you have Linux platform

108
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,200
localhost

109
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,400
That's the domain.

110
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,000
You have the version of the kernel

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,690
and Fedora distribution as well.

112
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,000
It's number 20

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and then you have the architecture.

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,100
So it's X86_64

115
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,700
There we go.

116
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,600
64-bit architecture.

117
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,700
Fantastic

118
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,700
Now that we have established that, we can

119
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,800
you can actually go ahead and click on it.

120
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,200
If you're using a 32-bit one

121
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,800
just click on the 32-bit one.

122
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,500
The procedure is absolutely the same.

123
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,000
There are literally no differences.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,349
It gives me an option to save a file.

125
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,800
So just click "Save" and then click "Okay"

126
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,400
That will download the file for you in the default downloads folder

127
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,550
unless you configured it in a different fashion.

128
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,800
I'm just gonna go ahead and cancel it

129
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,840
because as I said, I downloaded it previously

130
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,700
in order to save some time in this
tutorial.

131
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,500
Just cancel

132
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,300
Go back to your terminal.

133
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,010
Now clear the screen.

134
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,530
You will need to be root in order to
do this.

135
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,820
So just type in "SU", press "Enter, and type in your password

136
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,600
and of course I got my password wrong.

137
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,900
I'm quite famous for doing this.

138
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,620
I don't know why

139
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,400
but it's fine when I forget my passwords.

140
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,129
When I forget my encryption keys, that can be a bit of a problem

141
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:37,300
anyway there is a tool for managing RPM packets

142
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,610
as this is a Red Hat distro.

143
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,000
All the packets

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,659
software packets for it

145
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:46,959
I have an extension - ".rpm"

146
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,500
Here, let me just go ahead and show this to you.

147
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,059
I'm going to to go ahead and create a bigger zoom in

148
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:55,600
so you can all see what I am doing here.

149
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,800
Now, I am currently using the terminal

150
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,500
and I will give more detailed explanations.

151
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,569
I will instruct you in how to use it.

152
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:06,889
I will explain pretty much all the commands that we will be using

153
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:07,800
in great detail

154
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,000
but for the time being, just tune in and follow through.

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,619
So there's a command "ls"

156
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:18,300
and then I want to go to the folder
downloads

157
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,800
Home

158
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,100
Chronic -- That's me. That's the username.

159
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,000
Downloads

160
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and VirtualBox. There we go.

161
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,959
Press "Enter"

162
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,800
I'm just gonna go ahead and clear screen one more time.

163
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,000
There we go.

164
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,700
Got exactly the same thing but a better look.

165
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,179
Anyway, you see this extension that I have marked?

166
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:42,100
It says ".rpm"

167
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,919
Now ".rpm" represents a type of packet that I stated previously

168
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,309
that is meant specifically for certain
Linux distributions

169
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:54,900
such as Red Hat, Fedora, Syntax, and a few others.

170
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:00,100
What you can do is use your default RPM software.

171
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,600
So just type in "rpm -i"

172
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,600
"-i" argument is for installed

173
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,500
and then specify the path of your packet.

174
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:17,300
So home/Chronic/Downloads/VirtualBox

175
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,679
and press Enter from here.

176
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:21,700
Now again, this process is automated.

177
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,300
There isn't much that you need to do here.

178
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,900
Maybe press "Yes" and that's it along the way

179
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,729
but in any case, this is not the method that you should be using.

180
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:33,200
This is a method that I'm showing that
you CAN use

181
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,100
but I wouldn't advise, as if you do install it like this

182
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,700
it tends to break with newer updates

183
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,229
so it can be a bit problematic.

184
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:43,000
I will show you another method in the next tutorial

185
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
where you can actually use "yum", which is a default packet manager.

186
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,700
in order to install this packet

187
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,200
and then update it accordingly.

188
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,400
In any case, I bid you farewell

189
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,230
and I'll see you in the next tutorial, where I'll pick this up.
