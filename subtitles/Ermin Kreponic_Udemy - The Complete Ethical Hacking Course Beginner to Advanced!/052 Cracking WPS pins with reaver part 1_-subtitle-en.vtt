00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.210

Hello, everybody, and
welcome to this tutorial.



2

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.690

Today I will show you
another brute forcing method.



3

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.580

Primarily because the one that
I showed you previously does



4

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.640

require you to gather some information
previous, prior to the attack itself.



5

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.169

Primarily because you cannot
perform a brute force attack for



6

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:27.000

every possible combination out there for
the VPA2 passkey.



7

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.330

Why?
Well, simply because you have too many of



8

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.090

them to try, and
you don't have enough processing power.



9

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.230

The best you could do is combine,
let's say the best home user could



10

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.530

do is combine pretty much all
the devices that they have in the house,



11

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.060

for example, your smartphone,
a tablet, the laptop and a computer.



12

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.180

And you could combine the processing
power of all of those devices and



13

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.700

basically distribute the decryption
cracking onto all of those devices.



14

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:06.974

However, even then you would
still find it very difficult and



15

00:01:06.974 --> 00:01:11.620

you would still have way too
many computations to deal with.



16

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.602

Again, you have online services,
you can rent service to do this, but



17

00:01:14.602 --> 00:01:18.540

that costs money, and [LAUGH] yeah,
it's not easy to come by these days.



18

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.600

Anyway, do not despair.



19

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.910

There is no reason to panic or
anything of the kind.



20

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.410

I know that the previous method
is somewhat difficult and it does



21

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.290

require you to actually go out there and
gather some information on your own.



22

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.540

However, this method that
I am about to show you



23

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.590

doesn't require you to gather
much information at all.



24

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.080

Basically, what somebody has
come up with is this extremely



25

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.780

stupid idea of PIN authentication for
wireless networks.



26

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.290

And there is a major flaw in it.



27

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.540

First of all,
PIN authentication only has numbers.



28

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.080

Which dramatically reduces
the amount of combinations possible.



29

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.460

Namely, there are only
11,000 combinations.



30

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.480

And considering that the reverb splits
the length of the PIN code in two.



31

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.930

Once it finds the first half,
finding the second half gets a lot easier.



32

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.020

So you don't even need to do.



33

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.610

In all likelihood you won't actually need
to do all 11,000 combinations at all.



34

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.840

Now if you have watched the previous
tutorial you have seen that I can do maybe



35

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.208

1700 up to perhaps 2K passwords



36

00:02:34.208 --> 00:02:39.020

a second or two key attempts per second.



37

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.905

You would think that oh well,



38

00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:46.960

11,000 possibilities, not much at all,
probably less than ten seconds.



39

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.010

It would be over.



40

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.110

However that is not the case
because the sort of



41

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.960

attack if we're going to perform now.



42

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.850

This is not,
we're not gonna be doing it locally,



43

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.190

we're not gonna be doing
it on the machine itself.



44

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.740

Itself like we will have a file that we
will be able to use our processor to crack



45

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.840

the encryption of that file, rather
instead we will be doing this remotely.



46

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.420

So we will come into the range
of a wireless access point and



47

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.080

then we will attempt to attack that
wireless access point by passing it in,



48

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.060

by trying to pass PIN codes.



49

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:29.320

And if any them works out we're gonna
get a response from the revert software.



50

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.620

And it will basically tell us,
what is the pass code,



51

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.590

what is the VPA2 preshared key for
that particular access point.



52

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.480

The downside of it all is that most of
the routers these days, even though they,



53

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.640

the brilliant router manufacturers
have actually decided



54

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.640

to put PIN authentication to be enabled by
default on most of the routers out there.



55

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.870

They did, fortunately,
put a preventive measure which is



56

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.953

the router itself basically locks.



57

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:08.645

After you've passed the incorrect
PIN several times, it will lock and



58

00:04:08.645 --> 00:04:10.985

it will not allow any PIN authentication
of whatsoever to go on for



59

00:04:10.985 --> 00:04:12.405

a certain period of time.



60

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:15.605

Usually maybe an hour or
something of a kind.



61

00:04:17.075 --> 00:04:18.917

You can immediately deduce from this.



62

00:04:18.917 --> 00:04:23.970

This leaves possibilities for
numerous DOS attacks and



63

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.692

all you would have to do is authenticate
falsely a couple of times and



64

00:04:28.692 --> 00:04:32.590

PIN authentication will be disabled for
pretty much anybody there.



65

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.740

And there are a good amount of networks
out there who rely primarily and



66

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.800

only on PIN authentication,
why I have no idea.



67

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.790

So without further ado, let me,
I have showed in the previous



68

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.920

tutorials if you don't have Reaver
installed how to install it.



69

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.730

But in this particular one I'm
gonna just go ahead and use it.



70

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.920

I won't do any of the installation



71

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.010

procedures because they're already
done in the previous tutorials.



72

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.720

So just go ahead and
type in reaver -- help, and



73

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.693

you will get a ton load of options.



74

00:05:03.693 --> 00:05:07.300

I mean maybe not the ton load but
certainly a good amount of options.



75

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.520

We will be using some of them,



76

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.490

more likely than not when dealing
with different kinds of routers.



77

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.050

You will be required to
use some of these options,



78

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.300

use some of these arguments
primarily because yeah,



79

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.900

different routers have
different configurations.



80

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.920

And you want to be able to hide your
attacks or to mask yourself somehow.



81

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.800

Not because you are gonna get detected or



82

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.820

something like that because
it's not likely that



83

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.710

anybody can actually track you down if
you are attacking wireless access point.



84

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.580

Provided of course you are not
authenticated with it.



85

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.028

If you are not authenticated with
the wireless access point, and



86

00:05:46.028 --> 00:05:50.150

if you're just attacking it like this
wireless radio or something of a kind.



87

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.500

Basically there is almost
no way to detect you.



88

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.940

There is no way to find your physical
location or to identify you.



89

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.070

Sure, your MAC address will
probably show somewhere.



90

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.500

But what do you care?



91

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.940

All you need to do,
as I stated in the previous tutorial,



92

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.770

is type macchanger and change it.



93

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:10.750

No problems.



94

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.270

If you don't know how to change the Mac
address, just go back to tutorial 242 and



95

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:21.810

you will a tutorial called Mac or
Mac Changing or something of that kind.



96

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.110

It will have the word Mac in it, M-A-C.



97

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.220

And there, I have explained in great
detail how you can actually hide your



98

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.300

Mac address without any sort
of problems whatsoever.



99

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.890

The primary things that
we're gonna be using today,



100

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.290

the primary arguments,
that is, is i interface.



101

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:45.200

And we will of course need the bssid,
or MAC, of the target access point.



102

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.860

Before we do that,



103

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.420

as before with aircrack-mg we do
need to do a couple of things.



104

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.516

We need to set the mode
of our network cards.



105

00:06:52.516 --> 00:06:54.640

So, I'm not gonna go into great detail,



106

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.140

how to do it here because I have
explained it in previous tutorials.



107

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.400

Here I'm just gonna do it and hopefully
you will be able to follow through.



108

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.390

If not just go back a tutorial or
two and see,



109

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.250

I have given detailed explanations there.



110

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.190

So just type in ifconfig.



111

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:14.947

Type in the name of your
wireless access card,



112

00:07:14.947 --> 00:07:21.707

and bring it down,
operation not permitted,



113

00:07:21.707 --> 00:07:25.761

I'm not root, of course.



114

00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:33.462

[SOUND] Okay, I always love my passwords
primarily because of their length.



115

00:07:33.462 --> 00:07:38.830

I sometimes tend to forget them
which is infinitely interesting.



116

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.220

But there you go,
I've managed to type it in, and



117

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:45.305

it's actually a good thing that I haven't
managed to login just yet as route.



118

00:07:45.305 --> 00:07:47.445

Because I have my router
opened here which I set up for



119

00:07:47.445 --> 00:07:50.765

the testing purposes of
this particular tutorial.



120

00:07:50.765 --> 00:07:54.990

And you can see the current PIN,
I mean these PINs can be generated,



121

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.305

these PINS are generated at random.



122

00:07:57.305 --> 00:07:59.465

So you can see the length of the PIN and



123

00:07:59.465 --> 00:08:02.355

you can see the PIN here I can say
generate new PIN let's see what happens.



124

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.389

The change for
this config will not take, yeah.



125

00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:07.960

Okay.
So it will not take effect until



126

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.790

the device reboots.



127

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.890

But here you can see
the length of the PIN.



128

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:16.820

So it's like one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, only eight digits.



129

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.940

And if I do it again it's
gonna be eight again.



130

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.550

So one, two, three, five, six, seven.



131

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.160

Oops, sorry, not eight.



132

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:25.800

It's gonna be nine.



133

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.230

Is it nine?



134

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.500

One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.



135

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.180

Sorry, no, it's gonna be eight again.



136

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.590

It's always going to be eight,
so no problems there.



137

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.040

You know the length of the PIN,



138

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:41.920

which dramatically decreases the amount
of possible combinations as well.



139

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.150

Depending on what sort
of a router you have,



140

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:48.730

the PIN can be at different
places in the router.



141

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.710

I can't explain it for
every individual router,



142

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.670

but you can find it in the manual or
something like that.



143

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:58.470

Just open up a web interface for
your router by typing in the IP address.



144

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.960

If you want to know what the IP address
of your router is on a Linux system,



145

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.820

that is very easy to do.



146

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:11.530

You can just type in route, press enter
and this might take a bit of time.



147

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.620

I'm not exactly sure why is it taking so
long.



148

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.595

Primarily because I'm not
connected to the network.



149

00:09:16.595 --> 00:09:19.720

Okay, so I have config this another way.



150

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.920

But here, it would say Gateway,
and where it says Gateway,



151

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.300

that would be the default
address of your router.



152

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.850

However, that is the default Gateway.



153

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.390

That does not necessarily need to
be the IP address of the router you



154

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.820

are connected to.



155

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.130

So, type in ifconfig.



156

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.440

This is a foolproof way of getting
the IP address of the router,



157

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.660

much better than the previous one.



158

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.070

And I want to get the IP address of the
router to which my wireless access point



159

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.170

is associated with.



160

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:54.100

So wlp2s0, press Enter, and there we go.



161

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.280

I have an IP address here.



162

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.105

Okay, let's just clear this up a bit.



163

00:09:58.105 --> 00:09:59.860

[SOUND] Clear.



164

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:04.639

I want to get a bit of a better picture,
grab iNet.



165

00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:06.850

Excellent.



166

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:10.050

So I have iNet here, and
this is the Internet address.



167

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:10.940

But this is my local address.



168

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:15.598

It's not to be used for
external purposes at all.



169

00:10:15.598 --> 00:10:22.702

It's 192.168.0.102, and
the difference between your wired and



170

00:10:22.702 --> 00:10:27.240

wireless connection is
usually this digit here.



171

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.905

For wired it's one and
for wireless it's zero and



172

00:10:29.905 --> 00:10:33.090

then you have a list of
hosts which are here.



173

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:36.390

Anyway, my IP address in my local area



174

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:41.250

network that my wireless
interface has is 192.168.0.102.



175

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:47.100

The lowest possible IP address within this



176

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.520

range with only the last
octet changing is .0.



177

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.220

So, from zero to 255, and
the lowest one would be zero.



178

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:58.300

But you cannot use zero because
that is the network address.



179

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.720

So what you do is find the lowest
one here, which is zero.



180

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:06.370

Plus one and that's gonna give you the IP
address of your router, very simple.



181

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.500

And you can see that is exactly
what I've typed in here.



182

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.070

It's 192.168.0.1.



183

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:15.370

So just find the lowest one which is
zero of course then add one which is



184

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.750

going to be the IP address of the router.



185

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.530

Anyway, now that that is out of the way,



186

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.250

I've showed you how you can
check it out here, the PIN code.



187

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.746

But, this interface will differ
from one router to another,



188

00:11:28.746 --> 00:11:29.808

please keep that in mind.



189

00:11:29.808 --> 00:11:33.560

So, this is not a general explanation for
all of the routers out there.



190

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.120

But, it's fairly simple to find a PIN
code on your own home router without



191

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.330

any bigger difficulties.



192

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.280

Just go ahead and
login to it via web interface as I said,



193

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.940

just type in the address here, you will
be prompted for login credentials.



194

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.960

Usually it's adminadmin if
you haven't changed anything.



195

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.860

If it's not, go ahead and
contact your ISP provider and



196

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.670

ask them to provide the username and
password for you.



197

00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:01.564

Assuming that it's not locked,
if it's locked, you've gotta break it,



198

00:12:01.564 --> 00:12:06.015

but I will show you how you can break
routers in the tutorials to come.



199

00:12:06.015 --> 00:12:08.297

In any case,
let's just go back to the subject here.



200

00:12:08.297 --> 00:12:10.046

Now I am root.



201

00:12:10.046 --> 00:12:12.116

Let's take down my wireless interface.



202

00:12:12.116 --> 00:12:17.449

IfConfig, vlp2s0 down.



203

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:25.180

And now I need ivconfig
wlp2s0 mode monitor.



204

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:32.602

Excellent, so ifconfig wlp2s0 up.



205

00:12:32.602 --> 00:12:33.760

There we go.



206

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.730

You can make a neat short script.



207

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:40.580

The best script which has
these commands listed and



208

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.060

that could be a fantastic way to do this.



209

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.230

You would effectively save
yourselves a lot of time there.



210

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.810

Go ahead and clear the screen.



211

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:52.460

And you see it says connection to
something, it has been deactivated.



212

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:56.830

Because my wireless interface has
now been brought down and up and



213

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.410

on top of that, it's in monitor mode.



214

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.550

Now, there was a program which I've
used in the previous tutorial,



215

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:06.670

which is a part of the air crack
packaged It's called Airmon.



216

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:11.746

Airmon-ng and I want to check vlp2s0 for



217

00:13:11.746 --> 00:13:14.710

any possible problems.



218

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.060

I have explained this in
the previous tutorial,



219

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.795

why am I doing this and how is this done.



220

00:13:19.795 --> 00:13:24.734

So airmon-ng check vlp2s0,
of course your wireless interface



221

00:13:24.734 --> 00:13:29.770

name will probably not be the same if
you're not using the same OS as I am.



222

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.550

But just substitute it
with whatever it is.



223

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.110

No problems there.



224

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.320

In the previous tutorials
I've also stated that.



225

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.780

Here we have a list of problems,
as I like to call them.



226

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.190

These are lists of primary problems
as a network manager because its



227

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.840

generating a lot of
the other things up here.



228

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:52.670

So we'll just go ahead and kill them,
13133, I gotta kill them one



229

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:58.273

by one because they
are spawning one another and



230

00:13:58.273 --> 00:14:02.934

that can be problematic.



231

00:14:02.934 --> 00:14:07.830

So, kill 2498,
even if you are root they can give you



232

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:12.190

a ton load of problems primarily because
as I said they are spawning one another.



233

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:14.710

That can be just such
an unbelievable drag.



234

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.110

Excellent.
Now I have,



235

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.980

let me just clear the screen again.



236

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:24.260

Now I have ran the check once again to
make sure that I don't have any problems.



237

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.740

If you are afraid that you
will kill something that



238

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.590

you don't want to kill in terms
of networking, don't worry.



239

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:33.110

Anything from that list will
auto generate pretty much,



240

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:37.290

the moment you re-initiate
your network manager.



241

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:41.120

You can just type in the service
NetworkManager restart.



242

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.770

And all those processes will be generated.



243

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:49.000

If you don't wanna do this you
can just reboot the machine and



244

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.880

you will have pretty much the same effect,
no problems.



245

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.020

Let's go ahead and clear the screen.



246

00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:00.780

Before I actually start using reaver,
which we have installed previously.



247

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:04.190

I do need to check for
wireless connections within my area and



248

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:08.850

I do need to check whether they are
vulnerable, very important thing to do.



249

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.830

And that I will do in
the follow up tutorial.



250

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:18.530

We will use the wash command in order
to find these wireless access points.



251

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.392

Until then, farewell, and
I hope to see you there.
