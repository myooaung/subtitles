1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everybody and welcome to visit tutorial.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Today I will do as I promised in the previous one.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:13,000
We will do a bit of scripting and we will see how that works to our advantage.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,500
Now a client might try to hide

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,700
so if you wish to some sort of a long-term wireless denial of service attack

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,700
you will want to be vigilant.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,800
You will need to monitor the status of the network

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,200
You will need to see when the MAC addresses are changed

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,800
when the ESSIDs are changed

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,239
when channels are changed, and so on and so forth.

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,400
Now these things, you can do to manually.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,100
You can do them with scripts.

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,000
The choice is entirely yours.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,800
I can't go into bash scripting here, because that would be a course for itself

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,600
but I will show you some of the basics and what you can do with bash scripts.

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,900
I mean, they're very powerful.

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,200
You can do a lot with them.

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,800
You can automate most of your tasks

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,219
and on top of that, we need to see how we can deauthenticate particular clients

20
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:04,800
on the network.

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,200
So I didn't change anything.

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,700
So I'm still in monitor mode, if I'm not mistaken.

23
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,800
So I'm just gonna go ahead from the previous tutorial, that is.

24
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm just gonna go ahead and type in "airodump -ng wlp2s0"

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and then I press this.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,200
I have my network here, so I'm just gonna go ahead and take its MAC addresses

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,500
and I want to do a more precise scan

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,600
So here's what I will do --

29
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,600
I'll do "airodump -ng --BSSID"

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,000
which will be the MAC address of this of this access point

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,500
and I can also specify a channel with "--channel"

32
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
but I don't really want to do that.

33
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,250
I just want to scan for this MAC address and see.

34
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,000
That way I'll  know if the channel changes.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,850
The scan is now in progress.

36
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,100
At some point of time, I'm sure I'll get a client here or something of a kind.

37
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,600
Let me just deauthenticate it and deauthenticate it in my cell phone.

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm just gonna turn wireless on and off and then I should get the signal

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
because there is no activity.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,190
If I was browsing the net on my phone or something like that

41
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,000
It would show it immediately, but I have not doing anything

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,200
and there we go.

43
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,440
Simple authentication will show transition of packets

44
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,200
between the BSSID of 90:F6:52:C1:BB:18

45
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,320
and the station is basically a device

46
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,000
which is connected to that particular access point

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now I will go ahead and stop this here

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,300
and before I continue, you can see in the upper left corner

49
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,000
it says channel 6

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,940
and you have seen that these channels changed

51
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,500
I mean, it's been going from 1 to 14 if I'm not mistaken

52
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,700
and when these channels here change

53
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,400
your wireless network card is put into these functions

54
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,500
in accordance with these channels, and functions on these frequencies.

55
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,190
So that might disrupt it, and for a DoS attack

56
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,600
you might need to manually reconfigure your wireless network card.

57
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,400
As I've showed you before, just use iwconfig

58
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,500
and set it to whatever channel you want.

59
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,700
Anyway, client, as I said

60
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,000
can change the MAC address

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
it can change the BSSID

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,700
it can change even the encryption method

63
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,400
and can change the channel.

64
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,000
So how can you know for sure if somebody changes all three of these

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,200
if somebody changed the channel of the MAC address and the BSSID

66
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,000
how can you figure out what access point are you going to continue DoS'ing

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,700
because you might have like a hundred of them of something of a kind

68
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,500
that you captured with this airodump -ng packet

69
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,700
how will you figure it out?

70
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,900
Well, simple

71
00:03:52,900 --> 00:04:01,500
Same clients will be authenticated with the same networks.

72
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,570
So even if the BSSID name changes

73
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:15,000
even if I can change it something 1,2,3,4,5 or whatever

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
all of these parameters change the clients

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,700
which are authenticated to that access point

76
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,500
will not change.

77
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,500
I suppose theoretically, somebody could go ahead

78
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,200
and change the MAC addresses of every single device

79
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
connected to that access point taxes point

80
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,200
but think of the following scenario --

81
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,600
You're a company or you're in a coffee shop or something like that

82
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,200
you cannot go around changing everybody's MAC addresses

83
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,800
on everybody's devices.

84
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,000
No way

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,380
So the first time around

86
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,000
see which clients are authenticated to a particular access point

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and then do a general airodump-ng like this

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,200
Do a general sweep like this

89
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,000
and then you will see the authenticated clients down below.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,900
You will be able to see down below

91
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,780
who are the clients that are authenticated to that particular network

92
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,440
and in such a way, you will figure out the new MAC address

93
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,000
and the new channel, the newest BSSID

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,400
and the DoS attack will be able to proceed.

95
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,600
So as I said before, there really is no stopping it

96
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,800
there is only hiding from it.

97
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,500
So just go ahead and clear

98
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,800
and I have a very nice bash script here, which I want to show you.

99
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,900
Well, it's not very nice but it does the job

100
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,440
So this is a bash script

101
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,600
and this is an infinite loop.

102
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,400
It will perform until I cancel it manually as a user.

103
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,200
So let's just go briefly over it it.

104
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,800
It says "aireplay -ng  -0 5"

105
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,000
So I want to send five deauthentication signals...packets

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,500
and then "-a" to this MAC address from this interface.

107
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,900
Next up, Windows 5

108
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,800
the authentication packets have been sent.

109
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,200
I want you to bring the interface down.

110
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,900
So go ahead and bring the interface down.

111
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,600
Use MAC changer

112
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,500
Change the MAC address of the interface to random.

113
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,300
So randomly change MAC addresses of my wireless interface.

114
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:40,000
Just print out the "New Mac" so I know that something is happening

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,800
and then I want you to reconfigure the mode of the wireless interface

116
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,700
to monitor again.

117
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,500
Bring it back up

118
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:56,000
Tell me that the mode is monitor when you grep it, in order to confirm it.

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Go ahead and sleep for three seconds.

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
While your sleeping, echo waiting

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't know, I just wrote this down for some strange reason.

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,200
Anyway, what you can modify here

123
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,200
you can modify the sleep timer

124
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,800
so you can go to sleep for relatively larger shorter periods of time

125
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,900
depending on how you wish to perform this DoS attack.

126
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:30,400
Over here, you can read values from a file

127
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,570
where you have a list of access points

128
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,000
which to jam at particular time intervals.

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,800
That's a bit more of a complex bash scripting method

130
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,400
If you're interested, feel free to pose it in the question sections

131
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,900
but you do need to have a certain knowledge of bash in order to do that.

132
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,900
In any case, there are some of the things that I would like you to try

133
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,000
and play around with.

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,700
If you succeed, good

135
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,000
If not, feel free to post it in the question sections.

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,200
I will be more than happy to help you out.

137
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,300
Anyway, as I said, you can have a list of MAC addresses here

138
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:15,400
that is loaded from some file that you previously created

139
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:22,700
and you can jam particular wireless access points in certain time intervals.

140
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,200
When you do that, you will also need a command down below

141
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,200
in order to change to the appropriate channel

142
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,000
because you will also need to know the channels of those access points.

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So "iwconfig wlp2s0 channel"

144
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and then you will need to specify a channel name here, so 7 or 3 or 1

145
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,400
Excellent

146
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,500
So not a bad idea.

147
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,160
You can increase the effectiveness of your wireless jamming.

148
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,000
You can effectively basically jam your entire neighborhood

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,500
which I definitely do not recommend, as that is illegal

150
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,910
but people have been known to do it.

151
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,800
I mean, somebody somewhere figures out how to do it

152
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,000
and is genius enough to actually attempt it.

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
There's literally no gain in it.

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,200
It's just annoying to the neighbors, I suppose

155
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,780
but anyway, as I said, you can change the time intervals.

156
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,800
That's not a bad idea at all

157
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Feel free to play around with this as much as you want

158
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,400
with this part here in the loop

159
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,300
and if you come up with any new ideas or something of a kind

160
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,800
feel free to post them in the discussion section.

161
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,500
I will be more than happy to take a look at it

162
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,200
and see what you have done on your own

163
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,230
because that is really one of the best ways you can learn something.

164
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,530
Anyway, let's just go ahead and apply the script and see what happens.

165
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,300
No, I do not wish to save any changes.

166
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,000
Anyway, before you can run a script

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:13,000
you need to do "chnod +x jam.sh"

168
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,200
and I'm just gonna type in "jam.sh"

169
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,000
and see, I am again on the wrong channel

170
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
"Waiting for beacon frame"

171
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,360
"on channel 7"

172
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,000
"wlp2s0 is on channel 7, but the AP uses channel 6"

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,650
Excellent

174
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,150
So this actually even tells you what channel is the wireless access points.

175
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:36,500
actually even tells you one what channel is D is the wireless access points.

176
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:45,700
So "iwconfig wlp2s0 channel 6"

177
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,100
and now we can begin the jamming process.

178
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,700
Excellent

179
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,600
So you see here, it send five of the deauthentication attempts.

180
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,400
The one that I have selected.

181
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,800
and then it changes the MAC address to something.

182
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't know...unknown

183
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,800
and then it brings monitor mode back up again.

184
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,900
It says "Waiting"

185
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,500
When it says waiting, it's sleeping for three seconds

186
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,930
or something of a kind.

187
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,400
Whatever you write down

188
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,000
and you see the process is just going to repeat itself on end

189
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,300
pretty much until you shut the computer down

190
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:22,800
or until you terminate the process by killing the pid or just pressing CTRL C

191
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,600
Not a bad way to deauthenticate at all

192
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:36,500
but there is another thing that you can do.

193
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,600
So "airodump"

194
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,500
and you can use airodump in combination with airmon

195
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,700
but there is a trick to it.

196
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,200
You have to manually configure the channel for airodump -ng

197
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,700
so it doesn't change the channel.

198
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,800
If it changes the channel

199
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,000
your deauthentication attempts will not go through.

200
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,800
"Channel 6", press ENTER

201
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,400
Excellent

202
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,300
Now it's permanently scanning on channel 6

203
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,700
and you are able to monitor any and all changes that take place here.

204
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,000
So for example, if there are some changes that take place

205
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,700
you notice them and you can implement them elsewhere

206
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,000
and by that, I mean if you simply lose this wireless

207
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
if you no longer see it

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,200
perhaps the channel has been changed

209
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,000
or the BSSID has been changed...

210
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,710
Ha! Great. I even got the handshake here. Amazing

211
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:35,800
Oh no...I'm not actually not even performing the deauthentication.

212
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,200
I just got a handshake

213
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,500
It doesn't matter

214
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,000
Anyway, if you lose it

215
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,840
cancel it and do a general sweep without the BSSID specified

216
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,600
and without the channel specified

217
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,590
but you can also try just with the BSSID specified

218
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,200
and with the channel not specified

219
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
because somebody could have just changed the channel

220
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,700
and BSSID could have remained the same.

221
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:09,400
and I'm gonna use the jam.sh, which starts up aireplay

222
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,900
in conjunction with basically airodump.

223
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,300
So I can monitor the status

224
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,000
and what is going on here?

225
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,200
In addition to that, I can actually jam the signal as well

226
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,900
and even though it says that this station is actually deauthenticated with it

227
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,330
believe me, on my android phone or whatever this is

228
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:36,200
I would not be able to browse the internet.

229
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,400
There is no way

230
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,300
I would be continuously deauthenticated.

231
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,000
It would be impossible for me to even open up a basic website

232
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,100
That would be beyond the abilities of the device.

233
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,800
As I said before, you can actually use your own phones

234
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,300
you can use your own tablets or whatever other devices

235
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,600
in order to confirm this

236
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,200
but you can see that these tools can work parallel to each other

237
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
no problems

238
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,000
as long as you...

239
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,700
You cannot tell your wireless card to function on several channels at once.

240
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,000
At least I don't know how to do that.

241
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Maybe you can somewhere on the net.

242
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,290
They definitely can be at the same time.

243
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,000
They can be modulated

244
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,720
but you cannot have them running at the same time.

245
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,000
So you do need to adjust the parameters a little bit

246
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,400
and then you can use several of these tools at once.

247
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,000
You can monitor the status, you can jam it

248
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,300
you can even get a wpl2 handshake or something like that

249
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,960
and it says here interface is down

250
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,000
because I have brought it down.

251
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,400
Anyway, thank you for watching

252
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,900
and I hope to see you in the next tutorial.

253
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,200
Until then, I bid you farewell

254
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,300
and I urge you to try to do things on your own as much as you can

255
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,600
as that is absolutely the best way to learn,

256
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,800
Okay, so let me just do a quick show here.

257
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:10,600
"clear" and "nano jam.sh"

258
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,700
Excellent

259
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,900
So instead of actually doing a general deauthentication here

260
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,000
you are also able to do this

261
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,400
So space "-c" for client

262
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,100
and I'm just gonna stop this right now.

263
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,209
I'm gonna take this client

264
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:28,100
So just take the MAC address of this client

265
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,700
where it says C paste it

266
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,800
CTRL O to save, CTRLX to exit

267
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,000
and I wish to run, jam

268
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,200
Excellent

269
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,800
It says "Sending 64 directed DeAuth."

270
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,000
blah blah blah whatever

271
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,900
This is all verbose output from the program.

272
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,890
That's all that it is

273
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:59,480
and it says which client in specific is it actually deauthenticating.

274
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,000
That can be

275
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,500
I'm gonna do airodump -ng channel 6

276
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,200
Okay, it says "interface wlp2s0 down"

277
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,100
Okay, so sometimes it's not gonna actually work out, as I said before

278
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,000
primarily because I'm bringing the interface down

279
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,600
but the scanning is actually in progress

280
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,500
and even though the station might show here as actually connected

281
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,000
or something of a kind

282
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,400
try browsing the net, as I said before.

283
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,510
Try doing anything with it on the internet.

284
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,000
You won't be able literally to move

285
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,800
because nothing will be able to pass through.

286
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,600
That's gonna be a pretty big problem.

287
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,600
As I said before, you can confirm this with any of your devices.

288
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,500
You won't be able to do anything with them.

289
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,800
I just wanted to show you can actually jam a particular client

290
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,800
You can also set the rotations here to, I don't know

291
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
jam a particular client for awhile

292
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,000
and then jam a different one for awhile

293
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,800
Again, you can have a list of clients here

294
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,179
and load them up from the files, so they can modulate.

295
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:07,800
You're jamming this client for five minutes

296
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,700
for the next five minutes, the next one

297
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,900
and so on and so

298
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,200
in such a way creating a bit of a chaotic situation.

299
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:21,400
Anyway, I strongly urge you to try.

300
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,200
You don't need to practice, but just try to do something on your own.

301
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,900
Try to alter the code

302
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:32,000
Try to jam something you have permission to jam

303
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,600
and try to do it in a bit of a different way.

304
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,800
Apply some other arguments

305
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,000
Play around with things

306
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
There really isn't much that you can break here

307
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
especially if you doing it on your own wireless

308
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
that you have a permission to do it on

309
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,740
and that is really the best possible way to learn

310
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:52,200
but in any case gonna be you farewell now

311
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,000
and I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
