1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,210
Hello, everybody, and
welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,690
Today I will show you
another brute forcing method.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,580
Primarily because the one that
I showed you previously does

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,640
require you to gather some information
previous, prior to the attack itself.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,169
Primarily because you cannot
perform a brute force attack for

6
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:27,000
every possible combination out there for
the VPA2 passkey.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,330
Why?
Well, simply because you have too many of

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,090
them to try, and
you don't have enough processing power.

9
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:38,230
The best you could do is combine,
let's say the best home user could

10
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:43,530
do is combine pretty much all
the devices that they have in the house,

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,060
for example, your smartphone,
a tablet, the laptop and a computer.

12
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:53,180
And you could combine the processing
power of all of those devices and

13
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:58,700
basically distribute the decryption
cracking onto all of those devices.

14
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:06,974
However, even then you would
still find it very difficult and

15
00:01:06,974 --> 00:01:11,620
you would still have way too
many computations to deal with.

16
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,602
Again, you have online services,
you can rent service to do this, but

17
00:01:14,602 --> 00:01:18,540
that costs money, and [LAUGH] yeah,
it's not easy to come by these days.

18
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,600
Anyway, do not despair.

19
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,910
There is no reason to panic or
anything of the kind.

20
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:27,410
I know that the previous method
is somewhat difficult and it does

21
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,290
require you to actually go out there and
gather some information on your own.

22
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,540
However, this method that
I am about to show you

23
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,590
doesn't require you to gather
much information at all.

24
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,080
Basically, what somebody has
come up with is this extremely

25
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,780
stupid idea of PIN authentication for
wireless networks.

26
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,290
And there is a major flaw in it.

27
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,540
First of all,
PIN authentication only has numbers.

28
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:01,080
Which dramatically reduces
the amount of combinations possible.

29
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,460
Namely, there are only
11,000 combinations.

30
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:10,480
And considering that the reverb splits
the length of the PIN code in two.

31
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,930
Once it finds the first half,
finding the second half gets a lot easier.

32
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,020
So you don't even need to do.

33
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:24,610
In all likelihood you won't actually need
to do all 11,000 combinations at all.

34
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,840
Now if you have watched the previous
tutorial you have seen that I can do maybe

35
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,208
1700 up to perhaps 2K passwords

36
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:39,020
a second or two key attempts per second.

37
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,905
You would think that oh well,

38
00:02:41,905 --> 00:02:46,960
11,000 possibilities, not much at all,
probably less than ten seconds.

39
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,010
It would be over.

40
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,110
However that is not the case
because the sort of

41
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,960
attack if we're going to perform now.

42
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,850
This is not,
we're not gonna be doing it locally,

43
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,190
we're not gonna be doing
it on the machine itself.

44
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:03,740
Itself like we will have a file that we
will be able to use our processor to crack

45
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:08,840
the encryption of that file, rather
instead we will be doing this remotely.

46
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,420
So we will come into the range
of a wireless access point and

47
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:19,080
then we will attempt to attack that
wireless access point by passing it in,

48
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,060
by trying to pass PIN codes.

49
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:29,320
And if any them works out we're gonna
get a response from the revert software.

50
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,620
And it will basically tell us,
what is the pass code,

51
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,590
what is the VPA2 preshared key for
that particular access point.

52
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,480
The downside of it all is that most of
the routers these days, even though they,

53
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,640
the brilliant router manufacturers
have actually decided

54
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:54,640
to put PIN authentication to be enabled by
default on most of the routers out there.

55
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,870
They did, fortunately,
put a preventive measure which is

56
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,953
the router itself basically locks.

57
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,645
After you've passed the incorrect
PIN several times, it will lock and

58
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:10,985
it will not allow any PIN authentication
of whatsoever to go on for

59
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:12,405
a certain period of time.

60
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,605
Usually maybe an hour or
something of a kind.

61
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:18,917
You can immediately deduce from this.

62
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:23,970
This leaves possibilities for
numerous DOS attacks and

63
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,692
all you would have to do is authenticate
falsely a couple of times and

64
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:32,590
PIN authentication will be disabled for
pretty much anybody there.

65
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,740
And there are a good amount of networks
out there who rely primarily and

66
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,800
only on PIN authentication,
why I have no idea.

67
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,790
So without further ado, let me,
I have showed in the previous

68
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,920
tutorials if you don't have Reaver
installed how to install it.

69
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,730
But in this particular one I'm
gonna just go ahead and use it.

70
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:55,920
I won't do any of the installation

71
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,010
procedures because they're already
done in the previous tutorials.

72
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,720
So just go ahead and
type in reaver -- help, and

73
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,693
you will get a ton load of options.

74
00:05:03,693 --> 00:05:07,300
I mean maybe not the ton load but
certainly a good amount of options.

75
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,520
We will be using some of them,

76
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,490
more likely than not when dealing
with different kinds of routers.

77
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,050
You will be required to
use some of these options,

78
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,300
use some of these arguments
primarily because yeah,

79
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,900
different routers have
different configurations.

80
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,920
And you want to be able to hide your
attacks or to mask yourself somehow.

81
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,800
Not because you are gonna get detected or

82
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,820
something like that because
it's not likely that

83
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,710
anybody can actually track you down if
you are attacking wireless access point.

84
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,580
Provided of course you are not
authenticated with it.

85
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,028
If you are not authenticated with
the wireless access point, and

86
00:05:46,028 --> 00:05:50,150
if you're just attacking it like this
wireless radio or something of a kind.

87
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,500
Basically there is almost
no way to detect you.

88
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,940
There is no way to find your physical
location or to identify you.

89
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,070
Sure, your MAC address will
probably show somewhere.

90
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,500
But what do you care?

91
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,940
All you need to do,
as I stated in the previous tutorial,

92
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,770
is type macchanger and change it.

93
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,750
No problems.

94
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,270
If you don't know how to change the Mac
address, just go back to tutorial 242 and

95
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:21,810
you will a tutorial called Mac or
Mac Changing or something of that kind.

96
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,110
It will have the word Mac in it, M-A-C.

97
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,220
And there, I have explained in great
detail how you can actually hide your

98
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,300
Mac address without any sort
of problems whatsoever.

99
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,890
The primary things that
we're gonna be using today,

100
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,290
the primary arguments,
that is, is i interface.

101
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:45,200
And we will of course need the bssid,
or MAC, of the target access point.

102
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,860
Before we do that,

103
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,420
as before with aircrack-mg we do
need to do a couple of things.

104
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,516
We need to set the mode
of our network cards.

105
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:54,640
So, I'm not gonna go into great detail,

106
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,140
how to do it here because I have
explained it in previous tutorials.

107
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,400
Here I'm just gonna do it and hopefully
you will be able to follow through.

108
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,390
If not just go back a tutorial or
two and see,

109
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,250
I have given detailed explanations there.

110
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,190
So just type in ifconfig.

111
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:14,947
Type in the name of your
wireless access card,

112
00:07:14,947 --> 00:07:21,707
and bring it down,
operation not permitted,

113
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:25,761
I'm not root, of course.

114
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:33,462
[SOUND] Okay, I always love my passwords
primarily because of their length.

115
00:07:33,462 --> 00:07:38,830
I sometimes tend to forget them
which is infinitely interesting.

116
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,220
But there you go,
I've managed to type it in, and

117
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,305
it's actually a good thing that I haven't
managed to login just yet as route.

118
00:07:45,305 --> 00:07:47,445
Because I have my router
opened here which I set up for

119
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:50,765
the testing purposes of
this particular tutorial.

120
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:54,990
And you can see the current PIN,
I mean these PINs can be generated,

121
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,305
these PINS are generated at random.

122
00:07:57,305 --> 00:07:59,465
So you can see the length of the PIN and

123
00:07:59,465 --> 00:08:02,355
you can see the PIN here I can say
generate new PIN let's see what happens.

124
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,389
The change for
this config will not take, yeah.

125
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,960
Okay.
So it will not take effect until

126
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,790
the device reboots.

127
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,890
But here you can see
the length of the PIN.

128
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:16,820
So it's like one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, only eight digits.

129
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,940
And if I do it again it's
gonna be eight again.

130
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,550
So one, two, three, five, six, seven.

131
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,160
Oops, sorry, not eight.

132
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,800
It's gonna be nine.

133
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,230
Is it nine?

134
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,500
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

135
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,180
Sorry, no, it's gonna be eight again.

136
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,590
It's always going to be eight,
so no problems there.

137
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,040
You know the length of the PIN,

138
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:41,920
which dramatically decreases the amount
of possible combinations as well.

139
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,150
Depending on what sort
of a router you have,

140
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:48,730
the PIN can be at different
places in the router.

141
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,710
I can't explain it for
every individual router,

142
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,670
but you can find it in the manual or
something like that.

143
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:58,470
Just open up a web interface for
your router by typing in the IP address.

144
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,960
If you want to know what the IP address
of your router is on a Linux system,

145
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,820
that is very easy to do.

146
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:11,530
You can just type in route, press enter
and this might take a bit of time.

147
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,620
I'm not exactly sure why is it taking so
long.

148
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,595
Primarily because I'm not
connected to the network.

149
00:09:16,595 --> 00:09:19,720
Okay, so I have config this another way.

150
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,920
But here, it would say Gateway,
and where it says Gateway,

151
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,300
that would be the default
address of your router.

152
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,850
However, that is the default Gateway.

153
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,390
That does not necessarily need to
be the IP address of the router you

154
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,820
are connected to.

155
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,130
So, type in ifconfig.

156
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,440
This is a foolproof way of getting
the IP address of the router,

157
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,660
much better than the previous one.

158
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,070
And I want to get the IP address of the
router to which my wireless access point

159
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,170
is associated with.

160
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:54,100
So wlp2s0, press Enter, and there we go.

161
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,280
I have an IP address here.

162
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,105
Okay, let's just clear this up a bit.

163
00:09:58,105 --> 00:09:59,860
[SOUND] Clear.

164
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,639
I want to get a bit of a better picture,
grab iNet.

165
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,850
Excellent.

166
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,050
So I have iNet here, and
this is the Internet address.

167
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:10,940
But this is my local address.

168
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,598
It's not to be used for
external purposes at all.

169
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:22,702
It's 192.168.0.102, and
the difference between your wired and

170
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:27,240
wireless connection is
usually this digit here.

171
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,905
For wired it's one and
for wireless it's zero and

172
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:33,090
then you have a list of
hosts which are here.

173
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,390
Anyway, my IP address in my local area

174
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:41,250
network that my wireless
interface has is 192.168.0.102.

175
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:47,100
The lowest possible IP address within this

176
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,520
range with only the last
octet changing is .0.

177
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,220
So, from zero to 255, and
the lowest one would be zero.

178
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,300
But you cannot use zero because
that is the network address.

179
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,720
So what you do is find the lowest
one here, which is zero.

180
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,370
Plus one and that's gonna give you the IP
address of your router, very simple.

181
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,500
And you can see that is exactly
what I've typed in here.

182
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,070
It's 192.168.0.1.

183
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:15,370
So just find the lowest one which is
zero of course then add one which is

184
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,750
going to be the IP address of the router.

185
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,530
Anyway, now that that is out of the way,

186
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,250
I've showed you how you can
check it out here, the PIN code.

187
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,746
But, this interface will differ
from one router to another,

188
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:29,808
please keep that in mind.

189
00:11:29,808 --> 00:11:33,560
So, this is not a general explanation for
all of the routers out there.

190
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,120
But, it's fairly simple to find a PIN
code on your own home router without

191
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,330
any bigger difficulties.

192
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,280
Just go ahead and
login to it via web interface as I said,

193
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,940
just type in the address here, you will
be prompted for login credentials.

194
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,960
Usually it's adminadmin if
you haven't changed anything.

195
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,860
If it's not, go ahead and
contact your ISP provider and

196
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,670
ask them to provide the username and
password for you.

197
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:01,564
Assuming that it's not locked,
if it's locked, you've gotta break it,

198
00:12:01,564 --> 00:12:06,015
but I will show you how you can break
routers in the tutorials to come.

199
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,297
In any case,
let's just go back to the subject here.

200
00:12:08,297 --> 00:12:10,046
Now I am root.

201
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:12,116
Let's take down my wireless interface.

202
00:12:12,116 --> 00:12:17,449
IfConfig, vlp2s0 down.

203
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,180
And now I need ivconfig
wlp2s0 mode monitor.

204
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:32,602
Excellent, so ifconfig wlp2s0 up.

205
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:33,760
There we go.

206
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,730
You can make a neat short script.

207
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,580
The best script which has
these commands listed and

208
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,060
that could be a fantastic way to do this.

209
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,230
You would effectively save
yourselves a lot of time there.

210
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,810
Go ahead and clear the screen.

211
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,460
And you see it says connection to
something, it has been deactivated.

212
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,830
Because my wireless interface has
now been brought down and up and

213
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,410
on top of that, it's in monitor mode.

214
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,550
Now, there was a program which I've
used in the previous tutorial,

215
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:06,670
which is a part of the air crack
packaged It's called Airmon.

216
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,746
Airmon-ng and I want to check vlp2s0 for

217
00:13:11,746 --> 00:13:14,710
any possible problems.

218
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,060
I have explained this in
the previous tutorial,

219
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,795
why am I doing this and how is this done.

220
00:13:19,795 --> 00:13:24,734
So airmon-ng check vlp2s0,
of course your wireless interface

221
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:29,770
name will probably not be the same if
you're not using the same OS as I am.

222
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,550
But just substitute it
with whatever it is.

223
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,110
No problems there.

224
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,320
In the previous tutorials
I've also stated that.

225
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,780
Here we have a list of problems,
as I like to call them.

226
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,190
These are lists of primary problems
as a network manager because its

227
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,840
generating a lot of
the other things up here.

228
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:52,670
So we'll just go ahead and kill them,
13133, I gotta kill them one

229
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:58,273
by one because they
are spawning one another and

230
00:13:58,273 --> 00:14:02,934
that can be problematic.

231
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:07,830
So, kill 2498,
even if you are root they can give you

232
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:12,190
a ton load of problems primarily because
as I said they are spawning one another.

233
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,710
That can be just such
an unbelievable drag.

234
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,110
Excellent.
Now I have,

235
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,980
let me just clear the screen again.

236
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,260
Now I have ran the check once again to
make sure that I don't have any problems.

237
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,740
If you are afraid that you
will kill something that

238
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,590
you don't want to kill in terms
of networking, don't worry.

239
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:33,110
Anything from that list will
auto generate pretty much,

240
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,290
the moment you re-initiate
your network manager.

241
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,120
You can just type in the service
NetworkManager restart.

242
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,770
And all those processes will be generated.

243
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:49,000
If you don't wanna do this you
can just reboot the machine and

244
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,880
you will have pretty much the same effect,
no problems.

245
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,020
Let's go ahead and clear the screen.

246
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,780
Before I actually start using reaver,
which we have installed previously.

247
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,190
I do need to check for
wireless connections within my area and

248
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:08,850
I do need to check whether they are
vulnerable, very important thing to do.

249
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,830
And that I will do in
the follow up tutorial.

250
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,530
We will use the wash command in order
to find these wireless access points.

251
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,392
Until then, farewell, and
I hope to see you there.
