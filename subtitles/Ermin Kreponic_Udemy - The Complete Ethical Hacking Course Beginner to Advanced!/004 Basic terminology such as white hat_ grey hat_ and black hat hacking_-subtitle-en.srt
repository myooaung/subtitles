1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,600
Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,000
Today I will be talking about some of the basic terms

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,570
which you will need order to follow this course through.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:15,200
So first off, you have three main categories of people.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,700
There are White Hat Hackers, Grey Hat Hackers and Black Hat Hackers.

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,300
Everything that we will be doing falls into this category here

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,100
So, White Hats --

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,900
Those are people whose activities are within the confines of the law.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,809
There are people such pen testers, ethical hackers, people like you and me

10
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:37,300
and so on.

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,400
Then you have Grey Hat Hackers

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,280
whose activities are bordering between legal and illegal.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,300
It's a bit of a shady area there.

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,500
In addition to that, you have the most known category

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,329
which is Black Hat Hackers.

16
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:58,100
and usually, and unfortunately, every time someone hears the term hacking

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,900
it is associated with people from Black Hat world.

18
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:07,500
There are people who conduct all sorts of illegal activities

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,900
or conduct activities without any regard for the law

20
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,700
and, I don't know, extract new information from certain servers

21
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,800
credentials, your card information, take services down

22
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,800
usually to extract some sort of financial gain.

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,900
In any case, down below you have footprinting.

24
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,700
Now the act of footprinting is basically information gathering.

25
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:39,600
You are conducting some sort of
reconnaissance work

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,000
You are figuring out the IP of the server

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,100
Figuring out which ports are open

28
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,000
and with that, you can conclude which services are running there

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,720
but it doesn't necessarily need to be confined to the digital world.

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,800
The act of footprinting can also be when you go to the company itself.

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
You just walk in.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,700
It doesn't necessarily need to be a company.

33
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,100
It can be pretty much any building with servers in it

34
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,100
and you have a look around.

35
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,929
You try to gather some information there
on-site

36
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,400
where you go and you through their trash cans.

37
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,640
You go behind the building, jump into those
trash containers

38
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,000
and get some information from there.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,200
Also, people have been known to go into parking lots

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,239
to see who the employees are

41
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,400
and who works there.

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,510
All sorts of things.

43
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,700
So this is just general information gathering, in regards to your chosen target.

44
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,100
It doesn't need to be confined to the digital world.

45
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,400
Anyway, down below

46
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,100
you certain types of attacks --

47
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,100
You have DoS and DDoS.

48
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,100
Very simple. Basically the same thing implemented in a different way.

49
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,800
DoS stands for "Denial of Service"

50
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,500
Usually called "Childish Attacks" because they're relatively easy to implement

51
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,690
and they still are, provided of course if you have enough machines

52
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,300
but that's the domain of DDoS.

53
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:11,400
In general, what happens here is that you perform a certain amount of requests

54
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,430
more requests than a server can handle

55
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,709
and then the server begins dropping connections.

56
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:20,160
For example, Apache web server -- I believe
by default

57
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,200
it can handle up to 10,000 connections or so

58
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,450
and if you can make more than 10,000
requests

59
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,010
basically everybody else making any sort
of requests

60
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,600
will not be able to access the website

61
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,300
because their connections will be dropped

62
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,300
simply because Apache will say

63
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,400
"Okay, I have too many users. I have more users than I can handle"

64
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,300
all the other collections will be dropped by default.

65
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:52,700
Thereby making the site inaccessible, even though you haven't really broken any codes.

66
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,800
You haven't really broken through any firewalls or stole any passwords

67
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,000
or anything of a kind

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,500
but when you're DoS in something, it's just
you.

69
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,200
All the connections, all the requests

70
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,100
everything is coming just from your own computer

71
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,300
and that it is not always the most efficient way

72
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,500
In fact, it generally it can only work if there is a flaw

73
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,989
in the way which requests are processed.

74
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:26,760
However, that is why you have DDoS attacks

75
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,700
when you have multiple computers, multiple connections

76
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,900
and they are all making simultaneous requests to a certain server

77
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,100
and this is really difficult fight off

78
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,300
I mean, you really need to have a clever configuration of your firewall

79
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,800
and need to have quite a good firewall as well.

80
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,820
Usually you would need a physical one to prevent these sort of DDoS attacks

81
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,590
and by physical, I mean a router firewall or
something a kind.

82
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,020
This is quite difficult to

83
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,940
it's not difficult to actually do the attack itself

84
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,700
as it is difficult to make the necessary
preparations.

85
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,919
First of all, you need to go about infecting other devices, which you will use

86
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:16,300
which you will enslave and use in order to
perform this sort of attack

87
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,540
This is the hard part.

88
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,000
The DDoS part is quite easy compared to that.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,220
For that, in order for you infect other computers, you need two things --

90
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,710
You need RATS (Remote administration
tools)

91
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,200
and you need to make them FUD.

92
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,700
You need to make them fully undetectable.

93
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,600
That is what the term FUD stands for.

94
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,200
So it just means that they cannot be detected by antiviruses

95
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,600
or they are, more precise term would be

96
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,300
that they are not labeled as something malicious by antivirus programs.

97
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,700
By the way, sometimes actually most the times

98
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,040
you don't actually need to make your own applications fully undetectable.

99
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,500
There are plenty of pen testing companies
out there

100
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,180
and not just pen testing companies, but other companies as well

101
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,600
will pay very good sums of money

102
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,300
if you can make their programs fully
undetectable by antivirus programs

103
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,700
Down below, the RATS (Remote Administration Tools)

104
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,700
Now, they themselves are not some sort of hacks or anything of a kind.

105
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:30,100
They just basically put them on a USB stick or something of a kind.

106
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,600
Send them in the mail

107
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,000
Shared them in a zip file

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,700
and in such a way

109
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,540
that's just one of the ways to infect other computers

110
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,300
other devices

111
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,300
enslave them

112
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,100
convert them into your sleeves

113
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,620
into the slaves of the main server

114
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,200
where every death might be wherever you
might set it up

115
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,700
and then you can use all of those computers

116
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,100
to conduct all sorts of activities.

117
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,600
This is very good because it anonymizes you to a very large extent.

118
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,100
It's very difficult to track somebody
down, whoever is doing this

119
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,800
primarily because the users, who are infected

120
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,300
they have no idea that somebody else is controlling their devices

121
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,400
because nothing is really happening on your desktop you can't really see.

122
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,050
All the processes running are being run in
the background

123
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,300
and your processor is executing them

124
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,920
using up

125
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,540
the only way to see it would be basically to start up a task manager

126
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,800
or something of a kind.

127
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,100
and then see the running processes

128
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,500
and perhaps you could spot it there

129
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:43,200
but not even there if somebody has implemented a rootkit.

130
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,620
So a rootkit is a tool basically

131
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,620
which you install onto an operating system

132
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:57,200
and it is able to hide running processes from the system itself

133
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,900
So when you, for example, start a task
manager in windows

134
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,880
or something of a kind

135
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,500
the purpose of a rootkit would be hide the processes from the task manager.

136
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Basically how it works is the task manager from the system

137
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,420
from the kernel

138
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,400
and then the kernel of the system responds

139
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,500
which is the core of the system

140
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,000
where all the drivers and the key functionalities are.

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,700
The kernel of the system then responds

142
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,700
"Hey, I have this this this and this process running. Here you go"

143
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:33,500
What rootkit would do is redirect those requests from task manager to itself

144
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,900
and would basically say "I don't have such processes running"

145
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,100
So very very dangerous and potent combinations here

146
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,900
that we will use later on as we progress through this tutorial

147
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,500
but for the time being I just wanted to give a bit of an introduction to it

148
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,550
and give you an idea of what we shall be doing

149
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,589
through some these basic terms and concepts.

150
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:58,560
Next up, we have phishing attacks.

151
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:07,400
Now phishing attacks are basically when you apply some sort of bait

152
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,829
somebody bites it, then you pull on it.

153
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:12,100
Simple as that, right?

154
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,670
The same way you would do fishing.

155
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,100
Well not quite

156
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,389
Phishing attacks would be when you get, I don't know, an email from someone

157
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:23,100
and there's a link it

158
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,200
you click on it

159
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,720
and it throws you somewhere, I don't know, on some website

160
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,600
Perhaps it looks like something legit.

161
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,100
Perhaps it looks like a website that you are using or something of a kind

162
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,600
but it is not and you pass on your credentials

163
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,000
and that can be a problem

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,700
but this is generally avoided today.

165
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,600
This is not something that happens in such a way.

166
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,000
Rather instead what happens these days is the that DNS servers gets changed

167
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
on your routers

168
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and once that happens

169
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,600
older requests that you made on your web browser gets redirected.

170
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,800
So for example, if you type in facebook.com

171
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,700
you're gonna get a domain with facebook.com

172
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,800
from some private DNS server

173
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,500
god knows where

174
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,000
who's MX records are altered and they have been configured.

175
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,100
For example, to make redirections to interpret Facebook.com

176
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,269
sorry, not redirections but rather instead to interpret Facebook.com

177
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:22,389
to certain IP address that does not belong
Facebook or anything like that.

178
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,500
So you open up your Facebook

179
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,809
it looks exactly the same

180
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:31,800
There is no way to tell because in the upper left corner of the screen

181
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,000
you have the domain name written --

182
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,500
It's www.facebook.com

183
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,610
and basically provided login credentials

184
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,300
once you do that, they're gone.

185
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,900
Somebody has them.

186
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,240
One of the ways to detect this

187
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,470
even though it's very, I mean it's not
hard

188
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,860
but nobody really pays any attention to
it.

189
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,800
In the upper left corner you might check
with the protocol is HTTPS

190
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,200
instead of HTTP

191
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,800
because usually if these kind of attacks are conducted

192
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,400
it's not gonna be HTTPS

193
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,449
a status a lot harder to implement

194
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:15,300
but if it is HTTPS, there really won't be any
legit way of figuring it out

195
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,300
other then actually checking the keys

196
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,400
checking the certificates and

197
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,800
and nobody actually does that.

198
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Well maybe not nobody

199
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,700
but ninety-nine percent of users out there
are not going to bother

200
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,600
to go about conducting such checks.

201
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,300
Anyway, I know it sounds a bit complex

202
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,600
but believe me, I will explain this in great details.

203
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,949
I will give you several demonstrations

204
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:40,000
and by the end of this course

205
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,400
you will understand and know how to do this with great ease.

206
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,670
It will not present a significant obstacle in your line of work.

207
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,700
Excellent. Now that we have approximately
half these terms out of our way

208
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,000
I will continue to deal with them in the follow up tutorial

209
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
and I sincerely hope to see you all there
