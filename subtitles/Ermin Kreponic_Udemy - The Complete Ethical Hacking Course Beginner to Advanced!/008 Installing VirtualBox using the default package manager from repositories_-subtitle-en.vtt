00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.000

Hello everybody and welcome to this

tutorial.



2

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000

Today I will show you another more reliable way



3

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.950

to install VirtualBox.



4

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.200

If you're wondering why on earth



5

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.030

did I show you the other way using the RPM



6

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.000

if we're not going to use it here.



7

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.300

Well, it's always good to have another option.



8

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.100

Plus the procedure is exactly the same



9

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.800

if you're installing any other RPM packets.



10

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.100

So you just type in "rpm -i"



11

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.400

and that you just type in the name of the package that you have downloaded



12

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.600

and that you wish to install.



13

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.420

The procedure is exactly the same.



14

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.600

I would recommend passing an H argument as well



15

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.800

to give you a status bar



16

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.000

because if you just go ahead and type it in like this



17

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.420

within the name of the package.



18

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.129

It's gonna install it, no problems of

course



19

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.200

but the screen is just going to wait.



20

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.660

Nothing is going to happen.



21

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.400

You might think it's bugged or something like that



22

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.800

during the installation procedure.



23

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.700

Like this, with H, there's a status bar

that shows



24

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.989

so you know that something in the background is happening



25

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.900

but as I said, it's good to have another

option.



26

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.900

What we want to do today and now is actually install VirtualBox



27

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.300

using the default packet manager called "yum"



28

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.000

and pull the package from the repositories.



29

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.600

Now what are repositories?



30

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.600

Repositories are places where software packages are stored



31

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.700

and for Linux distros



32

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.230

and then you can pull those packets



33

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.900

those software packets



34

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.700

from your Linux distro using the default packet manager.



35

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.100

It's very simple.



36

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.000

It's extremely easy



37

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.200

and it's one of those things that you will absolutely need to know how to do



38

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.800

because you will be installing and uninstalling a lot of things



39

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.000

during the course of your pen testing careers.



40

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.700

During the course of pretty much any pen testing exercise in general.



41

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.000

So let me just demonstrate this to you.



42

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.200

You type in "yum"and then you give it a command.



43

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.300

First of all, use yum to call your default packet manager



44

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.700

which is yum basically, because I am using Fedora



45

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.500

but if I was using some sort of a debian distro



46

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.200

It could be "aptitude"



47

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.000

or it could be "apt-get"



48

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.200

and some other distros have their own packet managers



49

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.250

but we're not going to get into those now.



50

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.700

Later on, I will show you what Kali Linux is using.



51

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.000

That is the Linux distro that we will be

using



52

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000

in order to conduct some of the pen testing exercises.



53

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000

So first off, you type in "yum" as I said



54

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.910

and then type in "search"



55

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.000

which you're basically telling yum what to do.



56

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.380

You wanted to search for something, so you just type in "search".



57

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.599

It's pretty much exactly the same as

English language



58

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.690

you just kind of need to figure out the logical of it



59

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.000

and then you want to search for an

approximate name of the package.



60

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000

that you want.



61

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.920

So you don't perhaps know the full name or something like that.



62

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.500

Don't worry about it



63

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.519

just type in a portion of the name.



64

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:11.500

It will suffice



65

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.400

and pretty much everything that contains that portion of the name



66

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.100

will be displayed.



67

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.630

So we know what we want.



68

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.400

It's VirtualBox



69

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.400

and you might think that this is the of  the package



70

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.700

but no, it is not



71

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.000

Soon you will see



72

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.579

and there you go.



73

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.650

It has printed out every packet



74

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.800

every package that contains VirtualBox in it's name.



75

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.290

The word VirtualBox in the name

with the package



76

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.500

or in the description of the package



77

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.800

because you see you have the name of the package here



78

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.359

colon



79

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.400

and then you have the description of the package here.



80

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.800

There are a lot of things



81

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.300

a lot of things with the name "VirtualBox"



82

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.739

and you're wondering perhaps which ones to install.



83

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.120

Well, you need the Knod one, and here you have the kernel version



84

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.100

and fedora version



85

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.000

So FC would be the Fedora version



86

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.600

and you have the architecture



87

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.739

It's 64



88

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.079

I can't select it -- there we go -- It's 64



89

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.000

and here you have the kernel version.



90

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000

So you can compare it to what you have



91

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.349

and based on what you have



92

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:20.700

what your operating system is



93

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.700

you can take it from there, assuming it's a Fedora 20.



94

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.210

You can use any other distro.



95

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.000

The procedure is fairly the same.



96

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000

Later on, in the question parts



97

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000

if you are using, for example, a Debian based distro



98

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.900

or an openSUSE or something like that



99

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.700

feel free to ask me if you can't manage it there.



100

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.200

I will help you out, no problems



101

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.009

but for the time being, I'm just go ahead and install it here.



102

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.700

Let me just go ahead and clear the screen



103

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.160

in order to install the package.



104

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.400

Need to type "yum install"



105

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.200

and then you need to go ahead and type the name of your package



106

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.800

which would be the last one for us.



107

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.800

For me, anyway.



108

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.800

This one.



109

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.690

Whoops...here we go.



110

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.500

The name is a bit long, so I'm just gonna go ahead and copy it



111

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.979

but you see, there is one fundamental problem here.



112

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.300

The VirtualBox package



113

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.100

is not found in the default repositories of Fedora



114

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.240

and that is a bit of a problem



115

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.400

primarily because not have these commands would actually work



116

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.200

if I did not previously import RPM fusion repositories.



117

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.300

"RPM fusion" is simply the name for a certain type of repositories



118

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.500

containing certain types of packets.



119

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.130

So I have imported those repositories



120

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.400

and now I can pull information and packages from them.



121

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.630

If I did not do that previously



122

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.110

I would not have been able to do any of

these things



123

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.500

yum, search VirtualBox would yield no results whatsoever.



124

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.690

I would get a blank screen.



125

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.400

I would get like a message here saying that no packages were found



126

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.610

that matched this particular name



127

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.000

and then just a black screen.



128

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.100

That's it.



129

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.360

So that could be problematic.



130

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.300

In order to solve that problem



131

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.800

you need to go ahead and open up your favorite browser.



132

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.700

I already have this website open to save a bit of time



133

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:26.600

It says rpmfusion.org/configuration



134

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.200

but here, let me just go ahead and search for it.



135

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.900

So, type into any search engine "rpmfusion"



136

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.900

It's gonna pop. Do not worry.



137

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.070

So it's rpmfusion.org



138

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.500

Click on the website, open it up



139

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.500

and here you're gonna get instructions immediately.



140

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.700

It's a very simplistic website.



141

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.500

There isn't any tinkering that you need think about



142

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.000

or some advance configuration.



143

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.100

Nothing a kind.



144

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.300

It just says "For users"



145

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.800

and says "Enable RPM Fusion on your system"



146

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.100

Click OK



147

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.200

Uh, not okay. Just click on the link and there you go!



148

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.670

You get a listing here.



149

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.200

You get a listing downloads.



150

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.000

It says "free" and "nonfree"



151

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.950

and don't be intimidated with this "nonfree"



152

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:21.000

You do not need to pay for anything



153

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.500

It is nonfree for redistributable software

that is not open source software



154

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.360

as defined by Fedora licensee guidelines.



155

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:37.000

So this nonfree does not refer to money.



156

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.610

You do not need to pay anything here.



157

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.800

I cannot make it any more clearer.



158

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.800

It simply refers that the software is not open source software



159

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.800

as defined by Fedora licensee guidelines.



160

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.970

So, it might actually be open source but it just doesn't fit



161

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:58.000

within the boundaries of Fedora

licensing guidelines.



162

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.500

Anyway, that part is not that interesting to you.



163

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.700

Down below, the thing that you need to know here



164

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.800

is that nonfree is actually free, in terms of money



165

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.300

but not free in terms of source code.



166

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.000

Anyway, as I said, that's not really that important for you



167

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000

anyway, at the moment.



168

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.600

Down here you have



169

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.800

actually RPM packages.



170

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.600

Remember from the previous tutorial



171

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.000

I've shown you the extension ".rpm"



172

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.200

When you download the package



173

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.300

we could actually download one of these.



174

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.150

Actually I would download the first one



175

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:38.390

and then install it using my RPM software.



176

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:42.240

Just type in "rpm -i", and then I would



177

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.400

there we go



178

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.230

I just clicked on it



179

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:50.040

then I would pass this file name as an

argument as well



180

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.500

and it would install it, no problems as well.



181

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.800

but I don't really want to do that at the moment.



182

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.200

I want to show you a different way of doing it.



183

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.740

If you're wondering why it is being repeated twice



184

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:07.000

this is for free and this is for nonfree.



185

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000

Excellent



186

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.800

What we want is the command line setup using RPM.



187

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.000

It says here "Fedora 14" to the most current.



188

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.480

So mine is 20.



189

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.600

It's gonna work there, no problems as well.



190

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.200

So you have this very long command



191

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:30.700

and you don't really need to know what every single portion of this command is



192

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.490

or what it does.



193

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:39.000

basic sum total it imports a repository into your system



194

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.100

that you are going to use later on.



195

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.600

They have given this command,so you can do it from tap basically



196

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.300

You don't need to go about doing things or anything of a kind.



197

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.000

You basically just copy paste this and run it.



198

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.200

You are using your default package manager.



199

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.300

You are using local install option.



200

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.970

You are not checking for certain types of keys.



201

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:05.700

You are a giving it the place from which to pull it



202

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.000

and so on and so forth.



203

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.100

But later on as we progress through this

tutorial



204

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:17.240

we will deal extensively with Linux command line.



205

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:23.500

So only then will these things become clearer to you



206

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:28.700

once I actually explain some of the basic and fundamental things



207

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.300

then you will be able to understand things



208

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:36.100

such as those listed is this bracket



209

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.300

sorry not bracket



210

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.500

within the confines of this parentheses



211

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.500

and so on



212

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.000

because if I start explaining it now



213

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.200

it would no sense



214

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.700

and it simply complicate things further.



215

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:51.000

And I said, later on when we get into the command line interface of Linux



216

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.370

When I start explaining it in great detail



217

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:56.200

there I will begin from scratch.



218

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.000

Then move you basically from beginner to advanced user



219

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000

In a relatively short amount of time



220

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.760

and then you will be able to understand what all these things are.



221

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.100

For the time being, just copy this content



222

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:14.340

which is within the confines of these quotation marks



223

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.400

and paste it into your terminal.



224

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.800

So you do need to be root



225

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.500

let me just go ahead and exit



226

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.690

I am no longer root, as you can see.



227

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.700

I am now my regular user - "Chronic"



228

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.500

Just type "SU" type



229

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.700

Type in your password



230

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:33.900

and paste this.



231

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.000

Press "Enter"



232

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.800

okay, obviously it won't install here



233

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.900

because I already have it installed.



234

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:49.300

Yeah, it says "nothing to do" whatsoever



235

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:53.500

but on your system, where you do not have RPM fusion installed



236

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.400

this would just fly as well.



237

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.170

This would just pass, no problems



238

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:00.900

and you would successfully have installed RPM fusion



239

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.200

on your system as well.



240

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.000

So "clear"



241

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.300

Anyway, I just wanted to show you something else



242

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.350

that I neglected to show you a moment ago.



243

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:16.900

This command that we've ran



244

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:21.920

it actually installs free and nonfree repositories



245

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:27.000

If you just take a closer look to what I

am highlighting at the moment.



246

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.600

This is the free, so it says



247

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:35.700

http://downloadl1rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/



248

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.700

rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm



249

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.450

and down below, you have the second address



250

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:45.300

again, download http://download1.rpmfusion.org



251

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.800

and it says nonfree.



252

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.420

So I'm highlighting the entire thing



253

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.510

zoom it in a bit more so everybody can

see



254

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:55.300

and there you go.



255

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.400

You have two completely



256

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.700

well, they're not completely different addresses



257

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.000

but they are definitely different addresses



258

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.600

referring to different types of repositories.



259

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.000

Anyway, now can go back to your terminal.



260

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.200

Do not log out of root



261

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:17.639

Stay as root, because you will root privileges in order do this.



262

00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:20.000

Type in "yum"



263

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.800

Search



264

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.800

Once again



265

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.200

Virtualbox



266

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.000

Press "Enter"



267

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.389

Take the last one or whatever one suits your current kernel.



268

00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:37.600

You check the current kernel by typing

in "uname -a"



269

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.029

and here you go.



270

00:13:39.029 --> 00:13:44.000

So I'm 3.18.7-100



271

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.200

3.18.7-100.fc20



272

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:54.700

fc20 and there you have the architecture listed here as well.



273

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.900

So clear the screen



274

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.500

Type in "yum"



275

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.000

Install



276

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.500

Paste the name of the package



277

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.000

Press "Space dash Y"



278

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.300

and if you have this command, just press "Enter"



279

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.700

and it will install.



280

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.300

It will run through.



281

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:16.600

I've already installed VirtualBox to save some time as well.



282

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.079

You will have it up and running on your

system



283

00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:24.600

and after you've installed it, do not forget to type in "yum"



284

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.129

Update as well.



285

00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:29.189

So let the system just run through the updates.



286

00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:33.400

So you would make sure that you have the latest version



287

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:38.100

That you have everything up-to-date and running.



288

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.800

In any case, that would be it for this tutorial.



289

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.100

In the next one, I will start VirtualBox up



290

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.000

explain some of it's features



291

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.139

and hopefully through the follow-up tutorials



292

00:14:48.139 --> 00:14:53.000

I will start installing an operating system within my virtual machine



293

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.329

within virtual environment



294

00:14:54.329 --> 00:14:57.389

and we'll see how that process goes.



295

00:14:57.389 --> 00:15:01.000

Thank you for watching and I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
