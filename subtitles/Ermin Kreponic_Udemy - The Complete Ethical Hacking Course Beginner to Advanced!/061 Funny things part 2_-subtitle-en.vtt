00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.630

Hello everybody, and
welcome to this tutorial.



2

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.871

Let's just go ahead and
start our configuration.



3

00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:10.415

Before we can start the configuration,
we just need to go ahead and



4

00:00:10.415 --> 00:00:13.180

download some of these scripts.



5

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.900

So you have ASCII images,
basically converts all images



6

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.490

to ASCII text which can be kind of funny.



7

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.330

Blur images makes them blurry so
you can't see anything on it.



8

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.630

I personally like this one,
it's Google search.



9

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.130

You are able to add extra words
to whatever somebody's search is,



10

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.470

you can add extra words to it.



11

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.090

I've seen people do all
sorts of things with this.



12

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.630

And yeah.
Let's just go over onto the net.



13

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.180

Let me just show you where you can
download these sort of things, and



14

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.830

don't download them from anywhere else,
as they are executable scripts that



15

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.420

you will give execution privileges and
that you will run on your system.



16

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.620

So that can be a pretty big problem.



17

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.963

Anyway, go ahead,
use your favorite search engine.



18

00:01:06.963 --> 00:01:13.170

Type in googlesearch.pl and
I already visited the page.



19

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.762

It's googlesearch.pl on Google code.



20

00:01:16.762 --> 00:01:19.720

Let me just zoom in.



21

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.280

Here you can actually see the script.



22

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.184

You can read it, you can



23

00:01:27.184 --> 00:01:31.780

see the code,
you can see everything that it does.



24

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.610

It doesn't really do much it just adds
extra words to the Google search.



25

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.560

You can view raw file.



26

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.928

You can zoom in, and you can press Ctrl+A,
select all here, Ctrl+C, to copy it.



27

00:01:47.928 --> 00:01:53.020

Then you could open your terminal back up,
and I do believe I have some of them here.



28

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.720

Yep, there we go.



29

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.420

I have ASCII images, I have Google search,
no Internet, and Tourette images.



30

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.490

I got no idea what that does.



31

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.530

But I do believe I've tried
it out since it's here.



32

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.590

In any case,
you will need to of course type in nano.



33

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.630

And then you will need to use this name or
this name.



34

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.390

You can actually name
it whatever you want.



35

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.790

It doesn't matter as far as I know.



36

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.910

Although you do need .pl extension.



37

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.190

But try to keep the name consistent,
there is no need for you to change it or



38

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.070

anything of a kind.



39

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.888

You see, I basically just copy-pasted
this text here previously.



40

00:02:30.888 --> 00:02:36.290

If you didn't, you would have an empty
file here, you would just right click,



41

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.140

paste and copy everything into it.



42

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.240

There are no modifications that you need
to do to this one however, internally.



43

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.160

But externally,
you would need to type in chmod plus x and



44

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.950

then googleSearch in order to
give it execution privileges.



45

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.220

With some of these other scripts,
you do need to make certain modifications.



46

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.908

They're not extreme, but you do need
to actually go into the script and



47

00:03:02.908 --> 00:03:05.440

change a thing or two,
depending on the script.



48

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.521

So let's just take asciiImages,
nano, asciiImages.



49

00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:17.002

And you see here, it says $ourIP.



50

00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:21.840

I think the default one here is 33.



51

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.520

But you do need to change it to whatever
the LAN IP address of your device is.



52

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.950

Of your computer is that is.



53

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.310

Mine is 104 at the moment, but



54

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.660

these things tend to change, so
make sure to keep the paste up.



55

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.680

You can also assign IP addresses
statically to your computers, but that's



56

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.400

gonna present a problem when you connect
to a public Wi-Fi or something of a kind.



57

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.320

Anyway, doesn't matter, don't change the
IP addresses of your computer, just take



58

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.860

a look at what it is and type it in here
in order to render the script effective.



59

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.520

In order for it to start functioning.



60

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.940

You do need to probably just change
the last octave but I don't know.



61

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.670

Depends what your LAN IP address is.



62

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.090

Just type it in here.



63

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.990

This is how you can check
your LAN IP address ifconfig.



64

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.410

Press enter and there you go.



65

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.150

This is my LAN IP address,
the one that I am selecting at the moment.



66

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.460

Anyway, now that we have
some of the scripts here,



67

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.520

there's no installation procedure,
anything of a kind.



68

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.610

You basically copy, paste the script
into the matching name, and that's it.



69

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.710

As I said,
you can name it whatever you want, but



70

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.320

I would suggest that you name
it with a .pl extension.



71

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.877

And you can find all sorts of
these scripts, I mean, names,



72

00:04:34.877 --> 00:04:37.000

you can just type in your
favorite search engine.



73

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.240

Flip images squid.



74

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:52.130

Let's see if that's gonna help us out.



75

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.922

There you go,
somebody has April Fool's Day.



76

00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:59.110

Redirecting.



77

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.370

Do they have the list of scripts here?



78

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:07.390

No, they do not.
Let's just go over, let's just go over.



79

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.650

Don't give up so fast.



80

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.770

Apparently they do not
have it here either.



81

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.690

Do they have it on Google Code?



82

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:21.650

Yep, there you go.



83

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:22.560

Actually, you have them.



84

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.485

It says Fight Club, Blur Images, ASCII.pl.



85

00:05:26.485 --> 00:05:30.390

Google search no Internet,
or something like that.



86

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.500

If you're wondering
what the Fight Club is,



87

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.200

basically just substitutes
all of your images on a site.



88

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.460

If I'm not mistaken, with the imagery
from The Fight Club movie.



89

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.130

It definitely does something of a kind.



90

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.010

I'm not too sure about that.



91

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.870

But you can take a look at
the descriptions if you want for



92

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:48.830

every individual script.



93

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.600

There are a lot of these scripts
that you can find on the net.



94

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.810

And depending on what you wanna do, you
can implement each one of them separately.



95

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.690

Anyway, next step we
have to configure this.



96

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:02.990

We have to configure Squid.



97

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.910

As I've written here.



98

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.163

If you install then you
need to type in nano space



99

00:06:09.163 --> 00:06:13.913

slash etc slash squid.



100

00:06:13.913 --> 00:06:16.740

And then again, squid3 actually.



101

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.410

Sorry.



102

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.480

And then squid.com.



103

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:25.160

Press enter and then her we're
gonna be doing some of the editing.



104

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.770

There are 5,782 lines.



105

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.234

So, I'm just gonna go ahead and
search for what I need,



106

00:06:30.234 --> 00:06:34.581

in order to save us a bit of time,
actually, I don't need to search for



107

00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:38.510

the first one, because it should
be straight off the bat here.



108

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.390

Apparently not.



109

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.510

Do forgive me,
I've been modifying this yesterday.



110

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.350

So a few things have slipped my mind.



111

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.470

Nope, give me Ctrl+V, paste, go.



112

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.710

Okay excellent.



113

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:04.950

So these basic things,
how do you call them?



114

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:08.550

These bars represent
comment without lines.



115

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.320

They are the lines which the program
will not take into consideration.



116

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.251

All you need to do is un-comment it.



117

00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:16.311

There you go.



118

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:22.200

This line will be taken
into consideration.



119

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.323

And if you don't want it to
be taken into consideration,



120

00:07:27.323 --> 00:07:29.880

just put a bar there and it will not be.



121

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:35.840

I have un-commented this particular
line because this is my network.



122

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:44.441

So when I do 168.0.0
with the subnet mask 16.



123

00:07:44.441 --> 00:07:50.756

Anyway, depending on what
your configuration is,



124

00:07:50.756 --> 00:07:54.780

make sure to choose a proper one.



125

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.580

You should be able to find it,



126

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.730

these are ranges for
home IP addresses, most of them.



127

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:05.400

If not, I'm pretty sure you
can add your own as well.



128

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.280

And I'm not too sure about that.



129

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.190

That doesn't really matter.



130

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:13.986

You will find yourselves there as
most likely it will be in this one.



131

00:08:13.986 --> 00:08:17.577

192.168.0.0/16.



132

00:08:17.577 --> 00:08:18.357

So yeah.



133

00:08:18.357 --> 00:08:20.920

That's a lot of bits.



134

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.490

16, both of these ranges will change.



135

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.602

This is the host part of the IP address,
and



136

00:08:27.602 --> 00:08:30.632

these are the amount of host you can have.



137

00:08:30.632 --> 00:08:37.670

So 255 here and 255 here, and
then you get the combination.



138

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:38.890

That's a lot of hosts.



139

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.230

I don't know how many,
but a lot in general.



140

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:47.710

Let's go ahead and find our next
thing that we need to modify so



141

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:54.590

http access allow, copy, paste.



142

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.130

Where is it, excellent.



143

00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:02.380

So this line, this can be a commented
line so that can be a problem like this.



144

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.670

You need to un-comment it and
have it run as it is.



145

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:13.550

Okay, so the next step, what we
have to do is change the port 3812.



146

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.150

No, not the port, but we need to
make sure that it is transparent.



147

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.350

So let me just show it to
you what I mean by that.



148

00:09:21.325 --> 00:09:25.115

Excellent, so usually you will have
only this line that I have selected



149

00:09:25.115 --> 00:09:29.995

without the one that I am selecting now,
so the word transparent will not be here.



150

00:09:29.995 --> 00:09:35.065

You literally need to just type it in
there, just type in transparent right



151

00:09:35.065 --> 00:09:39.935

next to port with a space in between.



152

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:46.509

We are doing this, so computers
that we are spoofing would not at



153

00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:52.213

all need any sort of configuration with
their browsers or anything of a kind.



154

00:09:52.213 --> 00:09:55.100

It will use proxy by
default when we spoof them.



155

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:01.150

Anyway, that's it as far as
the squid proxy is concerned.



156

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.990

We don't actually need
to do any other changes



157

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.740

aside from assigning it a script to use,
and that's gonna be the end of it.



158

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.950

But this we are going to change.



159

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.640

This you can actually change
multiple times if you wish.



160

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.647

And this is where all
the changes come into play.



161

00:10:18.565 --> 00:10:20.965

Oh, come on!



162

00:10:20.965 --> 00:10:22.845

Don't do this to me.



163

00:10:25.045 --> 00:10:27.390

Excellent.
There we go, at the end.



164

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.026

So, this one will actually
needs to be at the end,



165

00:10:31.026 --> 00:10:34.850

and most likely,
it will not be written by default.



166

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.498

So, the command that I am selecting now,



167

00:10:38.498 --> 00:10:43.830

just write it down at the bottom
of this configuration file.



168

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.870

If it's not there just write it in.



169

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.560

Just write it down and that's it.



170

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.980

This here is the path and



171

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.870

this here right next to it is
the script that I'm going to be using.



172

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:58.530

The one that I have just
fetched from the Internet.



173

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.790

Now the path can be different of course.



174

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:05.360

Since this is Kali Linux with a default
installation, pretty much everything goes



175

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.480

into the root folder and
from there it gets used elsewhere.



176

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:16.250

But anyway, this is just the path and
over here is the script itself.



177

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.350

Nothing more.



178

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:21.660

And this, you need to write in here if
you wish to use any external scripts,



179

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.170

and that's it.



180

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:26.960

Now, when you change a script,
just change the path if necessary.



181

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.100

If they're at the same place,
just change the name of the script.



182

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.755

That's all, but you do need to reset
the script proxy server in order for



183

00:11:34.755 --> 00:11:36.374

changes to take effect.



184

00:11:36.374 --> 00:11:40.850

So, press Ctrl+O to save, Enter.



185

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.710

Ctrl+X to exit.



186

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.510

Now we have completely configured squid.



187

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:53.990

Let me just type in
service squid3 restart.



188

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:55.610

This can take up awhile, I don't know.



189

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.770

Depending on what is going on.



190

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.000

As I said the configuration
file is rather lengthy.



191

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.260

And this is a virtual machine.



192

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:07.086

So it's gonna take awhile for
it to actually reload or restart.



193

00:12:07.086 --> 00:12:11.950

Until then, I'm gonna bid you farewell and
continue in the follow up tutorial.
