00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.000

Okay so let's just continue up with this follow-up tutorial on John the Ripper.



2

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.790

We have obtained root access and we needed root access



3

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.300

in order to have access to etc passwd and etc shadow



4

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.360

where the passwords are stored.



5

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.000

Now we need to go ahead and type in as root.



6

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000

"unshadow"



7

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000

Yes, my typing skills are amazing.



8

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.500

So just type in "unshadow /etc/passwd"



9

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.200

and "/etc/shadow"



10

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.000

Excellent



11

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.250

and we need to store this in some sort of file.



12

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.000

You can name it whatever you want.



13

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.990

You can actually smash your keyboard if you wish.



14

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.790

I'm gonna go ahead and name mine "pass"



15

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.000

Press ENTER



16

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.800

If you do "ls", you'll see that there is a data file named "pass"



17

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.979

Let's just go ahead and type in "cat pass"



18

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:05.900

Press ENTER



19

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.000

and there you go



20

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000

I have lots of things here, lots of hashes...



21

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000

Actually, maybe not lots of hashes.



22

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.800

Sorry about that



23

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:23.500

but you have "root :", and here you have an encryption



24

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.860

and then down below somewhere, if I can just find it...



25

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.000

There we go



26

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.900

So it says "test :" and then you have an encryption there.



27

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.049

Let's go ahead and clear the screen.



28

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.100

Now "john" has a lot of options here.



29

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.920

Let me just switch to full screen mode



30

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.000

and look --



31

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.400

You can specify certain rules.



32

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.400

You can specify files.



33

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.000

So just do a word list and then read from the word list.



34

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.400

You can have a configuration file for john itself to substitute john.com



35

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.000

which you can also alter as well



36

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.800

There are literally tons and tons of rules here



37

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.920

depending on what you are cracking



38

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.000

what sort of encryption you are cracking



39

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000

but the most specific rules are the best ones.



40

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.300

Actually, the best ones



41

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.300

That's what I wanted to say



42

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.230

The best ones are when you can actually specify certain rules



43

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.200

on your brute force attack.



44

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.400

So let's say, I don't know



45

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.500

I want you to try all the words



46

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.000

where the first letter is a capital letter



47

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.500

then the second letter is lower case letter or something of a kind



48

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.060

because it is likely the first letter will be capital



49

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.200

more likely than not



50

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.900

and if you know that the the last three characters are actually numbers



51

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.100

you can also do that as well.



52

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.900

There are a ton load of options.



53

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.600

You can do these things with crunch, as I have shown you before



54

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.400

but I just wanted to make a mention of it that it does exist



55

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.800

for John the Ripper as well.



56

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.800

However, what people generally tend to use for John the Ripper



57

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.400

is "--format - NAME"



58

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.600

Now name, of course



59

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.800

you will substitute with one of the encryption types



60

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.000

with one of the hashes



61

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.300

so it forces one of these hashes to be decrypted.



62

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.700

If you don't know which type of a hash it is, it's not a big deal at all.



63

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.200

Don't worry about it.



64

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.200

John will be able to figure it out on its own



65

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.000

but it will issue a warning.



66

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.790

Look at how many of them there are.



67

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.410

There are a lot of them



68

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.000

and as I said, if you don't know which one it is, no big deal.



69

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000

Also a very nice thing is...



70

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.500

You know those files that you download from torrents



71

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.700

and then, I don't know



72

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.790

sometimes it says that the file is zipped and that there is a password on it?



73

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.600

Well, you can use John the Ripper to actually crack it open.



74

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.000

That's very nice as well



75

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.200

but in any case, we're just gonna use John with the most basic options



76

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.100

in order to crack the password hashes for a Linux system



77

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.900

as we are cracking system passwords today.



78

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.400

You can also use this crack status



79

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.580

"emit a status line whenever a password is cracked"



80

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.760

If you have a very large file of hashes



81

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.500

you can also use this one to tell you when something is cracked



82

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.500

but generally, you just want to leave it to run to the end.



83

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.900

Anyway, let's just go ahead and clear to screen.



84

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.200

Use john



85

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.300

So just type in "john"



86

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.900

It's called John the Ripper, but the command to execute it is just John



87

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.500

and then type in the file that we have previously made.



88

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.000

So "pass", press Enter



89

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.400

and for you, its gonna say, I don't know



90

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.100

something like password's cracked or something like that.



91

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.800

For me, it says "Loaded 2 password hashes with 2 different salts"



92

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.120

So yeah, there we go.



93

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.300

It says "No password hashes left to crack"



94

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.000

because I have cracked them previously



95

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.220

but it doesn't matter whether you find them here or not.



96

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.000

What you want to do is be able to see them later on



97

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000

and that's the command that is of importance to you



98

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.700

regardless of whether you see them here or not.



99

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.720

So they will be printed out here.



100

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.200

It will say "username password"



101

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.300

However, that's not what you want.



102

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.500

What you want is "john --show"



103

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.700

Oops, sorry



104

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.000

"john --show pass"



105

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.200

Excellent



106

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.000

So you type in "john", then you type in space



107

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000

once the job is done completely



108

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000

and then space, dash dash, show, space



109

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.500

and then name of the file for which you wanted to crack the hashes



110

00:05:52.500 --> 00:06:04.500

and then it says "root : test : 0 :0 : root : /root : /bin/bash"



111

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.200

It says "root : test"  and this is the password for root.



112

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.000

So you see here - the root account, colon



113

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.800

The password for root account is test



114

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.300

and you can just disregard the rest



115

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.310

and the password for our regular user



116

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.300

test, colon, test



117

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.370

I really should be using something different here



118

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.000

other than just pretty much naming everything "test"



119

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000

because it can get a bit confusing.



120

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000

That's one of the things that I would suggest to you that you change



121

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.400

but many case, this cracking process can take a while



122

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.800

so keep that in mind.



123

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.100

John the Ripper is not perfect



124

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.100

and of course, its performance is dependent



125

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.700

on the physical capabilities of your machine.



126

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.000

If it's something rather complex and difficult



127

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.700

It's gonna take a lot longer than this.



128

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.900

Although there's always that factor of chance



129

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.010

that you will be able to figure it out a relatively short amount of time.



130

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.700

In any case, it doesn't cost you a lot to simply give it a shot



131

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.500

because you always have a chance



132

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.600

and this is the format that you will get for the files.



133

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.800

Make sure to save the files somewhere



134

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:24.100

so that you can always review them later on with "john --show" command.



135

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.200

I just want to reiterate once again



136

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.800

it makes no difference whatsoever that I wasn't shown passwords here



137

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.500

because it says "No password hashes left to crack"



138

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.330

"Loaded 2 password hashes with 2 different salts"



139

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.000

Doesn't really matter.



140

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000

All of this you will see



141

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.800

except this last line



142

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.789

and then instead of the last line



143

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:45.500

you will see something like this



144

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.000

but again, it doesn't matter to you at all



145

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.020

primarily because that's the terminal output.



146

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.200

That's the standard output.



147

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.900

You don't want to just have it there in the standard output.



148

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.410

You want to have it somewhere



149

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.900

where you are always able to access it



150

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.300

and that's why after you've cracked them



151

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.300

clear the screen and use "john --show"



152

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.800

and then the name of the file



153

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.200

in order to list them here



154

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.600

because like that, they are stored for good on your computer



155

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.200

where you can review them at any later time.



156

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.000

You do not want to be memorizing these passwords



157

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.210

and once again, do use something different other than "test"



158

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.500

You can see I was confused there for moment



159

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.000

primarily because I use these things.



160

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.240

Anyway, I bid you all farewell



161

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.400

and in the follow-up tutorial



162

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.500

I'm gonna go ahead and jump into Windows



163

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.700

and see what we can actually do there



164

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.330

and how can we extract and crack the passwords in Windows



165

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.400

or bypass them completely.



166

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.500

Until then, I'm gonna call the tutorial here



167

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.000

and I hope to see you there as well.
