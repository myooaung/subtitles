00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600

Hello everybody and welcome to this introductory video.



2

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.900

Today I will be talking ethical hacking



3

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.000

and I will also introduce you to the course itself.



4

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.700

So first off, you might have noticed



5

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.100

that the term "Ethical Hacking" is composed of two words:



6

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.300

You have "Ethical" and you have "Hacking".



7

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.800

Now hacking



8

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.200

The definition of hacking is quite broad.



9

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.500

I mean, it encompasses a very wide range of activities.



10

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.700

However, if you actually go to any of the online dictionaries, pretty much



11

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.200

and if you type in the term "Hacking"



12

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.300

generally it will say that it has something to do with computers.



13

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.200

I cannot say that that is not true



14

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.800

however, that is a small portion of the definition.



15

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.800

Rather instead, the act of hacking is actually having any system



16

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.500

and I mean any system.



17

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.900

Not just a computer system



18

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.700

Not just a digital system



19

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.200

In fact, the system doesn't even need to contain any electrical parts.



20

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.800

So literally any system having it do something that you intended it to do



21

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.570

as opposed to what it was designed to do.



22

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.500

Now here's one short example



23

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.600

that has been cited over and over again --



24

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.800

You have a lock basically



25

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.400

You have a door lock in your house



26

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.000

Everybody has one



27

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.899

l sincerely hope that you have one



28

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:34.259

and the purpose of that lock is used to prevent intruders.



29

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.900

So anybody that does not have a key cannot enter.



30

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.200

But people enter without a key anyway



31

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.500

because they pick the lock and then they enter



32

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.300

and that itself could be considered an act of hacking.



33

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.600

Also an act of burglary, but that's another subject.



34

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.600

Anyway, the ethical side of it



35

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.300

would be when you have these large automobile industries



36

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.329

Manufacturers



37

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.200

Then they hire people



38

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.900

They hire these burglars to come and test their locks.



39

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.600

So basically, they pay them very good sums of money



40

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.800

to go to their factories and try to unlock their cars.



41

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.600

This doesn't need to apply only to locks for cars.



42

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.000

It can also apply to your door locks.



43

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.400

Manufacturers have pretty much all sorts of locks.



44

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.000

They hire people to actually try and pick lock them



45

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.200

and then if they succeed doing it, they pay them a very good sum of money.



46

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.659

I do believe that prices for one car manufacturer



47

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.200

went up to one million euros if you managed to break their locks



48

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.600

But what I am trying to say here is that the ethical side of it



49

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.600

would be when you have a permission to do it.



50

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.900

When it's within the constraints of the law



51

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.700

and the act of hacking itself can be within the constraints of the law



52

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.000

But doesn't necessarily need to be.



53

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000

Anyway, we will not be focusing on those types of locks today or during this course.



54

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.400

During this course, I will teach you how to penetrate networks



55

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.900

How to exploit systems



56

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.500

How to break into computers



57

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.900

How to compromise routers, etc. You will

be able, after you finish this course you



58

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.200

After you finish this course



59

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.299

After you've absorbed all the information in it



60

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:42.299

You will gain the ability to do some serious damage.



61

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.300

Now because of that, I wish to give you a disclaimer here --



62

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.100

So first off, I do not encourage any sort of illegal activity.



63

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.000

Furthermore, I strongly advise against it and I am against it.



64

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.500

So you do not have any legit need to do anything that is against the law



65

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.200

with the knowledge that you are going to get during this course



66

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.300

because you are going to get some pretty good



67

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.000

and you can abuse it very easily.



68

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.500

It's not that difficult to abuse it.



69

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.000

The opportunities are everywhere



70

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.100

They're endless because people tend to use insecure systems



71

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.400

or they use secure systems



72

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.500

but they don't know how to operate or configure them



73

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.800

and then in turn, those security systems

become insecure.



74

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.400

But what I'm trying to tell you is there really is no need.



75

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.600

I mean, if you want to do it for the money or something like that



76

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.400

you can make same amount, if not more, in a perfectly legitimate way.



77

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.400

People will pay you to actually test their networks



78

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.300

and to see if you can find any vulnerabilities in them



79

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.200

and then report them.



80

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.400

Perhaps even fix them.



81

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.000

However if you do decide to do something against the law



82

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.100

in any country, I am not responsible for it.



83

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.900

First off, that is what I want to say --



84

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.000

I do not claim responsibility for it



85

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.900

as I have already stated that I am doing this purely for educational purposes



86

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:29.000

and I do not advocate the use of this material for any sort of illegal purposes.



87

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.500

Now I hope you understand why I had to make this disclaimer



88

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.900

and this is not



89

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.900

what I said, these are not just empty words



90

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.700

I really do stand by it, and that is my philosophy as well.



91

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.780

In any case, during this course



92

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.800

I will show you numerous examples



93

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.700

methods



94

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.800

You will need some prerequisites



95

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.400

over which I will go in the next tutorial



96

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.000

but you in for a ride, so sit down



97

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.100

be patient



98

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.000

That is a very important thing in this line of work.



99

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.300

Patience, because everybody out there



100

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.700

I mean, if you are looking at this tutorial now



101

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.100

if you type in the term "Ethical Hacking"



102

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.100

I'm guessing at some point in your lives, like myself



103

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.700

you have seen a movie that involves

some sort of hacking with computers



104

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.500

and you see this terminal and you just see them typing in something there



105

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.400

and it just basically works!



106

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.200

It works within five minutes or something like that.



107

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.080

Let me tell you something --



108

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.400

that has nothing to do with the real world

or very little do with the real world.



109

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:48.700

In the real world, people spend countless

sleepless nights



110

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.000

trying to do something.



111

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.100

Trying to obtain access



112

00:06:54.100 --> 00:07:00.200

Trying to bypass a password protected file or something of a kind in a server.



113

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.300

Trying to escalate privileges.



114

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.900

Trying to inject in, a SQL injection of something of a kind



115

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.100

and they not only spend countless nights doing it



116

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.000

but they also spend a long time planning, preparing



117

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.210

and getting a general idea of what they can do



118

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.000

how they can execute an attack, etc.



119

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.800

These are not things that you will be able to do within five minutes



120

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.530

after you sit and open up your desktop computer. Whatever.



121

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.700

You will need time



122

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.500

You will need patience



123

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.949

but above all, you will need to be curious.



124

00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:42.700

Curiosity is one of the first steps here



125

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:48.000

and obviously, since you actually chosen to listen to this tutorial.



126

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000

To go through it.



127

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.400

You do possess it already.



128

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.100

You just need to build on it a little bit more



129

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.200

and you'll be where you want to be.



130

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:02.150

In any case, I hope to see you in the next tutorial and I bid you farewell.
