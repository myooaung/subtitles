00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,040
Hello everybody, and
welcome to the tutorial.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,650
Today I've decided to do something a bit
more fun to ease the path, so to say.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,360
And we're gonna be doing some sort of
thing that people generally do for

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,320
April Fool, or something of a kind.

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,910
Basically you've got to modify
the browsing information of

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:28,390
anybody that you can spoof,
who's art you can spoof.

7
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:33,820
What this means is that you can
actually affect how they view websites.

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:40,340
For example you can flip all images on
a website upside down or you can insert

9
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:47,490
text, or perhaps you can add extra words
to Google search, or I don't know.

10
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:53,650
You can do some crazy things like change
language settings to something ridiculous,

11
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,960
like there are these fictional languages,
something from Star Trek,

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,840
I do believe that I found it on the net,
a small script, that actually

13
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,165
changes your language settings to
Klingon while browsing the internet.

14
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:09,230
[LAUGH] Can you just
imagine reading anything,

15
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:14,120
trying to read something, or trying to
translate it back, or something of a kind.

16
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,260
That wouldn't really be fun.

17
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,110
Anyway, even though this is primarily for
fun, this part anyway,

18
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,805
you still, of course,

19
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:28,140
would need a permission, unless you are on
your own wireless or something of a kind.

20
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,470
Anyway, I have a small instruction
script for myself here, just so

21
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:37,100
that I don't mess anything
up during this procedure.

22
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,520
I have already done it, and
it seems to work to a good extent.

23
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,400
Some of the scripts, they won't always
work, but a good amount of the time,

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,850
you will be able to achieve what you want.

25
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,180
Anyway, first of all,
we need something called Squid.

26
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,240
And Squid is a proxy.

27
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,230
So let me just show you, apt-cache search

28
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:07,400
squid, and I'm gonna say 3.

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,540
Also you might have noticed
that I am back in Kali Linux.

30
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,350
And Kali Linux comes with a lot
of these tools pre-installed so

31
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,620
I don't need to go through a lot
of hassle or something like that.

32
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:26,870
And the configuration is a bit simpler
as you have a set of predefined here.

33
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:35,510
Also, I don't need direct access to
wireless for this sort of an attack.

34
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,400
Anyway, we're gonna need to install Squid.

35
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:44,970
You can see here squid3,
full featured web proxy cache, HTTP proxy.

36
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:50,282
In order to install it, opps, not yum,

37
00:02:50,282 --> 00:02:56,861
type in app-get install,
and then Squid3 -y.

38
00:02:56,861 --> 00:02:58,743
Press Enter and this will install it.

39
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:02,940
I'm not going to press Enter now
because I already have it installed.

40
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,150
That is one of the tools which we
are going to need but there is more.

41
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,510
You will need Apache Web Server for this.

42
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,925
So, again with the yum, apt-get search and

43
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:21,430
we're gonna need apache.

44
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,111
Apache is a well known,
oops, it's not get it's.

45
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:32,740
Apache, sorry.

46
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:39,100
Apache is a well known web server used
by the majority of the world today.

47
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,140
I don't know what percentage
of user actually uses Apache,

48
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,690
but lately there was some other web
servers which became really popular.

49
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,737
For example, Nginx,
that's gained in popularity really fast.

50
00:03:52,737 --> 00:03:58,760
Apparently it's a lot faster.

51
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,205
I can't find the exact name of the package
here but it doesn't really matter.

52
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:08,870
Look, just type in yum, oops again.

53
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,300
Just type in apt-get install apache2.

54
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,280
Press Enter and then there you go.

55
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:21,110
It says that Apache2 is already
the newest version, and

56
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:25,260
that doesn't really, oh,
wait, I need 62 upgrades.

57
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,150
It doesn't matter, I'm not going
to do any of the upgrades now.

58
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,915
But anyway,
this is the command to install it.

59
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:32,280
Apache2 is the name of the package.

60
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,080
I could have found it
in the list up there,

61
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,850
but figured I would just save some time
and give you the direct command for

62
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:43,050
you to install it so that we don't
have too much of a time loss there.

63
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,970
Anyway, go ahead and clear the screen.

64
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,860
The next thing that you're going
to need is a bunch of scripts

65
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,270
and I do believe I have them here.

66
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,488
No, not these scripts.

67
00:04:57,488 --> 00:05:01,068
Hm, where do you suppose they are?

68
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:05,748
Well, okay I do have them but
they're on my clipboard.

69
00:05:05,748 --> 00:05:13,068
Okay, so it's apt-get -y Install,
and you need these three programs.

70
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:16,190
So imagemagick, ghostscript, and jp2a.

71
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,090
I've written for myself here,
ghostscript optional.

72
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,500
You will only need ghostscripts for

73
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:28,220
certain scripts that we're
gonna download from the net.

74
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,793
Not sure exactly which ones but
you can just install it,

75
00:05:30,793 --> 00:05:33,770
it doesn't take a lot of space and
it doesn't take a lot of time.

76
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:39,670
Let me just see if I have all of them
installed and yes I do have all three

77
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,700
of them installed here so no problems
there but if you don't just go ahead and

78
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,660
run the same command, of course, and
you will have it installed no problems.

79
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,190
Just go ahead and clear the screen.

80
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,960
Anyway, those three tools,

81
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,590
we are going to need in order
to actually perform this attack.

82
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,108
So let's go over them one more time.

83
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:09,146
It's Squid, Apache, and these last
three scripts that I have shown you.

84
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:11,546
Not three scripts, sorry,
I keep on calling them scripts.

85
00:06:11,546 --> 00:06:14,466
They're script,
well this one is a script interpreter.

86
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:20,944
And this is actually, I don't know,
this is just a program for

87
00:06:20,944 --> 00:06:26,590
manipulating images on the Web or
something of a kind.

88
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:31,810
Anyway, so these three as well, and then
we will be able to perform this attack.

89
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,000
Make sure that you have
them all installed.

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,060
We don't need to configure anything,
we will do the configuration in the next

91
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,290
tutorial, but make sure that you
have all three of them installed.

92
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,960
Before you start watching the next
tutorial because there I will actually go

93
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,010
into the configuration and we will see
what we need to do in order to prepare.

94
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,550
Some of the things we've already done,

95
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,750
if you've kept the configuration
from the previous tutorials.

96
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:59,340
But if not,
you're gonna need to do a few things here.

97
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,489
Anyway, I bid you all farewell, and
I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
