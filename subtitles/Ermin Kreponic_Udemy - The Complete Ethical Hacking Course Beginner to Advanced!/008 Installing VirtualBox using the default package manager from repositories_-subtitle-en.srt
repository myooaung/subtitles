1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everybody and welcome to this
tutorial.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Today I will show you another more reliable way

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,950
to install VirtualBox.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,200
If you're wondering why on earth

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,030
did I show you the other way using the RPM

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,000
if we're not going to use it here.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,300
Well, it's always good to have another option.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,100
Plus the procedure is exactly the same

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,800
if you're installing any other RPM packets.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,100
So you just type in "rpm -i"

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,400
and that you just type in the name of the package that you have downloaded

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,600
and that you wish to install.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,420
The procedure is exactly the same.

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,600
I would recommend passing an H argument as well

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,800
to give you a status bar

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,000
because if you just go ahead and type it in like this

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,420
within the name of the package.

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,129
It's gonna install it, no problems of
course

19
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,200
but the screen is just going to wait.

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,660
Nothing is going to happen.

21
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,400
You might think it's bugged or something like that

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,800
during the installation procedure.

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,700
Like this, with H, there's a status bar
that shows

24
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,989
so you know that something in the background is happening

25
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:05,900
but as I said, it's good to have another
option.

26
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,900
What we want to do today and now is actually install VirtualBox

27
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,300
using the default packet manager called "yum"

28
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,000
and pull the package from the repositories.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,600
Now what are repositories?

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,600
Repositories are places where software packages are stored

31
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,700
and for Linux distros

32
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,230
and then you can pull those packets

33
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,900
those software packets

34
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,700
from your Linux distro using the default packet manager.

35
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,100
It's very simple.

36
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,000
It's extremely easy

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,200
and it's one of those things that you will absolutely need to know how to do

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,800
because you will be installing and uninstalling a lot of things

39
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,000
during the course of your pen testing careers.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,700
During the course of pretty much any pen testing exercise in general.

41
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,000
So let me just demonstrate this to you.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,200
You type in "yum"and then you give it a command.

43
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,300
First of all, use yum to call your default packet manager

44
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,700
which is yum basically, because I am using Fedora

45
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,500
but if I was using some sort of a debian distro

46
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,200
It could be "aptitude"

47
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,000
or it could be "apt-get"

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,200
and some other distros have their own packet managers

49
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,250
but we're not going to get into those now.

50
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,700
Later on, I will show you what Kali Linux is using.

51
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,000
That is the Linux distro that we will be
using

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
in order to conduct some of the pen testing exercises.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So first off, you type in "yum" as I said

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,910
and then type in "search"

55
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:47,000
which you're basically telling yum what to do.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,380
You wanted to search for something, so you just type in "search".

57
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,599
It's pretty much exactly the same as
English language

58
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,690
you just kind of need to figure out the logical of it

59
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:02,000
and then you want to search for an
approximate name of the package.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
that you want.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,920
So you don't perhaps know the full name or something like that.

62
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,500
Don't worry about it

63
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,519
just type in a portion of the name.

64
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:11,500
It will suffice

65
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,400
and pretty much everything that contains that portion of the name

66
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,100
will be displayed.

67
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,630
So we know what we want.

68
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,400
It's VirtualBox

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
and you might think that this is the of  the package

70
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,700
but no, it is not

71
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,000
Soon you will see

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,579
and there you go.

73
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:29,650
It has printed out every packet

74
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,800
every package that contains VirtualBox in it's name.

75
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,290
The word VirtualBox in the name
with the package

76
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,500
or in the description of the package

77
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,800
because you see you have the name of the package here

78
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,359
colon

79
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:47,400
and then you have the description of the package here.

80
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,800
There are a lot of things

81
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,300
a lot of things with the name "VirtualBox"

82
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,739
and you're wondering perhaps which ones to install.

83
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:58,120
Well, you need the Knod one, and here you have the kernel version

84
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,100
and fedora version

85
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,000
So FC would be the Fedora version

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,600
and you have the architecture

87
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,739
It's 64

88
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,079
I can't select it -- there we go -- It's 64

89
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:15,000
and here you have the kernel version.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So you can compare it to what you have

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,349
and based on what you have

92
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:20,700
what your operating system is

93
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,700
you can take it from there, assuming it's a Fedora 20.

94
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,210
You can use any other distro.

95
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,000
The procedure is fairly the same.

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Later on, in the question parts

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
if you are using, for example, a Debian based distro

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,900
or an openSUSE or something like that

99
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,700
feel free to ask me if you can't manage it there.

100
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,200
I will help you out, no problems

101
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,009
but for the time being, I'm just go ahead and install it here.

102
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:50,700
Let me just go ahead and clear the screen

103
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,160
in order to install the package.

104
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,400
Need to type "yum install"

105
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,200
and then you need to go ahead and type the name of your package

106
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,800
which would be the last one for us.

107
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
For me, anyway.

108
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
This one.

109
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,690
Whoops...here we go.

110
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:09,500
The name is a bit long, so I'm just gonna go ahead and copy it

111
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,979
but you see, there is one fundamental problem here.

112
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,300
The VirtualBox package

113
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:22,100
is not found in the default repositories of Fedora

114
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,240
and that is a bit of a problem

115
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,400
primarily because not have these commands would actually work

116
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,200
if I did not previously import RPM fusion repositories.

117
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,300
"RPM fusion" is simply the name for a certain type of repositories

118
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,500
containing certain types of packets.

119
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,130
So I have imported those repositories

120
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,400
and now I can pull information and packages from them.

121
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,630
If I did not do that previously

122
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,110
I would not have been able to do any of
these things

123
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:59,500
yum, search VirtualBox would yield no results whatsoever.

124
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,690
I would get a blank screen.

125
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,400
I would get like a message here saying that no packages were found

126
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,610
that matched this particular name

127
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,000
and then just a black screen.

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,100
That's it.

129
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,360
So that could be problematic.

130
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,300
In order to solve that problem

131
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,800
you need to go ahead and open up your favorite browser.

132
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,700
I already have this website open to save a bit of time

133
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:26,600
It says rpmfusion.org/configuration

134
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,200
but here, let me just go ahead and search for it.

135
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,900
So, type into any search engine "rpmfusion"

136
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,900
It's gonna pop. Do not worry.

137
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,070
So it's rpmfusion.org

138
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,500
Click on the website, open it up

139
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,500
and here you're gonna get instructions immediately.

140
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,700
It's a very simplistic website.

141
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,500
There isn't any tinkering that you need think about

142
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,000
or some advance configuration.

143
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,100
Nothing a kind.

144
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,300
It just says "For users"

145
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,800
and says "Enable RPM Fusion on your system"

146
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,100
Click OK

147
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,200
Uh, not okay. Just click on the link and there you go!

148
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,670
You get a listing here.

149
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,200
You get a listing downloads.

150
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,000
It says "free" and "nonfree"

151
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,950
and don't be intimidated with this "nonfree"

152
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:21,000
You do not need to pay for anything

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,500
It is nonfree for redistributable software
that is not open source software

154
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,360
as defined by Fedora licensee guidelines.

155
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,000
So this nonfree does not refer to money.

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,610
You do not need to pay anything here.

157
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,800
I cannot make it any more clearer.

158
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,800
It simply refers that the software is not open source software

159
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,800
as defined by Fedora licensee guidelines.

160
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,970
So, it might actually be open source but it just doesn't fit

161
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:58,000
within the boundaries of Fedora
licensing guidelines.

162
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,500
Anyway, that part is not that interesting to you.

163
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,700
Down below, the thing that you need to know here

164
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,800
is that nonfree is actually free, in terms of money

165
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,300
but not free in terms of source code.

166
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,000
Anyway, as I said, that's not really that important for you

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
anyway, at the moment.

168
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,600
Down here you have

169
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,800
actually RPM packages.

170
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,600
Remember from the previous tutorial

171
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,000
I've shown you the extension ".rpm"

172
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,200
When you download the package

173
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,300
we could actually download one of these.

174
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,150
Actually I would download the first one

175
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:38,390
and then install it using my RPM software.

176
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,240
Just type in "rpm -i", and then I would

177
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,400
there we go

178
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,230
I just clicked on it

179
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,040
then I would pass this file name as an
argument as well

180
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,500
and it would install it, no problems as well.

181
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,800
but I don't really want to do that at the moment.

182
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,200
I want to show you a different way of doing it.

183
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,740
If you're wondering why it is being repeated twice

184
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:07,000
this is for free and this is for nonfree.

185
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Excellent

186
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,800
What we want is the command line setup using RPM.

187
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,000
It says here "Fedora 14" to the most current.

188
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,480
So mine is 20.

189
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,600
It's gonna work there, no problems as well.

190
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,200
So you have this very long command

191
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:30,700
and you don't really need to know what every single portion of this command is

192
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,490
or what it does.

193
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:39,000
basic sum total it imports a repository into your system

194
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,100
that you are going to use later on.

195
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,600
They have given this command,so you can do it from tap basically

196
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,300
You don't need to go about doing things or anything of a kind.

197
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,000
You basically just copy paste this and run it.

198
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,200
You are using your default package manager.

199
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,300
You are using local install option.

200
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,970
You are not checking for certain types of keys.

201
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:05,700
You are a giving it the place from which to pull it

202
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,000
and so on and so forth.

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,100
But later on as we progress through this
tutorial

204
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:17,240
we will deal extensively with Linux command line.

205
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,500
So only then will these things become clearer to you

206
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,700
once I actually explain some of the basic and fundamental things

207
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,300
then you will be able to understand things

208
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,100
such as those listed is this bracket

209
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,300
sorry not bracket

210
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,500
within the confines of this parentheses

211
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
and so on

212
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,000
because if I start explaining it now

213
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,200
it would no sense

214
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,700
and it simply complicate things further.

215
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,000
And I said, later on when we get into the command line interface of Linux

216
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,370
When I start explaining it in great detail

217
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,200
there I will begin from scratch.

218
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,000
Then move you basically from beginner to advanced user

219
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
In a relatively short amount of time

220
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,760
and then you will be able to understand what all these things are.

221
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,100
For the time being, just copy this content

222
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,340
which is within the confines of these quotation marks

223
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,400
and paste it into your terminal.

224
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,800
So you do need to be root

225
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,500
let me just go ahead and exit

226
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,690
I am no longer root, as you can see.

227
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,700
I am now my regular user - "Chronic"

228
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,500
Just type "SU" type

229
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,700
Type in your password

230
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,900
and paste this.

231
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,000
Press "Enter"

232
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,800
okay, obviously it won't install here

233
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,900
because I already have it installed.

234
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:49,300
Yeah, it says "nothing to do" whatsoever

235
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,500
but on your system, where you do not have RPM fusion installed

236
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,400
this would just fly as well.

237
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,170
This would just pass, no problems

238
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,900
and you would successfully have installed RPM fusion

239
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,200
on your system as well.

240
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,000
So "clear"

241
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,300
Anyway, I just wanted to show you something else

242
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,350
that I neglected to show you a moment ago.

243
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,900
This command that we've ran

244
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,920
it actually installs free and nonfree repositories

245
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,000
If you just take a closer look to what I
am highlighting at the moment.

246
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,600
This is the free, so it says

247
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,700
http://downloadl1rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/

248
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,700
rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm

249
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,450
and down below, you have the second address

250
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,300
again, download http://download1.rpmfusion.org

251
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,800
and it says nonfree.

252
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,420
So I'm highlighting the entire thing

253
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,510
zoom it in a bit more so everybody can
see

254
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,300
and there you go.

255
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,400
You have two completely

256
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,700
well, they're not completely different addresses

257
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,000
but they are definitely different addresses

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,600
referring to different types of repositories.

259
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,000
Anyway, now can go back to your terminal.

260
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,200
Do not log out of root

261
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,639
Stay as root, because you will root privileges in order do this.

262
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,000
Type in "yum"

263
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,800
Search

264
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Once again

265
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,200
Virtualbox

266
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,000
Press "Enter"

267
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,389
Take the last one or whatever one suits your current kernel.

268
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:37,600
You check the current kernel by typing
in "uname -a"

269
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,029
and here you go.

270
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:44,000
So I'm 3.18.7-100

271
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,200
3.18.7-100.fc20

272
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,700
fc20 and there you have the architecture listed here as well.

273
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,900
So clear the screen

274
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,500
Type in "yum"

275
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,000
Install

276
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,500
Paste the name of the package

277
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,000
Press "Space dash Y"

278
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,300
and if you have this command, just press "Enter"

279
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,700
and it will install.

280
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,300
It will run through.

281
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,600
I've already installed VirtualBox to save some time as well.

282
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,079
You will have it up and running on your
system

283
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:24,600
and after you've installed it, do not forget to type in "yum"

284
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,129
Update as well.

285
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:29,189
So let the system just run through the updates.

286
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:33,400
So you would make sure that you have the latest version

287
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,100
That you have everything up-to-date and running.

288
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,800
In any case, that would be it for this tutorial.

289
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,100
In the next one, I will start VirtualBox up

290
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,000
explain some of it's features

291
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,139
and hopefully through the follow-up tutorials

292
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:53,000
I will start installing an operating system within my virtual machine

293
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,329
within virtual environment

294
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:57,389
and we'll see how that process goes.

295
00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:01,000
Thank you for watching and I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
