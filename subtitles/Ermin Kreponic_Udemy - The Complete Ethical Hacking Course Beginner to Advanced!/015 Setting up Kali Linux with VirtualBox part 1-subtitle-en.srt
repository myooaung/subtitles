1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,305
Welcome back everybody.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:06,907
The download is finished,
so we have it in the Downloads folder.

3
00:00:07,142 --> 00:00:09,734
Just open up Finder and go into Downloads folder,

4
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:13,182
so Finder is here, and then
go into the Downloads folder

5
00:00:13,217 --> 00:00:14,700
and you'll see something like this

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,350
Kali-Linux-2.0.0-vbox-amd64.7z

7
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:24,630
Now, if there's a newer
version, feel free to download it,

8
00:00:24,665 --> 00:00:27,953
you should be fine, it should work
without any problems of whatsoever.

9
00:00:27,988 --> 00:00:31,683
Now what we need to do is actually unpackage this

10
00:00:31,718 --> 00:00:35,122
because this is a zip file, this is a packet file.

11
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:39,519
Feel free to go to the App Store

12
00:00:39,554 --> 00:00:41,749
and download software from there if you wish.

13
00:00:41,884 --> 00:00:45,340
I, personally, have not
installed Homebrew here yet,

14
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,578
Macports, anything like that.
I've opted to go for Homebrew

15
00:00:48,613 --> 00:00:51,143
and I'm gonna go ahead and install it now

16
00:00:51,178 --> 00:00:54,709
and then I'm gonna install
a software in order to unzip this file,

17
00:00:54,744 --> 00:00:55,886
to unpackage it.

18
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:59,942
If you have some other software
that you wish to use or prefer to use

19
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:03,835
you don't need to follow
through this entire tutorial,

20
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,205
you can go ahead and skip it
but if you'd like to do it as I did

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,597
feel free to follow along.

22
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:15,007
Any way is fine as long as
you can unpackage this file.

23
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:21,613
So let's go ahead and open
Safari and let's go ahead and search for

24
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:28,328
"homebrew mac". There we go,

25
00:01:28,363 --> 00:01:31,343
the missing package manager for OS X.

26
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:33,874
It should be the first one that pops.

27
00:01:35,436 --> 00:01:37,925
It doesn't really have https encryption,

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,803
but then again there isn't anything,

29
00:01:39,838 --> 00:01:42,742
you don't need to log
into this site or anything like that.

30
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,323
You only have installation instructions,

31
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:47,920
which I myself am going to follow.

32
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:49,993
No big deal, really.

33
00:01:50,156 --> 00:01:53,525
So let's go ahead and copy this.

34
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,706
All that I did to copy was double tap to select

35
00:01:57,741 --> 00:01:59,808
or triple tap to select the entire thing.

36
00:01:59,843 --> 00:02:04,913
Press Cmd+C and then
I'm gonna open up my terminal here

37
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:09,377
and this is a horrendous
looking color, if you ask me,

38
00:02:10,615 --> 00:02:12,222
but well, no big deal.

39
00:02:12,457 --> 00:02:15,742
I just paste this command and press Enter.

40
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:18,313
I'm probably gonna be required sudo privileges.

41
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:23,583
No, OK, apparently not.

42
00:02:23,618 --> 00:02:27,665
The "Xcrun" command requires
the command line developer tools.

43
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,051
Would you like to install the tools now?

44
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:37,808
OK, install them. Mac SDK and Xcode agreement.

45
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,772
Fine, whatever. Should be fine.

46
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:49,507
OK, so it says less than a minute.

47
00:02:52,524 --> 00:02:55,151
That should finish up fairly fast.

48
00:02:57,081 --> 00:03:01,709
So I hope that I got the
site right: brew.sh. That should be the one.

49
00:03:02,044 --> 00:03:06,715
That was advertised and
I pretty much have everywhere else.

50
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:12,752
You can also go to Homebrew
GitHub and follow the link from there.

51
00:03:13,812 --> 00:03:15,387
It should be in the Read me.

52
00:03:15,922 --> 00:03:21,862
What packages are available?
Homebrew summarised on the homepage.

53
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:26,507
So there we go, this is the homepage, brew.sh.

54
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:32,488
OK, so let's just do this.

55
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,632
So that seems to be fine.

56
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:55,330
It says "press Return to
continue or any other key to abort".

57
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:59,277
Go ahead and press Return and let it fly.

58
00:03:59,612 --> 00:04:03,556
So now you will be
prompted for administrator password,

59
00:04:04,988 --> 00:04:08,616
you do need to be either using the admin account

60
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:12,752
or log into your admin account via the terminal.

61
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:15,460
To log into your admin account
via the terminal you can just...

62
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:19,461
I'll show you how to it, actually.
You can just use the "su" command,

63
00:04:19,496 --> 00:04:23,750
so "su", space, admin account, user name, Enter,

64
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:25,409
and then you'll type in your password

65
00:04:25,444 --> 00:04:27,448
and then type in whatever you need to type in.

66
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:29,744
Just type in this command that I've typed in,

67
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:31,911
or that I've copy-pasted pretty much from the net.

68
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:34,674
So let's go ahead and type in our password.

69
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:40,767
And it's going, it's starting.

70
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:44,306
It's downloading and installing Homebrew.

71
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:47,204
I actually have no idea how long this will take,

72
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:52,015
it'd probably be just
easier to set up an Apple ID

73
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,546
but I don't really feel like doing that...

74
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:58,932
I don't really feel like it at the moment,

75
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:00,668
I like to go the long way around and

76
00:05:00,803 --> 00:05:03,053
I do believe that I need this anyway,

77
00:05:04,218 --> 00:05:06,913
not for the course,
but for all things that I need to do

78
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:09,930
and I've figured it should be
a nice thing to show to everybody

79
00:05:09,965 --> 00:05:12,893
how they can do it without much hassle.

80
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:17,576
Let's type in "brew search".
Let's see if this works like Linux,

81
00:05:17,611 --> 00:05:21,343
that would be awesome if
it does, like the Linux packet manager.

82
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:25,540
Brew search...

83
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,085
I don't know... 7zip

84
00:05:33,273 --> 00:05:37,892
You're going to find... There we go,
p7zip, I know that one from Linux.

85
00:05:37,927 --> 00:05:43,154
I can use that one, so "brew install",

86
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:47,393
it's awesome because I get
Linux-like functionalities in Mac

87
00:05:48,462 --> 00:05:50,787
and I really install things with the command line

88
00:05:51,222 --> 00:05:54,587
You might argue that it's simpler to use a GUI,

89
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:57,802
but I'm not feeling it.

90
00:06:00,452 --> 00:06:04,683
You have an interface
which you need to follow through,

91
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:07,672
you have a bunch of
things that you need to click on, etc.

92
00:06:07,707 --> 00:06:10,549
Like this I just type in the name
of the package and install, that's it.

93
00:06:10,884 --> 00:06:15,857
Downloading HT binary,
pouring Yosemite bottle...

94
00:06:17,802 --> 00:06:22,365
Should be fine now,
let's go ahead and try typing in p7.

95
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:26,553
No. What was it called?

96
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:35,019
I'll see where I am, and then
I need to go to the Downloads folder

97
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:38,981
and I have a file which needs unzipping, so

98
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:42,244
I could either go with a GUI,
but let's see if I can manage in the terminal.

99
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:48,833
"Unzip", nice, OK, you have it.

100
00:06:51,226 --> 00:06:53,433
Excellent, so let's press Enter.

101
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:58,512
End-of-central-directory signature not found.

102
00:06:58,747 --> 00:07:03,567
It's not a zipfile...
Alright, so I got the wrong one.

103
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:08,328
I'm guessing it is not extracted.

104
00:07:09,977 --> 00:07:12,911
Of course not. So, let's use...

105
00:07:17,307 --> 00:07:19,555
Let's try using the GUI to actually extract it,

106
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,559
because I completely forgot the command

107
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:23,447
and I'm pretty sure this won't work.

108
00:07:24,142 --> 00:07:25,671
Choose application.

109
00:07:30,853 --> 00:07:36,832
"7zip". Here. Does the Homebrew
function in this manner?

110
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,143
No. It does not.
Keep in mind that I could have done all of this

111
00:07:42,178 --> 00:07:45,591
prior to this, but I wanted
to encounter all the problems

112
00:07:45,826 --> 00:07:49,295
the very first time Mac
user would encounter so that

113
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,621
everybody could see that it is doable.

114
00:07:52,756 --> 00:07:55,337
And if I have to eat my
words at a certain period of time,

115
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:57,958
well, I shall eat them, I guess.

116
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:09,543
How about if we do "ls /bin/"?
It should be in the bin directory, right?

117
00:08:19,294 --> 00:08:20,848
Nope, not here.

118
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:23,895
Let's see what the
installation folder was, it should be

119
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,481
/usr/local/cellar/p7zip

120
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:02,830
ChangeLog, readme, todo list, bin, share.

121
00:09:02,965 --> 00:09:06,777
Let's go into the bin. There we are!

122
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,952
"7z --help", so give me the Help button.

123
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:26,389
Add files to archive, Benchmark,
Delete files, Extract files from archive

124
00:09:26,424 --> 00:09:29,292
without using directory names.

125
00:09:30,588 --> 00:09:34,617
Fine, let's try the extract, "-e"

126
00:09:41,002 --> 00:09:44,755
/Downloads/. If you were
wondering what this curved sign, tilde, is

127
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,027
that's the shortcut for the
current user's Home directory.

128
00:09:49,462 --> 00:09:53,534
I could have just typed in like this on Linux,

129
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:55,756
if I'm not mistaken it should work.

130
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:07,505
No, actually. That's not how you
type into your Home directory in a Mac,

131
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,122
that is how you type it
in Linux, but doesn't matter.

132
00:10:10,157 --> 00:10:14,791
This is a universal shortcut for
the Home directory of the current user,

133
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:21,350
so I have Kali... 7z,
press Enter. Incorrect command line.

134
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:23,046
I wonder what the problem is.

135
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:36,128
So I am currently here,
and I would like to make it all the way to

136
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:43,155
Home. That's not Downloads,
it's not giving me anything else.

137
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,564
OK, so let's see where it
actually is physically located

138
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:50,898
because as you can see, I'm quite struggling here.

139
00:10:55,836 --> 00:10:58,086
Then we're gonna go into Users

140
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,831
Udemy and then Downloads.

141
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:07,613
I hope that you're
enjoying me struggling on a Mac,

142
00:11:07,748 --> 00:11:09,688
which is quite interesting, I guess,

143
00:11:09,723 --> 00:11:11,374
or it's quite boring for some people.

144
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:17,547
Let's use the same command as before to get help

145
00:11:17,582 --> 00:11:20,005
because I really need some assistance with this.

146
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:27,528
It says "7z command, switches,
archive names, file names, affiliates".

147
00:11:27,763 --> 00:11:33,155
That all seems to be fine and
dandy, and I need to pass in a command "e".

148
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,193
Maybe it's not passed the way I think it is passed.

149
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,978
Maybe it's passed without a dash,
so that could also be a possibility,

150
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:45,096
let's see if that work out.
Different systems, different formats.

151
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:49,986
Voilà. There we go. I did manage to figure it out.

152
00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:53,155
I'm sure that there will be a lot of people

153
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,780
who will say "why did you have to do this?"

154
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,863
"you're really showing that
you don't really know how to do it".

155
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:01,958
But as I said, I got a Mac a couple of days ago

156
00:12:02,193 --> 00:12:06,277
and I thought it would be
a very good idea to actually just

157
00:12:06,512 --> 00:12:11,149
record it as I do it to
encounter these exact same problems

158
00:12:11,184 --> 00:12:15,149
that you would encounter,
so that I would be able to better relate

159
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:19,144
to all the people who
possibly experience any problems,

160
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:21,506
so that I would struggle
and that you would see how I struggle

161
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,404
and how I've found solutions to the problems,

162
00:12:25,885 --> 00:12:29,812
in such a way I can better help you all out.

163
00:12:29,847 --> 00:12:32,170
So this is processing, this might take a while.

164
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:35,306
And we're just gonna leave it to run

165
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:37,100
and then we're gonna see what becomes of it.

166
00:12:37,165 --> 00:12:38,848
I might actually pause the tutorial here

167
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:43,999
and then continue it in the follow-up lecture

168
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,004
and see how that works out.

169
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:49,994
I'm thinking of giving it
a little bit more time and

170
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:54,047
then actually pausing it, but...

171
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:58,144
I wish I had a lot of other people to consult now,

172
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:01,646
but I'm alone here,
I am doing it for the first time,

173
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,644
so forgive any mistakes that I do make,

174
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:07,559
but at least I showed the
solutions for all the mistakes I make,

175
00:13:07,694 --> 00:13:10,473
which in advance solved your possible problems.

176
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:15,333
I hear the drive, it's spinning pretty fast,

177
00:13:15,368 --> 00:13:17,933
I wish I had an SSD at this point of time,

178
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:22,081
but price, that was a bit
high for a Mac with an SSD,

179
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:25,484
and considering I just got it for Udemy...

180
00:13:26,488 --> 00:13:28,100
You will forgive me for that, of course.

181
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,191
So I'm just gonna split the tutorial here

182
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,560
and then we're gonna go ahead and continue on

183
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:38,466
in the follow-up when
the unpackaging is actually over and done.
