00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Today I will show you how you can actually crack WiFi

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,200
Today we will actually get into it, now that all the prep work is done

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,500
and now as we have all the tools installed and our system set up.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,800
The first thing that we will need to do is set our network wireless card

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,500
into monitor mode.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,900
Type in ifconfig, press ENTER

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,000
and this option will display all the network interfaces that are available.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,200
My wireless interface is called wlp2s0

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,000
a bit of a strange name, I know

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
but Fedora has a custom for giving strange names

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
like my wired connection is called p8p1

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,600
which is kinda weird, but okay nevermind

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,500
just see which ones yours is and how is it called

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,300
and adapt accordingly.

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,170
Anyway I'm gonna use wlp2s0 in order for me to configure it

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,000
function in monitor mode.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,800
There are two ways --

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,000
So the first one is what I usually use to set it in monitor mode

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,300
and the second one is what I usually use to actually check

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,500
if there are any problems whatsoever.

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,600
So go ahead then type in ifcongif again

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,000
wlp2s0

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
which is the name of my wireless network card

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,600
and type in "down"

26
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,400
Let's shut our wireless card down completely.

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,700
Let's turn it off

28
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,500
and now we can do some modifications to it

29
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:38,000
Type in "iwconfig wlp2s0 mode monitor"

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,700
Again, "ifconfig wlp2s0 up"

31
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,909
and now our network card is configured to function in monitor mode.

32
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,200
While before this it was functioning in the promiscuous mode.

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,000
There are several names for it, but promiscuous mode is the most common

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,700
and the difference between the two operating modes

35
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,300
is that one mode allows...

36
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,000
and there you go.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,600
I have my wireless connection deactivated in the upper right corner.

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,000
The difference between the two modes is that in one mode

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,300
general network cards are configured to accept all packages

40
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,300
regardless if they were meant for them or not

41
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,440
and in promiscuous mode, they will accept packages

42
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,400
that are meant specifically for them.

43
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,970
Now I'm gonna go ahead and clear the screen

44
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,000
and finally start using some of the software packages

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
that come with aircrack.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,910
I have a list of commands here for you which we will use today

47
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,000
on my right side

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,200
and we're gonna use a few other ones

49
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,300
but these are the basic ones.

50
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,640
These are the ones that you absolutely need to know.

51
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:53,500
So let me just go ahead and type in "airmon-ng check wlp2s0"

52
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:00,000
I want to see if there are any possible processes that could cause problems

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,800
that would cause interference

54
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,800
and I see that there are quite a bit of them.

55
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,200
Now one of the first things that you need to kill is the network manager

56
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,800
or you should

57
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,000
because even though it doesn't actually directly interfere with the functioning

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
it does spawn some other processes that might interfere

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,800
like your active internet connection here

60
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,000
The dhclient

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,500
especially if your network manager is configured to automatically connect

62
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,800
to a certain network

63
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,000
or to a wired network that you plug into your computer.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So let's go ahead and kill...

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,300
I'm not gonna take any chances today

66
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,500
I'm gonna go ahead and kill the network manager

67
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,100
and then I will start killing the rest.

68
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,000
So let's repeat the airmon-ng check

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,500
Excellent

70
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,800
Now I have a few more of these.

71
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,900
Next one to kill...

72
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,000
You do need to kill them in a certain order though

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,200
because they tend to spawn each other and you kill a process

74
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,000
but you do a check once more

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,600
and you realize it's still up and running

76
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,570
even though you've killed it as root.

77
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,800
It will kill it but it will restart it as well.

78
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Let's just go ahead and kill the dhclient as well

79
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,000
in order to prevent interference

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,410
and the rest of killing can be done in any way you like.

81
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:32,800
Let's just go ahead and kill 1556 1215 1216

82
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,300
Excellent

83
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's check one more time

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So 1556

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's see...Will this work?

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
avahi-daemon are the only ones running.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,700
Apparently I have to kill the wpa-supplicant first

88
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,000
and then I can kill these.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,700
It can be frustrating, primarily because you can't do them all at once.

90
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,800
You gotta type in commands time and time again.

91
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,300
Excellent

92
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,700
No such process running

93
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,000
There we go

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,300
Let me just go ahead and clear the screen

95
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,300
and always perform a second check.

96
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,200
You see nothing has popped.

97
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,000
Nothing should present any problems now.

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,200
Let's just go ahead and clear the screen.

99
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:21,500
The next thing that we want to do is perform a scan of our environment here

100
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,200
to see what sort of networks do we have

101
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,200
and who is connected to which network.

102
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,000
Now this you cannot see with the network manager.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
With network manager

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,500
you can only see visible wireless access points around you

105
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:44,000
while on the other hand, one of the tools that comes with aircrack

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
you can actually see not only wireless access points around you

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,200
but you can also see who is connected to them, which is a very nice feature.

108
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,190
Let's just go ahead and type in the first command from my selected list here.

109
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,000
It's "airodump-ng wlp2s0"

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,400
wlp2so is our interface

111
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:13,000
So "airmon-ng wlp2s0"

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Not airmon. Sorry

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,600
"airodump-ng wlp2s0"

114
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,000
A bit of an inconvenience with my talking and writing.

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Never was good at that

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,400
but you can see here, these are all the wireless access points.

117
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,000
This one is mine

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I have created this specifically for this purpose, for this tutorial.

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It has a good password...strong password

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,419
and we are going to be cracking it today.

121
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:49,000
Keep in mind that the signal strength...

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,100
Okay, let me just cancel the scanning process now

123
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,900
and I just want to explain a few things that you can see here

124
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,500
during the scanning process itself.

125
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:07,200
BSSID is the MAC address of the device, which is a wireless access point.

126
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Excellent

127
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,000
So the BSSID is the MAC address of that wireless access point

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The PWR is the strength of the signal

129
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,600
-15 is a lot better than -30

130
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,800
Let's put it so

131
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,949
-57

132
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,000
It's not going to be the best of connections.

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
-78 or -84

134
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,200
You might be able to connect them

135
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,900
but this is not going to be a good connection at all.

136
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,900
However, even though the signals are this weak

137
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,000
if you have a good enough wireless card

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,600
you will be able to perform the authentication

139
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,400
and therefore, I will be able to render any of these networks that you see here

140
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,900
pretty much inoperable

141
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,500
but that we will do it the later tutorials.

142
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,800
For the time being, I just wanna show you one of the ways

143
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,219
in which you can actually crack the wpa2 encryption.

144
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:10,400
The DoS attacks are very useful.

145
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,900
They can practically render almost any WiFi network out there useless.

146
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,500
Nobody will be able to connect to it

147
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,400
or you can deauthenticate a specific client on the network

148
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,200
which is also extremely useful.

149
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,800
Let's just go ahead and clear the screen.

150
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,800
Once again, I will run the airodump and I will expand this terminal

151
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,500
so we can see some other things as well.

152
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,000
So it says something...It's 90:F6

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,400
I am looking for something to be associated with 90:F6

154
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:50,600
and that is what I shall use in order to actually deauthenticate

155
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,000
because we are looking for a four-way handshake.

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,500
It will appear in the top right corner.

157
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,200
There we will be able to see all the packets that are coming in

158
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,200
and there we will be able to actually capture file

159
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,300
and see what is going on

160
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,300
but that is not possible to do at the time being

161
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,800
primarily because we're scanning

162
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,200
for pretty much every single network out there

163
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
and I just wanted to show you how it looks like.

164
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,200
The next thing that we need to do is perform a specific scan.

165
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,000
So now we will be targeting this network here, as it has a good signal

166
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,500
and more importantly than that

167
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,440
I have a permission to do whatever I want with this network, as it is mine.

168
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,800
These down below are not mine.

169
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Also keep in mind that we are not doing anything illegal here

170
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,600
or anything of a kind

171
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,400
Everything that you see here is pretty much public information

172
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,500
because this is what all the WiFi routers around me are broadcasting.

173
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,200
They are broadcasting their MAC address

174
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,000
and they are broadcasting the name basically.

175
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,200
The ESSID name is not a technical term

176
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
ESSID is the term

177
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,900
but everybody refers to it as a name of a wireless access point

178
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,200
or something of a kind

179
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,100
Anyway, as I said, all these are public information.

180
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,500
This is all the WiFi spots around me are broadcasting

181
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,800
and this sort of information you can also see on your cell phone

182
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,900
by just using the network manager

183
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,200
or you can use a network manager on your computer

184
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,000
and you will see pretty much the same things.

185
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,800
You will see that it's wpa2 encryption, you will see the MAC address

186
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,500
and you'll see the ESSID, of course.

187
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,000
The ESSID will be the first thing that you see on the network.

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,300
Also, you will see the channels as well.

189
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,100
This stuff in between -- You have to worry about those

190
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,300
They're not that relevant for our purpose today.

191
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,430
Anyway, I will call the tutorial here

192
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,500
and in the next one, we will be performing a specific scan

193
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,210
where we will capture information

194
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:59,000
and use that capture file in order to crack the encryption.

195
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Until then, I bid you farewell

196
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
