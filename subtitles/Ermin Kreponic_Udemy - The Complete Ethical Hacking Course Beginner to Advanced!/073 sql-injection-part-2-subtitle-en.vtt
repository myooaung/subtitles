00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.500

Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.



2

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.500

This is a follow-up, so let's just go ahead and jump right in



3

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.200

and continue from where I left off in the previous tutorial.



4

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.700

Anyway, one of the first things that you will need to do is type in



5

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:36.700

chmod -Rv /var/www/DVWA - 1.0.8



6

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.600

Go ahead and press ENTER



7

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.800

Oh yeah, chmod does require you to actually give it a mod, so 777



8

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.700

Just go ahead and give it a global mod.



9

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.000

Let me just show you the command one more time.



10

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.910

Let's make it a bit clearer



11

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.410

Excellent



12

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.200

So this is the command that you need to type in, in order to change the mod of your folder.



13

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.000

We are doing this so that we may actually see it here.



14

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.100

If we don't this, we won't actually see it here.



15

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.100

Giving the global mode of 777 is a pretty bad idea



16

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.000

but considering that we are running this server locally, nobody really cares



17

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.800

because nobody actually from outside has access to this



18

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:26.700

and it really doesn't matter, since you are the only person with access to this particular web server.



19

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.209

Anyway, go ahead and click on it.



20

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:32.200

You will immediately get this thing here



21

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.200

and it says "Unable to connect to the databas. mysql_error"



22

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.900

Click here to set up the database.



23

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.200

Go ahead and click on it.



24

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.500

It says "Backend Database: MySQL"



25

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.200

Whoops, what does it say here?



26

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.000

"Could not connect to the database - please check the config file"



27

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.700

Okay, the web app is actually right.



28

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.800

We should check the config file to pass in some additional parameters



29

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:05.000

but aside from that, we will need to actually get our SQL server up and running.



30

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000

Go ahead and type in



31

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:35.600

apt -cache search mysql | grep -i database | less



32

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:44.400

Now I'm piping it into "less" so that it would  stop after a first screen full



33

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.200

and then I'm gonna scroll down manually through the rest of the packages.



34

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.200

Excellent!



35

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.900

So what do we got here?



36

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.100

Anything that we need?



37

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.300

You might think that this is what you need, but no.



38

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.200

We are looking for a client



39

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.000

Probably should have written a client, but it doesn't really matter



40

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.100

I can find it here.



41

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.600

There we go



42

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.200

It says "mysql - client"



43

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.500

Go ahead and copy that name



44

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.000

Press U to exit this



45

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.500

Type in "apt - get install mysql - client"



46

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.609

The server is already installed, if I'm not mistaken



47

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.000

and there we go.



48

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.300

It's done



49

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.600

If the server is not installed, you can do this as well, just in case



50

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.400

server, press ENTER



51

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.400

and there we go.



52

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.700

So this command that I have selected here, you can run it through just in case



53

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.600

and you need to run this command, the second one that I've selected, as well.



54

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.400

I hope that is clear enough.



55

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.600

That way, we will be able to access our SQL server.



56

00:03:50.600 --> 00:04:04.700

Now what we need to do is type in "service mysql start"



57

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.700

Yep, there we go



58

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.600

"starting MySQL database server: mysqld already running"



59

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.000

So what I can do here is type in "restart"



60

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.570

stopping, starting, and there we go.



61

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.000

Okay, so no problems there.



62

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.200

I've been doing some tampering with it.



63

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.500

So it just did some cleaning up work for me, no big deal there.



64

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.200

Anyway, you will need this command - service mysql start



65

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.100

It will not be started by default.



66

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.300

As I said, I've been tampering with it, so it's already up and running on my system



67

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.000

primarily because I need to test things out before I actually showed them to you



68

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000

Now go ahead and clear the screen.



69

00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:07.600

You can type in "mysql -h localhost -u root -p"



70

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.200

Now if you're doing this the first time around



71

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.700

if you haven't done any configuration to the SQL database, you will not use the "p" parameter.



72

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.200

So no p parameter



73

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.400

You will delete it and this is what you will type in



74

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.100

I'm gonna get an error saying "Access denied" because I am using a password



75

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.800

and it says here "using password: NO"



76

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.400

because I haven't passed any password parameters



77

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.400

but if you are running it for the first time, this is the command which you need to use --



78

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.800

mysql -h  localhost -u root



79

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.800

without any password parameters



80

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.700

because I've already set the password.



81

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.700

I am going to type in "-p" for password argument



82

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.300

and I'm going to take my passport here, and there we go.



83

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.200

It's up and running



84

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.260

I can actually connect to it without any problems.



85

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.400

I'm currently using the MySQL database.



86

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.800

This is what you type in the second time around



87

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.200

when you actually set the password.



88

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.900

You just type in "-p" for password argument



89

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.100

and if you're running it the first time around, you just type in this command.



90

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.500

I don't want to reiterate it again.



91

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.000

I hope you got that part.



92

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.300

If you didn't, feel free to ask me pretty much anything you wish in the discussion section on Udemy.



93

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.400

Anyway, the mysql command syntax is a lot different from the Linux one.



94

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.900

For example, you don't have clear



95

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.800

and you need to put semicolons at the end of your statements for them to take effect.



96

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.400

Now I have prepared a small list of commands here for us to use today.



97

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.000

I want you to take a look at them



98

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:57.000

Let's just...Ugh, come on. Don't do this to me



99

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000

Font...Give me 16



100

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.370

Okay, so now you can see it a bit better.



101

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.600

This is the command that you need to run.



102

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.400

So you can type in any password you wish here.



103

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.900

I'm gonna go ahead and type in "test", as this machine is primarily for testing purposes.



104

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.419

I would suggest that you type in something relatively complex.



105

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:27.400

If you really want to be secure and stuff like that



106

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:34.500

you can type in eight characters with all sorts of things, like thoughts, @ signs



107

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.600

no words from English dictionary or anything of a kind



108

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.100

but again, don't emphasize security too much now



109

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.500

primarily because this is a virtual machine and only you have access to it



110

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.600

and only you will be using this SQL Server



111

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.600

and I really don't think there is a need to type in anything super complex here.



112

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.400

I am using the password "test", although after the end of this tutorial



113

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.200

I am probably gonna delete this machine all together.



114

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.300

Anyway, this is the command which you need to use.



115

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:14.200

Capital letters are not mandatory, but they're quite nice if you want to have a good layout of the syntax.



116

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.400

If you type in this with lower case letters, this command is gonna work just fine as well.



117

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.840

I'm gonna do this without the semicolon, just to show you what happens



118

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.400

So copy, and paste it here



119

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.000

Basically like English language that says set password



120

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:42.000

It says "SET PASSWORD FOR root@localhost=PASSWORD( 'test' )



121

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000

The quotation marks are not part of the password.



122

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.300

In between the quotation marks, you will type your password in.



123

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.500

So if I press ENTER, nothing's gonna happen.



124

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.800

It's just gonna move on to the second line and wait for a second set of commands



125

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.540

but you can either pass different or additional parameters here.



126

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.000

For the time being, I'm not gonna do that.



127

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.200

I just want a simple password for my MySQL database and that's it.



128

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.900

You can check it out in the advanced setting passwords for MySQL databases



129

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.000

You will see that you can pass in a ton load of parameters



130

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000

ranging from encryption to substituting old passwords with new ones



131

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.800

and so on and so forth.



132

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.100

For the time being, I'm just gonna semicolon



133

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.400

but if you want to pass some additional arguments you could type them in here.



134

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.500

If not, type in the semicolon, press ENTER



135

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.700

and it's gonna finish it



136

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.400

It says "Query OK, 0 rows affected"



137

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.200

because I already have the password set to "test"



138

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.000

I would love to be able to clear the screen.



139

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.400

I do believe that there is a command for that somewhere around here you



140

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.200

but you cannot use clear.



141

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.000

That's just what I want to do emphasize here.



142

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.300

Anyway, now that we the password set up



143

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:56.300

I'm gonna type in "exit" and I'm gonna go back to my website to see



144

00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.400

Okay "Could not connect to the database - please check the config file"



145

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.400

Excellent



146

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.660

Now we need to clear the screen.



147

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:10.200

Go ahead and change your working directory to "cd /var/www/DVWA - 1.0.8"



148

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.700

Where is the config file?



149

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.200

Here it is -- The first row



150

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.200

So "cd/config



151

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.200

Let's see what's in the config file.



152

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.700

It's a php file



153

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.300

Excellent



154

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.000

So just type in "nano config"



155

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.600

and scroll down.



156

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.840

You will see here, it says "[   'db_server'  ] = 'localhost'; "



157

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.300

database...dvwa



158

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.400

Okay, you can leave that. That's gonna get created.



159

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.300

db_user, root



160

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.700

This is definitely not our password.



161

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.000

We need to type in "test"



162

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.200

Whoa, whoa, whoa...that's not what I want to do.



163

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.200

Let me just move here.



164

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.700

Delete this password



165

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:56.700

Type in "test", CRTL O to save it, and CTRL X to exit.



166

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.800

There are other ways of authentication



167

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.100

but we're just going to use this simple password for the time being.



168

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:08.200

Now I have noticed that, since I have created this new user test for myself in a  Kali Linux



169

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:14.800

there have been people in the discussion section who have been complaining about the permissions problem.



170

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.500

Just make sure that you are root



171

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.200

So whatever you doing of this nature or kind



172

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.500

and if you're configuring passwords or editing these sort of files



173

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.500

make sure that you are root.



174

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.760

You become root by typing "su"



175

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:37.300

Okay, let me just go ahead and exit



176

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.500

Excellent



177

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.800

So I am now test@kali



178

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.200

and if I type in "su", I get prompted for a password



179

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.800

and if  type in "test"



180

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.800

Oh, come on



181

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.800

Excellent



182

00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:00.200

I type in my password, and it's root@kali



183

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.700

I become root



184

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.300

Though it may seem strange to some people



185

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.900

because I'm giving up my password here



186

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:10.700

but as I said, it's a virtual machine that I am going delete after this tutorial is done



187

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.700

so it doesn't really matter to me at all.



188

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.600

I haven't even tuned the security precautions of this machine.



189

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:24.000

To a large extent, I have created real-time circumstances, but most of my passwords are like this.



190

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.830

So they're pretty weak and they can be busted really fast.



191

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:32.000

Fortunately for me, nobody from outside world has access to this machine.



192

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.320

Anyway, go ahead and clear the screen.



193

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.300

Now it did tell me that some services have stopped



194

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:42.800

I'm just gonna type in "service mysql status"



195

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.000

Is it running?



196

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:56.000

Okay, so it has threads. I guess it's running.



197

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.230

Okay, it is running.



198

00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:59.800

It's a little bit different in Fedora.



199

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.800

It actually tells you immediately if it's active or running.



200

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.800

I'm sure it's says somewhere in this text that as well, but it has threats, I guess it is running.



201

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.500

Anyway, just go ahead and clear the screen. .



202

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:26.700

Now "service apache2 restart"



203

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.600

Excellent



204

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.400

So it says that it "Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name"



205

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.800

It doesn't really matter



206

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.700

That's not an error. That's a warning.



207

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.400

Go back to your site and it says "Create database"



208

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.000

Excellent



209

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.300

So you see, "Database has been created"



210

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.200

" 'users' table was created"



211

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.600

"Data inserted in 'users' table"



212

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.180

Guestbook data inserted



213

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.600

Successful!



214

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.100

No problems, it runs smoothly.



215

00:13:54.100 --> 00:14:01.700

If you have any problems concerning this procedure, before you post the question



216

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.100

I would advise, if you get an error of some sort, or something of a kind



217

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.400

Copy/Paste the error immediately.



218

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.500

Don't wait for me to ask for the error.



219

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:14.600

You will save a lot of time by just copying the error immediately, so I can see what the problem is



220

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.500

and my first reply doesn't need to be copy the error and then you wait



221

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.500

and then you copy the error and then you wait again



222

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.700

and then I give you a reply.



223

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.800

Rather instead, copy the error immediately



224

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.400

so that my first reply can be "Oh, you need to do this..."



225

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:35.000

and then you do it and solve the problems for yourself, making it a far faster method.



226

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000

Anyway, here I'm going to conclude this tutorial



227

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.400

and we're gonna continue off in the next one.



228

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:46.000

Until then, I bid you farewell and wish you a lot of success.
