00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.020

Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.



2

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.000

Today we will be importing custom chains of proxies.



3

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000

Now I have done literally no prep work for this, deliberately



4

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000

because I want to see if I encounter any problems



5

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000

by doing just the first time around on Kali Linux



6

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.100

and if I do, I want to resolve it together with you



7

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.800

because if I encounter them, chances are that you will encounter them as well.



8

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.179

So automatically you will know how to solve them



9

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.600

but I don't predict any special problems there.



10

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.000

This should fairly straightforward.



11

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000

So let's just go and type in "Free socks5 proxies"



12

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.300

and see if we can find any for ourselves.



13

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.489

So "Socks Proxy -- Free Socks5 and Socks4 Proxy List"



14

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.600

Let's see what this website has to offer.



15

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.460

Excellent



16

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.100

So we have a lot of these things here that we can use



17

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.000

Anonymity, anonymous



18

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.240

I suppose they all claim that they're anonymous



19

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.500

but that's really questionable.



20

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.700

Generally you want to be using proxies in countries



21

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.600

that have a good reputation for not airing your private browsing information



22

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.100

or something like that



23

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.680

So, the countries that do have a good reputation with that...



24

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.420

Well, China doesn't share much with anybody else



25

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.579

Russia doesn't do that either



26

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.700

There's Netherlands as well



27

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.300

If they have Netherlands here, that would be awesome



28

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.200

because Netherlands has fantastic privacy policies



29

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.800

in terms of information.



30

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.290

In terms of personal user information



31

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.200

and Germany's also not bad.



32

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.000

So those are some the countries which you can use that are fantastic



33

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000

in terms of privacy



34

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.600

They will not share your traffic with pretty much anyone



35

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.700

or so they say



36

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.000

or so they claim



37

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000

Who will you trust is completely up to you



38

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.599

but again, it doesn't really matter that much to you



39

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.400

primarily because most of the work that we're doing here



40

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.690

or should I say, all the work that we're

doing here is white hat



41

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.500

and all of it is legal.



42

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.550

So you can use any of these to simulate a real attack



43

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.200

and even if you can reverse tracks



44

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.700

and find yourself, it's still okay



45

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.700

as long as you are using some sort of proxy to give real time circumstances



46

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.690

and encounter real time problems.



47

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.000

Also to circumvent firewalls and so on



48

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.500

because if you want to see Netflix or something like that



49

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.800

you will need a proxy in the United States



50

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.860

Most likely won't be able to do from the proxy



51

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.300

or you will be, but you will need a really good one



52

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.500

rather instead, you will need a VPN.



53

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.120

Anyway, without further adieu, you have an IP address here



54

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.200

which we will need.



55

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.000

You have a port number here



56

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.200

We won't need this



57

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.200

We won't need this



58

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.620

and we will need a version.



59

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.400

So we'll need version.



60

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.900

Okay, they are multiple pages for this.



61

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.600

So actually, let's see if there are any proxies from Netherlands.



62

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.400

Nope, Netherlands is not even listed here.



63

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.600

Okay, nevermind



64

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.000

I'm sure that it does exist on some other websites.



65

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.360

I have seen them and I'm inclined to use them



66

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.200

primarily because they're good policies



67

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.000

but for our purpose today, it's truly irrelevant



68

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000

So let's just go ahead and select the first five from the list.



69

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.630

So I need to copy this



70

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.600

open up my terminal



71

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.700

and let's just make our screen convenient



72

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.500

so we can do a ton load of copy/pasting.



73

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.860

There we go



74

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.810

Just do this, and let's grab the Firefox browser.



75

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.000

Just expanded it accordingly.



76

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000

Excellent



77

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.200

So I have everything that I need.



78

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.200

I have port number version and the IP address.



79

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.000

I need to expand the terminal a little bit to gain on size.



80

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.200

Excellent



81

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.510

Clear the screen for any inconveniences



82

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:24.200

nano /etc/proxychains.conf



83

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.400

Make sure that dynamic is selected



84

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.000

and that everything else is commented out.



85

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.150

Go scroll down to the bottom



86

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.500

and let's go



87

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.570

Now we need to specify our proxy chains.



88

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.000

Go ahead and start typing.



89

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.400

Anything special we need to know here?



90

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.800

Nope, it doesn't specify anything special.



91

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.800

Let's just go ahead and type in...



92

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.800

You don't need to use capital letters, just so you know



93

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.000

So "Socks5"



94

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.770

and paste the IP address.



95

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.180

Bit of a longer IP address.



96

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.400

Let's go ahead and and tabs here to be on the safe side



97

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.000

so that all is neatly done and sorted.



98

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000

So it's 33169



99

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.700

Press ENTER



100

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.000

So Socks5



101

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.200

What is the next one?



102

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.980

The next one is 94.180.123.34



103

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.800

and the port number is 1080



104

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.540

Let's take the next one.



105

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.620

We just need do this a bit faster.



106

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.700

So Socks...



107

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.000

Oops sorry, this one is actually Socks4



108

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000

and the next one is actually socks5



109

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.400

As you can see, it's a fairly simple process.



110

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.220

I mean, there's nothing really special that you need to do here.



111

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.000

Just create a list, which you will end up using



112

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000

I can assure you that more than half of these proxies do not work.



113

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.510

Not because I can see some information screen that you can



114

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.860

but rather instead, because I had experiences with such proxies



115

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.600

and they generally do not tend to work



116

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.000

but enough of them works for you to be able to anonymize yourself



117

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000

to a good extent.



118

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.580

So next one is 18060



119

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.620

Make sure you get the ports right, because if you get a wrong port



120

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.500

your connections will be dropped by default on that IP address



121

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.539

and you'll think the proxy is malfunctioning or something like that



122

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.000

but it's not



123

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.729

it's just you typing in a wrong port



124

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:59.000

So again, we have Socks5



125

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.919

IP address here



126

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:04.000

What is the port number? 1080 again



127

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.200

You will see that some port numbers have been standardized



128

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.600

and they are just rolling, they're repeating



129

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.300

You don't need to do that much thinking there



130

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.000

Press ENTER



131

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.200

I just wanna separate them from these



132

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.000

and let's go ahead...



133

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.430

Oops, sorry



134

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.000

I can just save it. It doesn't matter.



135

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.460

Nope, I don't want the different name



136

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.800

Excellent



137

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.600

Messed up the name



138

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.000

Okay, so let's exit nano



139

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.800

Expand our beloved terminal



140

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.700

The holy grail of power



141

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:48.780

Type in pretty much the same thing as we typed in the previous tutorials



142

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:58.800

"proxychains firefox www.duckduckgo.com"



143

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.500

So just keep in mind that you can type in any URL here



144

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.300

and as long as it's valid, it will open it.



145

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.200

So just go ahead and see what happens.



146

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.400

Press ENTER



147

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.800

Nothing...Literally nothing



148

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.060

What happened? It didn't even start proxy chains with it.



149

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.810

Why not? Well, you need to close the browser first.



150

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:23.080

We unfortunately had this list open



151

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.000

that continuously keeps changing as well.



152

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.600

That's a problem, because you cannot have Firefox open



153

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.200

and then start it again through proxy chains.



154

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.810

You need to close it completely.



155

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:36.400

Make sure that it is completely closed.



156

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.080

I can see nothing in my working menu down there



157

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.500

down at the bottom of the screen



158

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.990

and let's try again.



159

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:45.300

Same thing



160

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.400

See, now it's taking a bit longer.



161

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.500

As soon as you see that something flies through with proxy chains



162

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.800

using proxies that's really fast



163

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.000

you know that something is wrong



164

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000

because there's no way it's gonna be fast.



165

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.200

So do we got here?



166

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.050

Timeout



167

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.500

Timeout again



168

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.490

We have timeouts



169

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.890

and it's a dynamic chain, so it's trying to so through all of them



170

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:12.550

but it's skipping those that are not functional.



171

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:16.000

At the beginning stages, a long time ago



172

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.130

I was like "I'm gonna use 50 proxies and I'm gonna be completely anonymous!"



173

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:22.300

No no



174

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.490

I wasn't even able to load the basic of sites



175

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:29.070

or issue even the basic of requests for that.



176

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:33.000

You need to keep it low in terms of proxies, depending on their speed



177

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.600

Excellent



178

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.200

So hopefully one of them is going to pass



179

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.200

and one of them is going to work.



180

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.970

This is one way of looking at it and trying to figure it out.



181

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:47.800

Another way is just looking at the screen and see what's happening here.



182

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.000

So I'm just waiting for at least one of them...



183

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:50.900

Yep, there we go.



184

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.640

One of them said "OK"



185

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.200

but it needs to go and try all the others out as well



186

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.230

before it can actually verify



187

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:03.000

what is it that's going to use in order to open this side up.



188

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.400

Hopefully it's not gonna take too much time.



189

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.600

So you see, we have all of these timeouts



190

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.000

and only one of them was okay.



191

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.580

Which one was okay?



192

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.500

[DNS response] duckduckgo.com



193

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.800

There we go. It should be open now.



194

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.300

No, it is not.



195

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.000

This was just an DNS response.



196

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.900

Does not exist...hmm, have I mistyped this?



197

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.920

duckduckgo...No, I don't believe I have.



198

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.600

Okay, it's formulating a request again through different series.



199

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.000

Come on, please succeed



200

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000

Excellent



201

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000

This one didn't succeed



202

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.300

Well, now it has



203

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:51.070

[DNS response] www.duckduckgo.com is 50.18.192.250



204

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.000

Have you opened it? Please tell me you have.



205

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.800

No you have not



206

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.690

Okay, we gotta wait a bit longer



207

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:59.500

and this is the sad reality of using proxies.



208

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.900

If I had used one or two, this would have been a lot simpler



209

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.800

but I just wanted to make a point here



210

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.000

and show you you're not going to get anywhere



211

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.800

if you're using a lot of free proxies



212

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:16.200

and imagine scanning like a hundred hosts using proxy chains like this



213

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.800

and this would be the amount of time that it would take



214

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.200

to even load a basic website.



215

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.000

Imagine how long a scan would take.



216

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.900

It would take forever.



217

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.770

Okay, so finally it is requesting information on port 443



218

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:32.000

As you can see, all of the above communication



219

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000

was attempting to get a response from DNS server.



220

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000

We still haven't even...



221

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000

Look, this is how much information has been processed



222

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:52.300

before we even started to load duckduckgo.com



223

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:58.000

As you can see by the port names, the 53 are DNS ports



224

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.400

and we go down below, you can see that finally



225

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.000

I'm looking for port 443 somewhere around here.



226

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.360

I swear I saw it moment ago



227

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.380

1080 -- That's a proxy port



228

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.500

This is a proxy port as well



229

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.200

53 again



230

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.000

DNS resolution port



231

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:24.800

Yep, there we go!



232

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.070

443 has begun here.



233

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:28.200

It's still loading it



234

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.200

I wonder has it opened it?



235

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.800

Yep, there we go.



236

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.780

It is up and running.



237

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.700

The site is functional



238

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:39.200

but it has taken us a lot of time to open it, using a lot of free proxies.



239

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.200

So stick to two or three at max



240

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.600

and it should work



241

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.550

and stick with the ones that have the best reviews



242

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:46.200

and so on.



243

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.800

Stick with the ones that have the greatest up time as well.



244

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.960

That's one of the routes you can take.



245

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.720

In any case, I bid you farewell



246

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.000

and I hope to see you all in the next tutorial.
