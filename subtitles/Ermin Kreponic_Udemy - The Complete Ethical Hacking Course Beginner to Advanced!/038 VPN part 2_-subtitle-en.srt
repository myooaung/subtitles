1
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:06,541
Ok, so let's go ahead and continue

2
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:10,543
If you're just tuning in we've changed the DNS servers and I strongly advise you to

3
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:16,951
view these tutorials in the order in which they were posted

4
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:23,686
But the change of the DNS servers was necessary in order to hide the DNS servers

5
00:00:23,686 --> 00:00:27,094
from out ISP provider

6
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:30,378
Anyway, let's go ahead and open up our browser

7
00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:35,091
I already have mine open here and one of the first things we're going

8
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:42,353
to need to do is to disable WebRTC, I have it written down in the upper right corner

9
00:00:42,353 --> 00:00:45,435
if you can't see it, it's perfectly fine

10
00:00:45,435 --> 00:01:01,899
because now I'm gonna go ahead and type in "about:config" and then it's gonna say

11
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:04,827
"This might void your warranty!"

12
00:01:04,827 --> 00:01:07,861
notice that I'm using Iceweasel which it's basically Firefox,

13
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:12,164
for Chrome it's a little bit of a different procedure, if you're using that

14
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:20,666
let me know, I can help you out there, in any case WebRTC

15
00:01:25,806 --> 00:01:32,718
it can leak your data, it's one of the new things that have embedded into Firefox

16
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:39,129
and Chrome, but in Firefox they made it relatively easy to disable, I mean, it's not a big deal

17
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:48,165
you just have to go into about:config and you're gonna get this warning, and this warning

18
00:01:48,165 --> 00:01:56,681
is here for a reason, this is not here because somebody decided that they should just

19
00:01:56,681 --> 00:02:03,140
put a warning without a purpose or anything like that

20
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,937
this is here for reason, if you go about messing with these things, be sure that you know

21
00:02:07,937 --> 00:02:12,954
what it is that you are doing, otherwise, leave them as they are because you can brake your browser

22
00:02:12,954 --> 00:02:20,744
to the point where it's not longer going to work or it's gonna severely jeopardise your safety

23
00:02:20,744 --> 00:02:27,127
the safety of the software, integrity of your browser, etc.

24
00:02:27,127 --> 00:02:32,117
So I'll be careful, I promise just go ahead and click on it, and in the search bar you need to search

25
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:38,270
the same pattern that I am searching now, here, let me zoom at it as much as I can

26
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:49,140
it says, media.peerconnection.enabled

27
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:56,564
Ok, so here, boolean is set to false, you can just double click to change it to true

28
00:02:56,564 --> 00:03:05,663
but don't, only if this is true, double click and change it to false and that is all you really need to do,

29
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:07,774
no big deal there,

30
00:03:07,774 --> 00:03:12,775
so just go ahead and close, it just needs to be false, that's all it needs to be

31
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:19,347
so just go ahead and close the browser after that and reopen it

32
00:03:19,347 --> 00:03:22,896
type into your favourite search engine, or which one you're using

33
00:03:22,896 --> 00:03:25,892
I'm just using the default one here

34
00:03:25,892 --> 00:03:32,937
Open VPN free, just type that in

35
00:03:32,937 --> 00:03:37,262
and I have a site that I've used before

36
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:42,961
Yep, there we go, so, we're gonna... it's VPNBook

37
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:51,483
We're gonna go ahead and use one of these, so I'm gonna go ahead and use the German one

38
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:57,508
but you can use the Canadian one, US one, I don't know where this one is located but I'm sure we could

39
00:03:57,508 --> 00:04:03,079
figure it out but it doesn't really matter, I'm gonna use a German one, you can use whichever you want

40
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:12,153
Feel free, so I'm just gonna download it, it's gonna be in download folder, there we go

41
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:19,307
Here is the username, I'm gonna remember that, it's VPNBook, and I'm gonna go ahead and copy the password

42
00:04:19,307 --> 00:04:26,124
because now I need to close the browser, so in order to start the VPN we need to close the browser, we

43
00:04:26,124 --> 00:04:35,677
cannot have the browser open while the VPN is running, while we are setting up the VPN, sorry, my bad there

44
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:46,269
So we need to set the VPN up, start it, let it run and then open up the browser, so the browser cannot be open before

45
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:53,074
that, it needs to be closed, completely, all your tabs, the entire browser needs to be closed, it cannot be active

46
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:58,887
set the VPN up and only then start your browser, then it will work, otherwise it won't

47
00:04:58,887 --> 00:05:05,822
It shouldn't anyway, so, let's go ahead and type it in

48
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:09,517
and let's go to Downloads/

49
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,441
"ls"

50
00:05:10,441 --> 00:05:13,309
and this file is zipped, so just go ahead and unzip it,

51
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:20,366
unzip VPNBook.com

52
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:25,330
and there we go, do "ls" again, you will see that you have a good number of these

53
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,410
let's just clear the screen to make it a little bit clearer

54
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,538
"ll" is not installed here, but it doesn't really matter

55
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:37,803
and I'm going to use a TCP 443 Open VPN

56
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:48,927
What do I type in? I just type in "openvpn" space and then just go ahead and type this in

57
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:58,142
"tcp443.ovpn" start it up, type in the username, the username is VPNBook

58
00:05:58,142 --> 00:06:00,842
the password is the one that I've copied from the net

59
00:06:00,842 --> 00:06:02,558
Press Enter

60
00:06:02,558 --> 00:06:06,900
And just let it run, I only advise you to let it run for like a minute

61
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,778
for everything to be setup and initialized

62
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:20,244
and functional and so on and so forth, it says here "Initialization Sequence Completed"

63
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:28,938
that is what we were looking for and waiting for and now let's go ahead and start up our browser

64
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:36,735
and let's go ahead and type in "What is my IP?"

65
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:54,344
Ok, so it says that my public IP is this one here, and let's see where will that IP put me

66
00:06:54,344 --> 00:07:00,854
Wait, this is not a good one, let's go to DNS leak test

67
00:07:05,714 --> 00:07:13,750
It's putting me in Germany, that's where I'm located at the moment... not at the moment

68
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,708
That is where this IP is located at the moment

69
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:24,897
That is the location for this IP address and this is the one that is shielding my real one

70
00:07:24,897 --> 00:07:32,045
To just give you and idea of what I mean by it, I can go ahead and open up the terminal

71
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:38,382
stop this process with Control + C and let's see if this will work if I reload the site

72
00:07:38,382 --> 00:07:42,880
I don't think it's gonna actually work I think I should need to reset the browser

73
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,368
and yes, I need to reset the browser, but you saw that my IP was in Germany

74
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:57,295
and let's do it again, DNS leak test, and here we go

75
00:07:58,705 --> 00:08:02,317
There you go, it says... now it's giving my real IP address

76
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:06,298
A lot of people are covered up on youtube... on the net

77
00:08:06,298 --> 00:08:16,883
I personally think it's a completely pointless thing to do because these are dynamic IP addresses provided to us by our ISP providers

78
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:26,336
and this is gonna change about twenty times by the time I actually publish these videos,

79
00:08:28,376 --> 00:08:36,592
I can actually change it myself, If I just reset the router basically

80
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:43,175
plug it in, plug it out, that's the quickest way to do it, or you can actually log into your router and

81
00:08:43,175 --> 00:08:51,253
release the DHTP and then acquire a new one but it doesn't really matter, you see the idea

82
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:57,132
I mean I had German one and when I covered myself up and now I have this one

83
00:08:57,132 --> 00:08:59,601
Okay, so let's close it

84
00:08:59,601 --> 00:09:03,332
Let'st fire apart VPN again

85
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:15,305
There we go, it's starting, wait for it, don't just go and click and open up your browser immediately

86
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:20,526
Wait for this "Initialization Sequence Completed" and then open up your browser

87
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:29,137
and make sure as I said before that there are no other browsers that are open at all

88
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:34,090
No big deal, let's start it up

89
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:42,205
"DNS leak test", ok, click on it

90
00:09:42,205 --> 00:09:46,771
Again I am in Germany, so do the standard test.

91
00:09:49,771 --> 00:10:00,327
And now it says the ISP is Open DNS because I am using Open DNS DNS servers

92
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:03,781
I know it sounds a little bit confusing because of their name but basically I am using

93
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:06,812
the DNS servers of this company

94
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:11,432
The DNS servers that belong to this company.

95
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:19,464
What is important here? I know that I stated before you can just choose a DNS that is different

96
00:10:19,464 --> 00:10:24,285
from your own country, yes, that is true, definitely useful, but also

97
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:34,605
keep in mind that the primary thing that you are hiding from... that you are trying to hide is

98
00:10:34,605 --> 00:10:39,853
your ISP DNS server, that is the one that you're trying to conceal

99
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:47,588
so as long as your real ISP DNS server is not listed here and preferably but not mandatory

100
00:10:47,588 --> 00:10:53,781
that this is not the country where you are actually located, you are good to go

101
00:10:53,781 --> 00:11:01,484
if your ISP server shows here, the DNS server, your real ISP DNS server then

102
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:06,302
you have misconfigured something you are not completely anonymous

103
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:14,676
also if this is your country of origin, I'm not talking about the United States, it doesn't matter which one is listed here

104
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:22,766
I'm just saying that If here, it says a country, and this could be Czech Republic or Canada, it can be

105
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:26,177
The United States as you see here, it doesn't really matter, but as long as...

106
00:11:26,177 --> 00:11:35,897
If that is your country of origin, it's not that bad, somebody could perhaps see that you're coming from that particularly country and

107
00:11:35,897 --> 00:11:41,468
that might be your real country where you're located, but do you know? these are public DNS servers

108
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:49,127
if you pick a good one they won't keep log files and you're pretty much good to go because they won't have record

109
00:11:49,127 --> 00:11:56,607
they won't have anything showed, also as I said you could pick a DNS server which is not in your own country

110
00:11:56,607 --> 00:12:03,143
Here it's the United States because Open DNS is in the United States but doesn't matter as I said, it could be any country here

111
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:13,613
and let's say you're a citizen of Norway, and you have a Norwegian DNS server listed here and you're using that one

112
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:21,978
Well, you could try using a DNS server which is in South African Republic and it's gonna say here South African Republic

113
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:28,958
and you're gonna have a very different ISP here but as I said just make sure that they are reputable

114
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:35,824
now I hope that I have helped you out, that I've shown you can set up a free VPN service, completely free of charge

115
00:12:35,824 --> 00:12:41,269
You don't have to pay for anything extra and how can this actually work out

116
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:48,061
If you're using Virtual Box you can also go and. Let's go ahead and stop this

117
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:54,495
You can go under devices and network settings, and change from bridge adapter to NAT

118
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:59,831
because sometimes bridge adapter doesn't work for anybody due to the drivers and OK

119
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:03,294
and now you can reset the network manager

120
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:09,987
"service network-manager restart"

121
00:13:09,987 --> 00:13:14,437
Let's see if I can ping google.com

122
00:13:14,437 --> 00:13:20,155
Ok, NAT is working, and let's see If I can connect to the Open VPN

123
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:28,641
let it go through

124
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:37,120
Ok, "Initialization Sequence Completed" so it does work, but you see, I have my browser open

125
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:44,279
so this is a bad, bad, bad idea, this is something you should not do, close the browser and redo this process

126
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:51,686
Once you have redone it, open up your browser again

127
00:13:51,686 --> 00:13:58,383
I mean it's not like it's gonna reveal if you're using a browser straight away but the changes may not be applied to your browser

128
00:13:58,383 --> 00:14:04,302
that's the problem, so "DNS leak test"

129
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:14,185
Again, it's working in NAT just fine but let's see if the DNS is going to pass

130
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:22,082
Yep, it will, so NAT is also working just fine, you can use both NAT and bridge, if one doesn't work try the other

131
00:14:22,082 --> 00:14:31,603
this is just for people who are using virtual machines, you can switch between NAT and bridge for virtual machines

132
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:40,632
For everybody else if you're not using a virtual machine, if you're using a real installation or if you're using a USB, forget about NAT and bridge

133
00:14:40,632 --> 00:14:45,189
this is all you can and need to do

134
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:54,588
Anyway I bid you all farewell and I hope that this was helpful who have struggles with VPN and Kali 2.0
