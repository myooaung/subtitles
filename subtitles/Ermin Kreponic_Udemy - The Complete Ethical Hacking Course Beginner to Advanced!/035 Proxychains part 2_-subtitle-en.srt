1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,241
Hello, everybody and
welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:07,081
I'm just gonna pick up from where
I left off in the previous one.

3
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:11,452
Anyway, in the previous one as
the last part, I posed a question and

4
00:00:11,452 --> 00:00:16,381
you should have answered it before you
started listening to this tutorial.

5
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:20,470
In any case, as I said before,
you have a type of proxy here and

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,920
you always want to be using socks5.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,590
You don't want to be using http,
because they are not really that safe and

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,980
socks5 doesn't support a lot of options.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,561
Anyway, this is the IP
address of the proxy server.

10
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:38,421
We will enter a few of
them manually later on.

11
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:43,836
And this here is the port number on
which the proxy server is listening,

12
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:45,561
the port that is open.

13
00:00:45,561 --> 00:00:48,360
And over here, these two words.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,950
Now some proxy servers, especially paid
ones will always have a user name and

15
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:58,080
a password, so
you can just type them here in plain text.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,403
Unfortunately, but
it is only assumed that you and

17
00:01:01,403 --> 00:01:04,041
you alone have access to this computer.

18
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:10,540
And besides, this this file is not
everybody can read this file, anyway.

19
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,843
So if you just type in the username
here and password here, you will

20
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:21,922
gain access to a certain proxy that you
have chosen or that you have paid for.

21
00:01:21,922 --> 00:01:24,561
Anyway, these are just examples.

22
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:29,043
We won't actually be using these
proxies or anything of a kind,

23
00:01:29,043 --> 00:01:32,781
we need to go down below and
here is the end of the file.

24
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:35,482
So if I just press Enter
a couple of times, there we go.

25
00:01:35,482 --> 00:01:40,005
So there's only one proxy active
at the moment, it's socks4 and

26
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:42,360
all traffic is being routed here.

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,981
So our tor, it says,
defaults set to "tor".

28
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:49,070
Now tor by default,
listens on this port and

29
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,421
our connections will be
going through tor now.

30
00:01:52,421 --> 00:01:57,482
But just in case, I want to add socks and
you should really do this, socks5.

31
00:01:57,482 --> 00:02:01,100
Press Tab and
type in exactly the same IP address.

32
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:06,862
By the way, this 127.0.0.1, this is
the loopback address of your computer.

33
00:02:06,862 --> 00:02:10,963
So this is for inter-device communication.

34
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:16,722
And if you PNG this address,
it means your pinging yourself, basically.

35
00:02:16,722 --> 00:02:21,758
And usually, people PNG this address in
order to make sure that the IP protocol

36
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:26,661
is setup correctly, even though they
don't have internet connectivity.

37
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:32,801
So let's just type in 127.0.0.1.

38
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:34,543
Same port numbers, space here.

39
00:02:34,543 --> 00:02:37,962
No tabs, 9050.

40
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:38,802
There we go.

41
00:02:38,802 --> 00:02:42,763
Press Ctrl-O to save a file, press Enter.

42
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:47,441
By the way, you don't need to
use nano to edit this file,

43
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:50,962
you can use VI or
some other text to edit it.

44
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:55,802
I like using nano, it's practical and
it's fairly simple.

45
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:57,302
It's a lot simpler than VI.

46
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,974
I know how to use VI as well, but
it's a bit more complicated, so

47
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:03,083
I prefer to keep it out of tutorials.

48
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:08,242
Anyway, do Ctrl+O to save,
as I've done just a moment ago.

49
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:09,001
It doesn't hurt.

50
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:11,956
You can press it as
many times as you like,

51
00:03:11,956 --> 00:03:16,101
it doesn't really matter and
then press Ctrl+X to exit.

52
00:03:16,101 --> 00:03:18,242
There we go and we have the files saved.

53
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:22,978
Clear the screen for, you always want
make sure that you are working in a very

54
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:24,903
neat environment, so to say.

55
00:03:24,903 --> 00:03:31,862
Then go ahead and type in service
tor status, see if tor is running.

56
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:35,341
Tor is not running, so
it gives you an answer.

57
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:40,111
And what we want is to start tor up,

58
00:03:40,111 --> 00:03:43,242
so service tor start.

59
00:03:43,242 --> 00:03:43,981
Press Enter.

60
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:44,562
There we go.

61
00:03:44,562 --> 00:03:50,042
Now tor service has started and
it is up and running.

62
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:55,048
So the next thing we need to do
is use proxychains in combination

63
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:59,770
with our tor and in combination
with our internet browser in

64
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,587
order to be able to access a third
party in order to verify that

65
00:04:04,587 --> 00:04:08,662
all is working properly and
that we are anonymous.

66
00:04:08,662 --> 00:04:11,536
A lot of people do the configuration and

67
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:14,942
they type in service toward start and,
yeah.

68
00:04:14,942 --> 00:04:15,722
That's it.

69
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,802
They don't verify the settings.

70
00:04:17,802 --> 00:04:21,659
They start to scan and what happens,
of course, they get detected,

71
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:24,662
because they most likely
misconfigured something.

72
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:26,362
So that's really a bad idea.

73
00:04:26,362 --> 00:04:31,222
What you want to do is go ahead and
type in proxychains.

74
00:04:31,222 --> 00:04:34,462
So proxychains.

75
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:38,991
Now this is, you do not want to
browse the internet as root,

76
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:44,157
we're just going to use it to verify
our proxychain's settings and

77
00:04:44,157 --> 00:04:46,802
I'm gonna close the web browser.

78
00:04:46,802 --> 00:04:51,222
So, I'm just using it for that purpose and
we will use proxy translator later on for

79
00:04:51,222 --> 00:04:54,631
a different kind of purpose for
scanning and so on and so forth and

80
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:56,041
then we can use it as root.

81
00:04:56,041 --> 00:05:00,262
But for a browser,
it's not a good idea for security reasons.

82
00:05:00,262 --> 00:05:04,750
Anyway, proxychains and
then type in firefox or

83
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,461
you can type in any favorite
browser that you have.

84
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:13,560
I think Firefox works the best with
proxychains, as that is the default

85
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,742
browser of Kali Linux, even though
it says Iceweasel, it's Firefox.

86
00:05:17,742 --> 00:05:18,623
Trust me.

87
00:05:18,623 --> 00:05:24,242
So, type in proxychains firefox and we can
type in the website, if we wish to visit.

88
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:30,942
So let's just type in www.duckduckgo.com.

89
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:35,580
Now DuckDuckGo is one of those
search engines that is also

90
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,422
anonymizing you, so
they do not record your IP addresses.

91
00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:46,341
This is a very nice feature that they
have and I definitely recommend using it,

92
00:05:46,341 --> 00:05:51,544
primarily because you have a far
greater extent of anonymity than you

93
00:05:51,544 --> 00:05:56,762
do when using Google or, and
the equivalent popular search engine.

94
00:05:56,762 --> 00:06:00,788
As they do record your traffic, they do
record your IP addresses and that can be

95
00:06:00,788 --> 00:06:05,122
problematic in itself, especially when
you're doing some sort of footprinting.

96
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:07,982
You do not want to be recorded anywhere.

97
00:06:07,982 --> 00:06:14,482
Anyway, let's just go ahead and
press Enter and web browser is loading.

98
00:06:14,482 --> 00:06:18,538
You can see that the loading time
is definitely not the fastest,

99
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:21,182
it's a bit slow, but it has loaded it up.

100
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:24,642
Just go ahead back to our terminal and
see, excellent.

101
00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:28,362
So you see that the link has been
established here, there are some problems.

102
00:06:28,362 --> 00:06:34,100
As it says denied somewhere, but that's
okay, you are bound to encounter errors.

103
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,140
Here a ton load of them, especially
when you're using custom chains.

104
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:43,670
You will see, there will be more
error messages than there will be

105
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,740
OK messages, such as this one.

106
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,737
But believe it or not, the connection
still manages to pass through somehow and

107
00:06:49,737 --> 00:06:52,071
it still manages to
function in spite of that.

108
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:56,576
Anyway, I'll just go back and
open up our web browser once again and

109
00:06:56,576 --> 00:07:01,493
you can use pretty much a lot of services
out there to do this sort of thing.

110
00:07:01,493 --> 00:07:07,107
So just type in check for

111
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:13,571
DNS links and press Enter.

112
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:15,231
Whoa, this was fast.

113
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:19,373
So DNS Leak Test, excellent.

114
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:24,572
Lets go ahead and click there and
see what happens.

115
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:28,571
Hello, this is my public IP address now.

116
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:32,072
217.13.197.5.

117
00:07:32,072 --> 00:07:34,311
It says that I am from Germany.

118
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:37,712
I assure you, I am not from Germany.

119
00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:42,065
If you want to verify all of this,
you can type in,

120
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:46,627
open up a new terminal and
type in service tor stop and

121
00:07:46,627 --> 00:07:52,971
then open up your regular web browser
without the proxychains command.

122
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:57,657
Do the same test again and you will
see that you will get a completely

123
00:07:57,657 --> 00:08:01,851
different IP address,
which will be your real IP address.

124
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:05,492
So anyway, it says, hello,
this is me from Germany.

125
00:08:05,492 --> 00:08:08,172
I'm gonna do a standard test,
I'm not gonna do an extended test.

126
00:08:08,172 --> 00:08:10,592
Same thing pretty much.

127
00:08:10,592 --> 00:08:14,660
This one does more rounds, but you get
the same information, more or less.

128
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,200
So it goes query one, excellent.

129
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,053
This is my ISP provider.

130
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:28,233
This is what they have
concluded in regards to my DNS.

131
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:35,013
So look, it's Level 3 Communications and
it says, Country, United States.

132
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:39,212
Makes no sense of whatsoever,
so I am anonymous now.

133
00:08:39,212 --> 00:08:45,473
I can be effective,
which is a very good thing to have indeed.

134
00:08:45,473 --> 00:08:50,233
Now this IP address will change from
time to time, but just go ahead.

135
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:53,693
If you'll remember it, 217.13.

136
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:59,073
Let me just copy it and I'm gonna go ahead
and show you that it actually does change.

137
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:00,753
So, Accessories.

138
00:09:00,753 --> 00:09:03,373
I'm pretty sure,
I have a text editor here.

139
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:05,933
Excellent.
So, I'm just gonna paste this IP address.

140
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:10,857
And now what I'm going
to do is go ahead and

141
00:09:10,857 --> 00:09:18,333
close this browser and
don't need this, so service tor stop.

142
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,693
It's stopping it.

143
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,833
Service tor start.

144
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:23,872
It's starting it.

145
00:09:23,872 --> 00:09:27,748
So you don't need to write to
actually start stop start,

146
00:09:27,748 --> 00:09:33,174
you can also do service tor restart and
it's gonna do the whole process for you.

147
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:38,573
So you can save a little bit of time
there and let's just repeat everything.

148
00:09:38,573 --> 00:09:43,968
And go ahead, I'm just gonna go ahead and
type in proxychairs firefox and

149
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:47,373
I will request the same
search engine as well.

150
00:09:47,373 --> 00:09:48,594
Will it open?

151
00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:52,614
Now don't be disencouraged,
if it doesn't open it straightaway.

152
00:09:52,614 --> 00:09:55,563
If it says, okay,
you don't have connectivity or

153
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:59,060
website is not available or
something of that kind.

154
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:03,788
Just try typing in service space
tor space restart command,

155
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:07,322
a couple of times over
again until you get it.

156
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:11,317
Because sometimes,
certain IP addresses are blocked and

157
00:10:11,317 --> 00:10:14,261
you need to be assigned
the one that is not.

158
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:18,581
So just don't immediately jump to
a conclusion, oh, it's broken,

159
00:10:18,581 --> 00:10:19,761
what am I gonna do?

160
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:22,941
It's gonna take forever to fix this,
how am I going to do this.

161
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:27,863
No, just try resetting it a couple of
times and you will resolve the problem,

162
00:10:27,863 --> 00:10:32,122
primarily because a different IP
address will be assigned to you.

163
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:37,764
So anyway, let's just go ahead and
type in again,

164
00:10:37,764 --> 00:10:42,762
check for DNS leaks for
center and here we go.

165
00:10:42,762 --> 00:10:47,543
I'm just gonna use the same website,
it's DNS leak or whatever.

166
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:50,821
DNS leak test, that's the name of it.

167
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:51,998
Excellent.
So you see now,

168
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:55,302
I don't even need to compare the IP,
obviously, it's different.

169
00:10:55,302 --> 00:10:59,521
So this one is 217.13, this one is 91.109.

170
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:05,261
So completely different IP address here
and from a completely different place.

171
00:11:05,261 --> 00:11:10,381
Now it says that I am from United Kingdom,
apparently somewhere in London.

172
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:14,079
Now let's just go ahead
issue a standard test to see

173
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,901
what sort of resolutions will I get here,
this might take a while.

174
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:22,082
That's why I'm doing the standard test,
because it's a lot faster.

175
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:25,027
But you see the last one was rather fast,

176
00:11:25,027 --> 00:11:28,761
this one is a bit slower,
depends on the distance.

177
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:33,120
I suppose I'm a bit closer to Germany
than I am to the United Kingdom.

178
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,540
I don't know.

179
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,152
I suppose this depends on the speed
of their server, as well.

180
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:42,272
Anyway, you can see my DNS resolutions
here, it's Level 3 Communications.

181
00:11:42,272 --> 00:11:44,852
Again, I have stated
nothing from United States.

182
00:11:44,852 --> 00:11:48,860
I am completely anonymous with this,

183
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:54,252
not likely to be detected
by pretty much anything.

184
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:58,560
Just to give you an example,
if you wanted, for

185
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,351
example, to use proxychange with nmap.

186
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:04,379
I'm not gonna go into great detail now,

187
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:06,952
I will show you this when
we get to the nmap section.

188
00:12:06,952 --> 00:12:10,878
But before we do,
we can see some rebose output here,

189
00:12:10,878 --> 00:12:13,513
how this is actually functioning.

190
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:17,113
So there are certain domains
which are being contacted,

191
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:20,413
you can see pretty everything
that is going on here.

192
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:21,313
No problems.

193
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:25,743
Not a bad idea to sometimes go
through this sort of information,

194
00:12:25,743 --> 00:12:31,486
especially if you do not have connectivity
or you wish to understand better exactly

195
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:37,080
where is your traffic going, where it is
ending up and how is it spinning around.

196
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:42,750
Anyway, let's just go ahead and
clear the screen and

197
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,660
use let's say, proxychains nmap.

198
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,498
And this is all that you would
need to do in order to route

199
00:12:50,498 --> 00:12:53,762
all of nmap's traffic through proxychains.

200
00:12:53,762 --> 00:12:57,096
This is pretty much true
of any application,

201
00:12:57,096 --> 00:13:00,262
just invoke the application as you would.

202
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:06,620
So normal nmap in the location would
be nmap and then so IP address here and

203
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:12,682
then a port over here and some arguments,
as well to go along with it.

204
00:13:12,682 --> 00:13:19,323
But instead of just typing it like that,
you can use proxychains and hide yourself.

205
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:25,056
Also, just type in how would you evoke a
browser on a regular basis, you would type

206
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:30,722
in firefox, press Enter and that would,
of course, open up a Firefox browser.

207
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:33,970
So, any application that you can
start through your terminal and

208
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,402
you can start all of them
through your terminal.

209
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:41,538
Just type in proxychains in front of
it and all the network information

210
00:13:41,538 --> 00:13:46,862
generated by that application will
be routed through the proxychains.

211
00:13:46,862 --> 00:13:51,863
Now will it use a preset of proxies or
will it use tor,

212
00:13:51,863 --> 00:13:56,084
that is up to you how
you have configured it.

213
00:13:56,084 --> 00:13:57,883
And there will be a part three to this.

214
00:13:57,883 --> 00:14:03,158
I will show you how can you import
custom chains of proxies and

215
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:08,122
how you can use those proxies
to access things on the net or

216
00:14:08,122 --> 00:14:11,243
to hide your activity behind them.

217
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:14,920
In any case, I bid you farewell and
I thank you for watching.
