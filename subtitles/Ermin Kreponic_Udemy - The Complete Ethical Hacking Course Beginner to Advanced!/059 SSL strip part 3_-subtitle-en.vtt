00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000

Hello and welcome to this tutorial.



2

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000

This is will be the final one in the series of SSL strip, so let's wrap it up.



3

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.300

Anyway, I'm going to arf spoof basically twice.



4

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.600

I will convince the router that I am Windows 8.1 machine



5

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.900

and I will also convince the Windows 8.1 machine that I am the router as well.



6

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.570

Now this is the case that I have a virtual machine here, but it doesn't really matter.



7

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.520

It would work just the same with pretty much any other device



8

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.230

that is connected to this particular wireless network.



9

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.000

The procedure is exactly the same.



10

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.530

There are literally no differences whatsoever.



11

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.800

Anyway, this is the default gateway



12

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.500

Meaning that is my router and this is the IP address of my Windows machine.



13

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.000

I know what it is now, but I've shown you can use nmap to see the live hosts on the network



14

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.600

and you can use -O argument to perform operating system detection



15

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.000

and you can see which sort of devices are on the network.



16

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000

Anyway, let's go ahead and issue this command



17

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.300

and later on, I have one more thing to show you with IP tables.



18

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.500

I've been struggling around with that.



19

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.400

It didn't wanna work for a while for some strange reason



20

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.700

but then I really figured it out what it was.



21

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.240

Let me just see what I actually typed in here.



22

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.400

There is a command that you need to run.



23

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.000

You need to open up a port manually in the IP tables



24

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000

and that would be port 8080.



25

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.800

Okay, so router is first here.



26

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.479

Excellent



27

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.800

and Windows 8.1 machine is first here.



28

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.600

So now I am effectively performing the arf spoofing action.



29

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.000

I need to do it twice



30

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.200

and I guarantee you it's going to be effective this way



31

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.549

but here's what I wanted to show you.



32

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.000

Here's what I've been struggling with.



33

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000

The thing that I've been having problems with.



34

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.500

The port on my machine from which I'm performing the attack, port 8080, was not open.



35

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:17.500

Even though an application was listening, it was not permitted by IP tables to receive any sort of traffic on it



36

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.500

and that presented a pretty big problem



37

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.000

because now my arf poisoning effectively DoS'd a wireless network.



38

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.500

By poisoning the arf, I have effectively rendered the host that I am messing around with...



39

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.500

not the host, the victim machine that I am messing around with, connectionless.



40

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.900

It could no longer function properly, it could no longer interact with that wifi in a proper way



41

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.000

and it no longer had an exit point onto the internet.



42

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.600

So what I did was manually correct the problem.



43

00:02:50.600 --> 00:03:01.800

I typed in "iptables -I INPUT"



44

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.000

and I'm going to insert to the first position



45

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000

because it's very important with these rules, the positions themselves



46

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.400

the Linux will start interpreting the rules from the first to the last.



47

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.370

If they contradict each other or something like that



48

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.000

the first one in the order will take precedence always.



49

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.600

Input 1, and I need the protocol. It's going to be "tcp -- dport" -- This is a shortcut



50

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.800

and the dport will be 8080, the one that we specified.



51

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.500

You also specify different ports here, depending on what you specified on the redirect rule.



52

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.500

So you can use pretty much use any port there as well



53

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.280

that is not being used for anything else.



54

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.800

Anyway, let's just go ahead and type in dport there



55

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.000

"-j ACCEPT"



56

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.100

and this is the command which you need to run for IP tables as well



57

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.000

in order to open up this port here, so that the SSL strip could be listening.



58

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000

I'm not going to do it now because I already have it.



59

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000

Let me just show it to you -- "iptables -L INPUT"



60

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000

Well, what do you know. It's not actually there.



61

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000

No problems, we'll just go through it again.



62

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.200

I must have performed reset quite recently, but it doesn't really matter.



63

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.000

I can just do it really fast.



64

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:55.000

"...INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT"



65

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.200

Excellent. There we go



66

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.000

and now I can do the listing.



67

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.030

ACCEPT, tcp, source -- anywhere, destination -- anywhere



68

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.200

It says here webcache, but it's 80



69

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.700

Anyway, let's just go ahead and clear the screen.



70

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:22.600

Now I need to type in "sslstrip -l 8080"



71

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.000

Now keep in mind any that changes that you make in this fashion to the IP tables, to the firewall



72

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.300

are not permanent.



73

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.500

The first reset of the firewall, or the first reset of the machine as well



74

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.500

will pretty much restore the default settings.



75

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.590

They are not permanent changes, so I must have reset it or something like that



76

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.300

reset the service itself, the firewall service, and I've lost a rule



77

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.500

but it doesn't really matter.



78

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.700

Let me just go ahead and start the ssl strip and listen on port 8080



79

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.800

press ENTER, and there we go.



80

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.700

It is now effectively listening.



81

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.900

Now I'm not going to monitor this



82

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.100

because this is going to share some sort of information anyway that I'm not gonna be that interested in.



83

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:16.400

What I want is to type in "tail - sslstrip.log"



84

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.210

Press ENTER



85

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:26.100

tail -f will provide a live feed of any changes done to this file and sslstrip



86

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:33.000

Pretty much whatever passwords or usernames it manages to grab, it puts into this log file



87

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.190

and I want to monitor it, I want to see when things pop there.



88

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.000

Let's go over to my virtual machine -- Windows 8.1



89

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:58.500

I have it right here



90

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.900

Anyway, let's just go ahead and open up Firefox



91

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.000

and I'm gonna open Internet Explorer as well.



92

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000

I will show you the difference between the two.



93

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.400

Some of the things will work on Internet Explorer



94

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:17.000

while those same things will not work on Firefox



95

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000

primarily because they have different safeguards in place



96

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.600

and I'm not usually overly critical of Microsoft



97

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.900

because they've done a wonderful job with the security in Windows 8



98

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.400

but they've done a terrible job with design there.



99

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:36.700

However, Internet Explorer still remains one of the most vulnerable browsers out there.



100

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.000

I do not understand why.



101

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000

There you go



102

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.800

This is actually a tailing part.



103

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.200

You can see what sort of information is being passed here.



104

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.000

This is kinda difficult to read. It doesn't really make that much sense.



105

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.300

I mean, I couldn't read this.



106

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.500

Maybe I could, but only portions of it



107

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.360

and it would take me a very long time to figure out what all of it actually means and represents



108

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.500

but you are only looking for certain types of fields that have very specific names.



109

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.200

So let's go over to Google



110

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.000

I am wondering will it actually open Google



111

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.500

Surely enough, it actually opens it up



112

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.100

So Google search engine actually works with this.



113

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.000

Let's try Gmail



114

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000

Will it be able to open up Gmail?



115

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000

and yes it will, but it will be encrypted.



116

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000

Let's see, will I manage to take the credentials?



117

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:48.000

I'm going say FAKE, fake



118

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.670

Okay, it says incorrect



119

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:57.100

but since I am still going over the encrypted protocols, this is not gonna work.



120

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:02.000

Okay, no problems. Let's give it a shot here



121

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000

and let's see if this is gonna work on Internet Explorer.



122

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:21.900

Yes it will, because immediately here you see that it's HTTP protocol



123

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.370

and let's see if this is gonna catch it



124

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:30.200

SO FAKE, fake, sign in, and there we go.



125

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:39.000

It actually did catch it.



126

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.200

So the user name is actually "email", which is correct.



127

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:52.500

So email equals FAKE, and password equals fake.



128

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.700

Surprisingly enough, it doesn't work on Firefox



129

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.900

and usually if it doesn't work for Firefox, it's not gonna work with Chrome



130

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.000

but there is always a chance, a slight chance



131

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.900

With Explorer, it does work



132

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:10.200

and let me tell you this, 30% of the world's population still uses Internet Explorer.



133

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:16.200

Out of that 30%, a good amount of them does not perform regular updates



134

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:25.800

and even better, vast majority of that 30% are actually people in the corporate world



135

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.500

in the companies were you have a computer from the company



136

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:36.200

and you are forced to use certain programs, certain browsers, and operate under certain settings



137

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.500

and those are usually the kind of targets that pen testers go for



138

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.000

when they get the permission to do something of a kind



139

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.880

which is fantastic



140

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:53.000

primarily because they are using Internet Explorer, as it is extremely vulnerable.



141

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.300

So let's just try a few more pages and see how this works out.



142

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.500

Let's see if we can get to Facebook.



143

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:10.000

Okay, I'm gonna try Facebook on Explorer and I'm gonna try Facebook on Firefox.



144

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000

I didn't install the Chrome here because pretty much the same rules apply with Firefox.



145

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.300

They're state of the art browsers



146

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.700

and you see, it doesn't work with Facebook.



147

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.900

I'm not even going to try because...ah, I might as well try since I'm here.



148

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:28.200

It's still HTTPS, but down here with the Explorer



149

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.210

it's HTTP, and you'll be able to take it.



150

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:34.639

So let's give it a shot. Why not?



151

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:41.500

Facebook



152

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.500

and surely enough...



153

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.400

I should have it here somewhere, let me just see...



154

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.700

It's fairly difficult to see



155

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.700

Oh, I just had it...I had it



156

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.300

There we go



157

00:11:53.300 --> 00:12:00.000

So "email=FACEBOOK",  and "pass=FACEBOOK"



158

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.300

So over on Internet Explorer, I have managed to steal the credentials.



159

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.209

Let's go ahead and see whether or not I'm going to be able to do it in Firefox



160

00:12:06.209 --> 00:12:15.000

No, but let's try anyway.



161

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.500

Um no, this is definitely not going to work.



162

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:28.000

Let's just try it one more time.



163

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:40.000

Um, what am I going to type in here?



164

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.700

Nothing has changed here, so it didn't actually managed to capture it.



165

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:51.500

There was no stripping of this S, and the traffic unfortunately is still encrypted here.



166

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.000

So we can't actually use Facebook for that, but let's try some different sites.



167

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000

Let's try PayPal



168

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:18.440

That's one of the most common sites to receive attacks.



169

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:24.500

No, I don't want Bing. I want PayPal.



170

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.500

Amazing...amazing



171

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:38.000

Why are you doing this to me?



172

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000

Will it open? Well, what do you know! It actually does!



173

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:51.500

and it's running under HTTP protocol, which means username and password is in clear text



174

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.500

which is fantastic.



175

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:58.200

I do believe that I have this version of Windows updated to the max.



176

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:03.500

Do I? Yup, there are no notifications regarding updates.



177

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:09.500

So it is updated to the final version, along with the Internet Explorer



178

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.800

and let's see if it actually works on Firefox.



179

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:19.000

Purely doubt it, but I'm going to give it a shot anyway because I like trying things out.



180

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.500

No, no it doesn't.



181

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:30.000

Actually there is an S there, and this will not work.



182

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:42.000

So let's try Firefox.



183

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.500

Will it gives me anything? No, it will not.



184

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:54.330

Let's see Explorer



185

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:55.500

Yup, there we go.



186

00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:03.000

It's definitely somewhere in here.



187

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.500

Okay, so let's go over to some less protected sites.



188

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.800

Let's just give it a shot



189

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:16.490

I'm gonna go over to Linux.org



190

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:24.000

Wait, not Linux.org



191

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.500

Linuxquestions.org



192

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:33.800

This is a fantastic website to get pretty much any answers out there



193

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:43.500

and let's do the same here.



194

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.500

Let's go over to the official site



195

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.000

and no



196

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.500

This is in clear text anyway



197

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:56.600

but anyway, they don't really need to add any extra security there



198

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.420

because, I don't know, nobody's gonna steal these passwords.



199

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.700

There's no money here.



200

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.600

This is purely for educational purposes and people trade knowledge here



201

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.600

but anyway, it is a good site to actually visit.



202

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.200

If you have any problems, you can ask people there pretty much anything related to Linux



203

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.500

and more often than not, you'll find people willing to help you out.



204

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:24.000

Anyway, I hope I've given you a few clear demonstrations of what you can do here



205

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.500

and just in case you are thinking that you cannot do anything with Firefox or Chrome



206

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:33.200

well, you're badly mistaken, primarily because yes you can.



207

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:40.100

Chrome and Firefox are both susceptible to sslstrip, but not on all sites.



208

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.200

It won't work, for example



209

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.400

it won't work on PayPal, it won't work on Google, it won't work on Facebook



210

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.000

but as you have seen on Explorer, it will work on pretty much anything.



211

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.200

So if you're lucky enough, your victim is using Internet Explorer



212

00:16:54.200 --> 00:17:00.400

and you have a 30% that they are, which is there not bad odds at all.



213

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:05.200

You will be able to pretty much steal all the credentials.



214

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:12.800

Especially important with the rise of the Windows phone, who also uses Internet Explorer.



215

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.500

However, Firefox and Chrome will be vulnerable



216

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:23.000

if people try to log in into some less secure sites somewhere else



217

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.100

that are also functioning under HTTPS protocol, where the S gets stripped



218

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.800

the SSL encryption.



219

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.700

However, there are no extra safeguards



220

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.700

and you can actually steal the log in credentials there



221

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.500

and as I said before, people usually tend to recycle them and reuse them



222

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.200

so you have a very good chance that they are the same.



223

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:52.300

In any case,  I bid you all farewell.



224

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.500

I hope that you have enjoyed this tutorial



225

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.500

and with this, I will conclude this chapter



226

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:03.200

and of course, I really do hope to see you in the next tutorial



227

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.580

but until then, I urge you to experiment on your own, of course



228

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.300

within the limits of the law.



229

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:13.000

Anyway, I hope to see you next time.
