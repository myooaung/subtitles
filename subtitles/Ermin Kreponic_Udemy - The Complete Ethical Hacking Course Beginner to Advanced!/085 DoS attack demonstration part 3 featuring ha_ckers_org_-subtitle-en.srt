1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,837
Okay, so we're just going to
continue from where we left off.

2
00:00:06,837 --> 00:00:09,970
Yep, I still have the terminal up and
running.

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:15,628
And now we need to go onto that,
here's the address.

4
00:00:15,628 --> 00:00:17,836
Okay, so you no longer need this one.

5
00:00:17,836 --> 00:00:20,319
You just need

6
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:29,128
http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/.

7
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:33,671
And you can go ahead and
visit this website.

8
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:39,211
This is the official website for
this, exploit for this Perl script.

9
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:42,682
There isn't that much information on it,
but

10
00:00:42,682 --> 00:00:45,797
there is enough for a script of this kind.

11
00:00:45,797 --> 00:00:51,583
I would strongly recommend that you don't
necessarily need to read through all this,

12
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:52,461
but skim it.

13
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:54,211
Just go and skim it.

14
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:55,420
See what's in there.

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,960
See what the developers have written.

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,570
See how it works, what it is for,
in addition to what I have already stated.

17
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:09,420
You might get some deeper insights
into how this attack actually works.

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,963
One of the bright sides of this
attack is it doesn't actually

19
00:01:13,963 --> 00:01:18,070
require a lot of bandwidth,
not necessarily anyway.

20
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,324
But the more you have, the better.

21
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:21,950
Okay, so let's scroll down.

22
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,212
This is the part that you
really should take a look at.

23
00:01:25,212 --> 00:01:32,295
These are the servers, web servers, that
are affected by this sort of an attack.

24
00:01:32,295 --> 00:01:33,117
And down below,

25
00:01:33,117 --> 00:01:36,837
these are the servers that should not
be vulnerable to this type of attack.

26
00:01:36,837 --> 00:01:38,586
Okay, change here.

27
00:01:38,586 --> 00:01:39,710
I have a slight correction for
myself here.

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,920
These are not the servers that are
vulnerable to this type of an attack, but

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,063
rather instead,
that are probably vulnerable or

30
00:01:49,063 --> 00:01:52,300
that are likely to be susceptible to this.

31
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,360
Same applies here.

32
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,280
On these servers, it's not likely that
this type of an attack will work.

33
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,900
You see, for

34
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,650
these two, it's actually verified by
user community that it doesn't work.

35
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,511
You can still go ahead and try it,
if you have the permission,

36
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:12,420
but it is unlikely that it will work.

37
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,961
Anyway, here you have Apache 2,
point something.

38
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:20,860
That's important because a large amount
of servers out there run on Apache.

39
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,742
And what I am pleased to see here
is that Lighttpd doesn't seem to be

40
00:02:26,742 --> 00:02:31,795
affected by this and Nginx also
doesn't seem to be affected by this.

41
00:02:31,795 --> 00:02:33,003
More importantly, NginX.

42
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:40,540
If you don't know what NginX is,
it's spelled NginX.

43
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,461
It's an alternative to Apache.

44
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:47,441
It hasn't been quite around for that long,
like Apache, but definitely long enough,

45
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:50,860
and people have been using it
as a substitute for Apache.

46
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,546
It's said to be faster, but
I can't really confirm this.

47
00:02:55,546 --> 00:03:00,400
Anyway, that's a bit of extra information
that I just dumped in there somehow.

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,878
Doesn't really matter.

49
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:05,446
It says here also that
there are requirements for

50
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:07,628
this script to actually run.

51
00:03:07,628 --> 00:03:11,994
But if you're running it on Kali Linux
in the latest version, as I am,

52
00:03:11,994 --> 00:03:15,220
you shouldn't need to
install anything extra.

53
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,710
If you do, refer to this site and

54
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,800
see what else is missing, but
I don't know, I've tried it.

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,780
I've tried it on the Cullen Linux that
I'm running and you are running the same

56
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:32,280
system back at your place, you shouldn't
need to install anything of a kind.

57
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,091
Anyway, if you just keep on scrolling.

58
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:41,066
Just a key note here for anybody out there

59
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:45,161
that wants to do this on Windows,

60
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:50,004
you can, but you need to setup Cygwin.

61
00:03:50,004 --> 00:03:56,671
Yeah, this is definitely doable,
but I wouldn't really recommend it.

62
00:03:56,671 --> 00:04:00,242
Anyway, you go down further and
it says download.

63
00:04:00,242 --> 00:04:03,710
It's slowloris.pl.

64
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:09,800
You will need to download this particular
script or if you want to perform

65
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,250
this DoS attack on an IPv6 protocol,
you can also download this script.

66
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:21,264
I wouldn't say that that high of
a percentage of the world is using IPv6,

67
00:04:21,264 --> 00:04:22,628
not yet anyway.

68
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:25,503
But slowly, but surely,
they are switching to IPv6.

69
00:04:25,503 --> 00:04:26,878
Let me tell you why.

70
00:04:26,878 --> 00:04:30,059
You have about four
billion IPv4 addresses and

71
00:04:30,059 --> 00:04:33,251
you have exponentially
more IPv6 addresses.

72
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:36,310
Because there is a shortage
of IP addresses,

73
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,295
they've switched over to IPv6 protocol.

74
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:43,128
They made it available, but
I don't know why exactly.

75
00:04:43,128 --> 00:04:49,110
But not that high of a percentage has
switched to IPv6, not yet, anyway.

76
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,750
But in the future, sure, why not?

77
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,010
Anyway, for the time being, you're going
to use this particular script that I said.

78
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,600
Just go ahead and click on it.

79
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,560
And, you see that this is not
your average download link.

80
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,187
This is basically a script on the Net
that you are going to CTRL+A to select

81
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:09,878
everything, and then CTRL+C to copy it.

82
00:05:09,878 --> 00:05:16,638
Normally, I wouldn't advise doing this,
but I trust this site to a good extent and

83
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:21,003
you're doing this in a virtual machine,
so, yeah.

84
00:05:21,003 --> 00:05:25,562
Though, if you're doing it in a virtual
machine, it's not that dangerous, but

85
00:05:25,562 --> 00:05:29,540
if you're doing it in a physical machine,
it could present problems.

86
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,440
Anyway, let's just go ahead,

87
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,630
I'm gonna I have two of the files
which I've previously created.

88
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,045
So I'm just going to delete both of them.

89
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:45,045
And I'm going to create a new one,
nano slowloris.

90
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,135
You can name this whatever you want,
by the way.

91
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,110
.pl, but this just makes sense.

92
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,210
And you do need an extension pl, though.

93
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,799
That is an absolute must-have here.

94
00:05:55,799 --> 00:06:00,410
Just open up the file in nano.

95
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,710
Paste the contents.

96
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,730
Don't close it and save it immediately.

97
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,878
It takes a while for everything to load.

98
00:06:07,878 --> 00:06:08,638
You have the code here,

99
00:06:08,638 --> 00:06:10,930
down below as explanations,
the developers have placed there.

100
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,513
So you got some things here,
you can go through the script,

101
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:19,378
if you wish,
if you know how to read perl scripts.

102
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,003
Ctrl+Alt save.

103
00:06:21,003 --> 00:06:24,046
Press Enter, Ctrl+X to exit.

104
00:06:24,046 --> 00:06:28,130
Do the chmod, make the file executable.

105
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,836
+x slowloris.pl.

106
00:06:31,836 --> 00:06:33,212
Clear the screen.

107
00:06:33,212 --> 00:06:38,170
I'm sure I have the command here somewhere
because I really don't feel like

108
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,220
typing it in now.

109
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,295
I'm bound to make mistakes doing
tutorials when I type them in.

110
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:47,788
So you have this standard
script execution command ./ to

111
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:51,921
execute pretty much any
executable script in Linux.

112
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:57,490
Then you type in the name of the script or
the path to the script.

113
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,880
Then you have this argument dns,
then you have the IP address,

114
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,950
then you have -port 80.

115
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,722
And I do believe this is
the number of threads or

116
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:08,380
should I say SOCKS that are opened.

117
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,550
Anyway, go ahead.

118
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,580
I have typed in the IP
address of my router,

119
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,070
of course,
on which I'm gonna be performing this.

120
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,580
I have done the Nmap scan for
this particular IP address.

121
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,211
So go ahead and press Enter and
this is going to run.

122
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:26,590
Let's open up a browser.

123
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,290
It's 192.168.1.1, now it might load,
it might not load.

124
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,545
Okay, it doesn't load.

125
00:07:31,545 --> 00:07:34,671
It says the connection was reset.

126
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:36,336
I am unable to access it.

127
00:07:36,336 --> 00:07:40,598
So let's go ahead and into Kali,

128
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:45,629
stop this attack, go back to Firefox.

129
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:49,004
Let's try reloading the site now.

130
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:50,420
Try again.

131
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:55,045
No, I have stopped the script, have I?

132
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:03,780
Excellent, there we go.

133
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,297
I didn't press try again, I just pressed
Ctrl+R on my keyboard to reload the site.

134
00:08:08,297 --> 00:08:12,585
You can see that now I can type in,
as opposed to before,

135
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:15,880
you can see that the connection was reset.

136
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,500
So let's just go ahead and cancel this,
and while I'm running the tutorial,

137
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,840
let me just go ahead and do this thing,
Google, so that you know that I have

138
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,461
Internet connectivity, that I am not
disconnected from the Net completely.

139
00:08:29,461 --> 00:08:32,795
Not Q, but Ctrl+C.

140
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:35,045
So pretty simple to execute.

141
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:38,200
No, you don't have to invest
that much thought into it,

142
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,860
if you just conduct the scan.

143
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,640
If you see that it's vulnerable,
then you can perform an attack.

144
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:49,128
If you see that it's not vulnerable, then,
of course, you won't be able to do it.

145
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:54,407
Now, a key reminder before I finish this,
all of these tests I'm doing on

146
00:08:54,407 --> 00:09:00,115
my router so, on this particular web
service that I'm running on this router,

147
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:05,336
as you can see, it does have a list of
servers on which it is likely to run.

148
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:09,283
But, if you do try it on some
other servers that you, of course,

149
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:12,003
have permission to do so,
it might not run.

150
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:16,757
Also, it might actually slow the sites
down, increase the loading time or

151
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:22,128
increase the loading time to a couple of
minutes as, I do believe, I stated before.

152
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:25,587
So, it can be a full DoS attack or
a partial DoS attack.

153
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:27,920
If it's a partial one,
don't be discouraged.

154
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,307
It's pretty much just as effective as
the real one, primarily because nobody is

155
00:09:32,307 --> 00:09:36,836
going to wait around for five minutes for
their sites to load or rarely anyone will.

156
00:09:36,836 --> 00:09:42,320
Just try putting yourself
in such a position.

157
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,350
Anyway, I bid you farewell here and
I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
