3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,080
to take this journey with us to learn about ethical hacking and penetration testing.

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:26,850
I think the most you can get out of this course is a motivation to learn and try out these things yourself.

5
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:33,750
What you see in this course are valuable skills that people need worldwide and are willing to pay for

We hope that we've given you the opportunity in over 25 hours of HD video to learn these skills effectively

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,420
in this course and we hope that you enjoy the community of students that we've all built here together

9
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:55,550
over 30000 people just like you are taking this course and are hoping to learn from it.

10
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,620
If you connect with other students in this course you can find amazing opportunities other people to

11
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,410
work with to learn with and maybe even to work on line with or build a career together or make a new

12
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,470
friend.

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,270
All that gets started if you click on added discussion and if you are introduce yourself tell us what

14
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,510
you're looking to learn out of the course even if you don't find even one video helpful just introducing

15
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:27,750
yourself can give you the chance to start meeting and connecting with people in the course and you never

16
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,650
know what can come out of it.

17
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,500
Thank you very much for getting started and we hope that you loved this course.
