00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600

Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.



2

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.800

Today I will show you a little bit more stuff that you can do Nmap



3

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.000

but more importantly than that



4

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000

I will show you a tool which you can use to assign a physical location, namely a city, to an IP address.



5

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.800

It's relatively precise and it's relatively good



6

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.000

but the downside of it is that you can only make 1000 queries per day



7

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.200

which is still very reasonable



8

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.710

I mean, 1000 queries per day is a pretty good thing.



9

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.200

However, if you're doing some sort of mass scanning or something like that



10

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.100

it won't really help you.



11

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.000

You will need to go online and download the libraries for that



12

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.200

but 1000 is a very good number



13

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.200

and let me just show you how it actually works.



14

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.500

So here I have a command



15

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.200

This is the command that I've used to scan scanme.nmap.org and to get some information from it.



16

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.300

So it's "curl ipinfo.io/ ", and then you get an IP address here.



17

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.600

It's a curl script



18

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.000

So let me just copy/paste that here



19

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.500

and this is the command -- curl



20

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.000

This is the argument that you are passing  through it, along with the IP address.



21

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.600

Once you press ENTER, it queries the server



22

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.200

and there you go.



23

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.000

You have an IP and you have a host.



24

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000

You get a host name as well.



25

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.700

You get a city -- It's Fremont



26

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.600

It's region is California, country is US



27

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.150

you even get some coordinates here



28

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.100

organization, postal code, and so on and so forth.



29

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.900

So you get some really useful information here, in regards to an IP address



30

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.400

but as I said, the downside is that you can make 1000 queries per day



31

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.200

So you're not doing anything illegal here or anything of a kind.



32

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.000

You are simply querying a database somewhere in the world



33

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.600

to give you a specific information on an IP address.



34

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.000

You could have done this by simply typing on the net "Who is"



35

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.800

However, I wish to teach you how to do these things in the terminal



36

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.000

so that you will be less dependent on the browser or things of a kind.



37

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.030

Anyway, let me just go ahead and clear this.



38

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.000

Now what I wanted to discuss with you today are some external resources



39

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.800

which you can use in combination with Nmap.



40

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.200

Nmap has a wide variety of scripts that are applicable to it



41

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.400

and then you will be able to use nmap



42

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.000

in order to scan for particular vulnerabilities on the servers elsewhere in the world.



43

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.580

So just go ahead and open up your browser.



44

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.000

Okay, so I have this website -- scanme.nmap.org



45

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.200

open here



46

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.700

and on that website, there is a link



47

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.100

It's nmap.org



48

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.500

and then some link here.



49

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.250

You can just copy/paste this if you wish, or something of a kind.



50

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.700

Just read through it and then navigate over on their website



51

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.200

but it's not really that hard.



52

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.300

I'm here on nmap's website



53

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.200

and I have a list of categories of what sort of scripts can I run with nmap



54

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.200

in order to scan for particular vulnerabilities.



55

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.400

So there are 490 scripts, which is a lot.



56

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.300

For DoS, for denial of service attacks



57

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.910

those sort of vulnerabilities



58

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.000

for exploits



59

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.239

for, I don't know, for brute forcing, for identification. etc.



60

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.200

Anyway, let's just go and click on one of them.



61

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.209

Pretty much any will do. It's not a problem.



62

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.200

I'm gonna go ahead and click on vuln...some general thing



63

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.000

and now I have all these things here.



64

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.700

So if you're wondering "Well, how can I bypass firewall rules?"



65

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.800

Well, simply use a script.



66

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.200

It says "firewall-bypass"



67

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:52.700

Detects vulnerabilities in netfilter and other firewalls that use helpers to dynamically open ports for protocols...



68

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.600

...such as ftp and sip.



69

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.500

So this is going to help in a good amount of cases.



70

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.000

You can go ahead and open new tab



71

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.290

and once you click on it, you'll get the exact syntax how to use it.



72

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.800

"Example Usage"



73

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.900

It gives you the exact syntax.



74

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.800

There is nothing different that you need to do here.



75

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:23.000

Instead of <target>, just type in the IP address, and that's it.



76

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000

Literally that is only thing that you need to change here.



77

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.600

Just copy this command



78

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.300

and then just change the last thing into the IP address that you wish to scan.



79

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.200

Now I'm not going to go through all of them.



80

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.300

As I said, there are 490 scripts.



81

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.790

We will be using some of them, however, in the later tutorials



82

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.400

where you will get some clear demonstrations, once we actually start attacking particular services



83

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.700

and start exploiting their vulnerabilities.



84

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.100

However, again, I won't go through all 490 of them



85

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.000

because the course would be ridiculously long



86

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000

but you can go to the Nmap website, find this...



87

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.400

So look -- You have security tools, security list, scanners, etc



88

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.500

There are so many resources here that you can use



89

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.000

and I strongly advise you to go on to this website and check it out



90

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.200

but just take a look...



91

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.700

This is probably the most important part for you and for everybody on this website



92

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.600

is the availability of these scripts.



93

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.000

So just take a look at what they do and what you can do with them



94

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.300

primarily because you can save yourself a ton load of time



95

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.370

by just conducting a scan for certain types of exploits.



96

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.600

If I click on exploits, it gives me all sorts of exploits.



97

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.000

So for example, if I'm attacking a very secure file transfer protocol



98

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.710

just read through it.



99

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:02.000

It explains in great detail what it does



100

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.500

Literally the exact syntax which you need to use.



101

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.570

Right next to it, you just type in the IP address of whatever host you want and that's it.



102

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.000

There are no changes, there is nothing else that you need to do



103

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000

you just copy/paste this and change the name here.



104

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.300

Anyway, I'm just gonna go scroll up



105

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.530

and then I have yet another website that I wish to show you.



106

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.500

It's called ExploitDB



107

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.000

So just type in "exploitdb"



108

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.800

and the first sighted that pops up -- Exploit Database by Offensive Security



109

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.000

Click on it



110

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.200

This is pretty much one of the largest databases out there, in regards to vulnerabilities.



111

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.000

You can find them all in one place here.



112

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.400

There are literally here.



113

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.860

There are some very nice Wireless tricks that you can do here --



114

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.300

Reverse shells, privilege escalation...pretty much everything.



115

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.500

We will be using this site extensively in the follow-up tutorials



116

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.800

in other chapters as well



117

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.400

but I just wanted to mention it here, primarily so that you can explore it a little bit



118

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.600

and I strongly do advise you to do it.



119

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.900

Just go through the website.



120

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.000

For example, take a look at the router did you are using.



121

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.600

Just see what sort of a router you're using.



122

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.000

See what sort of a router was provided to you by the ISP provider



123

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:35.000

and then go ahead and click on Search in the top menu



124

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.200

and search for the vulnerabilities of your home router.



125

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.400

See what you can do with it.



126

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.800

You can look at by port.



127

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.500

There is a free text search, description, author



128

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.000

Look how many platforms are down there.



129

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.700

If you don't know what platform it is, just try a free search thing



130

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.800

type in the name of your router



131

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.500

type that in free search text



132

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.300

and it's bound to give you some vulnerabilities



133

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:08.520

because pretty much all the home routers have more vulnerabilities than they should.



134

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.000

So that is a task that I leave you with.



135

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.200

I want you to open up this website -- Exploit Database



136

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.800

find the vulnerability of your home router



137

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.000

figure out which one it is first.



138

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000

Usually you can do this by just looking at the box of the router



139

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.500

and once you found the vulnerability, there will be a description on how to use it.



140

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.000

Try using it, try exploiting it



141

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.400

If it fails, and it probably won't



142

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.600

because all you need to do is copy/paste things into the Linux terminal



143

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.000

and we're gonna do some demonstrations later on along the way



144

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.700

as we do some more complex stuff



145

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.300

but before we do it, I want you to try it



146

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.600

and if you have any questions, post them in the question section.



147

00:08:53.600 --> 00:09:01.000

I will be more than happy to not only answer them, but also to help you through the process as well



148

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.100

in terms of instructing you or something like that.



149

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.500

You don't need to pay anything extra for that.



150

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.580

I will do it gladly and help you out



151

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.220

but please give it a shot.



152

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:14.200

Try it first and then continue up the tutorial, see what I do



153

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:20.000

then perhaps you can fix your technique and improve yourselves.



154

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000

Before I leave, just one more time



155

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000

Over here, you have scripts that you can use with Nmap to detect particular vulnerabilities.



156

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000

Just click on it.



157

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.200

Once you click on it, you will get the exact syntax.



158

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.900

All you need to do is change the IP address and type in "exploitdb"



159

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.400

Use this website extensively.



160

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.170

It is very good and there are lots of vulnerabilities on it.



161

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.000

Pretty much all of them are located there.



162

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.500

It is completely free.



163

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:50.000

You don't need to pay anything for any of the services that I have mentioned here.



164

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.500

Open, free, anybody can access



165

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.880

no registration required



166

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.300

and with that, I will leave you today



167

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.300

and one more time, I will urge you to try it yourselves



168

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.100

and then continue on with the course where I do it myself



169

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:08.500

and then you can see the particularities and the fine details of how it is done.



170

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.000

I bid you farewell and until next time.
