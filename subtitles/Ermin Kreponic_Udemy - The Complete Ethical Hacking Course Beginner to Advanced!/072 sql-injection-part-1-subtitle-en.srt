00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Today I will begin a chapter on SQL injections.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,100
Now before we actually begin the chapter itself and before I get into the injections themselves

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,200
before I do demos with this attack method

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:24,400
and demonstrate in great detail how you can perform it, I do need to explain a few things first.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,800
So what is an SQL injection?

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,400
In general, what do you think it is?

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:38,600
Well basically, as the name itself says, you're just injecting SQL queries into your HTTP request methods

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,000
or somewhere else on the site.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,900
What you are doing with this

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:56,100
you are effectively pulling the database information that exists behind a web server...

12
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,900
Basically there is a website, and that website pulls the information from a certain database

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,900
in order to be displayed on that particular website.

14
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,900
That is the way in which user names and passwords are actually verified.

15
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,200
You type it in

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,000
The web server takes it in...

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,700
Actually, not the web server itself

18
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,800
Rather instead, the web app that you have on your web server

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,000
takes in your user credentials.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,400
It compares them to the user credentials, which are stored in the database.

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,900
If they match, you get logged in.

22
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,100
If not, your access is denied.

23
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,560
However, more often than not

24
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,000
user credentials, especially passwords, within the databases are encrypted

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,800
and that can be a problem, especially if they have MD5 hashes.

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,900
It's not easy to break.

27
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,189
There is a possibility always, but it can take a longer period of time

28
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:03,130
and if somebody is using a crazy long password or something of a kind

29
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,000
yeah, that's not gonna happen

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,800
and you might think now "Well, why do we have to do this?"

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,800
"Why should we do this at all, because if we can't get the user credentials, then why does it matter?"

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,200
It DOES matter. It does matter to a great deal.

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,200
First of all, you can get encrypted user credentials

34
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,700
and then you can use multiple computers to decrypt them in a shorter amount of time.

35
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,300
That's one way

36
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,000
or you can extract other useful information

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,700
and you might wonder "Well, what other useful information is there?

38
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,200
"What can we use?"

39
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,000
Well, let me just remind you of a case that happened...

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Actually this happens on a daily basis, but you don't really find it in the news or anything of a kind.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
A group of hackers,  black hat hackers

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,600
they broke into a database, and even though the user credentials were encrypted

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,000
they were very well encrypted and they had really good policies for passwords.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,200
So it really wasn't likely that they would ever get decrypted

45
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,200
that they would ever log in as those particular users.

46
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,800
However, credit card information

47
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,200
credit card numbers

48
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,000
they were in plain text format and they could be read

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,800
so they took about 50,000 credit cards.

50
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Just imagine how many people were affected by this.

51
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,200
50,000 credit cards were stolen!

52
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,600
I mean, what they did with them was probably that they sell them

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,400
or they tried to use some of them on the net, or something of a kind, to wash the money

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,500
but either way, I'm just trying to make a point here

55
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:53,500
that user credentials are not the only useful type of information in a database.

56
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,300
There is loads of stuff, and not just credit card credentials or something of a kind

57
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,000
there is loads of other stuff that you can find there

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,800
that you can extract, depending on what the site is.

59
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,300
Sometimes you won't be able to get the password

60
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:13,200
but you will get a large amount of information in regard to a certain user.

61
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,200
You will get pretty much whatever you want to get without actually authenticated at all.

62
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,200
So whatever you wanted to do after the deauthentications

63
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,430
if you wanted to steal a password, for example

64
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,000
then log in as that user and then do something

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,500
take some information there

66
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,200
you will be able to take it this way without ever having to log in, which is fantastic

67
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,000
because you leave....you don't leave...

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,500
I mean still, your connection of course

69
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,500
gets logged by the server and it can be problematic

70
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,600
but you can also issue commands to delete certain entries in the database

71
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,500
not just the SQL, but others as well

72
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,000
and there are some logs there, you can delete them.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,800
Sometimes you can even inject code, but that's not likely.

74
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,700
However, you can actually inject SQL queries and that is code in it of itself

75
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,800
so you can do a lot of stuff there.

76
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,900
Anyway, without further ado, let's go ahead and set up a virtual lab

77
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,000
because we can't actually go doing this on random websites.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,100
As I said before, it's illegal and you can't do it...

79
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,100
You shouldn't do it

80
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,800
I mean physically you can, of course

81
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,000
technically you can, but you really shouldn't

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,500
primarily because it's illegal

83
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,800
and I know I'm probably getting on somebody's nerves by repeating this.

84
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,200
I am sorry for that, but it is necessary.

85
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,700
I don't now, I feel a bit better by just saying that you shouldn't do it like that.

86
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,900
There is no reason to do it illegally or anything of a kind

87
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:53,000
when you can set up a perfectly functional pen testing lab on your own computer

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,400
on your own machine, where you can tune the difficulties, tune the defensive measures, etc

89
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,750
and then attempt to bypass them in peace

90
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,800
without thinking that you're going to get caught or something of a kind.

91
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,100
Anyway, one of the first things that we're gonna need to download for this tutorial

92
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,700
is Damn Vulnerable Web Application.

93
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,300
So we need this

94
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:23,600
Pardon for the expression, but that's the actual name of the web app.

95
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:32,300
You need to go ahead and visit this website --  www.dvwa.co.uk

96
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,200
Go ahead and click on "Download"

97
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,800
I think I've downloaded it like five times by now

98
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,900
because surprisingly somehow I've been managing to mess up my recordings.

99
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,200
Save file, press okay

100
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,400
Go ahead and navigate over to your downloads folder

101
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,200
or you can just go ahead and directly open it from here.

102
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,699
So one more time

103
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:56,500
Click on the arrow in the upper right corner, click on the zip file.

104
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,300
You will see there is something here.

105
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,430
Just click extract, and once you click extract here

106
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,200
files will be extracted to your default folder.

107
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,000
Click "Quit"

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,800
Your default folder for downloads is actually "Downloads"

109
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,200
So go ahead and navigate over to your home folder.

110
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,600
There we go

111
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,500
and go ahead and click on "Downloads"

112
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,000
There we go

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,900
So it says DVWA

114
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,200
That's the file which we have extracted.

115
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:34,200
I'm pretty sure I have extracted here

116
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,700
Yep, there we go

117
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,200
Anyway, so it's DVWA 1.0.8

118
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,600
I have extracted it several times and not sure where the files are going anymore

119
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
but it's gonna be in the downloads folder.

120
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,900
If you don't want to open it from here, from the browser

121
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,800
just go ahead then navigate over to your downloads folder

122
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,500
and there you go

123
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,900
I have a zipped file

124
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,200
I have three of them

125
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,000
Three exactly the same files

126
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,800
Double click on it

127
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,700
Click "extract" again

128
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,700
and click "extract" here, and that's it.

129
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,300
No problems there.

130
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,539
My existing one just got overwritten and that's why I was a bit confused.

131
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:15,600
I didn't have two of them.

132
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,200
It says here "Overwrite existing files", "Recreate folders"

133
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,200
but anyway, that's why I was confused.

134
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,900
I thought I would have two of them, but apparently I have one

135
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,500
because it was overwritten.

136
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,300
Anyway, enough of that.

137
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,000
So we have our folder here, it's downloaded

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and now we need to copy it to our default web servers folder.

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,300
Go ahead and open up your terminal.

140
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:46,400
Type in the following command -- "cp -Rv"

141
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,300
Capital R is for recursive mode, so it cp's all the subfolders as well

142
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:59,900
and v for verbosity, so the cp command would tell you what exactly is it copying.

143
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:13,000
Go ahead and type in " /home/ "

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,500
No, not home. Sorry

145
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,000
/root/

146
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Ugh, come on. Why are you doing this to me?

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,500
I am amazing. I am truly amazing.

148
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,000
Let's see where this is

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh, it's in /home/test/Downloads. Okay, sorry.

150
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,900
I am logged in as my regular user at the moment.

151
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,000
I didn't realize that.

152
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:53,800
So just type in cp -Rv /home/ Your Username

153
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,300
My username is "test"

154
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:01,500
Yours is probably something that you typed in, but mine is test

155
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:08,500
and then type in " /Downloads/DVWA 1.0.8"

156
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,700
There we go

157
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,000
So this folder is the one that you need to copy

158
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,500
and this folder you're going to copy into "/var/www/", press ENTER

159
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,200
and there we go.

160
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,800
I have completed the copy.

161
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:32,000
You can see the machine has actually told me every single file that it has copied.

162
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,900
Now if you have been following through my other tutorials

163
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,400
you might have some other files in this folder.

164
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:46,000
Before I actually began this tutorial, I cleaned this folder

165
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,200
"pwd" -- Print Working Directory

166
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:58,900
So if you have anything within this folder, you should really delete it prior to copying this

167
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,900
or you can actually copy this and then delete everything else

168
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,600
but it's gonna be easier before the copying itself happens.

169
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:14,300
Just make sure that there is nothing that will interfere, in any way or manner, with your web application.

170
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,900
However, you know what you're doing.

171
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,900
You can have other things lying around here, no problems.

172
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,900
Anyway, that would be it for this introductory video.

173
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:33,000
I will continue immediately, in the next tutorial, from exactly where we left off now.

174
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,400
However, until then, I bid you all farewell

175
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,300
and before I finish this tutorial

176
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,700
I would like to mention that I have been reviewing user requests

177
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,230
and there have been some people who have been asking for some additional tutorials

178
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,400
on some very specific subjects.

179
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,070
I will take them into consideration.

180
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,400
I'll see if I can do them.

181
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,500
If I can, time wise, I will.

182
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:02,380
However, please feel free to keep on posting your requests, demands, or whatever you wish.

183
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,200
If you have a specific wish

184
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,400
"Okay, I want to have a tutorial on how to do this particular thing within the realm of ethical hacking"

185
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,500
feel free to post it.

186
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,880
I mean, I can't promise that I'll do it

187
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,200
but I'll definitely read it

188
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,970
and there is a chance that I will, if I manage to get the time

189
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,800
or if I get enough requests, or something of a kind

190
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,300
but I will read it and I will consider it for sure, that much I guarantee it to you.

191
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,000
Anyway, I bid you farewell and I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
