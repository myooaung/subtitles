00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Hello and welcome to this tutorial

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:08,000
Today I will begin a chapter on wireless hacking.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,800
So first off, you need to know that there are different types of encryption.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,300
There is WEP

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:21,000
and whoever is still using WEP doesn't really deserved to have a wireless

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
primarily because it's practically as if you had a free password or an open wifi.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,260
It doesn't really matter.

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,700
It's quite easy to crack, no problems.

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,300
However, if you're using WPA or WPA2, that is another story.

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,200
That's quite difficult to crack, especially if the passwords are longer or something of a kind.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,100
There are different methods for direct wireless hacking

12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,800
and I really would not recommend it in all circumstances.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,400
There are some circumstances which are favorable to these sort of methods.

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:04,400
However, what is always better is to actually get an IP of the router

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,300
and then attack the router itself

16
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:15,000
because usually it has far more vulnerabilities than the WPA2 encryption that you are trying to crack.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,200
However, since we are cracking wireless, I'm just gonna go ahead and type in "ifconfig" here

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,300
and you will notice that I don't have a wireless interface here.

19
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,689
Why is that?

20
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:34,800
Well even though I have a network integrated card, a wireless one, within  my laptop

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,800
this is a virtual machine, and virtual machines do not support integrated network cards.

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,200
They can only go through your host machine

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,979
and in such a way

24
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:53,600
virtual machines are secure, so you can install all sorts of stuff on them

25
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,900
viruses, etc

26
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,200
and you'll still be safe.

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,700
They won't be infecting you and they won't be able to disrupt the normal functioning of your host machine.

28
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:10,000
However there are methods where you can get a USB wireless card and plug it in

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,200
and you can set up a pass through for your wireless machine

30
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,500
and in such a way, gain access to wireless.

31
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:22,220
However, password cracking from a virtual machine is not a good idea.

32
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,000
I mean it's a terrible idea, especially using VirtualBox

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Maybe if you are using send or something of a kind

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,950
where you have 90 - 95 native performance,  that would be great

35
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,900
but using VirtualBox for password cracking is a really bad idea, primarily because...

36
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,500
Let me just show you here --

37
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,200
If you go to devices

38
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,600
and I can click on network settings

39
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,600
and then I will get the menu for the other things.

40
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,900
So let's just go ahead and click on General

41
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,500
Systems...sorry

42
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,600
Look -- First of all, it has base memory.

43
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,500
This can be altered when the machine is off.

44
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,510
You cannot change the settings here, while the machine is turned on.

45
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:18,200
First of all, it says that I have two gigs of ram available for this particular virtual machine.

46
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,400
Now that's great for day-to-day operations

47
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,000
especially for Linux that requires 512 megabytes to run.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
However, you want to brute force a password

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,300
if you want to take that path

50
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:39,400
if you want to use a brute force method just by generating huge password lists and trying to guess it

51
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,500
this is not really a good amount of ram.

52
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,600
Actually, this is a terrible amount of RAM for such a task

53
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,300
and if we go ahead and click on the processor

54
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:55,700
you will see that execution cap is 100%, but we only have a single core assigned.

55
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,910
It says here one CPU core in the upper status bar

56
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,000
It says processors

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,500
It's gray at the moment, because you can't change the amount of processesors that are machines is using

58
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,300
while it's running.

59
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,100
So that makes no sense whatsoever.

60
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,000
You wouldn't be able to do that in the real world either.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,700
Maybe of some large servers or something like that

62
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,370
but even there, very doubtful that you can actually swap a processor.

63
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:28,000
That's mainly for swapping disks or adding RAM or something of a kind.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,300
In any case, it has only one CPU assigned to it.

65
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,700
I know it says here four, but I have an Intel i7 inside

66
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:44,800
and the VirtualBox supports only four CPU of cores for its machines

67
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:53,000
and you should take into consideration that you really won't need more than four for your virtual machines

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,500
especially if you're performing some testing tasks

69
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,400
or I don't know, even if you're programming

70
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,200
unless you're doing something specific that is strongly related to graphics

71
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,700
you won't be needing that many cores or anything of a kind.

72
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,000
One CPU is perfect.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,200
That's fine, you won't need anymore.

74
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:19,500
So anyway, I'm just gonna go ahead and click "Okay" here

75
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,900
and I just wanted to show you that, in order to demonstrate that the resources of your virtual machine

76
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:32,100
are simply not sufficient in order to support a brute force method

77
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,539
As I said, you can actually buy for about 20 bucks somewhere in the store

78
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:43,000
a USB network card, a wireless one.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,400
Plug it in, pass through the ports, and it's gonna work

80
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,690
but it's gonna be terribly slow.

81
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,000
What you need to do is either set up a dual-boot

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,800
or if you are running a Linux machine as your host machine,

83
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,500
you can do what I will do now.

84
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,000
Excellent

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,900
So because my main machine is Fedora Linux, I have installed all the necessary tools on it

86
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,200
pretty much you can install the same tools on Fedora as you can on Kali

87
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,700
and I will be doing my pen testing from here, from Fedora.

88
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,100
I will exit the virtual machine.

89
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,900
I will no longer use Kali for this purpose.

90
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,000
However, if you are a Windows user

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
if you don't have a native Linux system as your host machine

92
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,280
you will also be able to do this in Windows

93
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,600
I will show you the installation process alone

94
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,500
I will not show the actual method, but principles are the same

95
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,700
primarily because when you do it in Windows, you have to use the GUI mode

96
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:51,700
and quite frankly for these sort of things, I personally do not like to do them via GUI

97
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,260
it's far more effective to do it in from the terminal to some of

98
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,000
So some of the tools that we will need

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,400
I will just mentioned them here

100
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,000
and feel free to read up on them a little bit in the net, as you progress through the course

101
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and then go through the videos as well.

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,600
So there's a lot of extra information out there on the net

103
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,000
especially if you're facing some sort of bug or something of a kind.

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,100
Also, feel free to post it in the question section if something is not working.

105
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,300
I will be more than happy to try to fix it for you.

106
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:34,200
So just type in "yum search aircrack -ng"

107
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,160
Press ENTER

108
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,800
and it should find it shortly.

109
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,600
There we go

110
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,300
aircrack is in the default repositories of Fedora

111
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,760
and you'll be able to find it there without any sort of problems.

112
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,500
So it says "aircrack -ng . x86_64"

113
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,800
This is a standard for wireless

114
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:58,200
and it says "sniffer and WEP/WPA-PSK key cracker"

115
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,600
We're interested in this part -- "key cracker"

116
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,880
Basically, you can install it anywhere.

117
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,000
You can even install it in a virtual machine, capture the file in the host machine, transfer the file there

118
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
but there really is no point to do that.

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,900
Now we will install it and I will teach you how to use it.

120
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,400
There are lots more things related to aircrack

121
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:26,200
but there is one more tool that we will use that employs a completely different method

122
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,500
use a completely different way of tracking wireless passwords

123
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:36,200
and we'll mainly be talking about WPA and WPA2 password encryption methods.

124
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,800
I will do a brief demonstration of how to crack the WEP

125
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,000
but I mean, chances of you encountering WEP in today's world

126
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
are practically non-existent.

127
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,520
Just open up your cell phone...

128
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:03,100
I don't know if you're using Android or Apple phones or Windows phones

129
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,000
and whatever else is out there

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,600
just take a look at the wireless networks around you

131
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,500
and take a look at the encryption methods, because they will be shown to you

132
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,000
you will almost never see WEP

133
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,900
If you ever do see it, it's practically open wifi.

134
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,500
Because WEP has been cracked, it takes a very short amount of time to break it

135
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,000
without any sort of problems.

136
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,400
You don't need to use any sophisticated methods of any kind or sort.

137
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,800
A child could crack it without any problems.

138
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,000
Basically just follow through the procedure and that's it.

139
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,400
Now as I was saying, there was another method of doing this for EPA

140
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,000
and the tool name is "reaver"

141
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,800
Now, reaver is not in Fedora's default repository

142
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,000
so we will need to go through the installation process and find it on the net

143
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,900
but basically what reaver does is guesses the pins on your router.

144
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,600
So most routers these days have pin authentication

145
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:16,000
whereby you press a button and everybody around you can connect to that router, basically.

146
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
These things have been invented primarily for Windows users.

147
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,500
Very rarely will you find a Linux with support for pins

148
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,000
primarily because the method is highly insecure.

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,500
I mean, that is really one of the downsides of wireless.

150
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,200
If you're using pin authentication, you should definitely disable it on your home routers

151
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,200
as it enables malicious attackers to take your wifi, get your IP address

152
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,000
then from there, move on to more serious things.

153
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,600
I will show you how to disable these things as well

154
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,400
on one of my routers that I have here.

155
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,300
I think I have a dp link or something like that.

156
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,100
I will plug it in later on and show you what it does

157
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,000
but in any case, as a part of the aircrack package

158
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,300
you will get a few other programs, which we will use

159
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,490
and later on, there is one program in aircraft package

160
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,400
that enables you to perform a DoS attack  on wireless networks around you.

161
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:22,100
So you will be able to pretty much deauthenticate whoever you want, whenever you want

162
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,900
as long as two conditions are met --

163
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,100
The first condition is proximity, that you are close enough to the network

164
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,200
and the second condition is that you actually have to scan in monitor mode with your network card

165
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,500
and figure out what is going on around you.

166
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:46,100
What is the MAC address of that access point and what is the MAC address of the person you want to jam?

167
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,700
This is not that difficult to do.

168
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,839
This is easy

169
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,120
Both MAC addresses are public information.

170
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,200
Pretty much all you need to do is listen for them, and that is what monitor mode is.

171
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Basically, network cards have a lot of modes that they can operate in.

172
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,000
Well, maybe not a lot. I think it was six or something like that.

173
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,400
but there are only two which are of interest to us --

174
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:14,400
There is the promiscuous mode, where your network card will only process traffic

175
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,800
that is meant exclusively for it, regardless of

176
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,500
I don't know, capturing some of their traffic that is being transmitted wirelessly through the air.

177
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,500
I mean, just think about it --

178
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,100
You have so many wireless access points around you and they are all communicating with devices

179
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:35,200
and it's not like that wireless access point can send a signal in a specific direction to your device.

180
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,000
No, it sends it in a ciracle fashion and your device catches it.

181
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
A lot of other devices catch it, but sine the information is encrypted

182
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and since the information is not for them, they immediately figure out it's not for them

183
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,800
namely your network cards figure it out, and they immediately disregard the information.

184
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,000
They don't do anything with it.

185
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,200
However, if you put your network cards into monitor mode

186
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,329
they will actually take all of this traffic, process it, and see what they can get from it.

187
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:02,500
Some of it is encrypted

188
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,600
Most of it is encrypted

189
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,400
but some of it isn't

190
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,900
like the MAC addresses, which can be encrypted

191
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,900
and that's the bright side of it all.

192
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,529
You can take it and you can jam whoever you want.

193
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:22,800
You can deny wireless access to pretty much everybody within range, with just having your laptop

194
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,870
and no extra devices are needed.

195
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,400
This is all pure software.

196
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,000
You don't need any extra devices.

197
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,600
Of course, it is necessary that your network card supports monitor mode.

198
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,940
There is a compatibility list on the net.

199
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,400
I will show it to you in the follow-up tutorial

200
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,300
but for the time being, I just wanted to introduce you to the chapter

201
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,800
and to see what we shall be doing.

202
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,700
Now I would advise

203
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,900
you don't have to, of course

204
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,000
and you will be able to fully follow through the next tutorial without doing this

205
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,900
but I would just advise typing aircrack -ng on Google, or whatever your favorite search engine is

206
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,900
and type in "reaver"

207
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:09,500
Just read the first couple of sentences of the first post that comes by

208
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:15,000
and see if you can collect some information there.

209
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Then you can continue on watching the next video

210
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,800
where I will show you how to install these things.

211
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,900
I will show you how to install aircrack -ng on Windows, and I will attempt reaver as well

212
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,500
but sometimes reaver tends to break on Windows, and that can be problematic

213
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,300
but primarily, I will show you how to install aircrack -ng

214
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,400
I will show you how to use it there in a bit.

215
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,300
It's not that hard.

216
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,000
There's a graphical interface, practically.

217
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,500
You can just click through it, no problems.

218
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:50,000
However, I restate once again that you should have a Linux host machine

219
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,610
which you can use, to which you have access

220
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:58,400
primarily because a lot of these tools are a lot faster on Linux machines.

221
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,800
They work much better, they are faster

222
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,300
and quite frankly, they are easier to install.

223
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,500
Plus, you get a higher degree of anonymity.

224
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,000
Anyway, I bid you all farewell and I'll see you in follow-up tutorial.
