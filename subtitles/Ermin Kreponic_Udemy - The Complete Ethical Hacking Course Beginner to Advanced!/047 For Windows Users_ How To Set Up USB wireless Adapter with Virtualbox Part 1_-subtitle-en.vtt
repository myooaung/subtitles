00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.000

Welcome everybody to this tutorial



2

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.500

This is an addition to the wireless part of the course.



3

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.000

Anyway, I have noticed in the discussions



4

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.200

that a lot of people were struggling



5

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.500

Windows users were struggling with their virtualize environments



6

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.100

and they were unable to access their wireless card.



7

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.300

I have mentioned this in my original course



8

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.010

that you won't be able to access your physical hardware



9

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.000

your integrated wireless network card from your VirtualBox



10

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000

You will need to either create a bootable Linux CD in order to access it



11

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.870

or by a USB wireless device.



12

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.500

Now to create a bootable CD



13

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.400

it's fairly simple.



14

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.000

Just basically burn a CD with an ISO image and boot from it



15

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.800

but getting the USB wireless adapter



16

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.600

setting it up with VirtualBox can be a little tricky



17

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.300

and I have noticed that a lot of people out there have had problems with that.



18

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.090

They were unable to do it.



19

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.380

That is why I have made this tutorial in as an addition to the course.



20

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.640

Free addition to the course



21

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.000

in order to help you guys out



22

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.200

or ladies, if there are any.



23

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.610

I haven't noticed in the discussions, but my apologies if I have missed.



24

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.000

Anyway today, you just need go and open up your browser



25

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.760

This is the USB wireless device that I have purchased



26

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.000

It's 2000 megawatts USB alpha wireless adapter.



27

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.200

This is what you should type into your search engine



28

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.500

So, alpha USB 2000 megawatt network adapter



29

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.000

Fairly simple as that. No problems there.



30

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.200

You'll be prompted with a ton load of results.



31

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200

You can purchase it from pretty much anywhere.



32

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.100

I personally got it from ebay



33

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.000

because it had some favorable shipping options.



34

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.200

Again, you can get it from anywhere.



35

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.600

the prices are pretty much the same.



36

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.160

Have a look at different sites.



37

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.500

See if you can get it a bit cheaper, or something of a kind.



38

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.200

It's about $28 pretty much where you look



39

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.680

but feel free to have a look around.



40

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.000

Anyway, depending on which version of VirtualBox have you installed



41

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.900

you can actually download the extension pack here.



42

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.220

So there's like 1 2 3



43

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.100

but chances are that if you have installed VirtualBox on Windows



44

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.000

that you already have an extension pack.



45

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.400

Linux users have to additionally install the extension pack



46

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.400

because it's not open source



47

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.000

but, I mean



48

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.400

You, as a Windows user, most likely have it installed already.



49

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.000

If not, just go ahead and click here.



50

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.600

You'll be prompted with this one download



51

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.500

and it says "open with"



52

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.200

Press "OK"



53

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.500

By the time the download is done



54

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.000

Just go ahead and click on it.



55

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.870

Basically just follow through the wizard.



56

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.000

Keep clicking the "Next" button quite literally.



57

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.800

This is not my machine, by the way



58

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.000

I went by my friend's machine, who was running Windows  7



59

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.950

so I could actually do this tutorial on a

physical Windows machine



60

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.600

but as I said, I'm not going to install it now



61

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.500

because I already have it installed.



62

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.090

I have installed it through the installation of VirtualBox



63

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.900

and as I said, if you have installed

VirtualBox on Windows



64

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.840

on any Windows



65

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.000

you most most likely have the extension pack installed along with it.



66

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.900

If you don't, just click here and keep clicking on "Next"



67

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.900

That's all that you need to do quite literally.



68

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.300

There is nothing special or amazing



69

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.900

or anything of a kind.



70

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.000

The next button is your friend there.



71

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.100

Anyway, let's just go ahead and minimize this



72

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.300

Go ahead and unpack your USB wireless adapter.



73

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.270

Take out the CD that came with it



74

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.400

insert it into your machine and open it

up.



75

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.390

So let's just go ahead and do that.



76

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.900

This is the CD that I have inserted into my CD-ROM.



77

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.000

Let's just go ahead and open it.



78

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.200

Excellent



79

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.000

So now you get prompted here for a bunch of questions.



80

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.200

You can make a mistake here



81

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.200

but oh well, no big deal.



82

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.570

First of all, if you have bought the same devices I have



83

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.120

You will click on "Indoor USB wireless"



84

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.200

You will select "Adapter series"



85

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.130

You will select the middle one



86

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.000

You can read this from the bottom of your wireless USB adapter.



87

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.630

Click here



88

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.500

and the version as well, so same place.



89

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.500

Just take your wireless USB adapter



90

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.800

look at the bottom at the label



91

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.100

and there you will be able to find all this information.



92

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.000

Anyway, this is the version that I am using



93

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.580

so I'm just gonna go ahead and click on it.



94

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.900

If you're using the same as me, just go ahead and click on it.



95

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.200

If not -- if you bought a slightly different version



96

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.100

just read from the bottom, that's it



97

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.600

that's it



98

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.790

and this one, the CD actually comes

packaged with Mac drivers



99

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.500

Windows drivers and Linux drivers, which is fantastic.



100

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.000

So all you Mac users, you can pretty much just insert a CD



101

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.300

and get the proper drivers for this wireless card.



102

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.600

For this wireless USB adapter



103

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.300

Linux users if you have bought this for an extended range



104

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.000

or something of a kind



105

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.100

no need for you to actually install anything



106

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.800

as it already comes prepackaged with the drivers



107

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.980

as does the Linux terminal already has the necessary



108

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.760

to facilitate proper functioning of this device.



109

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.400

Anyway, I'm gonna go ahead and click on Windows drivers.



110

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.400

Now it offers Windows XP, 7, and 8.



111

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.250

There's no Vista, but for Vista if you are using it by any chance



112

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.300

try the XP or Windows 7.



113

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.350

One of those two is bound to work.



114

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.000

I'm on Windows 7, so I'm just gonna go ahead and select Windows 7.



115

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000

If you're on Windows 8, just select Windows 8.



116

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.520

Nothing too complex there.



117

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.800

Okay, so the installation process is starting.



118

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.000

Basically again, just click



119

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000

The "Next" button is your best friend.



120

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.500

There's nothing fundamentally different or new that you need to do.



121

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.000

Just keep on clicking "Next" and installation process will finish.



122

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000

Amazing. I know right?



123

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.690

Nothing too complicated there.



124

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.930

Just sit back, relax and let it finish its own thing



125

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.300

and you should be fine.



126

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.600

Now upon installation, we will be required to reboot our computer



127

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.110

in order for changes to take effect.



128

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.000

So I'm gonna pause the tutorial there.



129

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.100

Anyway, it says Windows can't verify the publisher of the software.



130

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.000

Oh well



131

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.700

That's one of the things you have to live with.



132

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.500

It's a CD that I've gotten from them



133

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.000

so I'm guessing there's nothing unsafe on it.



134

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.200

Just go ahead and say "Install this driver software anyway"



135

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.340

This is definitely not something that you should do



136

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.200

If you have downloaded from the internet



137

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.300

or something of a kind



138

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.000

but I have gotten the CD from the company



139

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.720

from the order, so it should be fine.



140

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.700

Anyway, the installation process is ongoing



141

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.000

I don't know, prompting you



142

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.900

if you can hear this clicking sound from time to time



143

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.500

that's basically Windows figuring out what the device is



144

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.200

as the drivers are being installed.



145

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.040

Anyway, I truly hope that this does help you out a great deal



146

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.600

and hope you all follow through the

wireless part to the course



147

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.700

without any problems



148

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.800

without making a bootable CD or any such changes



149

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.360

for all the Windows users out there.



150

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.000

If you're a Mac user, you can also do pretty much the same as well.



151

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.100

If you need help figuring how to do it on Mac



152

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.000

please let me know in the discussion section.



153

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.500

Here I'm just gonna say that I do want to restart my computer now



154

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.800

So I'm going to pause the tutorial here



155

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.600

and I will continue when I return.



156

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.000

In any case, I bid you all farewell.
