1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,250
Welcome back everybody. Let's go ahead and
go through this installation process and see

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:13,210
how this actually works. So I cannot I can't
actually increase the screen size here. Hopefully

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:19,460
you can see everything. I can see from quite
some distance away, so hopefully you can as

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:25,359
well. I'll just go ahead and begin the installation
process. First of all, we have an option for

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,789
Kali live. We don't care about the live at
the moment. I've shown you how to use the

6
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:37,070
live before. We're just going to select the
install. Press enter and it will go through.

7
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,690
Okay, the mouse pointer integration and all
that is not functional at the moment. The

8
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:49,800
release key is right control as you can see.
I'm in in the text mode only now, so I can't

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,559
really choose that. But once installation
is complete, the release key for the mouse

10
00:00:53,559 --> 00:01:01,359
will be the right control. Okay, so select
your language here. I'll go ahead and select

11
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:08,300
English and select UK. Select appropriately
for yourselves whatever you wish. These are

12
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:15,280
only my preferences, you can select any that
are offered here. Feel free to do so. Okay,

13
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,800
so the installation process is going through.
It shouldn't take too long. Well, this is

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,200
not the installation process. This is loading
all the other things. Installation will begin

15
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:37,590
shortly, once we have configured all the parameters.
Okay, it's going through. Come on. Network

16
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:48,840
successful, hostname. Which will be to hostname,
I don't know. My Fedora is called cup of tea.

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:59,070
Let's call this one cup of coffee. You can
change this later if you wish. domain name--

18
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,180
I don't really care about this, just go through
it. Root password: Now, please. I've noticed

19
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:09,110
a lot of people forget their root passwords
when they type them in here. Type in the root

20
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,170
password. I'm just going ahead and typing
in "test" because this is a virtual machine,

21
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:19,140
and I'm just doing the installation for testing
purposes. I just typed in test, but you can

22
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:26,490
type in whatever you want. Please be sure
to remember this. Press continue again. Retype

23
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:32,920
your password to confirm it. It doesn't give
me any warnings, even though the password

24
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,390
is way too short. We can of course change
this later, but for the time being, please

25
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:42,040
be sure to remember. So, guided use entire
disk select for this. There is only one that

26
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,950
we have assigned to this virtual machine.
All files in one partition, recommended for

27
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,280
new users. Sure, why not. Finish partitioning
and write changes to disk. Write changes to

28
00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:01,500
disk, yes. There we go. So, no big deal. Now,
the installation has commenced. This is going

29
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:10,390
to take a while. It may ask a few questions
along the way. No big deal. Usually there

30
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,790
will be a default option which you can select
and that's going to be good enough. If there

31
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:22,000
is anything of significance, I will take some
screenshots and inform you of the changes

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,630
that I have chosen. For the time being I'm
going to pause the tutorial here. I'm not

33
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,830
going to make another one. I'm just going
to pause here. I'll continue within this one

34
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:41,060
when the installation is complete. That way
you don't have to sit here for like 10-15

35
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,990
minutes or more waiting for this thing to
complete. Okay, so installation is going.

36
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:53,680
This is the first question that I was asked:
use a network mirror? Yes. HTPP proxy information--

37
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,540
I don't really need it. I'm not going through
a proxy server. Just just select continue.

38
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:08,209
It's scanning the mirror. It is just gonna
go forward and retrieve some files, etc. Anyway,

39
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:17,269
we're going pause until the next problem.
Okay, so the next the next question is: the

40
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:24,509
grub boot loader a hard disk. Sure, why not.
Just go ahead and install it. Then, select

41
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:29,620
select this device. This is the only one that
you have on the VirtualBox so it's fine. Go

42
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:39,289
ahead and select it. Now the procedure will
just continue. Okay, so it was just a question

43
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:44,090
to actually go ahead and reboot the machine
and finish of the installation. All you need

44
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:54,759
to do is click on continue. Okay, so now we
are prompted here with this screen after the

45
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:02,639
reboot. Just go ahead and type in root, enter.
Now, type in the password. Enter. There you

46
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:13,509
go. The machine will boot. It might take a
bit of time. It is first the first boot, so

47
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:22,839
be considerate and kind. That will be it.
That is the Kali VirtualBox machine. Next

48
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:28,650
up, the what we shall do is install guest
additions in order to make it functional.

49
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:35,689
Anyway, we are going to do that in the next
tutorial, as a separate part. Until then,

50
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:37,539
I bid you all farewell.
