00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,580
Hello everybody, and
welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,400
Today I am going to show you,

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,590
or today I'm going to just continue the
demonstration that I started previously.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,700
I'm going to show you how you can extract
credentials from this particular router.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,310
Now, the same procedure applies elsewhere,
but

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,540
you need to grab that model number,
either by doing extensive nmap scanning,

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:28,230
or by just using a far simpler method,
trying to authenticate.

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,770
Well, actually we don't need
to type any credentials,

9
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,100
you can just go to the website.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,102
Go to the login website, and
see if any information is revealed there.

11
00:00:38,102 --> 00:00:44,231
Apparently, for most of the home routers
you're going to get a model number there,

12
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:48,476
or at the very least,
you will get the manufacturer name.

13
00:00:48,476 --> 00:00:54,237
Anyway, I've attempted to download
rom-0 file from my browser.

14
00:00:54,237 --> 00:00:57,016
But now I am going to use wget.

15
00:00:57,016 --> 00:01:01,317
And wget is a piece of software that
should be installed by default.

16
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:04,137
But just in case it is not,
type in yum search wget.

17
00:01:04,137 --> 00:01:08,277
Press Enter.

18
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,397
And there you go, the last one is wget.

19
00:01:11,397 --> 00:01:16,020
Just type in yum install wget,
and it will be installed.

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,641
Clear the screen.

21
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:27,137
So, wget http://192.168.1.1.

22
00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:32,085
Keep in mind I'm using the local address
here, but you can use a public IP address.

23
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:36,535
So this router, for all intents and
purposes, could be in Japan,

24
00:01:36,535 --> 00:01:39,407
on the other side of
the globe from myself.

25
00:01:39,407 --> 00:01:43,727
It would not matter,
this attack would still go and fly.

26
00:01:43,727 --> 00:01:50,687
/rom-0, that's O, -0.

27
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:51,827
Press Enter.

28
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:54,367
And there we, oh,
it has saved it from the rom-0.2.

29
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:57,787
So I have already downloaded it twice.

30
00:01:57,787 --> 00:02:02,127
I guess this is the second time around
that I'm attempting to make this tutorial.

31
00:02:02,127 --> 00:02:05,167
For some strange reason either
the connection crashes, or

32
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,330
I have some problems.

33
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,170
But in any case, let's just go ahead and
proceed with this.

34
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,330
Well, let me just clear the screen.

35
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,360
And now we need something
to read that rom.

36
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,720
Let me just show you how that looks like.

37
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,380
I'm gonna use the original
one that I've downloaded.

38
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,898
I don't know why, it just feels right.

39
00:02:24,898 --> 00:02:30,953
Because I'm downloading it already for
the second time.

40
00:02:30,953 --> 00:02:31,535
Anyway, with is how
a binary file looks like.

41
00:02:31,535 --> 00:02:36,100
You can't really read through this,
you might get here and there,

42
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,874
pieces of readable code.

43
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:39,813
There you go, at the bottom.

44
00:02:39,813 --> 00:02:44,040
At the bottom,
you have a little bit that's readable.

45
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,520
But none of this information is
actually of any particular use to you.

46
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,360
Just go ahead and press quit to quit it.

47
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,140
And we need something to
actually interpret this.

48
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,630
In order for us to interpret this,

49
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,430
I have a bunch of websites here that
I have opened for this purpose.

50
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,822
And you can see here, you have ZTE,

51
00:03:05,822 --> 00:03:08,090
TP-Link, ZynOS,
Huawei rom-0 Configuration Decompressor.

52
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:15,132
So this will make the file
readable in short.

53
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:19,771
You can just go ahead and
copy this script into a file.

54
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:21,832
And now I want you to do this on your own.

55
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:26,750
If you fail to do it, feel free to
post it in the question section.

56
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,678
I will be more than happy
to explain it to you how.

57
00:03:28,678 --> 00:03:30,357
Here's a bit of a hint.

58
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:32,043
You need to just copy this
text into a text file.

59
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:37,300
That text file must have
an extension of .py.

60
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,400
And you must make it executable.

61
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,261
So chmod +x, and
the name of the file then follows.

62
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:48,881
This is the format of the file, so ls.

63
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:52,983
This is how your file should look like.

64
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:57,881
It should have a .py and
it should have a +x.

65
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:02,549
So type in chmod +x and

66
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:07,222
then name of the file.

67
00:04:07,222 --> 00:04:11,801
Just let's clear the screen.

68
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:18,650
ZteRomReader.py rom-0.

69
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,190
Press Enter, and there we go.

70
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,587
It actually just reads right through it,
and

71
00:04:24,587 --> 00:04:31,200
it converts it to a human-readable form,
you can put it so.

72
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,340
But it doesn't actually bother
to go through the whole file,

73
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,380
to give us the contents of the whole file.

74
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,150
Its main concern is with the password for
the router.

75
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,680
So there you have it here.

76
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,880
Usually these things are the password.

77
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,040
And there you go, here, and
then you have the password alone.

78
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,581
So router password is 263297.

79
00:04:54,581 --> 00:05:03,160
You can use this password that is obtained
in such a manner to log in to the router.

80
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,560
Now, there comes a problem
with this method.

81
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,420
If anybody has messed
around with the router.

82
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,740
Well, actually, on some of these routers,

83
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,440
I've noticed that you can't
actually change the user name.

84
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,880
Which is very interesting.

85
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,070
And that the default user name is admin.

86
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,610
So you can just use
admin as a log in name.

87
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,730
Maybe, maybe sometimes I've seen
that they use a login name root.

88
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,820
But you can also go on the net and

89
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,900
type in default login names for
that particular brand of the router.

90
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,440
And you can try a couple of them.

91
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:44,350
Usually, there's like maximum of four or
five, something like that.

92
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,350
You're not going to get
100 different variants.

93
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,250
Just try a few of them, see how it works.

94
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,980
But this is the password, for sure.

95
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,460
You will be able to log
into the router with it.

96
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,730
All that remains is finding the user name.

97
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,450
But 99% of the time,
the username will be admin.

98
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,110
So no worries there.

99
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,270
Although some of the routers,
they give very unique user names.

100
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,110
But they are public.

101
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,475
So just go on the net,
type in the router model.

102
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:20,170
And apply that particular user name.

103
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,320
Now, before you actually try to
do something crazy like this,

104
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,370
try the default login credentials.

105
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:28,930
Type in admin, admin.

106
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,719
And if admin, admin doesn't work,
take the model number,

107
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:37,711
type it into your favorite search engine,
and type in, default credentials.

108
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:44,770
Because default credentials can
vary from router to router.

109
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,110
And if the router is in
a different country,

110
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,690
see the IP address of the router,
see to who it belongs.

111
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,970
Let me just show you how you can do that.

112
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:00,191
Major IP blocks.

113
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:03,567
I believe I've showed
you this website before.

114
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:06,120
Come on, there we go.

115
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,640
So it says here,
it gives the IP addresses.

116
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,310
It gives the IP address ranges, and

117
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,970
then the owner should be
written in the far right.

118
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,740
But apparently I don't have it.

119
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,900
Come on.
Look at how many IP address are for

120
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,920
US alone.

121
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,320
That's like a lot.

122
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,494
And it doesn't list the owners for
the US, strangely.

123
00:07:30,494 --> 00:07:31,870
But it doesn't matter.

124
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:37,711
Look, I can just take this address,
copy it, oops, come on.

125
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:39,213
Why are you doing this to me?

126
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:40,331
Why, why, why?

127
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:41,911
I do not care for the Google Store.

128
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:45,013
I gotta delete this somehow so
I don't click on it.

129
00:07:45,013 --> 00:07:47,771
Who is.

130
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:57,270
And so it doesn't, you'll get
the owner of the IP address here.

131
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:02,700
Once you get the owner of the IP
address here, if it's a telecom,

132
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,920
and if it's a router then
it's definitely a telecom.

133
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,590
If it's a home router, then what I want
to say then it's definitely a telecom.

134
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,880
Once you actually figure
out which telecom it is.

135
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,320
You can go ahead and type on the net
configuration manuals of that

136
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,973
particular telecom for
that particular router.

137
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:26,882
Because usually telecoms
keep such files public.

138
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,950
And you can read the default username and

139
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:34,465
default password there which
are unique to that particular telecom.

140
00:08:34,465 --> 00:08:36,920
Cuz they can vary from
one place to another.

141
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:42,710
This is primarily to prevent people
from just mass scanning the Internet.

142
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,430
Well, one of the reasons, anyway.

143
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,130
To prevent people from mass
scanning the Internet, and

144
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,280
then just trying the credentials admin,
admin.

145
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,540
They still have default credentials,
they're just not admin, admin.

146
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,840
So a lot of the scripts will actually
fail to authenticate against them.

147
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,270
But if you just bother
to look a bit further,

148
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,356
you will realize that
the credentials are still public.

149
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:08,290
They can be changed by the users,
of course, but users rarely do this,

150
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,140
and I mean rarely.

151
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,260
Anyway, I'm going to
