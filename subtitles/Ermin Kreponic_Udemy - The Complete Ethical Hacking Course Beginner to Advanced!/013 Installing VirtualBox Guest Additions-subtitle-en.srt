1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,365
Hello everbody and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,093
Today I will continue from
where I left off in the previous one.

3
00:00:07,428 --> 00:00:10,837
If you remember, we issued "apt-get update"

4
00:00:10,872 --> 00:00:13,233
and "apt-get upgrade" commands.

5
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:16,252
That took a while to finish in process.

6
00:00:16,487 --> 00:00:19,645
I was prompted once, I was given a "Read me" file

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,483
in regards to Wget program, Wget paquet.

8
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:28,347
The way you handle it is you press Q to exit,

9
00:00:28,382 --> 00:00:31,200
you do not close the
terminal and terminate the updates.

10
00:00:31,235 --> 00:00:34,120
Rather instead you press
Q to exit the "Read me" file

11
00:00:34,355 --> 00:00:38,070
and the update process will continue, no problems.

12
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:43,430
So today we need to configure the sources list.

13
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:47,807
That is the list of repositories
from which your Linux distro

14
00:00:47,942 --> 00:00:51,398
actually pulls various
paquets and information from.

15
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:56,145
Just like Fedora, Kali Linux also has repositories.

16
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,639
And if you go onto their website

17
00:00:57,674 --> 00:01:00,414
see, the link is here, I have marked it.

18
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,856
You have these four repositories

19
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:06,614
that are the default repositories of Kali Linux.

20
00:01:06,749 --> 00:01:08,866
You can go ahead and copy paste them.

21
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:11,196
Not a bad idea to do this.

22
00:01:12,927 --> 00:01:15,563
I don't know why, but I don't find them by default

23
00:01:15,598 --> 00:01:18,273
in the repository list, in the sources list,

24
00:01:18,308 --> 00:01:20,144
so I've got to do it manually.

25
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:28,317
You go ahead and basically type in "cd /etc/apt".

26
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:35,459
"Ls" and there we go. You have "sources.list".

27
00:01:35,494 --> 00:01:39,518
You go ahead and type "nano sources.list".

28
00:01:39,753 --> 00:01:44,534
Press Enter and there
you are now in the repository file.

29
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:49,259
This is where they are listed,
where you can type them in.

30
00:01:49,294 --> 00:01:51,704
So let's go ahead and copy these two.

31
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:54,810
I'm not gonna worry about
duplicates right now or anything of a kind.

32
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:58,492
Duplicate repositories are not
gonna break anything, so no worries.

33
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:02,316
The system is smart
enough to realise that for itself.

34
00:02:02,351 --> 00:02:05,558
So I'm just going to go
ahead and copy the four of these.

35
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:07,671
Later on, if we want, we can sort this out

36
00:02:07,706 --> 00:02:09,647
and remove duplicates or something of a kind.

37
00:02:09,682 --> 00:02:13,178
But for the time being,
it doesn't matter, it's not gonna break anything,

38
00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:18,525
just copy all four of them,
press Control+O, Enter, Control+X to exit

39
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:23,919
and there we go.
So once again, Control+O to save a file,

40
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:28,484
so press Control+O,
Enter and then Control+X to exit.

41
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,507
Excellent. Now that we've got that sorted out

42
00:02:31,742 --> 00:02:37,515
we clear the screen and even though
we have placed our repositories there

43
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,810
it doesn't matter, the system
won't be able to pick anything up from them

44
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:44,640
until we actually perform the following.

45
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:49,593
So we need to do "apt-get update".

46
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:54,456
We're not upgrading the system,
we're just updating the repository list.

47
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:59,949
This should go through pretty fast and in the end

48
00:02:59,984 --> 00:03:03,276
it is most likely going to report duplicates

49
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:05,838
but that is fine, that is ok, no problems there.

50
00:03:05,873 --> 00:03:08,670
If you're wondering why are we doing this, well

51
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:11,196
we do need these repositories in order to install

52
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:14,257
the necessary headers for Kali Linux kernel,

53
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:18,344
which we will need in order to
install VirtualBox Guest Additions

54
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:20,955
to get full screen functionality.

55
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:25,598
Because if we continue to work
like this, in the smaller screen

56
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:28,176
it wouldn't be good, trust me.

57
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,030
Primarily because we're
gonna be doing a lot of things,

58
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:33,677
we're gonna need a lot of windows that are open

59
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:35,901
and that can present problems, so there you go.

60
00:03:35,936 --> 00:03:39,338
It's not an error. It's a W, so it's a warning.

61
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:41,648
It says "duplicate sources list".

62
00:03:43,606 --> 00:03:48,656
No big deal there, we can correct
these problems later on if we wish

63
00:03:48,691 --> 00:03:51,100
but for the time being, there is no need.

64
00:03:51,135 --> 00:03:54,083
Let me just go ahead and clear the screen.

65
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,331
Now what I want to do is install
two more packages which will allow me

66
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:06,231
to actually install and run
VirtualBox Guest Additions.

67
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:10,427
So I have a prebuild command
here for you that I'm going to run.

68
00:04:10,662 --> 00:04:15,237
It goes like this, basically. You have apt-get,

69
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:18,877
you're calling the packet manager,
you're telling it to do an update

70
00:04:18,912 --> 00:04:21,334
but since we already did a few updates,

71
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:23,783
I don't actually need that portion of the command.

72
00:04:23,818 --> 00:04:29,100
I'm just gonna go ahead
and use "apt-get install -y"

73
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:33,951
then I have "dkms", that's one
package, and then I have another package,

74
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:36,468
because you can specify
a lot of packets here, as many as you like.

75
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:42,747
And then I have
"linux headers-" and what this here is,

76
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:47,468
this is a variable, this dollar sign.
It's some sort of variable, a string

77
00:04:50,277 --> 00:04:54,883
and whatever this command "uname -r" outputs,

78
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:57,529
it will be stored into this variable

79
00:04:57,564 --> 00:05:01,840
and it will be added to this text line here.

80
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:07,121
So let me show you, I have
"uname -r" that I ran here on my terminal

81
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:09,756
and what I got was the kernel version

82
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:14,039
and the system architecture, 64 or 32 bits.

83
00:05:14,174 --> 00:05:16,835
I'm just gonna go ahead and press Enter.

84
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:21,113
There is nothing to do,
as I have previously installed them,

85
00:05:21,148 --> 00:05:24,357
I didn't want to waste time during the tutorial,

86
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:28,507
but this command is gonna fly without any problems

87
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:31,615
specially because you have "-y" argument.

88
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,331
You're basically saying to your packet manager

89
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:38,934
if you have any questions for me,
just answer them all with yes.

90
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:43,593
So that went just fine, the install process.

91
00:05:43,828 --> 00:05:48,539
I'm just gonna go ahead and run "apt-get upgrade".

92
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:52,862
You wanna make sure that
this happens after the installation.

93
00:05:52,897 --> 00:05:56,031
I already did it, but
I'm just doing a bit of a show here.

94
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:59,087
It says that two of them are not upgraded,

95
00:05:59,122 --> 00:06:01,907
metasploit and metasploit-framework,

96
00:06:01,942 --> 00:06:04,566
but it says that the packages have been kept back,

97
00:06:04,601 --> 00:06:07,100
so this is being done for a valid reason.

98
00:06:07,135 --> 00:06:10,226
We will get into that
a bit later on, but for the time being

99
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:11,958
let me just go ahead and clear the screen,

100
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:14,017
one of the first things you need to do now is

101
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:19,649
go ahead and click on Devices,
Insert Guest Additions CD image.

102
00:06:21,217 --> 00:06:23,003
There we go, it popped.

103
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:25,906
This is a warning that Kali Linux issues

104
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:29,553
and many other Linux type operating systems issue.

105
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:34,895
If you have content that is
on a CD or a USB or something like that

106
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,482
and if it's configured to run
automatically, the system will block it

107
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:40,828
and then it will ask you for a permission,

108
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:45,512
so "the medium contains software
intended to be automatically started."

109
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:46,518
"Would you like to run it?"

110
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:50,194
I'm gonna go ahead and
click Run and most likely get an error.

111
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:55,859
There we go. "Error autorunning
software. Cannot find autorun program".

112
00:06:56,572 --> 00:07:02,123
Now the error message,
it doesn't really tell us much in this case.

113
00:07:02,158 --> 00:07:05,545
I guess we can take a look at
the log files and so on and so forth,

114
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,342
but here is the solution which you can apply

115
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:11,575
as this is a common problem
that people encounter all the time

116
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,307
and so there are standardized solutions

117
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:17,125
and patches to this sort of problems.

118
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,498
I'll just go ahead and type in the terminal "cd"

119
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:24,270
to change the working directory, and navigate over

120
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:26,984
to where the VirtualBox Guest Additions CD is,

121
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:30,412
which is, you can use the same path that I'm using,

122
00:07:30,447 --> 00:07:38,305
so "/media/" and then "ls", "cd" again, "cdrom0"

123
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,988
Excellent. So we are now
here and look, I have a listing

124
00:07:43,023 --> 00:07:48,558
of pretty much all the
contents of the CD, basically.

125
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:54,139
This is a virtual CD, it's not
a real one, but it works just the same.

126
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:59,020
So this is the file that I want,
I want to move it from here

127
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:01,762
so I'm just gonna go ahead and use command "cp".

128
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:03,968
You can also use "move" command,

129
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:06,121
but you're permanently going to remove it from here

130
00:08:06,156 --> 00:08:07,959
and that is not what we want to do.

131
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:11,356
So just type in "cp" for copy.

132
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:15,373
Type the name of whatever
you wish to copy. Very simple.

133
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:19,602
And then specify the path
to where you want the file to be copied.

134
00:08:19,637 --> 00:08:22,382
I want it to be copied in my Home directory.

135
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:24,494
Press Enter, and there we go.

136
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:26,562
Now navigate over to your Home directory.

137
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,460
Get a listing. Excellent. It is there.

138
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:33,627
The way to run any script in Linux,

139
00:08:33,662 --> 00:08:38,070
any executable file in general,
not just a script, is just to press

140
00:08:38,842 --> 00:08:43,402
"./" and then the name of that file,
press Enter, there we go. It's running.

141
00:08:44,402 --> 00:08:47,556
The Guest Additions are being installed.

142
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:51,469
I have attempted this process before

143
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:54,553
to make sure that everything would run smoothly,

144
00:08:54,588 --> 00:08:57,452
and that's why it says "removing existing things".

145
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,372
Anyway, it might take a while for it to finish,

146
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,857
but I assure you it will.
There is a lot of things to do,

147
00:09:06,892 --> 00:09:11,694
and that is why it's taking a bit more of your time.

148
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:14,590
Aside from the full screen functionality

149
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,693
that we're gonna get by
installing VirtualBox Guest Additions,

150
00:09:17,828 --> 00:09:20,588
just in case you think
it's a bit of a pointless effort

151
00:09:20,623 --> 00:09:23,874
if you are a student, because I as a teacher,

152
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:26,421
I have to have the
full screen so you can see everything,

153
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:32,261
you also have under Devices
Drag'n'Drop and Shared Clipboard.

154
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:37,674
Drag'n'Drop, the name itself is self-explanatory,

155
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:39,445
you just pull a file from somewhere

156
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,199
and then pull it onto your
virtual machine or vice-versa.

157
00:09:42,234 --> 00:09:44,748
But I don't like to enable Drag'n'Drop.

158
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:50,265
What I do like to do is
enable Shared Clipboard host to guest.

159
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,830
Now here is why.
I use my browser on my host machine

160
00:09:54,865 --> 00:09:58,145
primarily because you tend to watch a video or two

161
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,898
somewhere about something
and you don't really want to bother

162
00:10:03,116 --> 00:10:06,997
about installing Flash
on Kali Linux. It can be problematic.

163
00:10:08,122 --> 00:10:12,201
So host to guest copy-pasting

164
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,706
is very useful and you will need it. I assure you.

165
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,902
There is a way, there is a Shared Folder Settings

166
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:21,201
you can either construct the shared folder

167
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:23,735
or you can have a localized web server

168
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,724
on both machines
where you can pull the information from

169
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,699
and put the information
there if configured properly,

170
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:34,262
but shared folders are better for such purposes.

171
00:10:34,297 --> 00:10:39,808
Anyway, you can review
what has happened here. It has been listed here.

172
00:10:39,843 --> 00:10:42,360
The most important part of it all is

173
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:46,246
that you don't have
any reports of anything failing.

174
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:50,008
So let's just go ahead
and go over it. All good here.

175
00:10:51,393 --> 00:10:52,933
No failures here,

176
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:55,553
"copying additional installer modules",

177
00:10:56,499 --> 00:11:00,063
installing them. Done. Done. Done. Excellent.

178
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:02,813
"Installing the Window
System drivers", very important.

179
00:11:04,222 --> 00:11:08,460
Done. Done. "Or just restart
the system". The Windows system.

180
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:12,894
Let me just go ahead and
attempt to restart the graphics,

181
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:15,304
so "init", run level 3. No.

182
00:11:15,405 --> 00:11:19,811
"init" run level 5, will this work? No.

183
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:22,080
Apparently it works on Fedora,

184
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:25,304
but perhaps the command is a bit different here.

185
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:29,290
I'm just gonna go ahead and type in "reboot".

186
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:35,817
Reebot is a lot safer option,
init 3 and 5 are run modes of Linux.

187
00:11:35,852 --> 00:11:39,464
One is basically without
any graphical interface, pure text.

188
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:42,040
And the other one is with a GUI.

189
00:11:43,277 --> 00:11:48,346
The safer option when you
conduct the installation of such packages

190
00:11:48,381 --> 00:11:50,679
that relate to the kernel directly,

191
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:56,155
specially if you have several
of them, is simply to reboot the machine

192
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,090
just to be on the safe side.
It doesn't take up a lot of your time.

193
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:02,490
It happens very fast,

194
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:07,358
and it's a lot safer option.

195
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:11,453
It's gonna save you a lot
of headaches in the future. Excellent.

196
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:14,957
So we have our boot here. Press Enter.

197
00:12:17,232 --> 00:12:21,425
I'll go ahead and close this.
Let me just load the full screen.

198
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,344
Let us see if it will actually happen,

199
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:28,477
if the VirtualBox
Guest Additions that we have installed will work.

200
00:12:28,512 --> 00:12:31,697
If they do work, great. If they don't,

201
00:12:31,732 --> 00:12:33,487
we're gonna have to try something else

202
00:12:33,522 --> 00:12:39,744
as these things have a tendency
to break and problems can occur.

203
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:47,574
You need to log in first, root and "test" below.

204
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:52,258
Excellent. There we go. I have a full screen.

205
00:12:56,229 --> 00:12:58,819
That image is just being
adjusted. Excellent! There you have it.

206
00:12:58,854 --> 00:13:01,919
We have Kali Linux now running in full screen mode,

207
00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:06,062
which is fantastic, now
we have a full overview of the situation.

208
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:08,936
If I open up my terminal and...

209
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:12,445
The scroll doesn't seem to work,
needs to be configured manually.

210
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,300
You zoom in. That's one of
the things that I find very annoying about

211
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:20,897
Kali Linux, but...

212
00:13:22,521 --> 00:13:25,159
There we go. That's it, that's how you zoom in.

213
00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:31,962
Control+- to zoom out. And you zoom in Control++.

214
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:37,488
So, I am pressing Control++,
but it seems to be minimizing things.

215
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:40,752
It doesn't really matter.

216
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:43,845
I'll enlarge it later on as
we progress through the tutorial.

217
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,844
There are a few things
that can be rather buggy here.

218
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,805
Specially with the keyboard keys

219
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,863
that you are using because it is a virtual machine.

220
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:56,137
If you are using Kali Linux
as your main machine, as your host machine

221
00:13:56,172 --> 00:13:59,155
you wouldn't have such
problems, but as I have stated previously

222
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,099
it is not a very recommended option.

223
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:05,570
In any case, that should be it for this tutorial.

224
00:14:05,605 --> 00:14:09,188
These are pretty much all the
preparations that you needed to make

225
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:14,168
and next up, we're gonna get
into the Linux command line interface.

226
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:18,058
I need to acquaint you with it. 
Though we have done some of the commands,

227
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:23,523
they are a very small
portion of what we need to learn

228
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:26,452
and I do need to explain them to you because

229
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:29,127
we're gonna be using Linux command line a lot.

230
00:14:29,162 --> 00:14:31,663
Basically, whatever we do, we're gonna need it.

231
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,772
I bid you farewell and
sincerely hope to see you in the next tutorial.
