00:00:00,312 --> 00:00:03,092
Hello everybody and
welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:08,008
Today we're gonna do some
pre-authentication exploitation whereby we

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:13,252
will pull the credentials without
actually authenticating with the router.

4
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:16,919
We're not gonna pull the router's
credentials in this particular case,

5
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:19,790
we're gonna pull some
information on the wireless.

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:24,600
Now, there are some pretty interesting
facts about this method and this approach.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,690
For example, I have seen it used.

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,030
Well, I haven't actually
seen it with my own eyes.

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,110
I've just read about it on the net.

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,670
And I've read the reports.

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,790
So basically, here's what people did.

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:40,840
Because there was a vulnerability within
peeling routers, that you can pull

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,950
wireless log, wireless credentials,
wireless login keys, provided

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,190
of course that you have
the external router IP address.

15
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,830
And now that is the catch, so
how do you get the IP address?

16
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,645
When you are not authenticated
with the service, I mean,

17
00:00:58,645 --> 00:01:00,550
there really is no easy way of doing it.

18
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,602
So what some people came up with, I mean,

19
00:01:03,602 --> 00:01:09,380
this is clearly in the realm of illegal
and you definitely shouldn't do this.

20
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,250
I mean, it's very unlikely that you
will get a permission to do this.

21
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,370
But, you know, rules vary from
one ISP provider to another.

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,510
And they did the following.

23
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,180
They basically conducted
a full-wide scan of all the IP

24
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,687
addresses within one country,
and they've basically,

25
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:31,860
because Nmaps supports scripting, you see
some of those scripts in front of me,

26
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,580
I'm going to clear the screen because I'm
going to show you how to install them.

27
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,090
Because Nmaps supports scripting,

28
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,410
it has allowed them to run one
single automated command and

29
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,750
just let it run there, and
it didn't run for even that long.

30
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,300
It ran for maybe a couple of, not

31
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:57,070
a couple of hours, but It ran for
a day for sure, something of a kind.

32
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,400
And it scanned one IP address after
another and it would confirm that the IP

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,090
address was vulnerable, that the services
running on that IP address were actually

34
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:11,720
vulnerable, they would be exploited
immediately by Nmap scripts and

35
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,890
credentials would be pulled.

36
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,870
So these scripts ran for
about a day or so.

37
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,740
They had a massive amount
of wireless passwords and

38
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,980
even though they didn't have all of them,

39
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:30,650
because not everybody within the country
uses the same wireless routers,

40
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,261
most of the routers were
actually vulnerable.

41
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:40,178
Primarily because firms,
companies that produce routers,

42
00:02:40,178 --> 00:02:44,616
they use very very similar
firmware on similar

43
00:02:44,616 --> 00:02:49,521
routers which are designed for
similar purposes.

44
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:54,473
For example, for home routers,
you will find that the firmware

45
00:02:54,473 --> 00:02:58,521
from one router to the other
is very similar indeed.

46
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:01,641
And the same vulnerabilities
usually apply.

47
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:05,810
Anyway, this doesn't of course
necessarily need to be true.

48
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,180
So they grab this huge amount
of wireless passwords.

49
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,630
Of course they couldn't use all of them.

50
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,820
The idea was that they would manage
to grab wireless password keys

51
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,890
from wireless access points
that were within their range.

52
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,030
So, within the range of their network,
wireless network card.

53
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,590
And they did actually manage to pull
those as well except they pulled

54
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,750
a lot of others as well.

55
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,410
They pulled thousands and
thousands of others as well.

56
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,630
And of course, they've stored
that into a file, one huge file.

57
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,300
And then they began searching.

58
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,730
Searching through the file for ESSIDs.

59
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,380
Of wireless access points around them,

60
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,050
if any of them corresponded to
the ESSIDs within the file.

61
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,121
And of course, they were matches.

62
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:52,707
And once they found those matches,
they've had wireless passwords for

63
00:03:52,707 --> 00:03:54,821
all of the networks around them.

64
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:57,990
For all of the wireless
access points around them.

65
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,240
Which was great, it was hilarious,

66
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,010
it was a complete success except
it was completely illegal.

67
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,653
Not sure whether it got caught or not but
it made it into the newspapers or

68
00:04:08,653 --> 00:04:09,901
something of a kind.

69
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:12,022
So I assume that they have.

70
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:16,832
Anyway, what we're going to do today is
exactly that, but we're not going to do

71
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:21,659
anything illegal, I'm not going to do
any mass scanning or anything like that.

72
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:26,040
Whatever I do, I will do within
the confines of my own home network.

73
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,760
But the principle is the same, really.

74
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,307
The only difference is the IP
address that you pass,

75
00:04:31,307 --> 00:04:36,790
although I am definitely not encouraging
you to do this, you could get in serious

76
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:42,500
trouble by mass scanning, especially
from your home or something of a kind.

77
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,884
Make sure to inquire about
regulations of your ISP provider,

78
00:04:46,884 --> 00:04:50,040
what is permitted and what is not.

79
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,770
Pretty much all the ISP providers
out there will allow scanning,

80
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,180
but they have some regulation
in regard to that scanning.

81
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,760
You either need a permission or you
need to say that you will do it, and so

82
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,830
on and so forth.

83
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:10,080
So just make sure that you
are acquainted with your local ISP

84
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,570
provider's rules in
regard to the scanning.

85
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:18,230
You don't need to call anybody or anything
like that if you're uncomfortable with it.

86
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,240
Just go on the net.

87
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,080
These sort of things, they're in the
public domain, they're public information.

88
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,740
So, they will give it to you.

89
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,920
That's not a problem.

90
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,486
They all have these specific rules and

91
00:05:29,486 --> 00:05:34,470
they like when people follow them
through so they're public, and so on.

92
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,455
What I'm trying to tell you is,

93
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:37,209
make sure that you're not
doing anything illegal here.

94
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:43,629
Anyway, without further ado, let's just go
ahead and start having some fun with Nmap.

95
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:48,117
So first of all I, will be exploiting my
home wireless router, which is set up for

96
00:05:48,117 --> 00:05:49,709
this particular exercise.

97
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:55,029
And I do believe I have a small file
here that I've prepared for myself.

98
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,909
Yep, there we go.

99
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:59,571
So we have one command
down at the bottom and

100
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:05,290
we have two different file
directories which we're going to use.

101
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:11,070
So anyway, let's go ahead and
give it a shot.

102
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:16,285
And before we actually do the scan itself,
I wanna show you how

103
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:22,401
you can install scripts because,
as you can see from this last command,

104
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:27,670
you have R file equals and
then you have, sorry, not R file.

105
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,578
You have dash, dash, script.

106
00:06:29,578 --> 00:06:33,800
And then http-tplink-dir-traversal.nse.

107
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,350
And then you have arguments for
that particular script.

108
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,990
Anyway, if you don't, you don't need
to actually memorize this long command.

109
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,157
If we just go over to the website,
the Nmap website,

110
00:06:49,157 --> 00:06:55,032
you will see that no matter what script
you actually choose at the bottom,

111
00:06:55,032 --> 00:07:00,280
well, close to the bottom anyway,
you will have example usage.

112
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,680
They've done this in such a fantastic way.

113
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,100
I mean, you don't even need
to think about it that much.

114
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,720
You just need to read what
the particular script does.

115
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,500
Once you do that you can literally
just copy/paste this command and

116
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,160
Then in addition to that,
you can just assign a target or targets.

117
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,760
As you will soon see.

118
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,868
But before you can actually
utilize any of these scripts,

119
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:24,210
you need to know how to install them.

120
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,864
And that can be tricky from time to time
because there isn't exactly a clean way of

121
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:31,739
doing it, like there is for
example, packages,

122
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:35,860
which are in the official
repositories that you can pool with.

123
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:41,549
This is a bit more complex, but
nothing too hard, so you see you have,

124
00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:47,830
at the beginning it says download,
http://nmap.org and then scripts.

125
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,810
So just go ahead and
click on that link basically.

126
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,570
Oops, let's do it like this.

127
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,320
So, open link in new tab.

128
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,541
Excellent, so
you have this rather large script here.

129
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:04,691
Go ahead and Ctrl+A to make sure
that you have selected everything.

130
00:08:04,691 --> 00:08:06,761
Ctrl+C to copy it.

131
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:10,269
And, well.

132
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:13,646
Okay, so no problems.

133
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:15,162
Where is the?

134
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:15,876
There we go.

135
00:08:15,876 --> 00:08:18,935
And now what you need to do,

136
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:24,360
is figure out where these
scripts are located.

137
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,434
I am already in the scripts folder but
if I C-D back to root and

138
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:32,020
clear, I have no idea where the Nmap
scripts are located, but what do I know?

139
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,614
I know that the Nmap script
extensions end up with .nse.

140
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:40,434
So let's just go ahead and
type in the command locate.

141
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:42,810
Locate, what do you
think this command does?

142
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:43,970
It says locate.

143
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,800
It literally locates the file.

144
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,510
But we're going to use a wild
card argument dot and then nse.

145
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:56,260
What this command means is, Please locate
all files that have an extension of .nse,

146
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,792
press enter, and there we go we have
a bunch of them, a lot of them here.

147
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,390
But that's really irrelevant,

148
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:08,540
what we have here is a path to
where these scripts are located.

149
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,484
I'm not gonna use a full path,

150
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:17,491
I'm gonna zoom in a little bit first and

151
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:23,106
then go ahead and type in cd/usr/share and

152
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:27,680
nmap, Enter, Clear, LS, Exon.

153
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,000
So we are here in this Nmap folder,
and we have scripts over here, but

154
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,530
there's also one more thing
which you need to pay attention.

155
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,770
It says nselib.

156
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:44,250
It's right next to the scripts,
right here.

157
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:44,750
It's nselib.

158
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:50,832
And these are the two folders which
will probably be used extensively.

159
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:53,773
There's also payloads and
so on and so forth.

160
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:58,643
And we might do this at a different time,
but for the time being let's just focus on

161
00:09:58,643 --> 00:10:02,260
these two and see how these
scripts are actually installed.

162
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,680
Let's just go ahead and
clear the screen, cd into scripts ls.

163
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,080
And there we go,
we have a lot of them here.

164
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,710
So, these scripts are all used to
either scan or exploit different types

165
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,400
of vulnerabilities depending on
what sort of scripts they are.

166
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:27,030
And, the way you would do it is,
actually, let me just see if I already

167
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:32,104
have this script installed so
I don't do it, like twice over.

168
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:32,936
Copy.

169
00:10:35,116 --> 00:10:40,050
So LS,
this is one of the ways to confirm it.

170
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,580
And, yes, I actually do.

171
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:49,964
So I can just do cat and then let's
paste it again, press Enter, and

172
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:55,118
there you go,
you have the entire script listed here.

173
00:10:55,118 --> 00:10:57,419
Pretty much just copy, pasting.

174
00:10:57,419 --> 00:10:57,959
There we go.

175
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:05,280
It starts from here and just copy,
pasting what we saw in the website, so.

176
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,010
Over here.

177
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,150
These two files are exactly the same so
just select everything that is here

178
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:19,440
and copy it into, into the script folder.

179
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,810
Clear.

180
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,660
So I already have the file.

181
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,400
I already have that script here, but

182
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,460
in case I didn't,
what I would do is type in the following.

183
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,769
I would touch, that's a command.

184
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:33,849
I'm not gonna touch anything,
obviously, aside from my keyboard.

185
00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:35,149
Type in touch.

186
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:41,389
And then we would need a name of the file,
so you would just do this.

187
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:45,189
Apparently, I have created it.

188
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:49,520
Let me just L-S the same thing.

189
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,570
Okay so it's already there, so
it can't actually create it, no problems.

190
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:59,920
Anyway, you would actually create it or,
you don't even need to use touch.

191
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,970
You can just use nano and
then paste the name,

192
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:07,270
remember that the name needs to remain the
same, and then I would just paste the code

193
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:11,590
from the website into this particular
file, the new file that I would create.

194
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:16,270
So what you need to do is type in nano,
name of the new file that you wish

195
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,430
to create, this one is full obviously,
but I can delete all of this and

196
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:23,700
copy that from the website, and
that would be all that I would need to do.

197
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,900
Make sure that the name is as
exactly as it says on the website.

198
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,540
So you can grab the name
of the script from here.

199
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,520
No problems here.

200
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,520
I can just open link in new tab.

201
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,710
I have some vone scripts here and
let's just pick

202
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:47,096
the first one, so
this one would be APF copy.

203
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:50,900
Do I have it here?

204
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,400
LS based.

205
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,170
Yep, I even have this one.

206
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,050
I have a vast majority of these scripts,
here.

207
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,650
So, I don't have any problems with that.

208
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:04,420
But, you will need to manually install
some of them and I've just showed you how.

209
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,460
So, just create a file with
the specific name of the script,

210
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:16,240
which you can grab from the site,
and then fill that script up

211
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,060
with information that you can find on
the download link at the top of the site.

212
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,926
So just Ctrl+A,

213
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:26,270
Ctrl+C and then you would paste it
obviously in the file in the terminal.

214
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,000
That is the way to use it.

215
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,930
Now down at the bottom it says requires.

216
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:37,285
So these are some of the things that it
requires, and you go down into Libraries.

217
00:13:37,285 --> 00:13:39,940
Control+F, vulms, and there you go.

218
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,580
It says vulms.

219
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:46,719
That's one of the libraries required,
so let me just go through it.

220
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:47,659
Yep, there we go.

221
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:50,770
Source, copyright.

222
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,901
Those are your functions down below.

223
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:55,112
I'm not interested in that.

224
00:13:55,112 --> 00:13:58,478
Anyway, example of [INAUDIBLE] script.

225
00:13:58,478 --> 00:14:03,060
The following example illustrates,
Illustrates.

226
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,900
There is bound to be a link somewhere.

227
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:10,390
To match different from abilities,
exploit ability

228
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:16,428
table There we go.

229
00:14:16,428 --> 00:14:17,768
Source.

230
00:14:17,768 --> 00:14:19,320
Sorry.
There's no download section here.

231
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:25,160
It just says source, if you click on it,

232
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,160
again, you are given the same screen,

233
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,930
which you can just Ctrl+A to copy and,
no problems there.

234
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,428
Same procedure as with the script,

235
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:39,935
you just Ctrl+A to copy
everything within this.

236
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:44,133
You come back, you actually
need to have the same name for

237
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:48,418
this library, and you go ahead and
open up your terminal,

238
00:14:48,418 --> 00:14:53,586
you go out of the scripts because we
don't want to be there, you go LS.

239
00:14:53,586 --> 00:14:54,666
Mm, where is it?

240
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:58,646
nselib, LS.

241
00:14:58,646 --> 00:15:00,987
And you will basically create it here.

242
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:03,530
Make sure that the extension has,
let's just go ahead and enter that.

243
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:10,237
Oh [NOISE] this is not what

244
00:15:10,237 --> 00:15:14,438
I wanted to create,

245
00:15:14,438 --> 00:15:21,117
give me a second here so, nano.

246
00:15:21,117 --> 00:15:25,218
Go back to the website, vulms.lua.

247
00:15:25,218 --> 00:15:28,198
Go back to the terminal, paste.

248
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,470
Oh, okay, so
I already have this one as well.

249
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,640
But if I didn't,
I would just paste the code into here and

250
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,410
I would press Ctrl+O to save it.

251
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,570
That is all you need to do.

252
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,720
There is nothing else, quite literally,
that you would need to do,

253
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,660
it's just a bunch of copy-paste action.

254
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,030
That is all.

255
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,277
A lot of these files and a lot of scripts
you will have by default install,

256
00:15:52,277 --> 00:15:53,459
so don't worry about it.

257
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:58,079
Just in case you need something very
specific, you would actually need

258
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,160
to go on over to their website,
and just copy-paste the code.

259
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,100
That is it.

260
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,890
You don't need to do anything else.

261
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,200
I'll just clear the screen.

262
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:13,330
If you still have some problems with this,
or something of a kind,

263
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:17,800
feel free to address me
in the question section,

264
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,910
I will be more than happy to
help you out any way I can.

265
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:25,080
Anyway, let's employ this last command.

266
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,560
Based and include the script.

267
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,640
So it says here target,
my target's gonna be 192.168.0.1.

268
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,922
And this is my wireless router.

269
00:16:34,922 --> 00:16:36,981
Now, I am giving it a LAN address,

270
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:41,220
but you can give it a external IP
address as well, if you have it.

271
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,420
I don't have Internet.

272
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,756
I don't have access onto
internet from my wireless router,

273
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,000
so I'm using it like this.

274
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,110
Press enter and there we go, we have
a vpa key, oh sorry, a vpa passphrase.

275
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:59,033
A wonderful passphrase,
seriously, like test123456789,

276
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:02,375
the most original one you will ever see.

277
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,960
ESSID is somewhere in here as well.

278
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,360
Feel free to just go about looking for it.

279
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,900
More importantly WPS default pin is here.

280
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,990
Make sure to grab this,
because if the user changes the password,

281
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,180
you want to know the pin.

282
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,865
You'll want to know the pin because you
can retrieve that password afterwards,

283
00:17:18,865 --> 00:17:24,876
the way I showed you where we
used revert in order to extract

284
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:31,190
the VPA Password, passphrase,
or a passkey with a PIN.

285
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,280
If you give reaver the default PIN,

286
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,140
it's gonna pull the password no problems,
immediately.

287
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,960
Anyway, I will wrap the tutorial up here.

288
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,256
This is one of the ways in which
you can get the IP addresses.

289
00:17:45,256 --> 00:17:48,144
The VPS2 passkeys.

290
00:17:48,144 --> 00:17:52,020
Aside from the IP address here,
you can type in -il and

291
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,110
then give it a file which
contains a list of IP addresses.

292
00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:02,810
A file which contains a list of IP
addresses would look something like this.

293
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,654
So it would have 192.168.1.

294
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,380
One to two hundred and, actually, 195.

295
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:23,705
So again, 192.168.44 to 98.1.

296
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:26,810
.1 to, I don't know, 33.

297
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:33,125
So these are the IP ranges which you can
put into this file and then later on,

298
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:39,740
you can actually pass them to Nmap with
an il command and, just type in test.

299
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,800
And the Nmap will actually take
all those IP address ranges and

300
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,110

every single IP address there.

In any case,
I would like to bid you all farewell,

302
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,400
and I'll hope to see you
in the next tutorial.
