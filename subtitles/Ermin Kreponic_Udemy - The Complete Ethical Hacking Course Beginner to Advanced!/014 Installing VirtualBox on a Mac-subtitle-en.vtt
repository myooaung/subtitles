00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.471

Welcome all.



2

00:00:03.706 --> 00:00:07.155

Today I have some joyous news for everyone,



3

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.348

well, not for everyone,

but ok, for a lot of people, I guess.



4

00:00:10.883 --> 00:00:14.238

Due to popular demand on Udemy I have



5

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:22.973

for Mac, for Mac

instructions, for tutorials on a Mac,



6

00:00:23.408 --> 00:00:28.515

I have decided to acquire a

MacBook Pro to do the demonstrations on it.



7

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.544

The set up instructions

on how to install VirtualBox,



8

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.104

how to do a passthrough



9

00:00:34.914 --> 00:00:38.247

and pretty much anything else

that you might ask of me to do.



10

00:00:38.282 --> 00:00:40.619

I will be happy to do it if I can.



11

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:46.151

And also, for some of the

problems that people have been experiencing



12

00:00:46.286 --> 00:00:51.169

on a Mac, now I can relate to you.

Now you can write me and I can attempt



13

00:00:51.404 --> 00:00:53.561

to recreate the problems and find the solutions.



14

00:00:55.163 --> 00:00:58.399

But before I actually

begin with the tutorial itself,



15

00:00:58.434 --> 00:01:04.036

I would like to share

my experience this far with a Mac.



16

00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.309

This is something I really feel that I need to do.



17

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.116

First of all, the price.

When I saw what the prices were for Macs



18

00:01:13.151 --> 00:01:17.177

that was pretty detrimental and demoralizing



19

00:01:17.212 --> 00:01:21.102

with me going around and looking for a used Mac.



20

00:01:22.922 --> 00:01:27.246

But, I guess it needed to be done, so here it is.



21

00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:32.933

What I've acquired to

purchase is a MacBook Pro, from late 2011



22

00:01:33.068 --> 00:01:36.491

with a 2.4 GHz i7 Quad-core processor



23

00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:42.610

and with 4GB of RAM and with

8 dedicated to AMD graphics card.



24

00:01:44.085 --> 00:01:49.400

So I have replaced the RAM,

I went to the official Mac service here



25

00:01:50.295 --> 00:01:53.667

and I asked them about

the RAM in Mac, and they basically said



26

00:01:53.802 --> 00:01:57.382

that I could either insert one 8GB slot



27

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:00.915

and that would work

in conjuntion with my 2GB slot,



28

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.654

which was on a lower frequency,



29

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.119

but then both would work in a lower frequency,



30

00:02:05.154 --> 00:02:06.913

or I could insert two of them.



31

00:02:06.948 --> 00:02:10.852

Upon realizing what the price

was for two, I promptly instructed him



32

00:02:11.087 --> 00:02:15.171

to insert only one into

this Mac, as I don't really need



33

00:02:15.206 --> 00:02:20.084

more than 10GB of RAM,

however the frequency is a bit lower.



34

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:23.609

Anyway, that is the hardware that I have,



35

00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:28.412

so that you know what

I am working with, so that you can compare



36

00:02:28.447 --> 00:02:31.995

to your own and understand

my limitations, if there are any.



37

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.281

And I also have the latest

update of Yosemite installed here.



38

00:02:38.386 --> 00:02:41.669

And I have created a dedicated account for Udemy,



39

00:02:41.804 --> 00:02:45.326

as you can see, in the

upper right corner it says Udemy.



40

00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:51.465

I have not installed

anything with this account, so



41

00:02:52.232 --> 00:02:53.977

this is as it gets, this is stock.



42

00:02:56.901 --> 00:02:58.970

And now I will go through the tutorials



43

00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:01.492

and show you how to install VirtualBox, Kali



44

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.741

and passthrough, set up a passthrough, I mean



45

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:09.331

things are fairly the same, if not exactly the same



46

00:03:09.666 --> 00:03:12.295

but some people have been

experiencing some problems.



47

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.401

I have not done anything on this Mac,



48

00:03:14.436 --> 00:03:19.340

I have not done any installations

or anything like that, so I want to see



49

00:03:19.475 --> 00:03:22.721

if I will encounter the same

problems while instructing you



50

00:03:22.756 --> 00:03:26.030

and let's see how,

if I am able to resolve them quickly.



51

00:03:26.065 --> 00:03:28.649

If I'm able to resolve them

quickly, I'll leave it in this tutorial.



52

00:03:28.684 --> 00:03:32.168

If I'm not, I'll cut out the long

parts and see what I can do.



53

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.030

Anyway, my experience this far with Yosemite,



54

00:03:38.365 --> 00:03:42.701

well, I'm not too thrilled

with it, not too enthusiastic.



55

00:03:42.836 --> 00:03:46.929

I mean, the design is nice,

both, the MacBook Pro design is very nice



56

00:03:47.064 --> 00:03:49.743

and the layout of the

operating system is very nice



57

00:03:49.978 --> 00:03:53.387

but it doesn't have the amount of customizability



58

00:03:53.422 --> 00:03:57.392

and it doesn't have the amount

of options that I have with Fedora, really.



59

00:03:57.427 --> 00:03:59.599

I don't have the same amount of freedom.



60

00:03:59.734 --> 00:04:02.900

But it is true what they say.

Things just tend to work with Mac.



61

00:04:02.935 --> 00:04:04.497

There are no problems of whatsoever.



62

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.276

It runs smoothly, the battery's great and all that



63

00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:12.638

but I just don't have the

same features that I have on Linux,



64

00:04:12.673 --> 00:04:15.824

even though the terminal

commands are fairly similar,



65

00:04:16.988 --> 00:04:20.259

I don't have the same amount

of freedom to mess around with my system



66

00:04:20.294 --> 00:04:24.506

as I do have in Linux,

so that's one of the reasons why



67

00:04:24.541 --> 00:04:28.318

I didn't enjoy my

experience with a Mac that much, but



68

00:04:28.453 --> 00:04:31.844

I mean, it's ok, it's fine,

this is a perfectly legit operating system.



69

00:04:35.638 --> 00:04:37.151

I would definitely be able to use it,



70

00:04:38.052 --> 00:04:40.926

I do not think it would be a bad experience,



71

00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:43.953

on the contrary, I believe

it would be a fantastic experience,



72

00:04:44.253 --> 00:04:47.658

but I'm not switching from Linux, like, no way.



73

00:04:51.034 --> 00:04:53.590

So let's go ahead and begin with the basics.



74

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:56.932

The first thing you

need to do if you are a Mac user



75

00:04:57.267 --> 00:05:01.707

to follow through this

tutorial, you will need to install



76

00:05:01.742 --> 00:05:05.600

a virtual machine of

Kali Linux, or create a dual boot.



77

00:05:06.743 --> 00:05:11.039

Today I'm not going to

demonstrate how to do a dual boot for Kali, but



78

00:05:12.403 --> 00:05:15.380

dual boot with Kali, I wouldn't really recommend



79

00:05:15.556 --> 00:05:17.337

because there isn't that much point to it,



80

00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:19.866

it's a lot easier to install a VirtualBox,



81

00:05:20.101 --> 00:05:23.268

as most of the wireless cards in Macs



82

00:05:23.403 --> 00:05:25.851

won't really be good for packet injection.



83

00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:30.346

You might ask me what is the difference.



84

00:05:30.481 --> 00:05:32.230

Can we do packet injection with VirtualBox



85

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.966

and stuff will go through

a virtual machine with VirtualBox?



86

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.755

No, you cannot do that.



87

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.981

Because if we install

a virtual machine, that virtual machine



88

00:05:40.016 --> 00:05:42.939

does not have access

to your integrated wireless card,



89

00:05:42.974 --> 00:05:47.078

the only thing you can do

is pass a USB wireless adapter



90

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:49.745

to that virtual machine

and then do it a packet injection.



91

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.514

This, I do believe that I shall demonstrate as well.



92

00:05:54.256 --> 00:05:57.504

Our work around for this

in most laptops, including MacBooks



93

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:02.304

is simply to create a

dual boot, or a live boot, and then...



94

00:06:03.912 --> 00:06:06.551

A live boot is basically to create a USB of Kali.



95

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.059

There is a separate tutorial for that.



96

00:06:11.785 --> 00:06:15.766

Those two options remain

and you can access your hardware directly.



97

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.779

But then again, there is no point in doing that



98

00:06:18.814 --> 00:06:22.469

if your wireless card

does not support packet injection



99

00:06:22.504 --> 00:06:25.048

or it's simply not good for it.



100

00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:29.000

So I would advise you to get a wireless adapter



101

00:06:29.235 --> 00:06:33.364

and if you still want

to attempt a dual boot or live version



102

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:35.375

I mean, by all means, feel free to do so



103

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.323

and I really, really,

really hope that it does work out.



104

00:06:39.358 --> 00:06:43.828

But in this tutorial I will

show you how to install VirtualBox.



105

00:06:43.863 --> 00:06:47.055

Also, by the way, if you have any other request



106

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.063

what you'd like me to demonstrate

on a Mac, feel free to ask it of me,



107

00:06:51.398 --> 00:06:54.348

but I'm only going to go in terms of configuration



108

00:06:54.383 --> 00:06:57.794

if you want the stuff

on the course that I do in Linux



109

00:06:57.829 --> 00:06:59.550

and you want to do the same things on a Mac,



110

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.224

that's not a good idea,

let me just leave it to that.



111

00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:08.296

Let me just go ahead and begin with this already



112

00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:12.484

because I'm looking at my timer,

I've been bubbling for about 7 minutes.



113

00:07:15.703 --> 00:07:18.525

So let's open up the default web browser,



114

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.950

I'm not going to install

Firefox or anything like that.



115

00:07:21.085 --> 00:07:23.385

On my main user I have

installed Firefox so I can use it,



116

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.950

but as I said I'm running this at stock.



117

00:07:27.685 --> 00:07:31.790

I've no intention of

changing the default installation.



118

00:07:32.984 --> 00:07:35.265

Let's go ahead and first

open up the VirtualBox website.



119

00:07:37.935 --> 00:07:42.551

Type in "virtualbox" and search for it.



120

00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:48.517

We've got https://www.virtualbox.org.



121

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.397

There we go, so check if it's secured.



122

00:07:56.632 --> 00:07:58.561

Safari is using an encrypted connection.



123

00:08:02.223 --> 00:08:03.816

Show the certificates.



124

00:08:07.866 --> 00:08:10.679

Issued by VeriSign, ok so I know they're the ones



125

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.912

issuing the certificate

for this site, so that is fine.



126

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.837

You go ahead an check the certificate anyway



127

00:08:17.072 --> 00:08:21.221

and make sure that it's https, just in case



128

00:08:21.256 --> 00:08:24.313

because people tend to put fake webs, websites,



129

00:08:24.348 --> 00:08:28.333

quite a good amount of times.

And then go into Downloads



130

00:08:30.995 --> 00:08:32.938

And from the downloads you can see...



131

00:08:34.598 --> 00:08:36.469

Oh, I didn't configure this bar down.



132

00:08:36.804 --> 00:08:39.246

Let's go ahead and configure this bar.



133

00:08:39.281 --> 00:08:41.020

I'm sorry, it's just gonna take a minute.



134

00:08:41.155 --> 00:08:44.814

The Dock. I'm pretty sure

all the Mac users know how to do this.



135

00:08:47.044 --> 00:08:49.316

Hide it. Thank you.



136

00:08:51.091 --> 00:08:54.180

Now let's expand this.

I really like this feature with a Mac



137

00:08:54.215 --> 00:08:58.199

that you can slide left and right, with 3 fingers.



138

00:09:00.095 --> 00:09:05.014

Let's go ahead and select

the OS X version of VirtualBox.



139

00:09:05.149 --> 00:09:08.715

So we got VirtualBox for

Windows hosts, OS X hosts.



140

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.707

Let's go ahead and select that one.



141

00:09:12.622 --> 00:09:15.337

The download is proceeding.



142

00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:23.001

And it's going pretty fast.

For me, anyway. Or so I like to think.



143

00:09:24.403 --> 00:09:27.273

And I don't have the fastest

internet connection out there,



144

00:09:27.608 --> 00:09:31.932

it's 8MB down and 10Mb up,



145

00:09:32.267 --> 00:09:36.991

80Mb down and 10Mb up,

but it does serve its purpose.



146

00:09:39.116 --> 00:09:41.631

Let's go ahead and open up this file.



147

00:09:46.312 --> 00:09:50.120

Let it run, let it run.

No big deal. Shouldn't take too long.



148

00:09:50.555 --> 00:09:53.890

Checking volumes. Finishing. Thank you.



149

00:09:56.575 --> 00:09:59.894

So let's go ahead and begin with the installation.



150

00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:03.463

This is the first time I'm

actually installing something in a Mac,



151

00:10:04.526 --> 00:10:06.136

I've done this deliberately.



152

00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:10.016

I did not want to do

this installation prior to this



153

00:10:10.251 --> 00:10:12.732

so that I can put myself into somebody's shoes



154

00:10:13.067 --> 00:10:16.569

and that I would encounter the same exact problems



155

00:10:16.804 --> 00:10:19.254

that you yourselves would encounter,



156

00:10:19.289 --> 00:10:22.763

I am hoping that I will

encounter them to an extent, anyway.



157

00:10:26.827 --> 00:10:28.754

Let's go ahead and see what it says.



158

00:10:28.789 --> 00:10:31.930

"Double click on this icon". Nevermind that.



159

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.683

"Run the VirtualBox application..."



160

00:10:37.246 --> 00:10:40.349

Will this work? No. Yes. Excellent.



161

00:10:42.966 --> 00:10:45.847

I'm lying. In my user

installation I did install Firefox



162

00:10:45.982 --> 00:10:49.593

so that's something. But I

did not install VirtualBox prior to this.



163

00:10:52.142 --> 00:10:53.949

Let's go ahead and open up Applications.



164

00:11:01.568 --> 00:11:04.152

There we go. VirtualBox package.



165

00:11:07.191 --> 00:11:09.461

"This package will run a program to determine



166

00:11:09.496 --> 00:11:12.808

if the software can be installed". OK.



167

00:11:15.124 --> 00:11:18.718

Introduction. Thank you for the introduction.



168

00:11:18.753 --> 00:11:22.163

Change install location.

What is the default install location?



169

00:11:23.374 --> 00:11:25.121

Install only for me.



170

00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:31.499

Why doesn't it give this option?



171

00:11:37.774 --> 00:11:39.467

Maybe it's stuck or something.



172

00:11:42.676 --> 00:11:44.745

No, it's definitely not stuck.



173

00:11:49.114 --> 00:11:50.845

That's just a certificate.



174

00:11:52.829 --> 00:11:56.757

Install for all users on this computer.

I do not know how to change this.



175

00:11:56.892 --> 00:11:59.349

Apparently I don't have the ability to change it.



176

00:12:03.435 --> 00:12:05.215

Customize. Let's see what this does.



177

00:12:08.083 --> 00:12:12.619

The command line tools, maybe I shall use them.



178

00:12:12.854 --> 00:12:16.909

The utilities, not a bad idea.

VirtualBox kernel extensions.



179

00:12:18.452 --> 00:12:23.258

It seems to have everything

prepackaged here. That is very nice.



180

00:12:23.593 --> 00:12:27.461

I could actually disable

one package, but it doesn't allow me



181

00:12:27.596 --> 00:12:29.936

to go ahead and destroy the kernel extensions.



182

00:12:29.971 --> 00:12:32.908

But it's OK, I mean, there I needed for it to work.



183

00:12:39.456 --> 00:12:42.728

What I am bothered with the most,

and sure somebody's looking at me



184

00:12:44.074 --> 00:12:46.886

and saying "wow, what a stupid person you are",



185

00:12:46.921 --> 00:12:49.968

"you can't even change the destination".



186

00:12:57.571 --> 00:13:00.416

I suppose it has to install for everybody,



187

00:13:01.354 --> 00:13:03.617

that seems a bit strange, doesn't it?



188

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:07.271

Well, not really a big deal. To be honest,



189

00:13:07.306 --> 00:13:10.176

I kind of need VirtualBox

in my other users as well.



190

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.401

On my main user I need the VirtualBox as well,



191

00:13:15.436 --> 00:13:16.939

I was meaning to install it anyway.



192

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:19.957

So let's go ahead and skip that shameful part



193

00:13:20.092 --> 00:13:22.501

where the instructor knows nothing.



194

00:13:24.791 --> 00:13:27.476

It's requesting me that

I confirm this with a password,



195

00:13:27.711 --> 00:13:32.899

so let's go ahead and type it in. There we go.



196

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:37.659

The strange thing for me,

coming to a Mac is that I can



197

00:13:37.894 --> 00:13:42.265

I mean, there is like the Homebrew,

the packet manager that I can install



198

00:13:44.285 --> 00:13:49.284

for OS X, but it is very

annoying to actually have to install that



199

00:13:49.419 --> 00:13:52.230

and not have a packet manager by default.



200

00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:54.856

So I have 30 minutes remaining.



201

00:13:55.852 --> 00:13:58.406

Hopefully we can finish it, as I am running short,



202

00:13:58.441 --> 00:14:01.007

as I only have six more minutes of the tutorial



203

00:14:02.125 --> 00:14:03.770

due to the limitations on Udemy.



204

00:14:04.005 --> 00:14:07.843

So that is the installation

procedure for VirtualBox.



205

00:14:07.878 --> 00:14:09.436

It seems to be installed now.



206

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:16.689

Let's go ahead and run it,

and I probably don't need this anymore.



207

00:14:21.576 --> 00:14:23.120

Is this how you delete things?



208

00:14:23.155 --> 00:14:25.245

No, that's how you remove them from the dock.



209

00:14:26.663 --> 00:14:29.900

I'll just use the file manager to remove it.



210

00:14:29.935 --> 00:14:32.358

Can I use the file manager to remove it?



211

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.342

Excellent, so there we go.

Let's go into the applications.



212

00:14:52.452 --> 00:14:54.033

And move to trash.



213

00:14:55.273 --> 00:14:57.396

Now we're gonna go ahead and start VirtualBox.



214

00:14:59.626 --> 00:15:02.907

I don't have an SSD in this, so keep that in mind.



215

00:15:04.182 --> 00:15:07.199

The version with an SSD was kind of expensive.



216

00:15:08.627 --> 00:15:13.971

But I might decide to upgrade

later on if it's worth the while.



217

00:15:15.002 --> 00:15:18.388

Probably it is in terms of speed,

but again, I don't use this laptop



218

00:15:18.423 --> 00:15:20.524

for much other than web browsing.



219

00:15:21.676 --> 00:15:26.843

Let's go ahead and, now that we have this set up,



220

00:15:26.878 --> 00:15:28.576

now we're gonna go ahead and



221

00:15:29.907 --> 00:15:31.536

basically just download Kali



222

00:15:31.771 --> 00:15:34.060

and in the next

tutorial we're going to install it.



223

00:15:35.135 --> 00:15:38.855

So go to Safari and then type in just Kali.



224

00:15:40.374 --> 00:15:41.919

It should pop up the right one.



225

00:15:43.013 --> 00:15:48.108

Https. Change to English. Thank you.



226

00:15:49.586 --> 00:15:53.304

There we go, the first one

is Kali Linux, Penetration Testing, https.



227

00:15:56.225 --> 00:15:58.150

We're gonna go into Downloads.



228

00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:04.364

And keep in mind that you can

either download a Kali 2.0 image from here



229

00:16:04.699 --> 00:16:08.701

in different sections of the

instructions. I used different versions.



230

00:16:08.836 --> 00:16:11.116

I've updated certain sections of the tutorial



231

00:16:11.251 --> 00:16:13.249

which are considered to be vital.



232

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.777

When you watch this,

if there is a newer version of Kali



233

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:21.919

just go ahead and download it,

it should be fine, no problems.



234

00:16:21.954 --> 00:16:26.938

So you can either download

this one, the ISO file from here



235

00:16:27.173 --> 00:16:29.945

or you can go ahead and...



236

00:16:38.013 --> 00:16:42.729

There we go. So you can either

download the ISO file from here, this one



237

00:16:43.164 --> 00:16:48.959

or you can go down below and select Official ARM



238

00:16:49.094 --> 00:16:51.431

and VMWare images for virtual machines.



239

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:57.300

So you have prebuild Kali Linux VMware images



240

00:16:57.435 --> 00:17:01.331

and you have prebuild

Kali Linux VirtualBox images.



241

00:17:01.466 --> 00:17:04.692

So you can use these as well. Keep that in mind.



242

00:17:08.226 --> 00:17:12.619

For the time being,

I would like you to go ahead and download



243

00:17:12.854 --> 00:17:18.145

this prebuild version, Kali Linux 64 bit VBox.



244

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.861

And we're just gonna go ahead and click on...



245

00:17:21.196 --> 00:17:24.178

Do I have any torrent clients installed here?



246

00:17:26.825 --> 00:17:30.926

Are you serious? I do. No, this is just the image,



247

00:17:31.261 --> 00:17:33.680

this is just the file that starts the download.



248

00:17:36.247 --> 00:17:38.874

Any chance I have it installed?



249

00:17:40.978 --> 00:17:42.555

Of course not!



250

00:17:43.628 --> 00:17:47.984

So let's just go ahead and click

on the image and download it so



251

00:17:49.248 --> 00:17:52.099

download is proceeding. By the time I come back



252

00:17:52.134 --> 00:17:55.276

in the next tutorial the download will finish



253

00:17:55.311 --> 00:17:58.236

and I'll be able to show you how to install it



254

00:17:58.371 --> 00:18:02.195

and then we can go into USB passthrough on a Mac.



255

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.377

Until then, I bid you farewell.



256

00:18:05.412 --> 00:18:07.916

And I sincerely hope

that you are all pleased with this.
