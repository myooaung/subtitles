00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,310
Hello everybody, and
welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,400
Today I will be talking
about how you can configure

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,500
proxy change to work in combination with,
or in order to anonymize traffic.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,310
Not only web browsing traffic, but
rather instead all network-related traffic

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,070
generated by pretty much
all of your applications.

6
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,490
Now, there are a few of those which will
not work in combination with proxy chains.

7
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:34,280
Namely, one such application is for
a piece of software is Metasploit.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,630
Now Metasploit is practically a hacking
framework, and it is of crucial importance

9
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,400
for pretty much any sort of
hacking activity in today's world.

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,050
Especially because it allows automated
generation of code needed to break

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,000
a certain system, and it also contains
a list of vulnerabilities as well.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,850
However, what I want to do here
today is show you how you can

13
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,660
anonymize pretty much all
footprinting traffic,

14
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,970
or traffic generated by Nmap when
you were gathering information.

15
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,460
Or even your web browsing
traffic in a different fashion,

16
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,260
other than using a Tor browser.

17
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,910
And how you can cover
your tracks in general,

18
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,330
no matter what you are doing, pretty much.

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,600
So one of the first things
that you do need to do,

20
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,400
in Kali Linux it comes pre-installed,
so you need Tor and proxy chains.

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,890
These two things you would
install on some other systems,

22
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,120
Linux systems or
Windows systems, doesn't matter.

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,430
Tor is kind of tricky.

24
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,770
I have seen versions where Tor is not
installed by default, and I have specified

25
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:51,850
in the previous tutorial I do believe how
to install Tor no problems, but yeah.

26
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,590
What you would need to do here is simply
configure and not install anything.

27
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,662
So, let's just navigate over to the etc
proxy chains configuration file,

28
00:02:03,662 --> 00:02:11,970
nano/etc proxychains.conf.

29
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,510
Press enter and there we go,
we are in the configuration file.

30
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,130
Let me just zoom,
let me just expand this actually.

31
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:24,300
And what proxy chains is,
well it gives you an ability to

32
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,470
route your traffic through
a series of proxy servers and

33
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:34,658
stay anonymous in such a fashion
by hiding behind them.

34
00:02:34,658 --> 00:02:39,505
Or by having them forward your request so
that it looks to the other side

35
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:43,870
that your requests are coming
from them as opposed to from you.

36
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,940
Surprisingly enough there
are a large amount of

37
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,900
free proxy servers out there that you
can use, but they're not very stable.

38
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,120
They go up and down and
they're not very fast, so for

39
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,800
specific targets they can be useful.

40
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,740
Not for brute forcing, not for
any form of brute forcing attacks.

41
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,903
But if you are doing something
to a certain target,

42
00:03:04,903 --> 00:03:07,430
if you're trying to log in,
or you're already logged in.

43
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,070
You can definitely do it
through proxy chains, and

44
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,230
it will be reasonably fast and
reasonably stable as well.

45
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,105
But if you're doing some
sort of mass scanning, or

46
00:03:18,105 --> 00:03:21,310
you're brute forcing a password or
something of a kind.

47
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,698
Proxy chains with a list of proxies
selected from the internet,

48
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:31,006
free proxies that is,
that's not gonna work out.

49
00:03:31,006 --> 00:03:35,226
I mean, it's gonna work about
eventually in a technical sense,

50
00:03:35,226 --> 00:03:38,380
but it will consume more
time than you can spare.

51
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,241
And by more time than you can spare,
I mean like a month or

52
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:48,110
two to do a simple scan, so
that's not an option there.

53
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,430
There are other ways of doing that,
but for the time being,

54
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,010
I just want to show you how
you can use proxy chains,

55
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:00,190
how you can configure it actually, cuz
it's really useful, I use it fairly often,

56
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,920
a lot of people do, and
it's a fantastic piece of software.

57
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,330
So first off, you have types of
proxies here which you can use,

58
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,750
you have HTTP, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5.

59
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,600
Now there are fundamental
differences between these protocols.

60
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,310
You always, always want to find
yourselves a SOCKS5 proxy as

61
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:27,360
that is the best possible one that has the
ability to anonymize all sorts of traffic.

62
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,310
HTTP, as the name itself says,
it's for HTTP traffic.

63
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,770
And SOCKS4 is very similar to SOCKS5 but

64
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:41,370
it does not support IPv6 protocol,
and it does not support QDP protocol.

65
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,000
So SOCKS4 can be rather problematic.

66
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:51,039
You always want to make sure that you're
using SOCKS5 wherever and however.

67
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,830
Anyway, down below you have these
options which we will go over.

68
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,290
So basically,
how you enable these options,

69
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,420
you don't need to type in some complex
lines of code or anything of a kind.

70
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,320
Basically just delete the hash and
that's it.

71
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,230
Save the file, the option's enabled.

72
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,320
This hash presents a commented outline,

73
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,910
meaning that the system reading this
file will ignore it if there is a hash.

74
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,830
If there isn't a hash it will
take it into consideration and

75
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,310
interpret it accordingly.

76
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,520
Anyway, what we have here
are statements which allow us to

77
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,150
specify how we want our
traffic to be routed.

78
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,590
So first off, we have dynamic chain.

79
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:45,190
Dynamic chain is an option which you
will find people using the most.

80
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,140
It is most commonly used option,
a preferable one,

81
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,050
and honestly I think it's the best one.

82
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,150
Primarily because it's the most
stable one and heres why.

83
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:00,240
Suppose you have A B C D proxies, so

84
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,730
those are some servers with IP
addresses with open boards.

85
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:10,730
And if you have a strict chain
policy like we have here,

86
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:15,730
you will only be able to access any
site on the internet in general

87
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,040
by going through A B C D.

88
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,290
So, you have to go through all of them and

89
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,350
you have to go through in
that specific order, A B C D.

90
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,490
And that's not always a good thing.

91
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,170
If you're paying for

92
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:33,420
five proxies that's not a problem
because they will always be operational.

93
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,220
They will always be up and why not?

94
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,480
That's not a bad option there at all.

95
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:45,510
However, most people use free proxies and
they don't tend to pay for them.

96
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:50,730
Why would you pay for five, ten proxies
for a simple scan or something of a kind?

97
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,470
They're not free, they cost money.

98
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:58,170
They're not that expensive either,
but still, the active ping itself

99
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:03,110
identifies you and it kinda diminishes the
amount of anonymity you have on the net.

100
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,250
There are some complex payment methods
which you can use to anonymize yourself

101
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:13,120
but still,
it's far simpler to simply go ahead and

102
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,780
use dynamic chains.

103
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,000
So I'm just gonna go ahead and uncomment,
oops, and I'm gonna uncomment this line.

104
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,930
Go ahead down below and comment this
line and comment this line out.

105
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:33,980
So strict chains will no longer be used,
I will be using dynamic chains.

106
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:39,300
One more thing to note here is that if you
want to use proxy chains in combination

107
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,610
with Tor, so if you want to route all of
your traffic through the Tor network,

108
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:48,090
not just the web traffic,
you must enable dynamic chains.

109
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,300
There is a chance that it will
work with strict chains, but

110
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,250
due to the instability of Tor
nodes it is highly unlikely.

111
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,916
You will need dynamic chains, and
that is why I am using them today.

112
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:07,630
Anyway, if you are using dynamic chains,
it just gives you the ability to go from

113
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:14,160
A B C D to your desired destination
by not having to adhere to any order.

114
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,300
So let's say that C is down.

115
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,650
You would go A B D, and
it would work no problems.

116
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,610
Even if B was down, it would go A D and
you would still reach the destination.

117
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,360
So as long as one single
proxy is functional,

118
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,150
it's going to work, and you don't
require any specific order to it.

119
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,220
Down below, you have random_chain.

120
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,760
Now, random chains are, in effect,

121
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:45,470
basically the same thing
as resetting your services.

122
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:50,090
If you're resetting your Tor,
you will be assigned a new IP address.

123
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:54,788
Tor assigns you a new IP
address every ten minutes or so

124
00:08:54,788 --> 00:09:00,230
anyway, but with a random chain
you can specify a list of IPs.

125
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,451
And then you can tell your computer okay,

126
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:08,421
I want you to connect to this point,
and every time you connect,

127
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:13,870
every time you transmit a packet,
I want you to use a different proxy.

128
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,450
You can do that as well.

129
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,820
That's one of the options, definitely.

130
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:22,560
You can say,
okay go use this one five times and

131
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,400
then change it to another one or
something of a kind.

132
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,340
There are a lot of options specified
there, primarily the chain length.

133
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,410
Anyway, now if we head down below,
there's the quiet mode.

134
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,990
You don't really need that.

135
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,510
Proxy DNS requests no leak from DNS data.

136
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,390
This is very important,
you can not have any DNS leaks.

137
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,470
Let me explain to you what DNS leaks are.

138
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,250
Even though somebody cannot get
your particular IP address,

139
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,890
they can get the IP address of
the DNS server that you are using.

140
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:03,400
What DNS servers do is resolve domains
to IP addresses and vice versa.

141
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:10,110
So, for example,
if you typed in youtube.com,

142
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:15,170
the DNS server of your local ISP
provider will resolve that into

143
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,750
some sort of an IP address
that the YouTube has.

144
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,730
And it will make a request, no problems.

145
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:28,830
You do not want that happening, because
your local DNS server will be discovered,

146
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:35,160
and that information can be used in order
to figure out your personal IP address.

147
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,650
And then when that is done, your physical
location is pretty much compromised.

148
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,000
Though that's a no go you
definitely need proxy DNS here.

149
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,200
It might slow you down a bit, but without
it you're practically not anonymous.

150
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,490
It's just a matter of time
before somebody finds you.

151
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,530
If you go down below we have
some other options here,

152
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,240
but we're not really interested
in them at the moment.

153
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,990
What we got here are formats for
entering proxies.

154
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,780
And I'm gonna leave it at that and

155
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,600
then we'll explain the rest
in the follow up tutorial.

156
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:19,980
But, just a key note before you go into
the next tutorial, have a look at these.

157
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,360
You don't need to go on the net or
read anything about it.

158
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,540
Just have a look at the format
here how they are written.

159
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:34,790
This is an example of proxy chains and
how you can write them down.

160
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,440
Not a bad idea would be to figure
out what these last things are here.

161
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,100
S you have a type of proxy,
you have an IP address.

162
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:48,260
Figure out what this number is, what
this name is and what this word here is.

163
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,890
I will of course explain all this in
the next tutorial but just try to

164
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,810
figure it out on your own and then you'll
get the answers, it's pretty simple.

165
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:00,010
In any case I bid you farewell and
I'll see you in the next tutorial.
