00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.166

Okay, so welcome to yet
another tutorial on DOS attacks, and



2

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:08.519

this time we're gonna
be combining two tools.



3

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.702

We're gonna use SlowLoris.pl.



4

00:00:11.702 --> 00:00:18.419

It's basically a pro script, and we're
gonna be using Nmap to actually conduct



5

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:24.561

a scan of a website in order to determine
whether it's vulnerable or not.



6

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:29.949

Now, this attack is not
perfect by any means.



7

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.810

The more bandwidth you have, the better.



8

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.016

The stronger computer you have,
also the better,



9

00:00:36.016 --> 00:00:38.030

because you'll be able
to make more threads.



10

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.960

Threads means just more
simultaneous tasks.



11

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.135

However, sometimes,
most of the time actually,



12

00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:51.795

if you don't have enough bandwidth,
the site will not be



13

00:00:51.795 --> 00:00:56.845

permanently DOSed, so
users will still be able to access it,



14

00:00:56.845 --> 00:01:02.988

however their loading time will be like
yeah pretty long, a minute or two.



15

00:01:02.988 --> 00:01:06.266

Try putting yourselves in such a position,



16

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:10.962

try thinking about a commercial
site where they sell things and



17

00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:15.922

imagine if all the clients logging
into that server have to wait for



18

00:01:15.922 --> 00:01:19.930

a couple of minutes before
that site actually loads.



19

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.792

How many of you would actually stick
around and wouldn't just go to pretty much



20

00:01:24.792 --> 00:01:28.486

a very similar site,
it sells pretty much the same things.



21

00:01:28.486 --> 00:01:33.509

That's just a fictive scenario and
just trying to prove a point



22

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.841

that you don't need to actually
permanently bring the site down.



23

00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:45.091

You can just render it unusable in
this fashion where users' access time



24

00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:50.490

is extremely long and
basically that site becomes unusable.



25

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.970

So whatever you're loading
it takes a minute or two and



26

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.120

it feels like you're, I don't know
if everybody's going to remember



27

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.380

those ISDN connections or something of a
kind where everything was extremely slow.



28

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.420

Well that's basically how
that website would look like,



29

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.410

when you are performing
this sort of attack.



30

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.686

Anyway, there are a few things
which we need to do here.



31

00:02:16.686 --> 00:02:21.647

And one of those things is that
we need to conduct a scan, so



32

00:02:21.647 --> 00:02:25.615

lets go and
use our Nmap as we have used before.



33

00:02:25.615 --> 00:02:28.253

You see I have the commands
memorized here as I



34

00:02:28.253 --> 00:02:32.292

have used these things before to test
them out to see how it works out.



35

00:02:32.292 --> 00:02:34.074

So, I have nmap.



36

00:02:34.074 --> 00:02:41.290

I'm telling Nmap to use a particular
script for this purpose parallels 400.



37

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.790

And I am giving it an IP
address that I wish to scan for



38

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.340

this particular vulnerability.



39

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.470

I've also issued the double
verbose output in order for



40

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.950

Nmap to actually tell me what is going on,
what it is doing.



41

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.094

On Nmap website,
let me just go ahead and do this.



42

00:03:05.094 --> 00:03:09.882

Excellent, so this is the site
where you can find all the scripts.



43

00:03:09.882 --> 00:03:15.180

I have shown you this before in the
previous tutorials that have label endmap



44

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.230

or something of a kind where we've
dwelt on the chapter Footprinting and



45

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.730

seen how we can actually scan
the servers for vulnerabilities.



46

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.808

Remember how I told you that you can
find the scripts here on their website?



47

00:03:29.808 --> 00:03:33.600

Well, you can also find categories and
what every script does.



48

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.268

I've also mentioned that as well.



49

00:03:35.268 --> 00:03:37.610

What we want is to click on DOS,
so denial of service.



50

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.090

These particular scripts will scan for
those particular vulnerabilities.



51

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.885

They will scan for
vulnerabilities related to DOS attacks.



52

00:03:50.977 --> 00:03:55.971

And we have, I dunno, broadcast of avahi
DOS to discover hosts and local networks.



53

00:03:55.971 --> 00:04:00.960

So we're not really that interested
in local networks at the moment.



54

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.235

I've dealt a lot with that on wireless and



55

00:04:03.235 --> 00:04:05.900

how you can actually
perform a DOS attack there.



56

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.970

We want this one, http-slowloris.



57

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.780

Web server for vulnerability to the slow
loris dos attack by launching that



58

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.780

particular type of an attack.



59

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.890

There are also other ones.



60

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.122

Feel free to actually try
them out on your own systems,



61

00:04:25.122 --> 00:04:28.419

and see how that works out for you,



62

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:34.244

what different types of attacks
will actually work for you.



63

00:04:34.244 --> 00:04:38.246

Anyway, we want this one for
web servers, and



64

00:04:38.246 --> 00:04:43.183

in order to be able to DOS a website or
something of a kind.



65

00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:48.130

So I'm just going to go ahead and
use it here you see script http-slowloris.



66

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.956

Press enter, and
let the scan run its course.



67

00:04:53.956 --> 00:04:58.222

The scan can take quite
a bit of your time.



68

00:04:58.222 --> 00:05:00.579

Why I don't know.



69

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:01.454

It's in LAN.



70

00:05:01.454 --> 00:05:04.673

It should be a bit faster,
but apparently it's not.



71

00:05:04.673 --> 00:05:07.849

Over internet it's bound
to be slower than this, so



72

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.544

don't just think it doesn't work or
something of the kind.



73

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:16.707

It does work, but if you're doing this
online it might take a while longer.



74

00:05:16.707 --> 00:05:20.442

In LAN, I really thought it was faster but



75

00:05:20.442 --> 00:05:25.261

apparently this is the speed
at which it progresses.



76

00:05:25.261 --> 00:05:32.150

Anyway, you have all the standard
stuff that you would usually have.



77

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.499

And down below,
it says Completed SYN Stealth Scan.



78

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.480

Excellent.
So that's just the normal stuff.



79

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.740

Down below, you have NSE: Script scanning.



80

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.682

Only after it has conducted its regular
scan does it begin the NSE: Script scan,



81

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:51.371

the script which we have
actually passed and



82

00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:54.930

the script which we want to
utilize in order to figure out,



83

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.661

is the server actually vulnerable
to this type of an attack.



84

00:05:58.661 --> 00:06:02.616

You have a separate timer for
the NSE script and



85

00:06:02.616 --> 00:06:07.500

the separate percentage done for
NSE script as well.



86

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.660

So it says here the current time and
this is the remaining time.



87

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.580

I'm sorry this is not the current time,



88

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.380

this estimated time to completion,
something of a kind.



89

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.090

It doesn't matter,
you don't have to pay attention to this.



90

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.456

This is the important part.



91

00:06:24.456 --> 00:06:27.866

It says two minutes and forty-one
seconds remaining, one minute and



92

00:06:27.866 --> 00:06:29.500

fifty-one seconds remaining.



93

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.537

It's gonna keep on issuing
them until its task is done.



94

00:06:34.537 --> 00:06:40.648

Once that is done, we will know whether
the server is vulnerable or not.



95

00:06:40.648 --> 00:06:44.380

These routers, they tend to be vulnerable,
I mean, to a ton load of things.



96

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.010

I had a bit of an awkward experience.



97

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.971

Just goes to show that you should never
really move away from your computer while



98

00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:53.856

it's unlocked.



99

00:06:53.856 --> 00:06:58.428

My friends, they took my IP address and,
because the home routers are not



100

00:06:58.428 --> 00:07:03.251

really that good in terms of protection,
so they were dossing me basically.



101

00:07:03.251 --> 00:07:06.559

Of course, I can avoid it quite easily
by just changing the IP address,



102

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:09.900

turning the router on and
off pretty much will do the trick.



103

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.730

There are other ways.



104

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.955

But I couldn't figure out for about five,



105

00:07:14.955 --> 00:07:17.230

ten minutes,
I couldn't figure out what was going on.



106

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.915

I didn't figure it out anyway because one
of the first things that people do when



107

00:07:20.915 --> 00:07:24.500

something is wrong with their internet
connection, they reset the router.



108

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.436

That's what I did and of course the IP
address changed so the DOS attack stopped.



109

00:07:28.436 --> 00:07:33.424

Only later on did they actually tell
me that they were messing around with



110

00:07:33.424 --> 00:07:34.579

me a little bit.



111

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:35.134

Anyway.



112

00:07:37.543 --> 00:07:39.220

The scan has completed.



113

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.920

It says probably vulnerable.



114

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.709

So let's see what we can do.



115

00:07:44.709 --> 00:07:48.962

You can go ahead and clear the screen
here, unless you have a 100 clients, or



116

00:07:48.962 --> 00:07:51.565

more than one client here
that you have scanned,



117

00:07:51.565 --> 00:07:55.205

then you want to redirect this to
a file as I have showed previously.



118

00:07:55.205 --> 00:07:59.195

So, go ahead and clear the screen.



119

00:07:59.195 --> 00:08:01.981

[COUGH] In the follow-up tutorial.



120

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:06.061

Sorry for the cough,
something just got into my throat.



121

00:08:06.061 --> 00:08:09.948

But in the follow up tutorial,
we will actually go ahead and



122

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:11.815

download the PERL script and



123

00:08:11.815 --> 00:08:17.470

see how we can actually utilize it in
order to actually perform this attack.



124

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.430

Until then I bid you farewell.
