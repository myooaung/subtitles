00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,020
Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:08,000
Today we will be importing custom chains of proxies.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now I have done literally no prep work for this, deliberately

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
because I want to see if I encounter any problems

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
by doing just the first time around on Kali Linux

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,100
and if I do, I want to resolve it together with you

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,800
because if I encounter them, chances are that you will encounter them as well.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,179
So automatically you will know how to solve them

9
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:33,600
but I don't predict any special problems there.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,000
This should fairly straightforward.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So let's just go and type in "Free socks5 proxies"

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,300
and see if we can find any for ourselves.

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,489
So "Socks Proxy -- Free Socks5 and Socks4 Proxy List"

14
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:55,600
Let's see what this website has to offer.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,460
Excellent

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,100
So we have a lot of these things here that we can use

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,000
Anonymity, anonymous

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,240
I suppose they all claim that they're anonymous

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,500
but that's really questionable.

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,700
Generally you want to be using proxies in countries

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,600
that have a good reputation for not airing your private browsing information

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,100
or something like that

23
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,680
So, the countries that do have a good reputation with that...

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,420
Well, China doesn't share much with anybody else

25
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,579
Russia doesn't do that either

26
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:33,700
There's Netherlands as well

27
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,300
If they have Netherlands here, that would be awesome

28
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,200
because Netherlands has fantastic privacy policies

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,800
in terms of information.

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,290
In terms of personal user information

31
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,200
and Germany's also not bad.

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,000
So those are some the countries which you can use that are fantastic

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
in terms of privacy

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,600
They will not share your traffic with pretty much anyone

35
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,700
or so they say

36
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,000
or so they claim

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Who will you trust is completely up to you

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,599
but again, it doesn't really matter that much to you

39
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:11,400
primarily because most of the work that we're doing here

40
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,690
or should I say, all the work that we're
doing here is white hat

41
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,500
and all of it is legal.

42
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,550
So you can use any of these to simulate a real attack

43
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:26,200
and even if you can reverse tracks

44
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,700
and find yourself, it's still okay

45
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,700
as long as you are using some sort of proxy to give real time circumstances

46
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,690
and encounter real time problems.

47
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,000
Also to circumvent firewalls and so on

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,500
because if you want to see Netflix or something like that

49
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,800
you will need a proxy in the United States

50
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,860
Most likely won't be able to do from the proxy

51
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,300
or you will be, but you will need a really good one

52
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,500
rather instead, you will need a VPN.

53
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,120
Anyway, without further adieu, you have an IP address here

54
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,200
which we will need.

55
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,000
You have a port number here

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,200
We won't need this

57
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
We won't need this

58
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,620
and we will need a version.

59
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,400
So we'll need version.

60
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,900
Okay, they are multiple pages for this.

61
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:14,600
So actually, let's see if there are any proxies from Netherlands.

62
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,400
Nope, Netherlands is not even listed here.

63
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,600
Okay, nevermind

64
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm sure that it does exist on some other websites.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,360
I have seen them and I'm inclined to use them

66
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,200
primarily because they're good policies

67
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,000
but for our purpose today, it's truly irrelevant

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So let's just go ahead and select the first five from the list.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,630
So I need to copy this

70
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,600
open up my terminal

71
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,700
and let's just make our screen convenient

72
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,500
so we can do a ton load of copy/pasting.

73
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,860
There we go

74
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,810
Just do this, and let's grab the Firefox browser.

75
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,000
Just expanded it accordingly.

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Excellent

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,200
So I have everything that I need.

78
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,200
I have port number version and the IP address.

79
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,000
I need to expand the terminal a little bit to gain on size.

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,200
Excellent

81
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,510
Clear the screen for any inconveniences

82
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:24,200
nano /etc/proxychains.conf

83
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,400
Make sure that dynamic is selected

84
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,000
and that everything else is commented out.

85
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,150
Go scroll down to the bottom

86
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,500
and let's go

87
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,570
Now we need to specify our proxy chains.

88
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,000
Go ahead and start typing.

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,400
Anything special we need to know here?

90
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,800
Nope, it doesn't specify anything special.

91
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Let's just go ahead and type in...

92
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
You don't need to use capital letters, just so you know

93
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,000
So "Socks5"

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,770
and paste the IP address.

95
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,180
Bit of a longer IP address.

96
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,400
Let's go ahead and and tabs here to be on the safe side

97
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,000
so that all is neatly done and sorted.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So it's 33169

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,700
Press ENTER

100
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,000
So Socks5

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,200
What is the next one?

102
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,980
The next one is 94.180.123.34

103
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,800
and the port number is 1080

104
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,540
Let's take the next one.

105
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,620
We just need do this a bit faster.

106
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,700
So Socks...

107
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,000
Oops sorry, this one is actually Socks4

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and the next one is actually socks5

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,400
As you can see, it's a fairly simple process.

110
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,220
I mean, there's nothing really special that you need to do here.

111
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,000
Just create a list, which you will end up using

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I can assure you that more than half of these proxies do not work.

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,510
Not because I can see some information screen that you can

114
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,860
but rather instead, because I had experiences with such proxies

115
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,600
and they generally do not tend to work

116
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,000
but enough of them works for you to be able to anonymize yourself

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
to a good extent.

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,580
So next one is 18060

119
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,620
Make sure you get the ports right, because if you get a wrong port

120
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,500
your connections will be dropped by default on that IP address

121
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,539
and you'll think the proxy is malfunctioning or something like that

122
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,000
but it's not

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,729
it's just you typing in a wrong port

124
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:59,000
So again, we have Socks5

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,919
IP address here

126
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:04,000
What is the port number? 1080 again

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,200
You will see that some port numbers have been standardized

128
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,600
and they are just rolling, they're repeating

129
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,300
You don't need to do that much thinking there

130
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,000
Press ENTER

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,200
I just wanna separate them from these

132
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,000
and let's go ahead...

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,430
Oops, sorry

134
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,000
I can just save it. It doesn't matter.

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,460
Nope, I don't want the different name

136
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,800
Excellent

137
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,600
Messed up the name

138
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,000
Okay, so let's exit nano

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,800
Expand our beloved terminal

140
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,700
The holy grail of power

141
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,780
Type in pretty much the same thing as we typed in the previous tutorials

142
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:58,800
"proxychains firefox www.duckduckgo.com"

143
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,500
So just keep in mind that you can type in any URL here

144
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,300
and as long as it's valid, it will open it.

145
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,200
So just go ahead and see what happens.

146
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,400
Press ENTER

147
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,800
Nothing...Literally nothing

148
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,060
What happened? It didn't even start proxy chains with it.

149
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,810
Why not? Well, you need to close the browser first.

150
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,080
We unfortunately had this list open

151
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,000
that continuously keeps changing as well.

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,600
That's a problem, because you cannot have Firefox open

153
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,200
and then start it again through proxy chains.

154
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,810
You need to close it completely.

155
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,400
Make sure that it is completely closed.

156
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,080
I can see nothing in my working menu down there

157
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,500
down at the bottom of the screen

158
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,990
and let's try again.

159
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,300
Same thing

160
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,400
See, now it's taking a bit longer.

161
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,500
As soon as you see that something flies through with proxy chains

162
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,800
using proxies that's really fast

163
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,000
you know that something is wrong

164
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
because there's no way it's gonna be fast.

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,200
So do we got here?

166
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,050
Timeout

167
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,500
Timeout again

168
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,490
We have timeouts

169
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,890
and it's a dynamic chain, so it's trying to so through all of them

170
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,550
but it's skipping those that are not functional.

171
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:16,000
At the beginning stages, a long time ago

172
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,130
I was like "I'm gonna use 50 proxies and I'm gonna be completely anonymous!"

173
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,300
No no

174
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,490
I wasn't even able to load the basic of sites

175
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,070
or issue even the basic of requests for that.

176
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,000
You need to keep it low in terms of proxies, depending on their speed

177
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,600
Excellent

178
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,200
So hopefully one of them is going to pass

179
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
and one of them is going to work.

180
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,970
This is one way of looking at it and trying to figure it out.

181
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:47,800
Another way is just looking at the screen and see what's happening here.

182
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,000
So I'm just waiting for at least one of them...

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,900
Yep, there we go.

184
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,640
One of them said "OK"

185
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,200
but it needs to go and try all the others out as well

186
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,230
before it can actually verify

187
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,000
what is it that's going to use in order to open this side up.

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,400
Hopefully it's not gonna take too much time.

189
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,600
So you see, we have all of these timeouts

190
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,000
and only one of them was okay.

191
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,580
Which one was okay?

192
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,500
[DNS response] duckduckgo.com

193
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,800
There we go. It should be open now.

194
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,300
No, it is not.

195
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,000
This was just an DNS response.

196
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,900
Does not exist...hmm, have I mistyped this?

197
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,920
duckduckgo...No, I don't believe I have.

198
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,600
Okay, it's formulating a request again through different series.

199
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,000
Come on, please succeed

200
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Excellent

201
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
This one didn't succeed

202
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,300
Well, now it has

203
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:51,070
[DNS response] www.duckduckgo.com is 50.18.192.250

204
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,000
Have you opened it? Please tell me you have.

205
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,800
No you have not

206
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,690
Okay, we gotta wait a bit longer

207
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,500
and this is the sad reality of using proxies.

208
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,900
If I had used one or two, this would have been a lot simpler

209
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,800
but I just wanted to make a point here

210
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,000
and show you you're not going to get anywhere

211
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,800
if you're using a lot of free proxies

212
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,200
and imagine scanning like a hundred hosts using proxy chains like this

213
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,800
and this would be the amount of time that it would take

214
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,200
to even load a basic website.

215
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,000
Imagine how long a scan would take.

216
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,900
It would take forever.

217
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,770
Okay, so finally it is requesting information on port 443

218
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,000
As you can see, all of the above communication

219
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
was attempting to get a response from DNS server.

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We still haven't even...

221
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Look, this is how much information has been processed

222
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:52,300
before we even started to load duckduckgo.com

223
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:58,000
As you can see by the port names, the 53 are DNS ports

224
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,400
and we go down below, you can see that finally

225
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm looking for port 443 somewhere around here.

226
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,360
I swear I saw it moment ago

227
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,380
1080 -- That's a proxy port

228
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,500
This is a proxy port as well

229
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,200
53 again

230
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,000
DNS resolution port

231
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,800
Yep, there we go!

232
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,070
443 has begun here.

233
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,200
It's still loading it

234
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
I wonder has it opened it?

235
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,800
Yep, there we go.

236
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,780
It is up and running.

237
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,700
The site is functional

238
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:39,200
but it has taken us a lot of time to open it, using a lot of free proxies.

239
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
So stick to two or three at max

240
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,600
and it should work

241
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,550
and stick with the ones that have the best reviews

242
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,200
and so on.

243
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,800
Stick with the ones that have the greatest up time as well.

244
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,960
That's one of the routes you can take.

245
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,720
In any case, I bid you farewell

246
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,000
and I hope to see you all in the next tutorial.
