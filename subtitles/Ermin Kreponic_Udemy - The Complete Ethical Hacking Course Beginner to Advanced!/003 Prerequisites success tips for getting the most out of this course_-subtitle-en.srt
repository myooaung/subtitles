00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everybody and welcome to this
tutorial.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,299
Today we'll be talking the prerequisites that you require

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,900
if you if you want to follow this course through.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:17,200
One of the first things that you need to be familiarized with

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,650
is your working environment.

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,400
So for myself, I have chosen to use two Linux distros.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,900
One will be Fedora 20, which is my

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,100
which is the operating system that I'm using.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,000
Anyway

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,600
and also I will install a virtual machine.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,000
That virtual machine will be Kali Linux.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,300
Basically, it is a Linux distro

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,800
which contains a great deal of pen testing tools.

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,680
So it's very useful in that sense.

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,100
Don't worry about it

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,800
I will explain this process in great detail

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,800
How you can set the virtual machine up

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
how you can install it

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,200
and so on and so forth.

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,600
However, should you be using Windows

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,900
that is definitely not advisable for this kind of activity.

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,200
Primarily because you will

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,940
I mean, since I'm doing this in an environment that I own

24
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,800
it doesn't really matter to me if I'm anonymous or not

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,000
but in the real world

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,500
all the pen testing that is done in the real world

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,200
You're always trying to anonymize yourselves.

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,600
You're trying to be as invisible as possible

29
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,100
as much as possible.

30
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,400
You do not want them to figure out where the attack is coming from

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,000
or anything of a kind.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,640
You want wipe your trail or something a
kind

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,700
and Windows is really not good for those
sort of things.

34
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,170
So there your anonymity level will be very
low

35
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,119
and most of tools that we are going to be using

36
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,900
They are native to the Linux environment.

37
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,800
They were made for Linux

38
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,600
So some of them might not work under Windows.

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,300
I have not tested them all out.

40
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,500
but most of them will

41
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,369
So you can still use Windows if you like

42
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:10,770
because you're not hiding from any anyone

43
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,300
but since I'm recreating the real life scenario here

44
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,310
I do need to actually use proxies, VPNs

45
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,300
and so on and so forth

46
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,900
just to show you how it's done

47
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,850
and how you can do it.

48
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,340
Also, for all the Mac users out there

49
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,500
if you're using Mac OS X

50
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,200
doesn't really matter which version.

51
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,100
Most of this stuff should work, like no problems.

52
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,060
The procedures are fairly simpler.

53
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,200
The command line tools are the same

54
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,900
how you install them differs

55
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,200
but pretty much will be able to run the same commands as me.

56
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,400
So there shouldn't be any problems there.

57
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Your anonymity level with Mac OS X

58
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,500
should be both really good

59
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,500
but still, on Linux you have the greatest anonymity

60
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,890
and you are rather safe in that sense.

61
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:09,660
Other than that, you will also require a working internet connection

62
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,730
and even those all of these attacks that we are going to do today

63
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,300
well most of them

64
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,180
they work much MUCH better if you have an extremely fast connection

65
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,100
but some of these attacks are actually
conducted from public wi-fi

66
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,480
in real life anyway.

67
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,000
We'll just pretend

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I will set up a wireless access point in my house and load it

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,780
so that it's similar to the public wi-fi, which is very slow.

70
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,900
Some of these attacks, as I said

71
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,900
they go over public wi-fi

72
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,000
and as we all know and as we've all painfully learned

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,900
public wi-fis are not the fastest internet connections out there.

74
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,640
So primarily because you have a lot of people that are connected to them

75
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,000
and there's a lot of data going through.

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
They're not the safest networks out there either

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,500
but if you want to absolutely anonymize yourself

78
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,400
and that is what some people do.

79
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,400
They actually go out and hook up to a public wi-fi

80
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,480
or they go to a bar, or something of the like

81
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,800
and conduct their attacks from there.

82
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,020
Now before they do that

83
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,900
they need to figure out whether the bandwidth of that wi-fi

84
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,700
can sustain their attacks.

85
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,000
So they need to minimize.

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,200
they need to downsize it

87
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,700
and that is how they become absolutely anonymous.

88
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,000
Anyway, the third thing that you will absolutely need

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,190
so these three things

90
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,200
these are the basic requirements.

91
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,000
Everything else we will pick up on the way.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I will show you how to do it, no problems there

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,400
but these three things, I can't really show you how to

94
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,900
I mean I can, but it's a bit pointless

95
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,500
How to go through your ISP and hook it up to the internet

96
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,100
and hook your telephone through the internet

97
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,700
or something of a kind

98
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:08,700
But in any case, the third prerequisite is a
working wireless card

99
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,500
and when I say "working wireless card"

100
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
most of the devices have them.

101
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,800
Pretty much all laptops from 2005

102
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,090
or from 2008

103
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,600
were standardized with wireless cards.

104
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,300
If you're using desktop machine that doesn't a wireless card

105
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,000
you can

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,020
you should

107
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,600
but however, if you want

108
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,900
you won't be able to follow through a portion of this tutorial then.

109
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,260
You should go out and buy a USB wireless card

110
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,200
or something of a kind.

111
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,400
They're pretty cheap

112
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,780
I don't know. 10 or 15 bucks

113
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,900
So they're not that expensive and you can
get them much anywhere.

114
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,520
Anyway, as I was saying

115
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,900
what I mean by a functional wireless network card

116
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,100
is that it is recognized by your operating system.

117
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,900
So if you are using a Linux distro like I am

118
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,340
you need to make sure

119
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,000
this Linux distro

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
that the kernel of this Linux distro

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
actually has the necessary drivers

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,270
for the wireless card that you are using at the moment.

123
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,300
You're probably using Atheros or Broadcom.

124
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,100
Atheros should be fine.

125
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,010
Pretty much an external support

126
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,800
A large amount of Atheros devices, if not all of them

127
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,040
in terms of network cards, that should be fine.

128
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,000
There were some problems with Broadcom

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,800
but as far as I am informed

130
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,000
that has been solved

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,700
so no big deal there.

132
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,100
If you are uncertain how to check

133
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,900
whether your wireless card functions under Linux distro

134
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,590
just try connecting to a wi-fi.

135
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,550
If you can connect to a wi-fi access point

136
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,300
If you can connect, obviously it works

137
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,070
If you can't, it doesn't work

138
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,300
but don't just hop to a conclusion that it doesn't work.

139
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,100
Maybe it's just turned off or something like that

140
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,350
but do not worry

141
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,500
I will show this in greater detail in the follow-up tutorials

142
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,800
where we actually go over the installation process and all of that.

143
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,100
Now there are a couple more things which we need to go over

144
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,800
before we head over and start the installation.

145
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,750
I would just like to go over some basic terms

146
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,000
and some basic terminology

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,600
that you will need in order to be able to follow this course

148
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,000
and for you to be able to follow the future tutorials.

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,090
In any case, I bid you farewell

150
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:27,930
and I thank you for watching.
