00:00:00.312 --> 00:00:03.092

Hello everybody and
welcome to this tutorial.



2

00:00:03.092 --> 00:00:08.008

Today we're gonna do some
pre-authentication exploitation whereby we



3

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:13.252

will pull the credentials without
actually authenticating with the router.



4

00:00:13.252 --> 00:00:16.919

We're not gonna pull the router's
credentials in this particular case,



5

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:19.790

we're gonna pull some
information on the wireless.



6

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.600

Now, there are some pretty interesting
facts about this method and this approach.



7

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.690

For example, I have seen it used.



8

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.030

Well, I haven't actually
seen it with my own eyes.



9

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.110

I've just read about it on the net.



10

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.670

And I've read the reports.



11

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.790

So basically, here's what people did.



12

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.840

Because there was a vulnerability within
peeling routers, that you can pull



13

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.950

wireless log, wireless credentials,
wireless login keys, provided



14

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.190

of course that you have
the external router IP address.



15

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.830

And now that is the catch, so
how do you get the IP address?



16

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.645

When you are not authenticated
with the service, I mean,



17

00:00:58.645 --> 00:01:00.550

there really is no easy way of doing it.



18

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.602

So what some people came up with, I mean,



19

00:01:03.602 --> 00:01:09.380

this is clearly in the realm of illegal
and you definitely shouldn't do this.



20

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.250

I mean, it's very unlikely that you
will get a permission to do this.



21

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.370

But, you know, rules vary from
one ISP provider to another.



22

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.510

And they did the following.



23

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.180

They basically conducted
a full-wide scan of all the IP



24

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.687

addresses within one country,
and they've basically,



25

00:01:26.687 --> 00:01:31.860

because Nmaps supports scripting, you see
some of those scripts in front of me,



26

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.580

I'm going to clear the screen because I'm
going to show you how to install them.



27

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.090

Because Nmaps supports scripting,



28

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.410

it has allowed them to run one
single automated command and



29

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.750

just let it run there, and
it didn't run for even that long.



30

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.300

It ran for maybe a couple of, not



31

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.070

a couple of hours, but It ran for
a day for sure, something of a kind.



32

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.400

And it scanned one IP address after
another and it would confirm that the IP



33

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.090

address was vulnerable, that the services
running on that IP address were actually



34

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.720

vulnerable, they would be exploited
immediately by Nmap scripts and



35

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.890

credentials would be pulled.



36

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.870

So these scripts ran for
about a day or so.



37

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.740

They had a massive amount
of wireless passwords and



38

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.980

even though they didn't have all of them,



39

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.650

because not everybody within the country
uses the same wireless routers,



40

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.261

most of the routers were
actually vulnerable.



41

00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:40.178

Primarily because firms,
companies that produce routers,



42

00:02:40.178 --> 00:02:44.616

they use very very similar
firmware on similar



43

00:02:44.616 --> 00:02:49.521

routers which are designed for
similar purposes.



44

00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:54.473

For example, for home routers,
you will find that the firmware



45

00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:58.521

from one router to the other
is very similar indeed.



46

00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:01.641

And the same vulnerabilities
usually apply.



47

00:03:01.641 --> 00:03:05.810

Anyway, this doesn't of course
necessarily need to be true.



48

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.180

So they grab this huge amount
of wireless passwords.



49

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.630

Of course they couldn't use all of them.



50

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.820

The idea was that they would manage
to grab wireless password keys



51

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.890

from wireless access points
that were within their range.



52

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.030

So, within the range of their network,
wireless network card.



53

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.590

And they did actually manage to pull
those as well except they pulled



54

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.750

a lot of others as well.



55

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.410

They pulled thousands and
thousands of others as well.



56

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.630

And of course, they've stored
that into a file, one huge file.



57

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.300

And then they began searching.



58

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.730

Searching through the file for ESSIDs.



59

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.380

Of wireless access points around them,



60

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.050

if any of them corresponded to
the ESSIDs within the file.



61

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.121

And of course, they were matches.



62

00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:52.707

And once they found those matches,
they've had wireless passwords for



63

00:03:52.707 --> 00:03:54.821

all of the networks around them.



64

00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:57.990

For all of the wireless
access points around them.



65

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.240

Which was great, it was hilarious,



66

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.010

it was a complete success except
it was completely illegal.



67

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.653

Not sure whether it got caught or not but
it made it into the newspapers or



68

00:04:08.653 --> 00:04:09.901

something of a kind.



69

00:04:09.901 --> 00:04:12.022

So I assume that they have.



70

00:04:12.022 --> 00:04:16.832

Anyway, what we're going to do today is
exactly that, but we're not going to do



71

00:04:16.832 --> 00:04:21.659

anything illegal, I'm not going to do
any mass scanning or anything like that.



72

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:26.040

Whatever I do, I will do within
the confines of my own home network.



73

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.760

But the principle is the same, really.



74

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.307

The only difference is the IP
address that you pass,



75

00:04:31.307 --> 00:04:36.790

although I am definitely not encouraging
you to do this, you could get in serious



76

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.500

trouble by mass scanning, especially
from your home or something of a kind.



77

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.884

Make sure to inquire about
regulations of your ISP provider,



78

00:04:46.884 --> 00:04:50.040

what is permitted and what is not.



79

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.770

Pretty much all the ISP providers
out there will allow scanning,



80

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.180

but they have some regulation
in regard to that scanning.



81

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.760

You either need a permission or you
need to say that you will do it, and so



82

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.830

on and so forth.



83

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.080

So just make sure that you
are acquainted with your local ISP



84

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.570

provider's rules in
regard to the scanning.



85

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.230

You don't need to call anybody or anything
like that if you're uncomfortable with it.



86

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.240

Just go on the net.



87

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.080

These sort of things, they're in the
public domain, they're public information.



88

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.740

So, they will give it to you.



89

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.920

That's not a problem.



90

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.486

They all have these specific rules and



91

00:05:29.486 --> 00:05:34.470

they like when people follow them
through so they're public, and so on.



92

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.455

What I'm trying to tell you is,



93

00:05:35.455 --> 00:05:37.209

make sure that you're not
doing anything illegal here.



94

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:43.629

Anyway, without further ado, let's just go
ahead and start having some fun with Nmap.



95

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:48.117

So first of all I, will be exploiting my
home wireless router, which is set up for



96

00:05:48.117 --> 00:05:49.709

this particular exercise.



97

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:55.029

And I do believe I have a small file
here that I've prepared for myself.



98

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.909

Yep, there we go.



99

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:59.571

So we have one command
down at the bottom and



100

00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:05.290

we have two different file
directories which we're going to use.



101

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:11.070

So anyway, let's go ahead and
give it a shot.



102

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.285

And before we actually do the scan itself,
I wanna show you how



103

00:06:16.285 --> 00:06:22.401

you can install scripts because,
as you can see from this last command,



104

00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:27.670

you have R file equals and
then you have, sorry, not R file.



105

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.578

You have dash, dash, script.



106

00:06:29.578 --> 00:06:33.800

And then http-tplink-dir-traversal.nse.



107

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.350

And then you have arguments for
that particular script.



108

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.990

Anyway, if you don't, you don't need
to actually memorize this long command.



109

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.157

If we just go over to the website,
the Nmap website,



110

00:06:49.157 --> 00:06:55.032

you will see that no matter what script
you actually choose at the bottom,



111

00:06:55.032 --> 00:07:00.280

well, close to the bottom anyway,
you will have example usage.



112

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.680

They've done this in such a fantastic way.



113

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.100

I mean, you don't even need
to think about it that much.



114

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:10.720

You just need to read what
the particular script does.



115

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.500

Once you do that you can literally
just copy/paste this command and



116

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.160

Then in addition to that,
you can just assign a target or targets.



117

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.760

As you will soon see.



118

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.868

But before you can actually
utilize any of these scripts,



119

00:07:22.868 --> 00:07:24.210

you need to know how to install them.



120

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.864

And that can be tricky from time to time
because there isn't exactly a clean way of



121

00:07:28.864 --> 00:07:31.739

doing it, like there is for
example, packages,



122

00:07:31.739 --> 00:07:35.860

which are in the official
repositories that you can pool with.



123

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:41.549

This is a bit more complex, but
nothing too hard, so you see you have,



124

00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:47.830

at the beginning it says download,
http://nmap.org and then scripts.



125

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.810

So just go ahead and
click on that link basically.



126

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.570

Oops, let's do it like this.



127

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.320

So, open link in new tab.



128

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.541

Excellent, so
you have this rather large script here.



129

00:07:58.541 --> 00:08:04.691

Go ahead and Ctrl+A to make sure
that you have selected everything.



130

00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:06.761

Ctrl+C to copy it.



131

00:08:09.061 --> 00:08:10.269

And, well.



132

00:08:10.269 --> 00:08:13.646

Okay, so no problems.



133

00:08:13.646 --> 00:08:15.162

Where is the?



134

00:08:15.162 --> 00:08:15.876

There we go.



135

00:08:15.876 --> 00:08:18.935

And now what you need to do,



136

00:08:18.935 --> 00:08:24.360

is figure out where these
scripts are located.



137

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.434

I am already in the scripts folder but
if I C-D back to root and



138

00:08:27.434 --> 00:08:32.020

clear, I have no idea where the Nmap
scripts are located, but what do I know?



139

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:37.614

I know that the Nmap script
extensions end up with .nse.



140

00:08:37.614 --> 00:08:40.434

So let's just go ahead and
type in the command locate.



141

00:08:40.434 --> 00:08:42.810

Locate, what do you
think this command does?



142

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:43.970

It says locate.



143

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.800

It literally locates the file.



144

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.510

But we're going to use a wild
card argument dot and then nse.



145

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:56.260

What this command means is, Please locate
all files that have an extension of .nse,



146

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:01.792

press enter, and there we go we have
a bunch of them, a lot of them here.



147

00:09:01.792 --> 00:09:03.390

But that's really irrelevant,



148

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:08.540

what we have here is a path to
where these scripts are located.



149

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.484

I'm not gonna use a full path,



150

00:09:12.484 --> 00:09:17.491

I'm gonna zoom in a little bit first and



151

00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:23.106

then go ahead and type in cd/usr/share and



152

00:09:23.106 --> 00:09:27.680

nmap, Enter, Clear, LS, Exon.



153

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.000

So we are here in this Nmap folder,
and we have scripts over here, but



154

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.530

there's also one more thing
which you need to pay attention.



155

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.770

It says nselib.



156

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:44.250

It's right next to the scripts,
right here.



157

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:44.750

It's nselib.



158

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:50.832

And these are the two folders which
will probably be used extensively.



159

00:09:50.832 --> 00:09:53.773

There's also payloads and
so on and so forth.



160

00:09:53.773 --> 00:09:58.643

And we might do this at a different time,
but for the time being let's just focus on



161

00:09:58.643 --> 00:10:02.260

these two and see how these
scripts are actually installed.



162

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:07.680

Let's just go ahead and
clear the screen, cd into scripts ls.



163

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.080

And there we go,
we have a lot of them here.



164

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.710

So, these scripts are all used to
either scan or exploit different types



165

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:21.400

of vulnerabilities depending on
what sort of scripts they are.



166

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:27.030

And, the way you would do it is,
actually, let me just see if I already



167

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:32.104

have this script installed so
I don't do it, like twice over.



168

00:10:32.104 --> 00:10:32.936

Copy.



169

00:10:35.116 --> 00:10:40.050

So LS,
this is one of the ways to confirm it.



170

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.580

And, yes, I actually do.



171

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:49.964

So I can just do cat and then let's
paste it again, press Enter, and



172

00:10:49.964 --> 00:10:55.118

there you go,
you have the entire script listed here.



173

00:10:55.118 --> 00:10:57.419

Pretty much just copy, pasting.



174

00:10:57.419 --> 00:10:57.959

There we go.



175

00:10:57.959 --> 00:11:05.280

It starts from here and just copy,
pasting what we saw in the website, so.



176

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.010

Over here.



177

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:12.150

These two files are exactly the same so
just select everything that is here



178

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:19.440

and copy it into, into the script folder.



179

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:21.810

Clear.



180

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:23.660

So I already have the file.



181

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.400

I already have that script here, but



182

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.460

in case I didn't,
what I would do is type in the following.



183

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.769

I would touch, that's a command.



184

00:11:30.769 --> 00:11:33.849

I'm not gonna touch anything,
obviously, aside from my keyboard.



185

00:11:33.849 --> 00:11:35.149

Type in touch.



186

00:11:35.149 --> 00:11:41.389

And then we would need a name of the file,
so you would just do this.



187

00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:45.189

Apparently, I have created it.



188

00:11:45.189 --> 00:11:49.520

Let me just L-S the same thing.



189

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.570

Okay so it's already there, so
it can't actually create it, no problems.



190

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:59.920

Anyway, you would actually create it or,
you don't even need to use touch.



191

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.970

You can just use nano and
then paste the name,



192

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:07.270

remember that the name needs to remain the
same, and then I would just paste the code



193

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:11.590

from the website into this particular
file, the new file that I would create.



194

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:16.270

So what you need to do is type in nano,
name of the new file that you wish



195

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.430

to create, this one is full obviously,
but I can delete all of this and



196

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:23.700

copy that from the website, and
that would be all that I would need to do.



197

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:28.900

Make sure that the name is as
exactly as it says on the website.



198

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.540

So you can grab the name
of the script from here.



199

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.520

No problems here.



200

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.520

I can just open link in new tab.



201

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:42.710

I have some vone scripts here and
let's just pick



202

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:47.096

the first one, so
this one would be APF copy.



203

00:12:47.096 --> 00:12:50.900

Do I have it here?



204

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:51.400

LS based.



205

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.170

Yep, I even have this one.



206

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.050

I have a vast majority of these scripts,
here.



207

00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.650

So, I don't have any problems with that.



208

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:04.420

But, you will need to manually install
some of them and I've just showed you how.



209

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:09.460

So, just create a file with
the specific name of the script,



210

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:16.240

which you can grab from the site,
and then fill that script up



211

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:21.060

with information that you can find on
the download link at the top of the site.



212

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:21.926

So just Ctrl+A,



213

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:26.270

Ctrl+C and then you would paste it
obviously in the file in the terminal.



214

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.000

That is the way to use it.



215

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.930

Now down at the bottom it says requires.



216

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:37.285

So these are some of the things that it
requires, and you go down into Libraries.



217

00:13:37.285 --> 00:13:39.940

Control+F, vulms, and there you go.



218

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:40.580

It says vulms.



219

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:46.719

That's one of the libraries required,
so let me just go through it.



220

00:13:46.719 --> 00:13:47.659

Yep, there we go.



221

00:13:47.659 --> 00:13:50.770

Source, copyright.



222

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.901

Those are your functions down below.



223

00:13:53.901 --> 00:13:55.112

I'm not interested in that.



224

00:13:55.112 --> 00:13:58.478

Anyway, example of [INAUDIBLE] script.



225

00:13:58.478 --> 00:14:03.060

The following example illustrates,
Illustrates.



226

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.900

There is bound to be a link somewhere.



227

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:10.390

To match different from abilities,
exploit ability



228

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:16.428

table There we go.



229

00:14:16.428 --> 00:14:17.768

Source.



230

00:14:17.768 --> 00:14:19.320

Sorry.
There's no download section here.



231

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:25.160

It just says source, if you click on it,



232

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.160

again, you are given the same screen,



233

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.930

which you can just Ctrl+A to copy and,
no problems there.



234

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.428

Same procedure as with the script,



235

00:14:36.428 --> 00:14:39.935

you just Ctrl+A to copy
everything within this.



236

00:14:39.935 --> 00:14:44.133

You come back, you actually
need to have the same name for



237

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:48.418

this library, and you go ahead and
open up your terminal,



238

00:14:48.418 --> 00:14:53.586

you go out of the scripts because we
don't want to be there, you go LS.



239

00:14:53.586 --> 00:14:54.666

Mm, where is it?



240

00:14:54.666 --> 00:14:58.646

nselib, LS.



241

00:14:58.646 --> 00:15:00.987

And you will basically create it here.



242

00:15:00.987 --> 00:15:03.530

Make sure that the extension has,
let's just go ahead and enter that.



243

00:15:05.296 --> 00:15:10.237

Oh [NOISE] this is not what



244

00:15:10.237 --> 00:15:14.438

I wanted to create,



245

00:15:14.438 --> 00:15:21.117

give me a second here so, nano.



246

00:15:21.117 --> 00:15:25.218

Go back to the website, vulms.lua.



247

00:15:25.218 --> 00:15:28.198

Go back to the terminal, paste.



248

00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:34.470

Oh, okay, so
I already have this one as well.



249

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:37.640

But if I didn't,
I would just paste the code into here and



250

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.410

I would press Ctrl+O to save it.



251

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:40.570

That is all you need to do.



252

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:44.720

There is nothing else, quite literally,
that you would need to do,



253

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.660

it's just a bunch of copy-paste action.



254

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.030

That is all.



255

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:52.277

A lot of these files and a lot of scripts
you will have by default install,



256

00:15:52.277 --> 00:15:53.459

so don't worry about it.



257

00:15:53.459 --> 00:15:58.079

Just in case you need something very
specific, you would actually need



258

00:15:58.079 --> 00:16:02.160

to go on over to their website,
and just copy-paste the code.



259

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.100

That is it.



260

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.890

You don't need to do anything else.



261

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.200

I'll just clear the screen.



262

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:13.330

If you still have some problems with this,
or something of a kind,



263

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:17.800

feel free to address me
in the question section,



264

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.910

I will be more than happy to
help you out any way I can.



265

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:25.080

Anyway, let's employ this last command.



266

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.560

Based and include the script.



267

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:32.640

So it says here target,
my target's gonna be 192.168.0.1.



268

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.922

And this is my wireless router.



269

00:16:34.922 --> 00:16:36.981

Now, I am giving it a LAN address,



270

00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:41.220

but you can give it a external IP
address as well, if you have it.



271

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.420

I don't have Internet.



272

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.756

I don't have access onto
internet from my wireless router,



273

00:16:47.756 --> 00:16:50.000

so I'm using it like this.



274

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.110

Press enter and there we go, we have
a vpa key, oh sorry, a vpa passphrase.



275

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:59.033

A wonderful passphrase,
seriously, like test123456789,



276

00:16:59.033 --> 00:17:02.375

the most original one you will ever see.



277

00:17:02.375 --> 00:17:03.960

ESSID is somewhere in here as well.



278

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.360

Feel free to just go about looking for it.



279

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.900

More importantly WPS default pin is here.



280

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.990

Make sure to grab this,
because if the user changes the password,



281

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.180

you want to know the pin.



282

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.865

You'll want to know the pin because you
can retrieve that password afterwards,



283

00:17:18.865 --> 00:17:24.876

the way I showed you where we
used revert in order to extract



284

00:17:24.876 --> 00:17:31.190

the VPA Password, passphrase,
or a passkey with a PIN.



285

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.280

If you give reaver the default PIN,



286

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.140

it's gonna pull the password no problems,
immediately.



287

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.960

Anyway, I will wrap the tutorial up here.



288

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.256

This is one of the ways in which
you can get the IP addresses.



289

00:17:45.256 --> 00:17:48.144

The VPS2 passkeys.



290

00:17:48.144 --> 00:17:52.020

Aside from the IP address here,
you can type in -il and



291

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.110

then give it a file which
contains a list of IP addresses.



292

00:17:55.110 --> 00:18:02.810

A file which contains a list of IP
addresses would look something like this.



293

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.654

So it would have 192.168.1.



294

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.380

One to two hundred and, actually, 195.



295

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:23.705

So again, 192.168.44 to 98.1.



296

00:18:23.705 --> 00:18:26.810

.1 to, I don't know, 33.



297

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:33.125

So these are the IP ranges which you can
put into this file and then later on,



298

00:18:33.125 --> 00:18:39.740

you can actually pass them to Nmap with
an il command and, just type in test.



299

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:43.800

And the Nmap will actually take
all those IP address ranges and



300

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:48.110

will do exactly the same thing for
every single IP address there.



301

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:51.810

In any case,
I would like to bid you all farewell,



302

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:54.400

and I'll hope to see you
in the next tutorial.
