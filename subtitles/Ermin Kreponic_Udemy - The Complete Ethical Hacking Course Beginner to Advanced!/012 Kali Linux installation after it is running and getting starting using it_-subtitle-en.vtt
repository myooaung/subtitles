00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.000

Hello everybody and welcome to this

tutorial.



2

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.200

I have Kali Linux machine here running.



3

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.400

I have left installation process in the last tutorial



4

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.200

because it was, quite frankly, pointless to just sit there and wait through it



5

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.500

and wait for it to finish



6

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.000

primarily because Kali Linux installation tends to be a bit longer



7

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.900

than the installation of other Linux operating systems



8

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.400

primarily because of the prepackaged tools that come with it.



9

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.710

However, there were a few screenshots that I have made



10

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.469

that some of the options that you were asked



11

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.100

while the installation process was going on



12

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.500

so there were just three of them.



13

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.000

I'm just gonna go ahead and open them up here.



14

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.300

So the first one that happened was that I was asked --



15

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.899

Do you want to use a network mirror



16

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.800

to supplement the software that is included on the cd-rom?



17

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.940

This may also make newer versions of

software available.



18

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.540

I said "no" because I'm gonna do an update



19

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.540

as soon as I finish the installation process



20

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.580

and as soon as I configure everything in

the proper way.



21

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.400

The update is the configuration that I'm going to do, so it doesn't matter.



22

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.000

No I do not want to use any mirrors or anything of the kind.



23

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.600

Just gonna say no



24

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.530

and go ahead and proceed with the installation.



25

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.400

So next up is the GRUB



26

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.200

So GRUB boot loader



27

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.549

It is asking me



28

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.259

"Do you want to install GRUB boot loader to the master boot records?"



29

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.800

Yes I do



30

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.200

Just click on it, as this is the only operating system on this machine



31

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.280

on this computer.



32

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.000

There's nothing that I can mess up by

installing the GRUB boot loader



33

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.800

to the master boot record of the first hard drive



34

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.270

as it is stated here in the instructions.



35

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.100

You can use the GRUB boot loader in order to configure multiple boots



36

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.900

or, I don't know, you can put 3 4 5 operating systems



37

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.800

as many as you like



38

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.400

as many as your hardware can support



39

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.000

not at the same time, of course



40

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000

but at boot time, you will be prompted



41

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.300

and asked "Which operating system do you wish to boot?"



42

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.000

That's also one of the options that you can have with GRUB



43

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.530

but aside from that, just click "Yes" there.



44

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.000

and there's a final one



45

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.220

It's simply states that the installation is complete



46

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.700

and if you had used a CD to complete this installation



47

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.600

or a USB or something of a kind



48

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.000

you will need to remove that media



49

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.900

and reboot the system in order for all of this to function.



50

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.970

So that would be it.



51

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.989

I was asked those three VERY simple questions



52

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.100

You have the answers here.



53

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.500

Just go through them



54

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.160

it will not make a difference in the final account things.



55

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.900

Just gonna go ahead and close this



56

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.000

and now I'm gonna go ahead and log into my Kali Linux virtual machine



57

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.510

So the user name is



58

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.800

this is actually one of the rare occasions



59

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.800

actually this is pretty much the only occasions



60

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.100

where I log into GUI with root.



61

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.200

but as you will soon realize in Kali Linux



62

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.830

everybody just logs in with root



63

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.000

primarily because you are not using Kali Linux to browse web



64

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.980

or something like that.



65

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.000

You are usually using it 99% of time to perform some sort of an attack



66

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.190

and for all those tools, you need to be



67

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.000

pretty much for all those tools, you need to be a root user



68

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.600

or have root privileges.



69

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:53.280

Most the time there's no point to have any other users on a Kali Linux distro



70

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.700

So type in "root"



71

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.660

Press "Enter"



72

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.100

Password was "test"



73

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.900

Press "Enter"



74

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.200

Yours is whatever you appointed it to be



75

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.600

Of course if it's a virtual machine, you don't need to worry that much



76

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.140

but if it's your main machine or something like that



77

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.200

Kali is generally not recommended to be your main desktop machine



78

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.580

That's not a good idea.



79

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.500

Rather run it as a virtual machine.



80

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.060

Okay, so first there are



81

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.000

I need to do a few things, like updates



82

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.919

in order for me to be able to install VirtualBox guest additions



83

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:32.200

so that we may use full screen and that we may use shared clipboard



84

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.860

and so on and so forth.



85

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.940

Just go ahead and change this.



86

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.350

Open up my terminal and set the view.



87

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.400

This is non-technical stuff that you can do this you can configure anyway



88

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.000

This you can configure anyway you like.



89

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.169

I'm just zooming it in for the purposes of tutorial



90

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.270

so that you may see it better



91

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.500

but before we can do updates



92

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.000

before we can do ANYTHING



93

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.860

we must verify that we have connectivity to the internet.



94

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.860

Here we go.



95

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.669

Nothing is happening, so I cannot ping yahoo.com



96

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.740

meaning that I don't have exit to the

external network.



97

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.000

I cannot a access the internet.



98

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.580

That's a pretty big problem because 

pretty much whatever we do



99

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.139

we will need internet connectivity for it



100

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.320

in order to download packets from the repositories, to perform updates



101

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.600

and to conduct scans



102

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.800

possible scans



103

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.100

and so on and so forth.



104

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.870

So just go ahead and click on "Devices"



105

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.800

Find network



106

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.919

Network Settings



107

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.200

and here you can see by default, it will be set to NAT



108

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.979

but you don't want the NAT, you want "Bridged Adapter"



109

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.700

and you want to choose your adapter here.



110

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.419

Mine is p8p1



111

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:53.000

See what yours is and click "Allow VMs"



112

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.900

Virtual machines



113

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.000

So okay, if you don't know what the adapter on your machine is



114

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000

and you are using a Linux system



115

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000

just go ahead, open up your terminal



116

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.309

and type in "ifconfig"



117

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:12.900

Here you will be able to see a listing of adapters that you have.



118

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.400

So you have lo, which is loopback.



119

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.000

You have p8p1, which is my ethernet connection



120

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.100

This is for some virtual machines as well



121

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.000

and I have wlp2s0 which is my wireless interface



122

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000

So I know that for a fact I'm using p8p1



123

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.919

primarily because my network manager tells me that I am.



124

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:33.000

You see connected to p8p1.



125

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.700

This is also a better way of actually checking what you are connected to



126

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.300

and which adapter you are using.



127

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.500

So just open up your network manager in the upper right corner



128

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.000

and look at p8p1 -- It says "connected"



129

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.300

Your network manager's position can vary



130

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.300

depending on how you've configured your system.



131

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.500

By default it will be in the bottom right corner



132

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.800

but that is easy enough to find either way.



133

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.129

Let's just go ahead and close this terminal



134

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:05.800

now that we have actually configured our network.



135

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.400

Have we? Yes we have.



136

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.900

but still, I'm pretty sure I won't have internet connectivity.



137

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.339

Let me just try ping again



138

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:14.800

and you see it is simply not working.



139

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.079

So there is a problem once again.



140

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:20.500

So let's just go ahead and check the Kali Linux network manager



141

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.100

and it says "Wired network but device not managed"



142

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.200

That could be a problem



143

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.500

and that is a general problem which you will face with wired interfaces.



144

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.000

Pretty much all the time.



145

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.400

There's a relatively easy fix to it.



146

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.100

You just navigate over in the terminal



147

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.600

You type in "cd", which stands for "change directory"



148

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.419

to "etc network manager"



149

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:43.700

Let's see what's in it.



150

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.400

Excellent



151

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.900

We have NetworkManager.conf



152

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.400

I'm gonna go ahead and type in "nano"



153

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.300

which is the text editor that I am going to be using



154

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.600

and then type in NetworkManager.conf



155

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.380

Press "Enter"



156

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:00.800

There we go.



157

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.569

It opens up the configuration file.



158

00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:05.400

You do need to be root in order to make any changes here.



159

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.800

It says "main, "plugins", "ifupdown", "keyfile"



160

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.900

"ifupdown", "managed=false"



161

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.700

So where it says "false" , just delete this and type in "true"



162

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.500

Control O to save



163

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.100

Press "Enter"



164

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.000

Control X to exit



165

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.600

Now we need to actually restart our network managers.



166

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.000

So just go ahead and type in "service network"



167

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.300

There we go.



168

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:38.000

"network manager restart"



169

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.500

Stopping and starting.



170

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.900

Excellent



171

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:42.900

Connection established



172

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.700

You are now connected to ifupdown (ath0)



173

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.220

Let's check the connectivity



174

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:53.400

So ping yahoo.com



175

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.200

Excellent



176

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.140

So now we have internet connectivity



177

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.900

and pay attention to the steps here.



178

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.800

They're quite important because



179

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.700

not so much for the ethical hacking part



180

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.200

as they are to actually setting up the environment



181

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.600

because setting up the environment itself can be troublesome.



182

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.000

You can encounter multiple problems, bugs, etc.



183

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.010

and instead of having to go from one forum to the other



184

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.300

trying to find a solution, you can just

go through this tutorial



185

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.450

just pay a bit of attention



186

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:27.300

and I will show you pretty much how to

resolve pretty much all the issues



187

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.400

that you might encounter



188

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.700

because I myself am doing



189

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.380

I have done a fresh install here



190

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.360

and I would be encountering the same

problems that anybody else would



191

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.000

and I would like to go over them



192

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.100

because more likely than not, if you are performing a virtual machine installation



193

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.400

you will encounter similar problems as I have.



194

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.720

Although should you encounter any other problems



195

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.000

please feel free to pose questions



196

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.900

and I will be more than happy to provide any answers that I can.



197

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.360

So let's just go ahead and clear the screen



198

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.390

and now that we have internet connectivity



199

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:10.100

I would like to perform some updates, which are necessary.



200

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.900

Believe me, you need to perform regular updates of the system



201

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:19.800

because you will find that certain things will not work after a while



202

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.500

So let me just change directory



203

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.700

Clear the screen again



204

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.900

Type in "apt-get"



205

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.220

"update"



206

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.700

So I could do this with one command in

Fedora



207

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.000

but here I'm gonna need two of them.



208

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.900

So it's picking up things from the repositories.



209

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:35.600

Excellent



210

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.810

Now I need to type in "apt-get"



211

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.000

"upgrade"



212

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.200

Press



213

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.400

and you see it says



214

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:48.600

"After this operation, 73.7 MB of additional disk space will be used"



215

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.000

This is this last sentence here that I am marking



216

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.700

and that is quite a bit, in terms of updates.



217

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.300

I mean, look at all the packages.



218

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.800

These are all the packages that are to be updated.



219

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.000

List goes on and on



220

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.200

Well, there you go.



221

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.100

It starts from here and it doesn't end anytime soon



222

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.250

It goes all the way down.



223

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.800

So anyway, just type in "yes"



224

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.700

You don't actually need to type in capital Y.



225

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.700

You just type in "y"



226

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.450

Press 'Enter"



227

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.500

and the update process will start.



228

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.980

Now depending on your internet connection



229

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.860

this might take shorter or longer amounts of time.



230

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.330

I will end this tutorial here



231

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.000

until the updates actually finish



232

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.810

because I don't want to be standing here in front of the screen



233

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:38.000

but in any case, these updates will finish until the end.



234

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.500

You're not gonna be posed any questions at a certain point of time



235

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.600

during the update process.



236

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.070

You might be notified of some things.



237

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.400

A screen might pop with some texts.



238

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.860

That's perfectly fine



239

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.000

You can read through it and then close it.



240

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.060

Those are "Read Me" files



241

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:57.000

specifying the characteristics of certain packages



242

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.300

and what has been upgraded



243

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.070

but don't go about just reading it there.



244

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.800

You can close it later on, if you wish



245

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.700

You can do further exploration



246

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.900

and actually discover what each of these packages contains.



247

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.700

In any case, we will continue this process in the follow up tutorial.



248

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.900

Until then, I bid you all farewell.
