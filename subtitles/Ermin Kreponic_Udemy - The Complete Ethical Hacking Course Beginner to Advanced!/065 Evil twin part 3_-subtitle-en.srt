1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,480
Welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,000
Today I am gonna finish
up with this section.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,360
I will show you how you can actually
monitor all traffic that goes on

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:18,560
the cloned network that you have set up
on your laptop or desktop, or whatever.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,520
Anyway, why is this important?

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,960
Well, first of all,
don't get your hopes up too high.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,690
Because you won't be able
to actually get passwords,

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,570
or user credentials,
by just listening to traffic.

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,650
You can, if they are not using
any encrypted protocols, but

10
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,560
if they are using HTTPS,
you can forget about it there.

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,380
That's gonna be too difficult.

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,500
I mean, there are some methods
that are experimental today, but

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,370
I haven't really included them here
as they are still experimental.

14
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:51,080
If you just go back a tutorial or
two you have an option of SSL strip.

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,200
So you will be able to rid
yourself of that encryption and

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,960
read the credentials in clear text
without any problems whatsoever.

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,940
It doesn't always work with all
browsers and all websites, but

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:09,490
like 90% of the time,
it will work without any bigger problems.

19
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,830
Now, why then you might ask yourselves,
why would we do this?

20
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:20,480
Well, you are able to see who is
browsing what sort of content.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,225
You are able to see who is logging
into the back ends of the web servers.

22
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:29,150
You're able to see if somebody is
using official email, or any email for

23
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:29,900
that matter.

24
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,660
And you are able to see who is using
which type of services on the net.

25
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,750
And in such a way will be able to pick
your target in a relatively easy fashion,

26
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,460
you will see who has what.

27
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,886
And okay, I need this, so let's go for it.

28
00:01:46,886 --> 00:01:52,390
Anyway, this is not the only
reason why we have accessed it,

29
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,010
why we have created an evil twin.

30
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,610
We can use it for other purposes,

31
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,720
such as a DNS change of the DNS
servers and the router.

32
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,130
And, as I have stated previously, that's
gonna enable us to do some wonderful

33
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:12,930
social engineering whereby we
will be able to take user names,

34
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,900
passwords, user credentials in general,
without any bigger difficulties.

35
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,550
But for the time being, let's just
see how is traffic actually analyzed.

36
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,020
Let me just go ahead and
clear the screen here.

37
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,980
Zoom it in, move it here.

38
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,450
For this purpose we will,
of course, need a tool.

39
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,180
With which we can actually
listen to traffic.

40
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,360
And that tool is called Wireshark.

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,010
That's one of many,
there are others out there.

42
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,720
Wireshark is the most used one.

43
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,090
I would definitely recommend it,

44
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,840
but if you don't feel like it just go on
the net and see what else is out there.

45
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,290
Now it's pretty simple, it comes with
a pretty simple installation method.

46
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,360
So, yum search wireshark, and
it should pop up here somewhere.

47
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:02,890
You need to install two packages,
It will enable you to listen

48
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,790
to pretty much all traffic that goes
through your network without any problems.

49
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,560
However, as I said before,

50
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,060
you won't be able to take
passwords from encrypted traffic.

51
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,780
Moreover, Wireshark is, I mean,
that's a course for itself and

52
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,900
its rather lengthy, there are a lot of
options, it's a pretty sophisticated tool.

53
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,020
I won't go through all of
the options today, but

54
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,720
I will show you some of the basics and

55
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,820
how you can actually monitor traffic based
upon the information that I give you.

56
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,890
So you will need this package
here that I am selecting, and

57
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,310
you will need the bottom one.

58
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,940
Hopefully by now, you know how to install.

59
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,510
It's, yum, space, install space,
the name of the package, space -y.

60
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,950
So you wouldn't be prompted for
any questions, and

61
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,770
it would install it without any problems.

62
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:55,680
Now I have Wireshark
running here somewhere.

63
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,750
Yep, there we go.

64
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,640
Now I have opened it, and

65
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,930
here you can take a pick from the list of
interfaces on which you wish to listen.

66
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,490
Our interface is of course Evil,
and that is

67
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,140
what we want to listen to all
the traffic that goes on it.

68
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,870
Now there isn't much traffic here,

69
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,560
primarily because there
isn't much that is going on.

70
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,220
But you can see immediately there are some
basic packets that are going through.

71
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,480
And let me just see if I can
browse something on my phone, or

72
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,620
something of that kind.

73
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,440
This is just router communication.

74
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,510
So let's go over to Firefox over here.

75
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,802
I've just literally opening up
a website on my phone, and that is it.

76
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:48,990
You can see that immediately the amount
of traffic is jumping insanely.

77
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,060
Look at how much of it there is.

78
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,990
So all this traffic is
generated basically,

79
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,460
well most of this traffic is
generated by one single device.

80
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,050
And I'm gonna go ahead and

81
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,730
stop the capture here because I
am no longer interested in this.

82
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,970
Over here you can see the queries.

83
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:15,062
And here you can actually see
the URL from time to time.

84
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:18,710
The URL is a small piece of all of this.

85
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,150
But I'm not sure if I can find
it now as there is a lot of it.

86
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:26,215
Look, here's one that says,
standard query response,

87
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:30,805
safebrowsing.cache.l.google.com.

88
00:05:30,805 --> 00:05:35,424
And you can see the IP address
that was accessed from

89
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:38,868
which I do believe the response came.

90
00:05:38,868 --> 00:05:41,940
Anyway, again we have
something related to Google.

91
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,890
Again, I don't have a browser open.

92
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,760
There is literally no traffic going on,
on my network here.

93
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:58,836
However, there is traffic that is
being generated from my phone.

94
00:05:58,836 --> 00:06:00,558
Or, yeah, there we go.

95
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:02,788
And this is www.google.ba.

96
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:08,120
You see here, you have the URL
here that is being accessed.

97
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,010
And you can see that,
that has been requested here.

98
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,110
If I just double-click on it,
if I open it,

99
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:21,012
I'm gonna get a listing of pretty
detailed information here.

100
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:23,470
So, domain name, if I just click on it,

101
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,360
there's some sort of information here,
not very useful to you at the time.

102
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,290
But you can just go down to queries,
and you can see the URL.

103
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:38,610
That is probably the most important thing
for you at this particular point in time.

104
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,930
This is how you can actually
see who is browsing for what.

105
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,400
Who wants what, who is going where.

106
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,680
Not a bad idea, pretty good thing to do,
especially because you can, as I said

107
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,190
before, you can actually pick the targets,
and you can see the IP addresses here.

108
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:03,550
I mean, you can see which IP
address has requested which site.

109
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,400
So this first colon that
you are looking at now.

110
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,840
Sorry, not the first colon,
where it says source.

111
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,680
So source, IP addresses, and then you have
the next one is destination IP addresses.

112
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,142
I'm clicking on the two of them.

113
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:26,092
So if you take a look at the top right
corner, it says 192, the grey one.

114
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:32,099
It says 192.168.1.101, and
then there is destination,

115
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:35,948
which is 173.194.116.225.

116
00:07:35,948 --> 00:07:43,426
So, the device with this first
IP address,192.168.1.101,

117
00:07:43,426 --> 00:07:48,154
has requested something from
the destination IP address,

118
00:07:48,154 --> 00:07:51,510
173.194.116.225.

119
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:55,190
There was a communication in
between these two IP addresses.

120
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,990
Now that can be different
sorts of traffic.

121
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,530
And for the time being,
you can disregard most of this.

122
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,812
What you are interested in are those URLs.

123
00:08:04,812 --> 00:08:08,850
To see what sort of information
are people browsing, and

124
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,390
you can see and get the addresses.

125
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:16,400
For example, if they're logging into their
company's servers that have an external

126
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,300
IP address, you can actually see it here
in the destination IP addresses part.

127
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:28,610
And in such a way you can go ahead,
try to open it up in your browser and

128
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,590
see what sort of login procedures
does it actually require.

129
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,810
How hard is it?

130
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,640
Is it HTTP or is it HTTPS?

131
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,520
It can give you a lot of information.

132
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,070
Now, this is just a raw overview of data.

133
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,940
I encourage you to expand
upon this subject further.

134
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,760
In the upper left corner,
there are filters and

135
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,300
here you can type in various values.

136
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,100
Do try to pick apart the information.

137
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,200
For example, I can type in DNS.

138
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,410
So, give me all the DNS queries,

139
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,350
and it's gonna give me all the DNS
queries that have been made.

140
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,310
Which is very nice, because I now
know what my phone has requested.

141
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,660
So look, It has CCNA.

142
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,100
That's for Cisco.

143
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,300
It has requested Google.

144
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,570
It has pulled some,
is this an image from YouTube?

145
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,650
I have no idea what this is.

146
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,570
I don't know.

147
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,840
In any case, it has contacted YouTube.

148
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,740
Again, it went over to Google,
and, yeah, there you go.

149
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,940
There's safe browsing, Google clients.

150
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:35,050
Yeah, okay so, I have opened up Firefox,
I've seen something on Google.

151
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:40,600
I obviously can't see the search results,
but I can see when a person clicks

152
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,020
on one of those search results and
requests that particular URL.

153
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,030
For that purpose,

154
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:52,980
DNS filter is your friend, but
it doesn't necessarily need to be.

155
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,540
You can just leave it empty and
see how it goes.

156
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,623
You can also type in IP.addr == and

157
00:10:00,623 --> 00:10:04,577
then you can type in the IP address.

158
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:10,939
Here for example, 192.168.1.101.

159
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,720
So now we have all the traffic,
which has either a source, or

160
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,736
a destination IP address of 192.168.1.101.

161
00:10:20,736 --> 00:10:25,640
So if you wish to see a traffic
of a particular IP address,

162
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,520
you can use the filter
that I have just used.

163
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,200
I would strongly encourage you to
expand upon this subject further.

164
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,350
There is a course on Udemy
that I have made, as well.

165
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,950
But you don't have to go there.

166
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,520
I mean, you also obviously have a great
deal of knowledge on the Internet as well.

167
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,630
So you can explore it there.

168
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:50,534
Because Wireshark and networking traffic
monitoring is a subject of its own.

169
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:51,610
That's like a course of its own.

170
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,980
There's a huge amount of information.

171
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,040
But you are able to get
the basic information,

172
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,850
which interests you at this point of time.

173
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,270
In any case,
I am going to wrap the tutorial up here.

174
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:07,030
And in the next chapter,
we're going to get into routers and

175
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:12,370
how to break the first line of defense for
pretty much any major network out there.

176
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,657
Until then, I bid you farewell, and
I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
