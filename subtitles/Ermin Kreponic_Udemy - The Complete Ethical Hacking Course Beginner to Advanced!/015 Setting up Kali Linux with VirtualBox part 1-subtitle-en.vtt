00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.305

Welcome back everybody.



2

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.907

The download is finished,

so we have it in the Downloads folder.



3

00:00:07.142 --> 00:00:09.734

Just open up Finder and go into Downloads folder,



4

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.182

so Finder is here, and then

go into the Downloads folder



5

00:00:13.217 --> 00:00:14.700

and you'll see something like this



6

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.350

Kali-Linux-2.0.0-vbox-amd64.7z



7

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.630

Now, if there's a newer

version, feel free to download it,



8

00:00:24.665 --> 00:00:27.953

you should be fine, it should work

without any problems of whatsoever.



9

00:00:27.988 --> 00:00:31.683

Now what we need to do is actually unpackage this



10

00:00:31.718 --> 00:00:35.122

because this is a zip file, this is a packet file.



11

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.519

Feel free to go to the App Store



12

00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:41.749

and download software from there if you wish.



13

00:00:41.884 --> 00:00:45.340

I, personally, have not

installed Homebrew here yet,



14

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:48.578

Macports, anything like that.

I've opted to go for Homebrew



15

00:00:48.613 --> 00:00:51.143

and I'm gonna go ahead and install it now



16

00:00:51.178 --> 00:00:54.709

and then I'm gonna install

a software in order to unzip this file,



17

00:00:54.744 --> 00:00:55.886

to unpackage it.



18

00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:59.942

If you have some other software

that you wish to use or prefer to use



19

00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:03.835

you don't need to follow

through this entire tutorial,



20

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.205

you can go ahead and skip it

but if you'd like to do it as I did



21

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.597

feel free to follow along.



22

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:15.007

Any way is fine as long as

you can unpackage this file.



23

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:21.613

So let's go ahead and open

Safari and let's go ahead and search for



24

00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:28.328

"homebrew mac". There we go,



25

00:01:28.363 --> 00:01:31.343

the missing package manager for OS X.



26

00:01:31.478 --> 00:01:33.874

It should be the first one that pops.



27

00:01:35.436 --> 00:01:37.925

It doesn't really have https encryption,



28

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.803

but then again there isn't anything,



29

00:01:39.838 --> 00:01:42.742

you don't need to log

into this site or anything like that.



30

00:01:42.977 --> 00:01:45.323

You only have installation instructions,



31

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.920

which I myself am going to follow.



32

00:01:48.652 --> 00:01:49.993

No big deal, really.



33

00:01:50.156 --> 00:01:53.525

So let's go ahead and copy this.



34

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.706

All that I did to copy was double tap to select



35

00:01:57.741 --> 00:01:59.808

or triple tap to select the entire thing.



36

00:01:59.843 --> 00:02:04.913

Press Cmd+C and then

I'm gonna open up my terminal here



37

00:02:06.328 --> 00:02:09.377

and this is a horrendous

looking color, if you ask me,



38

00:02:10.615 --> 00:02:12.222

but well, no big deal.



39

00:02:12.457 --> 00:02:15.742

I just paste this command and press Enter.



40

00:02:15.878 --> 00:02:18.313

I'm probably gonna be required sudo privileges.



41

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.583

No, OK, apparently not.



42

00:02:23.618 --> 00:02:27.665

The "Xcrun" command requires

the command line developer tools.



43

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.051

Would you like to install the tools now?



44

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.808

OK, install them. Mac SDK and Xcode agreement.



45

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:41.772

Fine, whatever. Should be fine.



46

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.507

OK, so it says less than a minute.



47

00:02:52.524 --> 00:02:55.151

That should finish up fairly fast.



48

00:02:57.081 --> 00:03:01.709

So I hope that I got the

site right: brew.sh. That should be the one.



49

00:03:02.044 --> 00:03:06.715

That was advertised and

I pretty much have everywhere else.



50

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.752

You can also go to Homebrew

GitHub and follow the link from there.



51

00:03:13.812 --> 00:03:15.387

It should be in the Read me.



52

00:03:15.922 --> 00:03:21.862

What packages are available?

Homebrew summarised on the homepage.



53

00:03:22.297 --> 00:03:26.507

So there we go, this is the homepage, brew.sh.



54

00:03:30.245 --> 00:03:32.488

OK, so let's just do this.



55

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:51.632

So that seems to be fine.



56

00:03:51.867 --> 00:03:55.330

It says "press Return to

continue or any other key to abort".



57

00:03:55.365 --> 00:03:59.277

Go ahead and press Return and let it fly.



58

00:03:59.612 --> 00:04:03.556

So now you will be

prompted for administrator password,



59

00:04:04.988 --> 00:04:08.616

you do need to be either using the admin account



60

00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:12.752

or log into your admin account via the terminal.



61

00:04:12.787 --> 00:04:15.460

To log into your admin account

via the terminal you can just...



62

00:04:15.495 --> 00:04:19.461

I'll show you how to it, actually.

You can just use the "su" command,



63

00:04:19.496 --> 00:04:23.750

so "su", space, admin account, user name, Enter,



64

00:04:23.785 --> 00:04:25.409

and then you'll type in your password



65

00:04:25.444 --> 00:04:27.448

and then type in whatever you need to type in.



66

00:04:27.483 --> 00:04:29.744

Just type in this command that I've typed in,



67

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:31.911

or that I've copy-pasted pretty much from the net.



68

00:04:31.946 --> 00:04:34.674

So let's go ahead and type in our password.



69

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:40.767

And it's going, it's starting.



70

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.306

It's downloading and installing Homebrew.



71

00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:47.204

I actually have no idea how long this will take,



72

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:52.015

it'd probably be just

easier to set up an Apple ID



73

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.546

but I don't really feel like doing that...



74

00:04:56.885 --> 00:04:58.932

I don't really feel like it at the moment,



75

00:04:59.067 --> 00:05:00.668

I like to go the long way around and



76

00:05:00.803 --> 00:05:03.053

I do believe that I need this anyway,



77

00:05:04.218 --> 00:05:06.913

not for the course,

but for all things that I need to do



78

00:05:06.948 --> 00:05:09.930

and I've figured it should be

a nice thing to show to everybody



79

00:05:09.965 --> 00:05:12.893

how they can do it without much hassle.



80

00:05:12.928 --> 00:05:17.576

Let's type in "brew search".

Let's see if this works like Linux,



81

00:05:17.611 --> 00:05:21.343

that would be awesome if

it does, like the Linux packet manager.



82

00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:25.540

Brew search...



83

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.085

I don't know... 7zip



84

00:05:33.273 --> 00:05:37.892

You're going to find... There we go,

p7zip, I know that one from Linux.



85

00:05:37.927 --> 00:05:43.154

I can use that one, so "brew install",



86

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:47.393

it's awesome because I get

Linux-like functionalities in Mac



87

00:05:48.462 --> 00:05:50.787

and I really install things with the command line



88

00:05:51.222 --> 00:05:54.587

You might argue that it's simpler to use a GUI,



89

00:05:54.622 --> 00:05:57.802

but I'm not feeling it.



90

00:06:00.452 --> 00:06:04.683

You have an interface

which you need to follow through,



91

00:06:04.718 --> 00:06:07.672

you have a bunch of

things that you need to click on, etc.



92

00:06:07.707 --> 00:06:10.549

Like this I just type in the name

of the package and install, that's it.



93

00:06:10.884 --> 00:06:15.857

Downloading HT binary,

pouring Yosemite bottle...



94

00:06:17.802 --> 00:06:22.365

Should be fine now,

let's go ahead and try typing in p7.



95

00:06:24.668 --> 00:06:26.553

No. What was it called?



96

00:06:30.533 --> 00:06:35.019

I'll see where I am, and then

I need to go to the Downloads folder



97

00:06:35.354 --> 00:06:38.981

and I have a file which needs unzipping, so



98

00:06:39.016 --> 00:06:42.244

I could either go with a GUI,

but let's see if I can manage in the terminal.



99

00:06:46.247 --> 00:06:48.833

"Unzip", nice, OK, you have it.



100

00:06:51.226 --> 00:06:53.433

Excellent, so let's press Enter.



101

00:06:54.786 --> 00:06:58.512

End-of-central-directory signature not found.



102

00:06:58.747 --> 00:07:03.567

It's not a zipfile...

Alright, so I got the wrong one.



103

00:07:06.686 --> 00:07:08.328

I'm guessing it is not extracted.



104

00:07:09.977 --> 00:07:12.911

Of course not. So, let's use...



105

00:07:17.307 --> 00:07:19.555

Let's try using the GUI to actually extract it,



106

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.559

because I completely forgot the command



107

00:07:21.694 --> 00:07:23.447

and I'm pretty sure this won't work.



108

00:07:24.142 --> 00:07:25.671

Choose application.



109

00:07:30.853 --> 00:07:36.832

"7zip". Here. Does the Homebrew

function in this manner?



110

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:42.143

No. It does not.

Keep in mind that I could have done all of this



111

00:07:42.178 --> 00:07:45.591

prior to this, but I wanted

to encounter all the problems



112

00:07:45.826 --> 00:07:49.295

the very first time Mac

user would encounter so that



113

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.621

everybody could see that it is doable.



114

00:07:52.756 --> 00:07:55.337

And if I have to eat my

words at a certain period of time,



115

00:07:55.372 --> 00:07:57.958

well, I shall eat them, I guess.



116

00:08:05.945 --> 00:08:09.543

How about if we do "ls /bin/"?

It should be in the bin directory, right?



117

00:08:19.294 --> 00:08:20.848

Nope, not here.



118

00:08:20.483 --> 00:08:23.895

Let's see what the

installation folder was, it should be



119

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:28.481

/usr/local/cellar/p7zip



120

00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:02.830

ChangeLog, readme, todo list, bin, share.



121

00:09:02.965 --> 00:09:06.777

Let's go into the bin. There we are!



122

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.952

"7z --help", so give me the Help button.



123

00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:26.389

Add files to archive, Benchmark,

Delete files, Extract files from archive



124

00:09:26.424 --> 00:09:29.292

without using directory names.



125

00:09:30.588 --> 00:09:34.617

Fine, let's try the extract, "-e"



126

00:09:41.002 --> 00:09:44.755

/Downloads/. If you were

wondering what this curved sign, tilde, is



127

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:49.027

that's the shortcut for the

current user's Home directory.



128

00:09:49.462 --> 00:09:53.534

I could have just typed in like this on Linux,



129

00:09:53.569 --> 00:09:55.756

if I'm not mistaken it should work.



130

00:10:04.046 --> 00:10:07.505

No, actually. That's not how you

type into your Home directory in a Mac,



131

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.122

that is how you type it

in Linux, but doesn't matter.



132

00:10:10.157 --> 00:10:14.791

This is a universal shortcut for

the Home directory of the current user,



133

00:10:15.026 --> 00:10:21.350

so I have Kali... 7z,

press Enter. Incorrect command line.



134

00:10:21.385 --> 00:10:23.046

I wonder what the problem is.



135

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:36.128

So I am currently here,

and I would like to make it all the way to



136

00:10:38.102 --> 00:10:43.155

Home. That's not Downloads,

it's not giving me anything else.



137

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.564

OK, so let's see where it

actually is physically located



138

00:10:48.699 --> 00:10:50.898

because as you can see, I'm quite struggling here.



139

00:10:55.836 --> 00:10:58.086

Then we're gonna go into Users



140

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.831

Udemy and then Downloads.



141

00:11:04.966 --> 00:11:07.613

I hope that you're

enjoying me struggling on a Mac,



142

00:11:07.748 --> 00:11:09.688

which is quite interesting, I guess,



143

00:11:09.723 --> 00:11:11.374

or it's quite boring for some people.



144

00:11:12.801 --> 00:11:17.547

Let's use the same command as before to get help



145

00:11:17.582 --> 00:11:20.005

because I really need some assistance with this.



146

00:11:21.724 --> 00:11:27.528

It says "7z command, switches,

archive names, file names, affiliates".



147

00:11:27.763 --> 00:11:33.155

That all seems to be fine and

dandy, and I need to pass in a command "e".



148

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.193

Maybe it's not passed the way I think it is passed.



149

00:11:36.328 --> 00:11:39.978

Maybe it's passed without a dash,

so that could also be a possibility,



150

00:11:40.213 --> 00:11:45.096

let's see if that work out.

Different systems, different formats.



151

00:11:45.231 --> 00:11:49.986

Voilà. There we go. I did manage to figure it out.



152

00:11:51.595 --> 00:11:53.155

I'm sure that there will be a lot of people



153

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.780

who will say "why did you have to do this?"



154

00:11:55.815 --> 00:11:58.863

"you're really showing that

you don't really know how to do it".



155

00:11:58.998 --> 00:12:01.958

But as I said, I got a Mac a couple of days ago



156

00:12:02.193 --> 00:12:06.277

and I thought it would be

a very good idea to actually just



157

00:12:06.512 --> 00:12:11.149

record it as I do it to

encounter these exact same problems



158

00:12:11.184 --> 00:12:15.149

that you would encounter,

so that I would be able to better relate



159

00:12:15.184 --> 00:12:19.144

to all the people who

possibly experience any problems,



160

00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:21.506

so that I would struggle

and that you would see how I struggle



161

00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:24.404

and how I've found solutions to the problems,



162

00:12:25.885 --> 00:12:29.812

in such a way I can better help you all out.



163

00:12:29.847 --> 00:12:32.170

So this is processing, this might take a while.



164

00:12:32.505 --> 00:12:35.306

And we're just gonna leave it to run



165

00:12:35.341 --> 00:12:37.100

and then we're gonna see what becomes of it.



166

00:12:37.165 --> 00:12:38.848

I might actually pause the tutorial here



167

00:12:39.083 --> 00:12:43.999

and then continue it in the follow-up lecture



168

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.004

and see how that works out.



169

00:12:46.039 --> 00:12:49.994

I'm thinking of giving it

a little bit more time and



170

00:12:50.029 --> 00:12:54.047

then actually pausing it, but...



171

00:12:55.338 --> 00:12:58.144

I wish I had a lot of other people to consult now,



172

00:12:58.179 --> 00:13:01.646

but I'm alone here,

I am doing it for the first time,



173

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:04.644

so forgive any mistakes that I do make,



174

00:13:04.779 --> 00:13:07.559

but at least I showed the

solutions for all the mistakes I make,



175

00:13:07.694 --> 00:13:10.473

which in advance solved your possible problems.



176

00:13:12.699 --> 00:13:15.333

I hear the drive, it's spinning pretty fast,



177

00:13:15.368 --> 00:13:17.933

I wish I had an SSD at this point of time,



178

00:13:18.917 --> 00:13:22.081

but price, that was a bit

high for a Mac with an SSD,



179

00:13:23.417 --> 00:13:25.484

and considering I just got it for Udemy...



180

00:13:26.488 --> 00:13:28.100

You will forgive me for that, of course.



181

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.191

So I'm just gonna split the tutorial here



182

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:32.560

and then we're gonna go ahead and continue on



183

00:13:32.595 --> 00:13:38.466

in the follow-up when

the unpackaging is actually over and done.
