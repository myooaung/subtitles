00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,920
Hello everybody and
welcome to this follow up tutorial.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,010
Now, I have done some testing prior to
actually beginning this tutorial and

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,840
I have realized that when I
type in the command wash and

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,020
when I pass the interface VLP 2S0
which is my wireless interface.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,530
Okay, it starts scanning it now and
it seems to be working without any bigger

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:26,130
problems here however,
let me just go ahead and cancel it.

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,690
It tends to issue out errors,
and it doesn't say much.

8
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,600
It just says that it's unable to open
the interface that you have specified.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,940
And after I Googled it up a little bit,

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,300
I have found that the problem
is a missing file.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,600
In order to fix that,
you just need to type in mkdir,

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,100
one of the basic Linux commands.

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:52,190
To make a directory,
type in / etc / reaver.

14
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,450
Press Enter and there you go.

15
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:01,095
Now, this command will create
this file in this folder.

16
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:04,935
It says cannot create directory
because it already exists.

17
00:01:04,935 --> 00:01:06,805
I have created it prior to this.

18
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:10,385
But if it gives you any trouble of what so
ever try doing this.

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,100
Try creating this file.

20
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,330
Reaver can be problematic
from time to time,

21
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,910
and there are forums dedicated to these
things which you can, of course, use.

22
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,770
Just type in Reaver help,
or whatever on the net,

23
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,870
then you'll be given 100 forums
where you can go and turn to help.

24
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,260
But you can always ask me as well
to help you out, no problems,

25
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,060
I'll be more than happy to do it.

26
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,360
Anyway, just go ahead, that's a small
fix that you can do if you encounter any

27
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,330
problems, but if you don't, well,
then good for you, and good for us all.

28
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,120
Type in, just go ahead and
back and let's continue, and

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:52,450
let's start the scanning process itself
to see what we can actually attack,

30
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,800
is what wireless access points are
vulnerable and what we can actually do.

31
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,950
If you take a bit of a closer look,
here you will see the BSSID,

32
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,380
which is basically the Mac
address of the access point.

33
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,950
Here you can see the channel RSSI,
that's not important for us.

34
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,520
VPS Version, that can be important.

35
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,660
And VPS Locked,
this is what we are looking at.

36
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,400
This is the most important thing here
that we need to pay attention to.

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,090
If it says no, good for you,
you can actually do it.

38
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,880
If it says yes, it means that
the VPS has been disabled on that

39
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,910
particular wireless access point, and
this attack is rendered pointless.

40
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,850
You can't do anything with it.

41
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:46,170
It won't yield any results, in fact, you
won't be able to try even a single bin.

42
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,890
So as long as the answer is no, the
wireless access point is vulnerable and

43
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,220
you can perform this sort of attack,
no problems.

44
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,570
I mean yeah,
depending on the router of course and

45
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,070
depending on how well it was configured.

46
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,710
But out of the box,
usually, it's not that good.

47
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,900
Anyway, this is the wireless access
point that we will be attacking.

48
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,770
This is mine.
It's called Something,

49
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,080
which I have set up for
our tutorial today.

50
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,460
I think that this test
router is like 20 bucks or

51
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,550
something like that,
they're pretty cheap these days.

52
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,430
It's not the best one,

53
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:24,820
definitely, but it will serve our
purpose for our learning sessions today.

54
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,630
Just go ahead and cancel this.

55
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,648
There is a, there is one more thing
which we need to be certain of.

56
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:37,020
Here we can see which access
points are vulnerable,

57
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:43,045
but other than that,
we need to verify the signal strength, so

58
00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:47,714
airodump-ng.

59
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,110
VOP2S0 go ahead and start.

60
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,770
Excellent.

61
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,260
So, I have used this command
in the previous tutorials, and

62
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,130
here you can see the power output.

63
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:03,690
So, as long as it's, well,
minus -80 is not a good thing.

64
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,810
It's definitely not a good thing for
revert.

65
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,680
You want to have.

66
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,180
Let me just stop it here because
I have the network that I want.

67
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:16,189
You see, something is -43, and
I have this one which is -53,

68
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:23,450
these are all, well, good ranges,
they have relatively good signal strength.

69
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,310
And somehow, even though my router is
literally right next to my computer,

70
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,820
it's -43, which is not as good.

71
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,080
And I have these -80, it is probably
my neighbor or something like that.

72
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,800
Anyway, I'm not gonna touch them,
I'm not gonna mess with them.

73
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,670
I'm just gonna go ahead and
focus on this one, which is mine.

74
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:47,849
But it does need to be at least- 60,
at least below -60.

75
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,468
So -55, -40, something of a kind,

76
00:04:52,468 --> 00:04:57,340
you will be able to actually
perform it -75, and -80.

77
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,990
I have heard of these cases but,
it is not easy.

78
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:07,620
I get breaks in the connection,
get problems, errors, etc.

79
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,710
Not the best of things to do.

80
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,250
If you want to crack it, if you want to
get close to it or something like that,

81
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,390
you don't need to stay there for
the whole duration of the attack,

82
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:20,570
primarily because usually this
sort of attacks you can start,

83
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,390
and continue at a later time from
where you left off, no problem.

84
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,460
Reaver save this sort of information for
you, and

85
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,440
you're able to re-use it or to restart it
from where you left it off previously.

86
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,842
Now, I'm going to employ reaver,
so type in reaver.

87
00:05:36,842 --> 00:05:42,490
-a for our Mac address,
so what we need is for

88
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,340
something, there we go, second one.

89
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:57,340
Let's go ahead and paste it and
type in interface vlp2s0.

90
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,404
Sorry, my bad, it's not -a.

91
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,345
I want to pass the MAC address, and

92
00:06:03,345 --> 00:06:08,020
the interface should go first,
let's see if it's gonna work like this.

93
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,890
Yup, it's gonna work,

94
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:13,870
you don't need to use this specific
order from the previous session.

95
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,380
No, but

96
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:19,458
I do want to do this double verbose
output here, always a good idea to do.

97
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:23,400
Anyway, press Enter, no,
I do not wish to restore it.

98
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,000
Just go ahead and continue and
see what happens.

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,440
Okay, so you see what it's doing here?

100
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,890
It says switching to channel 1,
channel 2, channel 3.

101
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,680
We don't want to do that,
let's just go ahead and cancel it.

102
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,223
I want to save it a lot of time.

103
00:06:37,223 --> 00:06:41,704
Let's see what channel I am using.

104
00:06:41,704 --> 00:06:45,171
I am using channel 6.

105
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,610
That's just a frequency on which my
wireless access point functions.

106
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,457
Let's just go ahead and type in -c 6.

107
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,910
Will it work like this,
switching to channel six immediately?

108
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,080
Yes, it will.

109
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,990
No, I do not wish to continue from before.

110
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,540
Excellent.

111
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:08,380
So, it says here trying this pin,
and it just keeps on going.

112
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,000
Guess it's going to tell me
at a certain point of time,

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,520
what percentage of the task is done, but
usually you can do this within a day.

114
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,710
I mean, provided of course, you don't
get locked out, or something like that,

115
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,670
and the amount of tries you
can actually do before you're

116
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,330
getting completely locked out.

117
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,940
So you see here's one pin, and
where's the other one, here's yet

118
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,800
another pin, and here's a third pin,
and so on, and so forth.

119
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,809
Of course we have all seen the pin that
I have used at the very beginning.

120
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,770
That the router has
generated automatically.

121
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,910
I have not saved it, I have actually
just used the one that's already there.

122
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:49,760
But that's completely irrelevant,
because pins vary from router to a router.

123
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,946
This is gonna take awhile.

124
00:07:51,946 --> 00:07:58,270
You see it says 0.05% complete and

125
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,840
it gives you when it was done and
if you remember at the beginning,

126
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,850
it actually asks me do I wish to continue
from the last time I started doing this,

127
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:11,620
that's the beauty of it, you can go for
it, start cracking it somewhere and

128
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,550
lets say you're passing by a certain
place, you can sit at a bench for

129
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,370
an hour or something like that,
have this run for

130
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:25,010
you, leave tomorrow again, pass by the
same bench then sit on it, leave it for

131
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,700
an hour and a half,
an hour something like that.

132
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,090
And there you go, eventually you will
be able to crack it no problems,

133
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,900
of course if somebody is reviewing
the router logs which is rarely done for.

134
00:08:37,982 --> 00:08:42,380
For routers where pin out
authentication is actually enabled,

135
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,800
than they will see that somebody is trying
to do something and they might decide to

136
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,060
actually authentication altogether,
however, other than that,

137
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:56,120
there isn't that much that they can do
even if they set specific MAC addresses of

138
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,930
the computers within the network you will
still be able to see those MAC addresses.

139
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:04,140
And, as I showed in the previous tutorial,

140
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,815
you will be prompted to, you will be
able to change your MAC address to match

141
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,985
the corresponding MAC addresses
which are allowed to pass.

142
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,005
And there we go.

143
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:16,444
After only 0.05% complete,

144
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:21,075
it says WARNING: Detected AP
rate limiting.

145
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,538
Waiting 60 seconds before re-checking,

146
00:09:25,538 --> 00:09:31,180
which means the router is now into lock
down and you can't actually do anything.

147
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,130
There are, the good thing about the,

148
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,180
not a bad thing to do would be
to actually see the router.

149
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,840
See the router's MAC address and then try
to figure out which router it is, and

150
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,840
then search on the net
to see what the AP rate

151
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:53,600
limiting is, and
then you can time your reverb

152
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,050
in attempts in between so
that the router doesn't get locked.

153
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,010
I will continue with this in
the followup tutorial, but for

154
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:05,940
the time being, I am locked out and
in the next tutorial, we will be

155
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,670
doing some work arounds around this
lockout, and see how we can actually ply

156
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,630
past it because this is one of the most
common problems that people encounter.

157
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,400
It's not the installation
because it's relatively simple.

158
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,270
The usage is also relatively simple.

159
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,620
The set up is not a big deal or
a big problem.

160
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,555
There's plenty of help on the net.

161
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,640
But here it says,
Detected AP rate limiting,

162
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,090
waiting 60 seconds before re-checking.

163
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:35,030
That is one of the most hated lines
as far as Reaver world is concerned.

164
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,150
In any case, I bid you farewell.

165
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,890
And I really hope to see you
in a follow-up tutorial where

166
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,550
we will attempt to bypass this problem.
