00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:08,283
Today I will open up a chapter on how to stay anonymous

3
00:00:08,283 --> 00:00:11,464
So there's several ways, several methods that you can use

4
00:00:11,464 --> 00:00:15,205
first off, you probably heard about these things, they are proxies

5
00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:18,724
So you are just routing your connection throught several

6
00:00:18,724 --> 00:00:21,022
different points althought this can be very

7
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:23,239
slow depending on the speed of the proxies

8
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:28,012
elsewhere, and you also know nothing

9
00:00:28,012 --> 00:00:30,998
of the other site, you know nothing of the

10
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:33,161
servers through which your packets are

11
00:00:33,161 --> 00:00:33,737
going

12
00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:34,660
so that can be risky

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,322
but then again, if you're just scanning something

14
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:42,248
If you're using Nmap to footprint a newtork

15
00:00:42,248 --> 00:00:43,724
why do you care?

16
00:00:43,724 --> 00:00:46,198
It's not of importance.

17
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:51,799
However, if you're using proxies to log in somewhere or pass credentials

18
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,312
or something of a kind

19
00:00:53,312 --> 00:00:56,987
that is potentially dengerous and you should not do that

20
00:00:56,987 --> 00:01:00,229
I mean, quite literally you shouldn't do it

21
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:03,524
The other option is to use some sort of VPNs

22
00:01:03,524 --> 00:01:11,617
and to encrypt your traffic betweten you and the VPN service provider.

23
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:15,058
Now these things can be very fast, depenending on which one you have.

24
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:16,798
So you can just pay for a service out there

25
00:01:16,798 --> 00:01:21,576
A yearly subscription is like a hundred and something bucks

26
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:23,487
A monthly suscription is like ten bucks.

27
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:27,853
You get a dedicated VPN static IP adress.

28
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:30,756
So you can do a lot of stuff

29
00:01:30,756 --> 00:01:34,783
and they can be very very very fast.

30
00:01:34,783 --> 00:01:37,346
Furthermore your traffic is encrypted, as I said.

31
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:42,075
and the only way that somebody can figure out that you are doing something somewhere

32
00:01:42,075 --> 00:01:47,762
is if the VPN service provider actually relinquishes your information.

33
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:50,909
However this does not happen that often.

34
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,751
This is very difficult to attain, especially if you get a VPN in certain parts of the world

35
00:01:56,751 --> 00:02:00,964
where they just generally don't give these sort of information out

36
00:02:00,964 --> 00:02:05,429
but I woudln't recommend doing that for white hat hacking

37
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:09,085
primarily because they isn't need to stay anonymous to that extent.

38
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:13,671
What we are going to be using VPN and proxies mainly for

39
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:18,782
or what they are mainly used for in the world today, I would say anyway

40
00:02:18,782 --> 00:02:21,305
this is just my personal opinion

41
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:27,257
is to bypass firewall settings or firewall limitations, should I say.

42
00:02:27,257 --> 00:02:29,753
So here's a real-life example

43
00:02:29,753 --> 00:02:34,104
that people are using pretty much on daily basis.

44
00:02:34,104 --> 00:02:40,816
Netflix, for example, has a certain range of IP adresses from which it allows connections.

45
00:02:40,816 --> 00:02:47,057
So if you are elsewhere in the world and you don not belong to that IP adress range

46
00:02:47,057 --> 00:02:50,729
it will not allow you to view anything on the site

47
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:53,896
it will not allow you to see movies or something of a kind.

48
00:02:53,896 --> 00:02:55,503
However, if you use a proxy

49
00:02:55,503 --> 00:02:56,812
a good one

50
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:58,394
or if you use a VPN

51
00:02:58,394 --> 00:03:02,367
you will be access to site as through you were coming from the country

52
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:05,999
which falls within the IP adress range list

53
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:09,181
So that's just one of the common examples, what people have been doing

54
00:03:09,181 --> 00:03:16,424
It's not exactly harmful or something like that.

55
00:03:16,424 --> 00:03:20,548
You're not taking servers down or anything of a kind

56
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:25,065
but people have been using it in order to be able to watch Netflix from, I don't know

57
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:28,512
from a cell phone when they're traveling or something like that

58
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:31,920
In any case, there are numerous other examples

59
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,142
when you want to bypass certain firewall settings.

60
00:03:34,142 --> 00:03:39,776
Primarily you bypass the IP range list which are allowed to access a certain server or something like that

61
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:47,363
Also, for example, if you had a certain server who's traffic is mainly generated from these single area

62
00:03:47,363 --> 00:03:48,975
from a single country

63
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:57,669
and you do not want to be, for example, scanning it from an IP address that belongs to the area in China

64
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:03,174
or something like that, because those IP adresses look very differently.

65
00:04:03,174 --> 00:04:04,412
I mean, of course they're withing the same

66
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:08,412
but any network administrator, as soon as they see that IP address of that kind

67
00:04:08,412 --> 00:04:11,771
that is far away from their geographical area

68
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:18,843
they will know that it's an anomaly of some sort that doesn't belong there

69
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:21,721
and they will be intrigued, they will start looking

70
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:24,380
So that is not something you want happening to you.

71
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:30,025
You want to be accessing the server from where all the other users are accessing it from

72
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:33,877
in order to hide yourself in the mass.

73
00:04:33,877 --> 00:04:37,667
In any case, that is what we should be doing in this chapter

74
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:40,844
and a few other things but for the time being, for this tutorial

75
00:04:40,844 --> 00:04:44,149
I want to show you how you can actually access the dark web

76
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:47,428
or the hidden web, whichever way you wish to refer to it.

77
00:04:47,428 --> 00:04:52,786
Now the rumor is that the dark web is a lot bigger than your regular internet.

78
00:04:52,786 --> 00:04:56,812
There's a lot more information there

79
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:58,705
and I use it's resources

80
00:04:58,705 --> 00:05:00,219
a lot of people do.

81
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:03,184
There are some very nice forums where you can get a lot of good stuff.

82
00:05:03,184 --> 00:05:08,624
So I would definitely recommend trying it out

83
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:10,456
and at some point in time, you will need it.

84
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:13,318
For that, you will need to install a tor browser

85
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:18,119
and with tor browser, you will be able to access dark net

86
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:21,427
Now it's not installed by default on Kali

87
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:26,932
and this is one of those rare occasions and rare situations

88
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:31,983
where we will actually need a different user other than root

89
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:34,926
in order to be able to do anything with tor

90
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:36,341
in order to be able to start it.

91
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:42,018
So first off, I'm going to go ahead and create a new user.

92
00:05:42,018 --> 00:05:43,999
So just open up your virtual machine.

93
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:46,010
You see mine is already opened up here.

94
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,493
I'm just changing the size of it.

95
00:05:48,493 --> 00:05:49,806
You can see it's virtual machine

96
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:52,027
and I have my terminal up and running here.

97
00:05:52,027 --> 00:05:53,799
I can close it and reopen it.

98
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:54,879
There you go

99
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,658
Just open up your tegular terminal and type in the following

100
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:01,006
So first off, we need tor.

101
00:06:01,006 --> 00:06:03,593
I will explain what tor is in a moment

102
00:06:03,593 --> 00:06:11,468
but you just type in "apt - get install tor -y"

103
00:06:11,468 --> 00:06:13,387
and press ENTER

104
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:16,254
With this command that I am highlighting at the moment

105
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:18,329
tor will install, no problems in Kali

106
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:21,262
as long as you have an active internet connection.

107
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:27,643
It is not installing here because I already have it installed.

108
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:32,410
Yep, there we go

109
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,564
It says "tor is already the newest version"

110
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:37,130
So it is already installed.

111
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,247
It is the newest version.

112
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:41,395
I have deliberately skipped all the entire verbose installation

113
00:06:41,395 --> 00:06:46,446
primarily because you're not going to see anything useful at the moment

114
00:06:46,446 --> 00:06:49,129
and it's gonna waste quite a bit of time.

115
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:51,415
So just type in this command.

116
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:55,435
You will not be prompted for any question for any questions because of the -y argument

117
00:06:55,435 --> 00:06:59,229
and installation will go through, no problems.

118
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:01,653
Let me just go ahead and clear the screen.

119
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:07,878
Now the next things that we need to do is actually create that user that I have been talking about.

120
00:07:07,878 --> 00:07:12,124
So just go ahead and type in the command "adduser"

121
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:16,412
Just the keynote here -- There was also a command "useradd"

122
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:19,249
Do not use this command for the time being

123
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:23,038
primarily because I have discovered that it causes some unnecessary complications

124
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:25,982
which tend to hinder us along the way

125
00:07:25,982 --> 00:07:30,908
Just go ahead and type "adduser"

126
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:34,790
and now you can name your user whatever you want.

127
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,216
You cannot use capital letters, if I remember correctly.

128
00:07:37,216 --> 00:07:39,014
That is the rule in debian systems.

129
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:47,263
So I'm just gonna call my user "test"

130
00:07:47,263 --> 00:07:51,349
My user will be test

131
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:52,338
and there we go

132
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:56,714
Now it says "adding user test", "adding new group test"

133
00:07:56,714 --> 00:08:00,063
"adding new user test", "adding new user test with group test"

134
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,368
That's pretty much what has happened here.

135
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:05,344
It has created a home directory for that user.

136
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:07,121
It already exists

137
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:09,259
Letting you know I have created previously

138
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:13,338
but I have deleted it, just to make sure there are no mistakes in this tutorial

139
00:08:13,338 --> 00:08:14,741
but it doesn't matter

140
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:19,934
It will say here that the home test directory has been created

141
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:23,220
and that you will be able to use it.

142
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,435
You do need this folder, primarily because we're going to be doing stuff there.

143
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:30,194
which you cannot do with root.

144
00:08:30,194 --> 00:08:32,723
Go ahead and type in your password here.

145
00:08:32,723 --> 00:08:35,264
It doesn't show anything when you type.

146
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,943
That's the standard way of Unix passwords

147
00:08:37,943 --> 00:08:41,682
in order to prevent anybody from seen the length of the password in the screen.

148
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:42,823
Very nice

149
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,019
So press Enter

150
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:49,746
Now you are prompted here for some information in regards to that user

151
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:52,480
Completely irrelevant for our porpouse today.

152
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,746
So we do not want to type in full name, room number

153
00:08:54,746 --> 00:08:57,161
work phone, home phone, other

154
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,768
Don't care

155
00:08:58,768 --> 00:09:00,961
Is this information correct? Sure, why not?

156
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:02,686
Press Enter, and there we go

157
00:09:02,686 --> 00:09:09,292
We have just effectively created our new user test, to which we need to log

158
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:11,138
and then from there, conduct our work.

159
00:09:11,138 --> 00:09:19,806
Now a key thing to note here is that, even though there is a way of configuring the tor browser to run as root

160
00:09:19,806 --> 00:09:21,522
it's not simple, but there is a way

161
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:24,073
do not do that.

162
00:09:24,073 --> 00:09:28,951
I mean, it's not even good idea to browse the internet as root user.

163
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:34,693
If you pick any sort of viruses up, any sort of maliciuos code,

164
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:36,641
it's going to run as root.

165
00:09:36,641 --> 00:09:38,599
So you don't want that on your system

166
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:41,306
You do not want to compromise it in such a way

167
00:09:41,306 --> 00:09:45,027
and generally, on the machine that you re performing these tasks

168
00:09:45,027 --> 00:09:46,908
like this virtual machine of Kali Linux

169
00:09:46,908 --> 00:09:48,951
you don't really use it to browse the internet.

170
00:09:48,951 --> 00:09:55,059
For the sake of examples, I sometimes open the browser Firefox basically

171
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:59,093
and do some stuff there, just to show you the information

172
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:04,790
or, as you've seen now, I have downloaded, I have downloaded from a very specific site...

173
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,221
actually not now, but in a few moments you will

174
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:11,829
I will download from a very specific site a tor browser.

175
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:16,828
So just when you know exactly what you're doing and where are you getting it from

176
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:20,260
and when you have verficiation of the source

177
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,272
then you should use it as root, or you can use it as root

178
00:10:24,272 --> 00:10:28,306
but otherwise, do not browse the internet as a root user.

179
00:10:28,306 --> 00:10:30,451
That's a bad idea.

180
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:36,331
However, we will mainly use this user for our tor browser

181
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:39,221
otherwise, we'll be using the root user

182
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,831
primarily because you can do pretty much anything in Kali without the root user.

183
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:46,916
All the tools, more or less, require these sort of root permissions.

184
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:51,709
as they do tend to access network related things.

185
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:58,394
Anyway, I will cut the tutorial here and I'll see you in the second part of it.
