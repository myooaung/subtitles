00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everybody and welcome to the continuation of this tutorial.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,500
Anyway, today we're gonna do the actual cracking of the captured file

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,600
which is basically a follow up tutorial on the previous one.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,250
Make sure you watch these in a proper order, as they are usually tied to one another.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,000
Anyway, we have aircrack -ng

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So I'm just gonna go ahead and type that in.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Anyway, we need the -w for a password or word list that we're going to use.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,800
Either password or word list.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,500
Anyway, you can find these online and download them

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,000
and I've seen some pretty good ones.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So it's 48 gigabytes or something like that

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
However, you need to keep certain things in mind.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
First of all, the region where you're doing this.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So for example, if you're doing this in the US or Canada or English speaking areas

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,700
you'll be able to find some relatively good word lists that you can use

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,290
and they will most likely be able to help you out.

17
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:11,700
However, if you are in a region such as mine where people mainly

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,520
speak slavic languages those word lists
are not going to help you very much

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,150
orasure for example in russia or perhaps
some friends or something of a kind

20
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:29,229
there are specified word lists for
language areas but more often than not

21
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:33,939
they don't tend to work as I said if you
if you are in an english-speaking region

22
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:38,299
try it out with word lists there is a
good chance that it will be a successful

23
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:43,860
run for merely because people do tend to
repeat either repeat password or if they

24
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,290
tend to use fairly similar ones so the
likelihood of the password being in the

25
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,439
word list is pretty high

26
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:54,490
brute forcing method again what I just
said is not called

27
00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:00,530
explained is called a dictionary attacks
who literally take a dictionary from

28
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:06,000
somewhere you type it in here you type
the name of the file hereafter download

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,310
and then you and then you start cracking
which is

30
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,069
a fairly difficult process to do over
over a certain period of time especially

31
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:22,050
if it's a dictionary it will practically
finished trying all the possible

32
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,099
combinations within the dictionary all
the list of recommendations within a

33
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:29,739
dictionary in a reasonable amount of
time so it might take a day or two or

34
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:33,959
something like that but again if you're
sitting next to a wifi you can spread

35
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,480
this attack out you don't actually need
to spread out or anything like that

36
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,019
perhaps indeed spread out for the
capture option or something like that

37
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:47,319
but for the aircraft option once you're
cracking the password it doesn't matter

38
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,670
you can literally sit in your house
without any sort of internet connection

39
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:57,430
or whatsoever if you have a few have a
capture capture file which you then

40
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,280
that's the end of it you will be able to
do it in your house without concern or

41
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,540
worrying about overloading the network
because this process is not conducted

42
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,959
over network this is conducted on your
local machine on a file this is very

43
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,950
important it is completely different
from an online attack or something of a

44
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:23,870
kind where you have the billion
limitations however as i said im in a

45
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,000
region where word lists are not very
useful and therefore I'm gonna do a very

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,150
different thing here I'm gonna see you
for a file to be ready in but I will

47
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:41,720
also tell it to reading from standard
output and now a duty to specify the

48
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:48,859
actual capture file so can test caps
let's just expanded to fullscreen

49
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:52,500
excellent so I have scant

50
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:59,230
dashiell one-dot cap and the final thing
that I need to put in a society which is

51
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:06,590
something and now in front of it all I
have shown in the previous tutorial

52
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:11,880
about crunch I mentioned it a few times
so I used for lunch

53
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:19,150
base and now each facet of arguments now
once you are when you start doing this

54
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:24,410
you want to have an idea of what the
past Ridley 12

55
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:32,490
to take a look around maybe specifically
a coffee shop maybe it will be a name or

56
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,820
something like that

57
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,060
of the place bid will have some sort of
characters of the name in it so make

58
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:45,220
sure to include them or something of a
kind if it's a company tried tried the

59
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:52,200
names of the officers tried the name of
the company tried the names of the of

60
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,100
the year of the different departments
and so on

61
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,720
communication with numbers and you may
think all well here's why why don't I

62
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,520
just tell us do all possible
combinations because it would take about

63
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,930
a billion years quite literally
regardless of what sort of hardware you

64
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,140
have it would take you like a billion
years you would basically need to have a

65
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:18,970
full power I don't know let's combine
Amazon and Google cloud hosting services

66
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:24,440
altogether and still it would take you
are very long amount of time in order to

67
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,120
crack a password because there are
literally death many combinations so my

68
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,710
twenties scouting and it also helps if
you know the length of the password so

69
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,990
if you see somebody typing in the
password in this is not just for

70
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:44,150
wireless cracking this is for any kind
of rude foreseen or dictionary attacks

71
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:49,110
if you are there if you are in the
environment or if you can access the

72
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:55,840
environment physically as a as I think I
mentioned in my first tutorial but I'm

73
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,050
not sure about it

74
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:03,430
somebody during class during one of my
classes he actually managed to see the

75
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,950
length of the past for the professor was
typing in because while she was taking

76
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,180
it in it was being projected onto a
projector screen was being projected

77
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,210
through the projector and nobody could
see it of course nobody could see the

78
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:19,790
password but hey he taught himself how I
at least have the link now and then he

79
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:24,240
passed a few times by her while she was
there to get in she obviously couldn't

80
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,230
he obviously couldn't see all the
cheapest taping in but the password was

81
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:35,200
like six or eight characters in length
and he managed to figure out that there

82
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,070
are many

83
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,950
of six or eight characters he managed to
figure out three or four something like

84
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:46,520
he didn't know their exact positions but
industry but he knew that they were one

85
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,290
after another and that is what I would
highly recommend otherwise this will

86
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:56,060
take for ever so for example I know the
password of my work

87
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,390
wireless router and I know the length
that's why I'm gonna give you this

88
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:07,770
option Sudesh and with that you can
actually specify what sort of characters

89
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:13,930
will be assigned to which positions so
for example I would strongly advise

90
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:24,580
looking at the man pages of crime just
show you a clear and an French

91
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,780
excellence we have we have a man paid
for grants and you have these arguments

92
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:38,620
so on and so forth and if we go down low
ok this is Jeff Carr said oars which

93
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,270
prove which we might actually uses well
I showed you that but we'll see whether

94
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:51,450
that is convenient for our purpose
anyway I'm just trying to find it should

95
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:57,540
be around here somewhere in the examples
down below this is definitely something

96
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,960
you should occur because they're
practically there's practically an

97
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,760
infinite amount of combinations that you
can use excellent so here we go this is

98
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:12,310
what sorry thundershower 5th St
excellence look at what he has done here

99
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:17,950
all these symbols present certain types
of characters for example the signage

100
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:23,860
preserves the lower case letters while
the exclamation

101
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:30,009
and this hash I have no idea what they
represent that I'm being percentage is

102
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:34,300
numbers irritating its capital letters
amateur about that but it doesn't really

103
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,490
matter is completely irrelevant you
don't need to know these things by heart

104
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:44,229
I don't know them what I do I take a
look at the man ages and I figure out

105
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:50,579
what is what it's not it's not really
that of course it's Dashti option there

106
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:56,170
we go desh the and here we have our
options to keep in mind it is an option

107
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,760
is an option percentage science is an
option carried signs an option and look

108
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,880
look at what it says the explanations
practically perfect specifies a pattern

109
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,800
an example of a pattern says your God
which is believe it or not people

110
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,430
actually use that in their best words
it's hilarious but they do and he has to

111
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:24,870
signs the front and 34 out signs
actually in the back look at whether a

112
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:31,630
designer 4 cents will insert lower case
characters so it will use this word and

113
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:38,050
it will insert lower case characters in
front and behind she said it would

114
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:42,440
insert uppercase characters in a certain
percentage sign somewhere in there it

115
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,440
would insert numbers that I care a tiny
percentage side and the carrots owners

116
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:57,110
down below it will insert symbols that
is why it is this i mean you have the

117
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,209
option obviously and that is why it is
very important to acquaint ourselves

118
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:07,420
with sort of password if you are
breaking you cannot just walk in and

119
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,720
break password brute force it without
knowing anything about it previously

120
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,100
that that that's just highly unlikely to
happen I mean even with the best of

121
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,920
machines out there it will not work as
well as you wanted to i mean i I'm

122
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,459
running a few virtual machines in the
box or perhaps my CPU usage will be a

123
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:32,910
bit lower but I've managed to turn
everything off and

124
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,480
Mehsud out it was on seventeen hundred
passengers per second I think I could

125
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,310
have gotten to 2.2 K if I overclock my
processor but i dont didn't have a

126
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,430
cooler here so I didn't want to do that
that is a very important aspect of this

127
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:51,500
you will need to watch the temperature
of your processor I mean if you're using

128
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,330
an Intel Core it will shut down by
default it will not allow you to

129
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:02,250
overhear adrienne arsenault destroyed by
overheating it but look here on the

130
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:09,390
right side I have each temperature
meters and they don't really have a way

131
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:14,780
of doing this in as the gadgets on the
desktop but you can see these you can

132
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:20,540
see do not necessarily the Celsius
temperature in numbers rather instead

133
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:26,130
you can see these charges basically
where scales however you call them you

134
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:32,470
will see the different temperatures like
61 degrees Celsius when I start working

135
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:38,760
with brute force air cracks method when
I start using the brute force method

136
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,330
with aircrack it will load the CPU

137
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,830
Nicholas 610 and you will see how the
temperature will just start jumping up

138
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:53,530
so when you're performing this attack
you might consider actually employing

139
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:58,870
some extra cooling systems in order to
basically reduce the temperature

140
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:04,270
processor because that will not only
increase decrease the chance of

141
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,700
something more functioning but also
increase the chance increased the amount

142
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,640
of tries it can do per second

143
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,730
anyway without further ado and just
gonna go ahead and move to celebrate and

144
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:23,540
terminal but more as well and I'm gonna
say crunch d I want you to you lose your

145
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:31,450
numbers in front and I know that the
word is under so

146
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:40,339
1234567890

147
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:54,470
also pipe Piper simply saying whatever
goes out this this and this argument

148
00:12:54,470 --> 00:13:00,019
here is saying read from whatever is
faster than standard of press center and

149
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:07,610
there we go take a while and this is not
going to work because I am a genius

150
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:15,059
failed to actually passed the proper
length ones passing length in

151
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:21,240
combination with what we did hear you
absolutely need to make sure that it's

152
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:31,009
exactly the same late 2011 excellent
presenter and the scan is progress exxon

153
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:33,350
their ago so there we go

154
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:39,290
he found in such ridiculously short
amount of time primarily because I

155
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:45,230
already knew a good portion of it but
let's let's see what happens now let's

156
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:53,220
head and if I remember correctly what
was for capital letters I think it was a

157
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,850
coma

158
00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:00,079
just check it out because I not all
knowing and come up with uppercase

159
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,490
letters yes it will

160
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,949
my memory still serves me well we will
remember to treat my brain with

161
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:12,499
something later I'm gonna see I'm going
to give it to you here I'm gonna give

162
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:14,420
your

163
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,440
something well it doesn't matter press
ENTER and still still the amount of

164
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,269
possible combinations is not large I
just wanted to make sure that you had

165
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:29,620
the opportunity to see the max out see
the maximum amount of tries here let's

166
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:35,060
just go ahead and close pretty much all
of my virtual machines and once I do dad

167
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:41,769
I will have more CPU despair more CPU
time here that I can devote to do this

168
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:48,230
forcing method just go back here and as
them as a virtual machines are getting

169
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,510
close and saved I'm getting more and
more attempts here but the still pretty

170
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:58,600
low I remember getting up to 1,700 so ok
it it sounded again within a reasonable

171
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:10,300
amount of time let's try passing II
think a character set so shush F ups

172
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:23,910
sorry that and what does it say what
character sets terminal at Cedis $1 his

173
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:28,029
name

174
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:33,850
caterer said Steve excellent so remember
to give a path if you're doing it and

175
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,209
some other folder but if you're doing it
in the folder down during it installed

176
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:50,589
this should be fine and paste said Alice
T and you know it will help you with

177
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:56,760
that I actually take a look at it myself
soldiers go back to the terminal

178
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:04,320
and this is not going to be very helpful
and need to go ahead and open CBE

179
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:13,500
stopped 36 excellent LSU and we have a
charset somewhere around here I'm pretty

180
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:20,590
sure scratch see make file management
want our civility so here we go lets go

181
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:26,660
to class versatility and here we have
the names stated before for pretty much

182
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:32,020
all the charts it's in existence we can
specify these manually but it's better

183
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:37,030
to use these drugs such as there is a
much smaller probability of the National

184
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:44,270
mistake so let's use mix alphanumeric
space and discuss significantly increase

185
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,300
the amount of possible combinations
probably gonna take through tomorrow to

186
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:55,190
actually get that but oh well I
compositor at any time and continue it

187
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,110
as well so no problems there

188
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,710
press ENTER and apps it's still giving
me a relatively small amount of

189
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:11,220
combinations primarily because like
12345 possibilities if you increase the

190
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:18,079
amount if you press Ctrl C tragically
started it will it will go until the

191
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,660
final threat because Linux systems
guaranteed it alters will be executed

192
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:32,970
and water so it's just this one say that
and this one as well

193
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:39,830
at center its seven hundred and
twenty-six year by the this will take a

194
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:45,630
significant amount of time let's see
what else can we actually closed in

195
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,540
which increase it

196
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:52,590
oh I know I know why it's so low because
I am recording at the moment as as I am

197
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:58,660
recording at the moment that is eating
up my if my memory and CPU time as well

198
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,110
now it's gonna show you something else
before iraq has tutorial up because

199
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,420
they're feeling I've already breached d

200
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:10,970
a lot of time if you have some sort of
temperature commuters on your computers

201
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,030
and a curse you do they're pretty easy
they're pretty easily downloaded from

202
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:19,230
the next you will notice after an hour
or something like that the temperature

203
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:25,290
will begin to rise the good news is that
you can spread this file that you have

204
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:32,680
interrupt this process now and the last
passport the last thread for password is

205
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:38,420
this one just gonna go until it's
reached exxon so what you can do here in

206
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,960
order to alleviate stress on a single
machine in order to increase your time

207
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:57,040
actually use this command and specify
either my list of characters so or you

208
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,770
can actually if you don't know the size
you can do the following for example you

209
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:09,680
can tell one machine ok I want you to do
all the combinations 499 of course then

210
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:15,040
this option would not be possible any
longer he would need to delete this and

211
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:22,230
another machine could do for example
1010 another one could do 1111 I do

212
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:26,600
believe that this is something that we
did long ago in school because we all

213
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,610
have laptops and pretty much we wanted
to brute-force ascertain password but

214
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:36,970
you know a single laptop doesn't have a
lot of processing powers Ashley not long

215
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:43,600
ago a lot of Sprint actually amazing so
we actually emerged not just a few left

216
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,870
off but also house home desktop
computers we basically merged every

217
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:52,360
single computer we could have scrapped
from anybody that was willing to help us

218
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:59,710
out and we had 10 or 20 computers
buckled up together and they were all

219
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:03,400
conducting a brute-force attack they
were all generating passwords of this is

220
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,270
something that you can do you can give
different parameters two different

221
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,170
computers

222
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:13,020
executed on the captured file because
this captured five kids portable you can

223
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,350
put it pretty much anywhere you want and
conduct

224
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:22,340
a attack there anyway in the follow-up
tutorials I will show you some other

225
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,450
methods how you can attack wireless
wireless access points and what you can

226
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,919
do with them perhaps a little bit of a
more effective method method in terms of

227
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,770
time that requires far less
reconnaissance any case I bid you

228
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,590
farewell and I hope to see you in the
next story
