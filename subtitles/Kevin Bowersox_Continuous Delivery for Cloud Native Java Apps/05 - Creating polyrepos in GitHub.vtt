00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.002
- [Instructor] Let's set up our poly repo

2
00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:04.003
within GitHub to store the source code

3
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:06.009
for each of our microservices.

4
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.004
To help with that, we're going to use a GitHub organization,

5
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:14.007
which will have a repository for each service.

6
00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:17.006
To create an organization within GitHub,

7
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:19.002
just click on your profile,

8
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:22.006
and then come down to your organizations and click here.

9
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:24.003
If you don't see this option,

10
00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:26.008
you'll need to set up your first organization

11
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:30.004
using the instructions found at the link below.

12
00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:33.003
Next, we'll click on the new organization button

13
00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:35.005
to get the process started.

14
00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:37.000
The first thing we'll need to do

15
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is select the type of organization

16
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.007
that we'd like to create.

17
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:42.008
I'm going to use a free organization,

18
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:46.008
so I'll click on this button.

19
00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:48.009
Next, we'll need to provide a name

20
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:51.002
for our new organization.

21
00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm going to name mine hotel-landon-kb

22
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.005
just to make the name unique.

23
00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:00.005
Then I'll go ahead and provide my email,

24
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:03.009
and then indicate that I'm using a personal account.

25
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.006
Next, I'll need to solve a quick puzzle,

26
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:08.005
and then I can click on the next button

27
00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:10.009
to create the organization.

28
00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.009
All right, it looks like it created.

29
00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.002
Now let's move on and set up the security configuration

30
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:19.004
within GitHub that some of our tools

31
00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:21.006
in the pipeline will need.

32
00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:23.008
The first piece of configuration we'll need

33
00:01:23.008 --> 00:01:25.007
is a personal access token.

34
00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:27.005
So click on your profile,

35
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:29.009
and then come down to Settings,

36
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.006
and within the settings menu,

37
00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:35.000
click on developer settings.

38
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.003
Here you'll find the option on the sidebar

39
00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:40.001
to start building a personal access token.

40
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:44.005
Click on that and then click generate new token.

41
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:47.007
Here I'm just going to name my token lab

42
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:52.001
and then I'll specify that it will expire in 90 days.

43
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:53.004
The next thing I'll need to do

44
00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:54.009
is select some scopes

45
00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.008
to give the token different permissions

46
00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:58.008
that our tools will need.

47
00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:01.003
The first one will be the repo scope,

48
00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:03.001
then write:packages,

49
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:06.002
then admin:org, admin:public_key

50
00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:08.003
and finally, user.

51
00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:09.008
Once you've selected those,

52
00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:11.008
just click on generate token here

53
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:13.007
at the bottom of the screen.

54
00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:16.005
This will create our new personal access token,

55
00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:19.004
and we can copy it by clicking on this button.

56
00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:21.007
Now, we'll want to put this somewhere convenient

57
00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.001
where we can access it

58
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:24.008
because we'll need it several times

59
00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:26.009
throughout the course.

60
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.003
So I'm just going to go ahead

61
00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:33.006
and write my token into a file named pat

62
00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:35.008
within my home directory.

63
00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:39.000
And there we can see it.

64
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.001
Okay, the next thing we'll need to do

65
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:42.007
is set up an SSH key

66
00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:44.004
that some of our tools can use

67
00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:46.008
to authenticate with GitHub.

68
00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:49.000
To do that, I'm going to open a console

69
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.002
within the exercise files directory.

70
00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:54.005
If we take a look within this directory,

71
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:59.003
you'll notice the setup_ssh script.

72
00:02:59.003 --> 00:03:02.009
This script can help us generate our SSH key.

73
00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:08.000
Let's go ahead and we can execute the script.

74
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.006
Okay, it looks like it executed,

75
00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:13.001
and it placed our SSH key,

76
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:15.007
which is going to be an RSA token

77
00:03:15.007 --> 00:03:19.001
inside of our .ssh folder,

78
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:20.005
and then for convenience,

79
00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:22.006
it also wrote it to our home directory

80
00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:25.000
where we have our public and private keys

81
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.003
for the RSA token.

82
00:03:27.003 --> 00:03:28.009
We're going to need the value

83
00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:32.004
of the public key in order to place it within GitHub.

84
00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:33.008
So I'm going to go ahead

85
00:03:33.008 --> 00:03:36.000
and print it to the console.

86
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.008
And then I'll copy the key to my clipboard

87
00:03:38.008 --> 00:03:41.003
and we'll navigate back to GitHub.

88
00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:43.008
And within the settings again,

89
00:03:43.008 --> 00:03:48.003
I'm going to go down to the SSH and GPG keys.

90
00:03:48.003 --> 00:03:51.008
Here I can click on the new SSH key

91
00:03:51.008 --> 00:03:56.006
in order to add the public key into this form.

92
00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:59.008
All right, and then I just need to give the key a name.

93
00:03:59.008 --> 00:04:02.006
I'll call it lab once again.

94
00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:06.004
Then I just need to click on the add SSH key button,

95
00:04:06.004 --> 00:04:10.001
and there we can see it's registered with GitHub.

96
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:12.002
Now that the key is registered,

97
00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:15.002
we can start to build out each of the repositories

98
00:04:15.002 --> 00:04:17.009
for our microservices.

99
00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:19.001
To help us with that,

100
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:23.004
I've created another script, setup_repos.

101
00:04:23.004 --> 00:04:30.002
Let's just take a look at what this script does.

102
00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:31.005
The first thing I'll point out

103
00:04:31.005 --> 00:04:34.008
is that the script accepts three parameters.

104
00:04:34.008 --> 00:04:36.009
The first is going to be our email.

105
00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.003
The second will be our username,

106
00:04:39.003 --> 00:04:41.003
and then the third will be the name

107
00:04:41.003 --> 00:04:43.008
of our GitHub organization.

108
00:04:43.008 --> 00:04:47.001
It's used to adjust some YAML files

109
00:04:47.001 --> 00:04:50.001
and also it's used in this line

110
00:04:50.001 --> 00:04:52.003
that creates a new repository

111
00:04:52.003 --> 00:04:55.003
within our GitHub organization.

112
00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:59.008
Now, to do that, it uses the GitHub CLI.

113
00:04:59.008 --> 00:05:01.007
This is a tool that we can use

114
00:05:01.007 --> 00:05:04.002
to work with GitHub from the command line.

115
00:05:04.002 --> 00:05:05.008
You can do a lot of things,

116
00:05:05.008 --> 00:05:07.003
like create pull requests

117
00:05:07.003 --> 00:05:10.009
or even create repositories like we're going to do.

118
00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.006
The script is going to iterate through each directory

119
00:05:14.006 --> 00:05:16.008
within our exercise files

120
00:05:16.008 --> 00:05:19.004
and create a new repository for it.

121
00:05:19.004 --> 00:05:21.008
And that's how we're going to get each repository

122
00:05:21.008 --> 00:05:25.006
in our organization for our microservices.

123
00:05:25.006 --> 00:05:27.001
Now, to use the script,

124
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:30.001
we'll need to log in with the GitHub client.

125
00:05:30.001 --> 00:05:34.000
To do that, you'll use the GitHub client's auth command,

126
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.001
and then you'll specify that you want to log in.

127
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:39.009
Next, you'll select GitHub.com.

128
00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.006
Then SSH.

129
00:05:41.006 --> 00:05:44.003
Then select the RSA key.

130
00:05:44.003 --> 00:05:47.000
And then finally, we'll use an authentication token

131
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
to log in.

132
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.003
That's going to be the personal access token

133
00:05:50.003 --> 00:05:52.001
we created earlier.

134
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:56.004
So let's go ahead and print that to the console.

135
00:05:56.004 --> 00:06:01.008
And then I'm just going to copy it to my clipboard.

136
00:06:01.008 --> 00:06:03.009
And then I'll paste it here in the console

137
00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.002
so we can authenticate with GitHub.

138
00:06:06.002 --> 00:06:09.009
Excellent, it looks like we're authenticated.

139
00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:12.002
Okay, let's go ahead and run the script

140
00:06:12.002 --> 00:06:14.005
to set up our repositories.

141
00:06:14.005 --> 00:06:17.001
First, I'll provide my email address,

142
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:18.005
then my username,

143
00:06:18.005 --> 00:06:21.001
and then finally, I'll specify the name

144
00:06:21.001 --> 00:06:23.009
of my organization within GitHub.

145
00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.003
Okay, I'll go ahead and execute the script

146
00:06:26.003 --> 00:06:29.000
and it will begin to create repositories

147
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.007
and check in the source code files

148
00:06:30.007 --> 00:06:35.006
for each of our microservices.

149
00:06:35.006 --> 00:06:37.002
Okay, it looks like the script

150
00:06:37.002 --> 00:06:39.008
is finished setting up our poly repos.

151
00:06:39.008 --> 00:06:42.003
Let's navigate back over to GitHub

152
00:06:42.003 --> 00:06:45.008
and we can check out the organization to see them.

153
00:06:45.008 --> 00:06:48.000
So just click on your profile,

154
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.009
then your organizations,

155
00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:53.002
and then click on the new organization that you created.

156
00:06:53.002 --> 00:06:57.000
There's all of the repositories for our application.
