00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Instructor] To automate the deployment

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.009
of our microservices on the Kubernetes cluster,

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.005
we'll need to set up the security configuration

4
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.009
that allows the cluster to pull images

5
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.004
from the container registry.

6
00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:15.004
To see how this works, let's take a closer look

7
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:17.006
at one of our deployments.

8
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:21.004
Inside of the deployment, we defined the spec for a pod.

9
00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:23.004
It indicates the container image

10
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:25.007
that will run inside of our pod.

11
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:28.000
And you'll notice that the container image

12
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.009
is found on the GitHub Container registry.

13
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.004
So in order for the cluster to pull that image,

14
00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:37.009
it will need to authenticate with GitHub.

15
00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:42.001
Now to do that, we've configured an imagePullSecret.

16
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.007
The PullSecret's name is regcred.

17
00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:47.001
It's going to be a secret that we'll create

18
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:50.006
inside the cluster that holds our personal access token,

19
00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:52.003
and that's what the cluster will use

20
00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:54.008
to authenticate with GitHub.

21
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:58.001
Now, if we come back up to the top of our deployment,

22
00:00:58.001 --> 00:00:59.009
you'll notice that it's created

23
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:02.007
within the landon-hotel namespace.

24
00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:05.003
So that's where we'll need to create our secret

25
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:07.006
inside the cluster.

26
00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:09.005
Let's head over to the terminal,

27
00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:11.008
and we can start to set all this up.

28
00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:14.005
So first, I'm going to use kubectl

29
00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:18.004
to create our landon-hotel namespace.

30
00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:20.008
All right. There, we created the namespace.

31
00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:24.006
Now let's go ahead and we'll create our secret.

32
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:27.005
So here's the command that creates the secret.

33
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:30.000
You can see that we use kubectl,

34
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.005
and then we create a secret

35
00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:35.007
for our Docker registry, named regcred.

36
00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:38.007
To create this secret, we need to provide the domain

37
00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:42.008
of our container registry, our GitHub username,

38
00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:46.000
along with our email, and then we'll provide

39
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.006
our personal access token,

40
00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:49.006
which are the credentials that will be used

41
00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:52.004
by the cluster to authenticate.

42
00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:55.003
Then we need to tell the cluster what namespace

43
00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:57.000
to create the secret within.

44
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.002
So here, we specified landon-hotel.

45
00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:03.002
All right, let's go ahead and we'll create our secret.

46
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:05.006
And there, you can see the cluster's indicated

47
00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:07.008
it's been created.

48
00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:11.003
All right, so that configured our staging cluster,

49
00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:14.006
but we'll need to switch our kubectl context

50
00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:18.004
over to the production cluster and run the same commands.

51
00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:23.006
So first, let's get the name of our contexts.

52
00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:25.008
There, you can see the staging context,

53
00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:29.009
which we're currently on, and here's the production context.

54
00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:33.003
Let's go ahead. We'll copy that name.

55
00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:36.007
And then we'll switch our kubectl configuration

56
00:02:36.007 --> 00:02:40.007
over to use the production context.

57
00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:43.006
All right, now we're connected to the production cluster,

58
00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:48.002
and we can go ahead and run those commands one more time.

59
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:51.007
All right, so there we created the namespace,

60
00:02:51.007 --> 00:02:53.009
and there, we created the secret.

61
00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:57.001
Okay. So the security's all set up on our cluster.

62
00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:58.007
Let's move on to the next lesson

63
00:02:58.007 --> 00:03:01.000
and start to set up our GoCD.
