00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] If you'd like to follow along,

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:03.009
with the hands-on lessons in the course,

3
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.003
you'll need to set up the lab environment.

4
00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:07.001
To do that,

5
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.003
we'll need two pieces of software.

6
00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:11.001
The first one is VirtualBox.

7
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:14.003
We'll use it to launch our Ubuntu virtual machine,

8
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:16.004
that contains the lab.

9
00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:19.001
To get started with the VirtualBox install,

10
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:20.008
just click on the downloads link,

11
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:22.009
on the VirtualBox homepage.

12
00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:23.008
And then from there,

13
00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:24.008
you'll scroll down,

14
00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:26.001
until you find this link,

15
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.007
for VirtualBox older builds.

16
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:32.004
Here, you'll want to select VirtualBox 6.1

17
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:34.001
and then you'll find the download links,

18
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.005
for various operating systems.

19
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:39.004
Go ahead and select the right operating system for you.

20
00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:41.003
I'm going to choose Windows,

21
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:44.000
and that will start to download the software.

22
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.002
While that's downloading,

23
00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:47.007
let's take a look at our next piece of software.

24
00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:49.005
Which is Vagrant.

25
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:52.001
The lab is packaged as a Vagrant box.

26
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.006
And we'll use Vagrant to spin it up.

27
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:56.004
So to get started with Vagrant,

28
00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:59.002
click on the download button on the homepage,

29
00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:02.008
and then scroll down until you find this drop-down.

30
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:04.003
Here you'll want to select,

31
00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:08.003
Vagrant 2.2.18 and then select the link,

32
00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:10.001
for your operating system.

33
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:13.002
I'll go ahead and choose Windows once again.

34
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:15.001
Now I'm not going to walk you through,

35
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:18.005
the installation for both of these pieces of software.

36
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:19.008
They both have installers,

37
00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:21.001
and it's fairly straightforward,

38
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:22.001
to get up and running.

39
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:25.002
Just select all the default options.

40
00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:27.003
Once you've done that installation,

41
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:30.007
you can navigate into the exercise files for the course.

42
00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:33.003
Now let's talk about these files some.

43
00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:35.002
Here you'll see the source code,

44
00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:37.002
for each of the microservices,

45
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:39.008
within our course project.

46
00:01:39.008 --> 00:01:41.009
Now one thing that you need to know,

47
00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.006
is that the lab environment contains,

48
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:48.006
the initial copy of these exercise files.

49
00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:50.006
But you won't be able to go through,

50
00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:53.002
and switch the branches for the different lessons,

51
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:54.007
within the lab.

52
00:01:54.007 --> 00:01:55.008
You'll have to do that,

53
00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:57.006
on your local workstation,

54
00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:00.007
and then copy the changes for a specific lesson,

55
00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:02.008
over into the lab.

56
00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:04.005
Okay now that we walk through that,

57
00:02:04.005 --> 00:02:07.007
let's talk about how we can spin up the lab.

58
00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:09.004
Inside of the exercise files,

59
00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:11.009
you'll find the lab setup directory.

60
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.007
Let's go ahead,

61
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:14.004
and we can open that in a terminal.

62
00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:16.008
I'm going to use get bash.

63
00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:18.004
Once you've opened the directory,

64
00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:19.008
inside the terminal,

65
00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:23.003
go ahead and take a look at the Vagrant file.

66
00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:25.003
It's what's going to tell Vagrant,

67
00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:27.008
how to spin up our lab environment.

68
00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:30.002
Now you can leave everything as is,

69
00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:33.006
but you may need to adjust some of the memory settings here,

70
00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:34.009
for your machine.

71
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.005
You can see that I'm running with 16 gigs of Ram,

72
00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:39.000
and six CPUs.

73
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.007
But you can scale this down,

74
00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:44.003
to eight gigs of Ram and four CPUs.

75
00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:45.007
(keyboard clicking)

76
00:02:45.007 --> 00:02:47.002
Now before we launched the lab,

77
00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:50.001
we'll need to install a Vagrant plugin.

78
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:50.009
That plugin,

79
00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:53.009
is the Vagrant-vbguest plugin.

80
00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:57.001
It's going to help Vagrant work with VirtualBox.

81
00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:58.001
So let's go ahead.

82
00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:01.001
We can install the plugin.

83
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:04.001
Okay it looks like the plugin has installed.

84
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:05.008
And now we can just go ahead,

85
00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:08.004
and use Vagrant to launch the VirtualBox,

86
00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:12.004
by issuing the Vagrant up command.

87
00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:14.004
Now once we execute this command,

88
00:03:14.004 --> 00:03:15.009
Vagrant will start to launch,

89
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:16.009
our virtual machine,

90
00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.001
containing the lab environment.

91
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.009
It can take anywhere between 10 and 45 minutes,

92
00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:25.000
depending upon the speed of your network connection.

93
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.008
So you'll want to keep an eye on it,

94
00:03:26.008 --> 00:03:30.009
in case there's a dialogue where you'll have to click okay.

95
00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:32.008
While we wait for the lab to spin up,

96
00:03:32.008 --> 00:03:33.007
let's go ahead,

97
00:03:33.007 --> 00:03:36.000
and we can get started on some of our lessons.
