00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] Let's start building

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:04.002
our first Jenkins pipeline.

3
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:07.002
We'll create it within the room service project,

4
00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:10.008
which you'll notice I've switched over to use Maven.

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:12.002
When working with Jenkins,

6
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:15.000
the pipeline is written within a Jenkins file

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.009
that's normally placed in the root directory of a project.

8
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.005
Let's go ahead and we can create this file with Eclipse.

9
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.008
Just right click on the project,

10
00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:28.006
then go to new and then come down here and click file.

11
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:31.003
Then just name the file Jenkins file.

12
00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:34.002
Now, one thing to really look out for here,

13
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:37.000
make sure the F is lowercase.

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If you have the name correct, go ahead and hit finish

15
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.001
and that will create our new Jenkins file inside of Eclipse.

16
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.006
Eventually we'll need to create a Jenkins file

17
00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:48.001
for each microservice,

18
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:50.006
but for now let's work in this project

19
00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:53.005
and we'll make the script generic enough that later

20
00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:57.006
we can just drop it into the other projects.

21
00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:59.003
Inside of this Jenkins file

22
00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:01.008
is where we'll define our pipeline.

23
00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:04.003
The code in the file uses a DSL

24
00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:06.001
that has a declarative syntax

25
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:09.002
which is very similar to Groovy.

26
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.003
Within eclipse, I've already installed

27
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.006
the Jenkins editor plugin,

28
00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:16.006
it provides some code completion and syntax highlighting

29
00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:19.005
that'll help us write our pipeline.

30
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:22.003
To start out, we'll need to add a pipeline block

31
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:23.008
in the Jenkins file.

32
00:01:23.008 --> 00:01:25.008
It holds all of the stages and steps

33
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:28.005
that we want to include within our pipeline.

34
00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:32.008
It's really where we define all the actions in the build.

35
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:34.006
After declaring our pipeline,

36
00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:38.002
we need to specify what agent the pipeline will run on.

37
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:41.003
Here, I'm going to go ahead and set this to any,

38
00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:43.008
this will cause a new workspace to be created

39
00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:47.009
for the pipeline and an executer to be allocated for it.

40
00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.000
The workspace is like a folder where the pipeline stores

41
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.008
all of its files and the executer will run the pipeline

42
00:01:54.008 --> 00:01:57.002
on one of Jenkins nodes.

43
00:01:57.002 --> 00:01:59.001
Let's save our file and then we'll head over

44
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:02.007
to the Jenkins configuration and I'll show you what I mean.

45
00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:03.008
Once you're in Jenkins,

46
00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:06.005
go ahead and click on the manage Jenkins option

47
00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:11.000
on the sidebar and then click on manage nodes.

48
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.008
Here, you'll see the master node for our Jenkins server.

49
00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:16.005
Let's click on that.

50
00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:17.008
And then we're going to go ahead

51
00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:20.008
and click on its configuration.

52
00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:24.007
So in Jenkins, a node is a system that builds can be sent

53
00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:27.007
to by the central Jenkins controller.

54
00:02:27.007 --> 00:02:30.002
This allows the work performed by Jenkins

55
00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:33.002
like our builds to be distributed and scaled

56
00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:35.005
across a number of hosts.

57
00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:37.002
In a typical corporate environment,

58
00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:40.003
you'll find many nodes connected to Jenkins,

59
00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:42.005
but in our lab, we're just going to be running

60
00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:46.008
the Jenkins controller and builds on the same system.

61
00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:50.003
Now, if you're running part of your build in a container,

62
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:53.006
it's important these nodes have Docker installed on them,

63
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:56.003
and we do have Docker in the lab.

64
00:02:56.003 --> 00:02:59.007
Now at the moment we have two executor's on our node,

65
00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:02.001
but I'm going to go ahead and increase this to five

66
00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:05.006
that way we can run more builds at the same time.

67
00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:07.006
Once you've upped the number of executor's

68
00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:09.003
just go ahead and hit save,

69
00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:13.005
that way those changes are applied to our master node.

70
00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:15.003
So now we have a Jenkins file,

71
00:03:15.003 --> 00:03:18.009
a skeleton for a pipeline and a few more executor's.

72
00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:21.009
In our next lesson, we'll expand upon this pipeline

73
00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:26.000
to establish the stages in our CI process.
