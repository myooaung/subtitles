00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.007
- [Instructor] Packaging modern Java applications

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:05.007
within containers has become a popular practice

3
00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:07.009
because it's a consistent and portable way

4
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.000
to run your software.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.002
Let's take a closer look at containers

6
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.002
and how they impact the way we build

7
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:17.006
and run modern Java applications.

8
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:20.008
Containers allow us to easily package our application

9
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:23.001
with its entire dependency stack

10
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:27.007
into a single executable unit known as a container image.

11
00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:29.004
When building container images,

12
00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:32.001
we first need to package our Java application

13
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:37.000
into an executable jar that includes an embedded server.

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.003
Then we add other dependencies to run the application

15
00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:41.004
to the image.

16
00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:43.004
So inside of the container,

17
00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:46.002
we might place some configuration files necessary

18
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:48.005
to run the app.

19
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:50.000
But we don't stop there.

20
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.009
We'll also include the JVM inside the image

21
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:54.009
and a separate file system

22
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:58.004
that mirrors the host operating system.

23
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:00.007
So you wind up with the single artifact,

24
00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:04.004
the container image that contains not only the application,

25
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:06.008
but its environment as well.

26
00:01:06.008 --> 00:01:08.007
Once we've built a container image,

27
00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:12.000
we can install a container runtime on any host

28
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.002
and deploy the image there to run.

29
00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:18.003
Containers make our applications very portable.

30
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:20.005
We can deploy the same container image

31
00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:24.001
to multiple environments and expect the same results.

32
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:27.004
So if you deploy an image to the staging environment

33
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:29.003
and then deploy it to production,

34
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:31.001
you don't have to worry about a mismatch

35
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:32.008
between the environments.

36
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:35.002
That's because the environment is packaged

37
00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:39.002
inside the container along with the application.

38
00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:42.004
Within the CI pipeline for a containerized app,

39
00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:44.002
the last step is responsible

40
00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:46.007
for building the container image and storing it

41
00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:49.001
within a container registry.

42
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:50.008
Once stored in a registry,

43
00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:53.008
the image can be retrieved and deployed to an environment

44
00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:55.008
where it will run.

45
00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:58.004
To achieve this, our pipeline will integrate

46
00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:00.001
with two additional platforms

47
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.000
that are essential for working with containers.

48
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.004
The first is Docker,

49
00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:07.009
which includes build kit for building our container images

50
00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.003
and container D as the runtime that will run the image

51
00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:13.001
as a container.

52
00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:16.008
The next platform we'll use is GitHub Packages.

53
00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:19.004
It's a container registry within GitHub

54
00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:23.000
where we'll store the container images that we build.

55
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.007
GitHub Packages is automatically included

56
00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:28.000
when you create a GitHub organization.

57
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So it's already available for us to use.

58
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.002
So we have everything we need to build, store

59
00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:38.004
and run our Java applications as containers.

60
00:02:38.004 --> 00:02:40.001
Let's move onto the next lesson

61
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:42.000
to see exactly how it's done.
