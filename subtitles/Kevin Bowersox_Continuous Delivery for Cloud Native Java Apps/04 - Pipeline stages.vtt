00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] Within our Jenkins pipeline,

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.008
we'll need to define the different stages and steps

3
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:07.006
that will execute the CI process.

4
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:10.000
This starts by adding a stages block

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.005
inside the pipeline section of the script.

6
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:14.007
Inside of this block,

7
00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:16.009
we can add individual stages

8
00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.006
that we'll execute as part of the pipeline.

9
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:22.002
So let's go ahead and we'll add a stage

10
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:24.006
that builds our application.

11
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:27.008
You just provide the name of the stage here.

12
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:31.002
This stage will compile our application source code

13
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:36.000
and then package the application into an archive like a jar.

14
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.008
A stage is like a group of commands.

15
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:42.001
And in the pipeline, those commands are known as steps.

16
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:46.000
So let's add a steps block inside of our stage.

17
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.008
And then the first step we'll execute is the sh step.

18
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:52.003
It allows us to execute shell commands

19
00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:54.005
inside of our pipeline.

20
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:57.007
Now, eventually, we'll be building the application

21
00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:58.009
withMaven here.

22
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:02.005
But for now, let's just echo some output to the console

23
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:05.008
so that we can watch our pipeline execute.

24
00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:09.003
So here, I'll say Performing Maven Build.

25
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:12.003
Okay, now we have our first stage.

26
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:14.005
Let's go ahead and we'll copy this.

27
00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:17.001
And then we'll build out some of the other stages

28
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:20.005
within our CI process.

29
00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:22.007
After the application's built,

30
00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:25.000
we'll need to create a container image

31
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.007
that we'll use to run the application.

32
00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:30.006
So here, I'm just going to update the name of the stage

33
00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:32.007
to Build Container Image,

34
00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:35.000
and then we'll change the output to the console

35
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.002
to reflect that.

36
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:41.002
Okay, now we have the stage that builds our container image.

37
00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:44.003
After that, we'll need to publish the image

38
00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:46.005
to a container registry.

39
00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:50.004
So let's add a final stage into our pipeline

40
00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:52.002
and we'll update the name

41
00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:55.004
to indicate that we're publishing the image.

42
00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:56.005
And then once again,

43
00:01:56.005 --> 00:01:58.001
we'll change the output

44
00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:00.004
so that we can see that information

45
00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:03.002
as our pipeline executes.

46
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:05.004
So now, our pipeline starting to shape up,

47
00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:08.002
we have three stages that correspond with the work

48
00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:10.008
we'll perform in CI process.

49
00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:13.003
But right now, our pipeline isn't generic enough

50
00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:15.005
to build each of our services.

51
00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:18.000
Let's pick up there in our next lesson.
