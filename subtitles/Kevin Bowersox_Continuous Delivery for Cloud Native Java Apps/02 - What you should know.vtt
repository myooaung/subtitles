00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] Before we take a closer look at how

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.007
to build and deliver Java apps,

3
00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:07.009
let's talk a bit about who this course is for and what you

4
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.002
should know ahead of time.

5
00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:13.007
The course is designed for Java developers and operations

6
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:16.008
engineers that are responsible for delivering changes to

7
00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:19.000
Java applications.

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.004
It explores the techniques, platforms, and tools

9
00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:25.001
used to create an automated delivery process

10
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.006
for modern Java apps.

11
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.007
The course focuses on the mechanics of an automated

12
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:34.005
pipeline and while we'll discuss testing and verification,

13
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:37.005
the hands-on lessons do leave this part out

14
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:40.001
just to keep things concise.

15
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.009
That's because there's a lot of technologies packed

16
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:46.004
into the course that stack on top of each other.

17
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.003
And that brings me to my next point.

18
00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:50.006
If you're just beginning to learn Java,

19
00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:53.001
or you're not familiar with tools like Git,

20
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:56.006
there might be better courses for you at this point.

21
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:59.000
To help us work with these technologies.

22
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.005
I've created a lab environment within an

23
00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:03.007
Ubuntu virtual machine.

24
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:06.008
To run the lab you'll need Virtual Box, Vagrant,

25
00:01:06.008 --> 00:01:08.009
and the Vagrant virtual box plugin

26
00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.006
installed on your workstation.

27
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:14.004
The lab has quite a bit of software installed for us

28
00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:17.008
to practice delivering modern applications.

29
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:20.004
You'll get hands-on experience with each of these

30
00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:24.005
technologies if you follow along with the lessons.

31
00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:27.005
If you do intend to complete the hands-on lessons,

32
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:30.001
you'll need a workstation with a bit of horsepower.

33
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.008
At a minimum, I would recommend allocating eight gigabytes

34
00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:37.005
of RAM and three CPUs to the virtual machine.

35
00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:39.009
If your machine doesn't meet these requirements,

36
00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.006
there's still quite a bit you can learn

37
00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:44.000
from just watching the course.

38
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.006
So that's what you need to know.

39
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:48.000
Let's dive into the lessons.
