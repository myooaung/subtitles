00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.008
- [Instructor] The evolution of Java applications

2
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:06.001
over the past 25 years is extraordinary.

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.007
The language and its surrounding technologies

4
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:11.002
have adapted to embrace new innovations

5
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:15.002
like cloud, containers and microservices.

6
00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:17.002
If you haven't followed every twist

7
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:18.006
and turn in this journey,

8
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.001
it can be overwhelming when you start to explore

9
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.008
these new tools and techniques for delivering software.

10
00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:26.008
Hi, I'm Kevin Bowersox.

11
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:29.003
Using continuous delivery practices,

12
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:32.009
I've automated the release processes for many applications

13
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.005
that run inside containers on Kubernetes.

14
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:38.006
In this course, I'll show you how tools

15
00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:41.008
like Maven, Jenkins and Docker work together

16
00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:45.003
to build and package modern Java apps.

17
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.003
You'll also learn how emerging tools

18
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:49.005
like Kustomize and Argo CD

19
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:52.003
are used to automate their deployments.

20
00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:53.007
After watching this course,

21
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:56.005
you'll have a new toolset that will accelerate

22
00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:59.005
your team's release cadence without sacrificing

23
00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:02.001
the stability of your application.

24
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:03.005
So if you're ready,

25
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:05.005
join me on my LinkedIn Learning course

26
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:07.004
to learn how continuous delivery

27
00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:11.000
can help you deliver cloud native Java applications.
