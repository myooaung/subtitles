00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.005
- [Tutor] Modern Java applications are frequently developed

2
00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:05.005
with the help of third-party libraries

3
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:08.005
like the Spring Framework or Hibernate.

4
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:10.000
Build tools like Gradle

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.001
provide dependency management features

6
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.006
that can help us include these libraries

7
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:18.004
and their dependencies within our projects.

8
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.003
If we scroll down inside of our build script,

9
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:24.003
you'll notice that we already have a few dependencies

10
00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:28.002
declared within the dependencies section of the build.

11
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:31.004
Let's first talk about the Guava dependency.

12
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:34.000
You'll notice that we define the ID

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.002
for the Guava dependency by first specifying its group ID,

14
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:43.001
then its artifact ID, followed by its version.

15
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.003
You'll also notice that the dependency

16
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:49.000
is declared with a scope of implementation.

17
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.009
This indicates that Guava is a compile time

18
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:55.002
and a runtime dependency for our project.

19
00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:56.001
On the other hand,

20
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:58.005
you'll notice that the Junit dependency

21
00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:02.004
is declared with a scope of test implementation.

22
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:05.003
This tells Gradle that it's only used for compiling

23
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:09.009
and running the source code for the project's test.

24
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.002
The build script also specifies where these dependencies

25
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:17.003
are pulled from by including a repositories section.

26
00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:19.004
The repositories block is configured

27
00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:22.005
to pull dependencies from the Maven repository.

28
00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:25.001
So when a build needs these dependencies,

29
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:26.008
that's where they're going to be downloaded

30
00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:29.000
from the first time.

31
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Then after that first run,

32
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.005
these dependencies will be stored locally

33
00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:35.004
within Gradle's cache.

34
00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:38.000
So then the next time Gradle needs them,

35
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.003
they can be fetched locally,

36
00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:43.008
and we won't need to download them from Maven Central.

37
00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:45.003
Let's head out to Maven Central

38
00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:49.003
to find a dependency we can include within our project.

39
00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:53.000
I'm just going to use the Hibernate Core as our example.

40
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.002
So I'll go ahead and search for it.

41
00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:59.001
And then I'm going to click on the first item in the list.

42
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:00.000
On this page,

43
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.001
we'll see some information about the dependency.

44
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:05.001
You'll notice that it's currently set up

45
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:07.000
to pull a beta version.

46
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.007
Let's switch that up and get something more reliable.

47
00:02:09.007 --> 00:02:14.003
So I'm going to switch to 5.5.8.final.

48
00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:15.009
On the right side of the page

49
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:19.000
you'll notice that we get a groovy DSL snippet

50
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.005
that we can use to include the dependency

51
00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:23.001
within our build script.

52
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:25.004
So let's go ahead and we'll copy that.

53
00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:28.003
And then we'll head back over to Eclipse

54
00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:29.009
and we'll paste it inside

55
00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:33.006
the dependencies section of our build.

56
00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:35.008
I'm going to go ahead and save that file.

57
00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:38.004
And then I'm going to navigate to a terminal window

58
00:02:38.004 --> 00:02:42.002
so we can inspect the dependencies within our build.

59
00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:45.008
To do that I'm going to use my local Gradle installation

60
00:02:45.008 --> 00:02:48.008
to execute the dependencies task.

61
00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:50.007
This will give us more information

62
00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:53.003
about the dependencies within our project

63
00:02:53.003 --> 00:02:58.003
and where they come into play on the different class pass.

64
00:02:58.003 --> 00:03:00.003
Now that we've executed the task,

65
00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:04.003
let's scroll up to see its output.

66
00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:08.000
Let's start here with the compile time class path.

67
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
You'll notice that the Guava dependency

68
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.001
and the Hibernate Core dependency

69
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:16.005
were included on the compile time class path.

70
00:03:16.005 --> 00:03:18.001
Now, you'll also notice

71
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:20.004
that all of their transitive dependencies

72
00:03:20.004 --> 00:03:21.006
were pulled for us.

73
00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:24.008
So that's work we didn't have to do.

74
00:03:24.008 --> 00:03:26.006
If we continue to scroll down,

75
00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:28.007
you'll see that these dependencies

76
00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:32.001
were also included on the runtime class path,

77
00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:34.008
but notice what's missing, it's Junit.

78
00:03:34.008 --> 00:03:37.008
And that's because J unit was only included

79
00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:41.008
on the compile time class path for our test.

80
00:03:41.008 --> 00:03:44.008
If we scroll down a little bit within this section,

81
00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:47.002
there you'll see that it's added.

82
00:03:47.002 --> 00:03:48.008
So those are some of the basics

83
00:03:48.008 --> 00:03:51.003
of managing dependencies with Gradle

84
00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:53.000
And you can see how easy

85
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
it makes it to pull external libraries into our projects.
