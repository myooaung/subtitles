00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Instructor] Inside of our lab,

2
00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:03.006
ArgoCD is already running

3
00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:06.000
on our staging and production clusters.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.002
However, there's a little bit

5
00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:09.002
of configuration we'll need to do

6
00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:12.003
in order to get Argo to deploy our application

7
00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:14.002
on those clusters.

8
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:17.005
To access either instance of ArgoCD,

9
00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:20.000
you can use these links in the bookmarks bar.

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.006
There's one for staging and one for production.

11
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:25.005
Let's start in the staging environment.

12
00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:28.009
Here you can provide the credentials admin, admin

13
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.009
in order to log into the ArgoCD instance.

14
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.001
Now, once we're in ArgoCD,

15
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:39.001
let's click on this gear to set up a repository.

16
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:43.000
This is going to define ArgoCD's connection

17
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.002
to the repository that holds our manifest,

18
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:49.007
which tell it what to run on our cluster.

19
00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:52.009
So let's go ahead and we'll click on this button,

20
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:54.007
and then we'll need to select the type

21
00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:56.008
of connection we'll establish.

22
00:00:56.008 --> 00:01:00.008
I'm going to select this option, which uses SSH.

23
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:04.004
Then we'll need to provide a name for the connection.

24
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:07.003
I'm just going to call it landon-hotel.

25
00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:09.009
And then here we'll need to provide a link

26
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.004
to the repository that holds our manifest.

27
00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:15.003
So let's head over to GitHub

28
00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:17.004
into our deploy repository.

29
00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:21.003
And here I'm going to go ahead and copy the SSH URL

30
00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:22.006
to the repo.

31
00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:26.004
Now, you'll recall this repository holds our manifests

32
00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:28.007
and our customizations.

33
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:30.009
So now let's go back to Argo,

34
00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.005
and we'll paste in that link.

35
00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:35.008
Then we'll need to provide the private key

36
00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:40.005
of our SSH key that we created earlier in the course.

37
00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:43.000
So I'm going to head over to the terminal

38
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and you'll remember that we placed the private.key

39
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.009
within our home directory for convenience.

40
00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.006
So I'll print that out to the terminal

41
00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:54.005
and then I'll carefully copy it from there.

42
00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:55.009
All right, once I've copied it,

43
00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.006
I'll go back to ArgoCD,

44
00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:01.000
and I can paste it right here in this text box.

45
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.004
Okay, that's everything we need for a connection.

46
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:06.000
Let's go ahead and we'll hit connect.

47
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.004
And then you'll notice that the connection was successful.

48
00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:11.007
So now we can click on these ellipses

49
00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:15.001
and create an application.

50
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:19.001
So here we're going to configure the application

51
00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:23.005
that ArgoCD will deploy onto the cluster.

52
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:26.003
First, we'll need to give the application a name.

53
00:02:26.003 --> 00:02:31.000
I'm going to call it landon-hotel-staging.

54
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.003
Then just go ahead and select the default project.

55
00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:37.002
And then we'll need to configure the sync policy.

56
00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:39.008
So I'm going to select automatic here,

57
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:42.000
and this will allow ArgoCD

58
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.007
to automatically apply the configuration that it reads

59
00:02:45.007 --> 00:02:48.006
from our Git repository on the cluster.

60
00:02:48.006 --> 00:02:49.009
If we selected manual,

61
00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.009
we'd have to click a button for it to sync.

62
00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.006
Then I'm going to click on these two options.

63
00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:58.008
And these allow ArgoCD to remove resources

64
00:02:58.008 --> 00:03:02.009
from the cluster if they're not found in Git.

65
00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:04.005
All right, if we scroll down further,

66
00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:07.005
here we can adjust the resources

67
00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:11.004
that ArgoCD will pull from the repository.

68
00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:15.008
So first, I'm going to change our staging instance

69
00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:20.006
to pull the resources from the main branch in the repo.

70
00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:24.001
Then we can select the staging overlay.

71
00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:27.008
So this will cause ArgoCD to use customize

72
00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:30.001
to apply the staging overlay

73
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:35.000
when it's determining what needs to run on the cluster.

74
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.005
All right, now if we scroll down here,

75
00:03:36.005 --> 00:03:39.006
we'll just select this option for our cluster URL,

76
00:03:39.006 --> 00:03:42.004
and then we need to provide the namespace

77
00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:46.000
where we want these resources to be applied.

78
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.009
So you'll recall

79
00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:49.007
that we're using the landon-hotel namespace.

80
00:03:49.007 --> 00:03:52.005
That's where we created our secret.

81
00:03:52.005 --> 00:03:53.008
And then if we scroll down,

82
00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:57.004
you can see that ArgoCD recognizes

83
00:03:57.004 --> 00:04:00.008
that our repository is using customize.

84
00:04:00.008 --> 00:04:03.005
Now, we don't have to adjust anything here.

85
00:04:03.005 --> 00:04:05.003
So let's just go ahead

86
00:04:05.003 --> 00:04:08.008
and we can create our application.

87
00:04:08.008 --> 00:04:13.005
Okay, so while ArgoCD is deploying those resources

88
00:04:13.005 --> 00:04:15.005
on our staging cluster,

89
00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:18.005
let's head over to our production cluster.

90
00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:21.009
And we can start to configure the production environment.

91
00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:26.002
Once again, the credentials are admin, admin.

92
00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:28.007
And then we're just going to walk through the same process.

93
00:04:28.007 --> 00:04:31.004
So I'm going to go pretty quickly here.

94
00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:32.009
We'll click on this option,

95
00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.009
then we'll select the repositories,

96
00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.006
and then we'll select the SSH option.

97
00:04:37.006 --> 00:04:40.004
We'll go ahead, give this a name.

98
00:04:40.004 --> 00:04:45.009
Then we'll need grab our URL once again.

99
00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.008
We'll just paste that in there.

100
00:04:47.008 --> 00:04:49.009
Then we'll go back to the terminal.

101
00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:55.000
And we'll copy our private key.

102
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.003
Then we can paste that in to the text box

103
00:04:57.003 --> 00:04:59.006
and create our connection.

104
00:04:59.006 --> 00:05:01.009
All right, it looks like it's successful.

105
00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.005
Now let's create the app.

106
00:05:04.005 --> 00:05:10.003
And here we'll name this landon-hotel-prod.

107
00:05:10.003 --> 00:05:12.005
Once again, we'll select the default project,

108
00:05:12.005 --> 00:05:14.009
the automatic sync policy.

109
00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:18.002
We'll allow it to prune and self-heal.

110
00:05:18.002 --> 00:05:20.002
Then we'll scroll down.

111
00:05:20.002 --> 00:05:21.009
Now, this next part's important.

112
00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.009
We only want production to pull the manifest

113
00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:26.006
from the release branch.

114
00:05:26.006 --> 00:05:29.003
So let's go ahead, we'll enter the name release

115
00:05:29.003 --> 00:05:30.007
for the branch.

116
00:05:30.007 --> 00:05:32.005
And then we'll go back to GitHub

117
00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:34.009
and we can create that branch.

118
00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.007
All we need to do is click on this dropdown

119
00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:41.000
and then type the word release.

120
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.008
And then we can click on this option

121
00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:45.001
to create the release branch.

122
00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:47.001
Okay, now we have the branch.

123
00:05:47.001 --> 00:05:49.001
Let's go back to ArgoCD

124
00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:52.005
and we can continue our configuration.

125
00:05:52.005 --> 00:05:54.006
Now, for the path, I'm going to go ahead

126
00:05:54.006 --> 00:05:58.008
and enter overlays/production.

127
00:05:58.008 --> 00:06:00.008
This will cause the production overlay

128
00:06:00.008 --> 00:06:03.004
to be applied by ArgoCD

129
00:06:03.004 --> 00:06:05.009
when it determines what resources need

130
00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.005
to run on the cluster.

131
00:06:08.005 --> 00:06:10.001
All right, now let's scroll down.

132
00:06:10.001 --> 00:06:13.006
We can select this option for our cluster URL.

133
00:06:13.006 --> 00:06:17.007
Once again, our namespace is landon-hotel.

134
00:06:17.007 --> 00:06:20.009
And that should complete our application configuration

135
00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.008
for the production instance of ArgoCD.

136
00:06:24.008 --> 00:06:27.002
All right, let's go ahead and we'll click on the button

137
00:06:27.002 --> 00:06:30.004
to create the app.

138
00:06:30.004 --> 00:06:32.006
There you can see ArgoCD is starting

139
00:06:32.006 --> 00:06:35.008
to sync the resources from the Git repository

140
00:06:35.008 --> 00:06:39.008
onto the cluster.

141
00:06:39.008 --> 00:06:41.004
Right now it looks like it's pulling

142
00:06:41.004 --> 00:06:45.003
the different container images.

143
00:06:45.003 --> 00:06:49.000
Now we're starting to see a few of the pods come online,

144
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.006
and it looks like our app is up.

145
00:06:51.006 --> 00:06:53.000
All right, now to hit the app,

146
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.001
let's go back to the application section

147
00:06:56.001 --> 00:06:59.007
and then here, we can click on this first link.

148
00:06:59.007 --> 00:07:01.000
It might take a second though

149
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.008
for the app to spin up.

150
00:07:02.008 --> 00:07:06.009
Let's just give it a minute and then we'll refresh.

151
00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.000
All right, excellent.

152
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
We have our application up and running

153
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and we're in production.
