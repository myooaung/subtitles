00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.008
- Let's take a closer look at the structure and key files

2
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:08.000
within our new Gradle build.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.003
When we configured our build with Gradle's init plugin,

4
00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:14.000
it created a multi-project build,

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.005
and here we can see its layout.

6
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:21.008
This project type is what Gradle recommends for most builds.

7
00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:24.000
Within the root of this build we'll find the

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.004
settings dot Gradle file.

9
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:28.004
It defines the configuration and

10
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:33.004
layout of our multi project build.

11
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:37.007
Let's take a closer look at how this configuration works.

12
00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:38.009
Within this file,

13
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:42.006
we can define other sub projects within the build.

14
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:46.002
Those sub projects are added by using the include statement

15
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:48.002
that we see here.

16
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:49.007
Currently within our build,

17
00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:53.000
we only have a single sub project named app,

18
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.001
but we could include others by adding another include

19
00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:01.004
statement, if we needed to.

20
00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:05.000
If we return to the root of our project and inspect it,

21
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
you'll notice it contains the app directory,

22
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.006
which corresponds with the sub project in the

23
00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:15.000
settings dot Gradle file.

24
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Let's take a closer look at the layout and contents of the

25
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.005
sub project.

26
00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:24.004
This directory contains the sub projects build script

27
00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:26.006
and a directory that holds all of the

28
00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:31.002
source files for the project.

29
00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:34.004
The build script is located inside the root of the sub

30
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:40.005
project within a file named build dot gradle.

31
00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:43.007
Let's open that up and take a quick look at it.

32
00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:46.006
You'll recall that when we initialized our project,

33
00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:49.001
we selected the groovy DSL.

34
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:51.000
Here you can get a feel for how

35
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.008
it's used to define resources

36
00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:54.006
like dependencies, plugins,

37
00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:59.000
and tasks that are necessary to build our sub project.

38
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.001
When you're using Gradle, the build script is

39
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:03.001
very important and we'll spend quite

40
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:06.002
a bit of time working with it.

41
00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:08.004
For now, let's return to our project

42
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:09.009
and take a closer look at the

43
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.004
structure of our app sub project.

44
00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:17.001
The Gradle Java plugins define a default structure for

45
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:19.004
where the different source files are located

46
00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:21.008
within this directory.

47
00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:24.005
They expect us to place the source code and

48
00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:27.001
configuration files for the application

49
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:30.006
and its tests within the source directory.

50
00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:33.000
By default, your application source code

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.007
is placed inside of the source

52
00:02:34.007 --> 00:02:37.008
main Java directory and then a separate directory,

53
00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:40.005
source test Java, is where the source code

54
00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:42.009
for the tests are placed.

55
00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:45.002
Inside of both of these directories is a

56
00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:47.006
resources directory, where we can provide

57
00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:49.008
things like configuration files for the

58
00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:52.007
application or the tests.

59
00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:54.007
If you need to, you can override

60
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:57.000
these directories by configuring custom

61
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.005
locations, known as source sets.

62
00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:03.007
However, for most cases it's best to stick with this layout.

63
00:03:03.007 --> 00:03:06.006
These standard directory conventions allow Gradle

64
00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:09.008
to find files it needs for specific tasks,

65
00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:12.002
like compiling our source code.

66
00:03:12.002 --> 00:03:14.008
Now that we've seen the structure of a Gradle build,

67
00:03:14.008 --> 00:03:16.002
and some of its conventions,

68
00:03:16.002 --> 00:03:18.006
let's move on to the next lesson to learn

69
00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:22.000
another way that we can perform a build with Gradle.
