00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Narrator] Within the lab environment,

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.008
there's a Jenkins server that we can use to automate

3
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:09.000
the continuous integration process for our microservices.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.003
To access Jenkins, click this link on the bookmarks bar.

5
00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:16.006
It will navigate to local host on port 8080,

6
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:18.006
where Jenkins is served.

7
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:20.005
Once you land on this page,

8
00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:24.001
go ahead and click this option to log into Jenkins.

9
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:28.008
Here we'll use the credentials admin, admin to log in.

10
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:31.002
Once you've entered those just hit the sign in button,

11
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:34.001
and that will take you into Jenkins.

12
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.007
Now, inside of this Jenkins installation,

13
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:38.009
there are several plugins pre-installed

14
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:41.006
that will help us build out our pipeline.

15
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:43.002
Let's go take a look at those.

16
00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:46.007
So come over here and click on manage Jenkins.

17
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:51.004
And then we can click on this option to manage the plugins.

18
00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:52.002
On this tab,

19
00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:54.009
we can see all the plugins that are installed

20
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:57.001
within the Jenkins server.

21
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.007
Here I'm just going to filter things down to pipeline,

22
00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:04.001
and then we can start talking about some of these plugins.

23
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:05.008
The first I'll call your attention to

24
00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:08.007
is the Docker Pipeline plugin.

25
00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:12.002
This will allow us to run different steps of our pipeline

26
00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:14.006
within a Docker container,

27
00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:18.004
which can help make our builds more efficient.

28
00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:20.002
If we scroll down on the page,

29
00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:23.000
we'll also find the Pipeline Plugin.

30
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.004
This plugin allows us to script Jenkins builds

31
00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:29.009
as code inside of a Jenkins file.

32
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.000
This is an alternative to building out Jenkins jobs,

33
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.002
using the forms on the user interface.

34
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:39.000
Next we're going to scroll up

35
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.005
and I'll highlight the GitHub Branch Source plugin.

36
00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:44.005
This is a plugin that we'll use heavily

37
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:46.000
throughout the course.

38
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.005
It can automate the creation of pipelines

39
00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:50.006
based on Jenkins files

40
00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:53.003
that it finds in the repositories inside

41
00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:55.009
of a GitHub Organization.

42
00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.005
So you create a GitHub Organization

43
00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:02.005
and then this plugin scans it to find those Jenkins files.

44
00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:03.004
And when it does,

45
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:07.007
it builds a pipeline in Jenkins.

46
00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:09.004
The last plugin that we'll discuss

47
00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:11.002
is the Credentials plugin.

48
00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:13.001
We can use it to store credentials

49
00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:17.008
like our GitHub Personal Access Token or our SSH keys.

50
00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:19.006
This is important because Jenkins

51
00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:21.001
will need to securely connect

52
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:24.004
to all the other tolling within our pipeline.

53
00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:25.003
Let's go ahead

54
00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:28.006
and we can set up some credentials within Jenkins.

55
00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:31.007
So navigate back to manage Jenkins

56
00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:35.004
and then head into the managed credentials section,

57
00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:38.001
here you'll click on Jenkins,

58
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:41.005
then you'll navigate into the global credentials

59
00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:44.005
and then here's the option to add credentials.

60
00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:45.009
Within the section,

61
00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.006
we're going to create two new credentials.

62
00:02:48.006 --> 00:02:52.004
One is going to be for our GitHub Personal Access Token

63
00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:56.000
and the other for our SSH key.

64
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.004
When setting up our personal access token,

65
00:02:58.004 --> 00:02:59.007
the first thing we'll need to do

66
00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:01.006
is provide our GitHub username,

67
00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:06.006
and then we'll need to fetch our personal access token.

68
00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:08.005
You'll recall that earlier in the course,

69
00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:12.007
I placed mine within a PAT file in my home directory.

70
00:03:12.007 --> 00:03:15.002
So I'm just going to write that out to the console,

71
00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:16.007
copy the value,

72
00:03:16.007 --> 00:03:19.001
and then I'll return to Jenkins and paste it

73
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.004
as the password.

74
00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:25.001
Next we'll need to provide an ID for this credential.

75
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:29.004
I'm going to call it, github-pat.

76
00:03:29.004 --> 00:03:30.004
And then if we'd like,

77
00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:33.005
we can go ahead and we can add a little description

78
00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:35.002
about this credential.

79
00:03:35.002 --> 00:03:36.004
Okay, let's go ahead

80
00:03:36.004 --> 00:03:40.005
and we'll set up our GitHub Personal Access Token.

81
00:03:40.005 --> 00:03:41.004
All right,

82
00:03:41.004 --> 00:03:42.008
we're going to make one more credential

83
00:03:42.008 --> 00:03:44.007
and that's going to be our SSH key.

84
00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:47.004
So click on add credentials,

85
00:03:47.004 --> 00:03:51.001
and then here you'll want to select SSH username

86
00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:52.008
with private key.

87
00:03:52.008 --> 00:03:55.003
This will change the form up a bit.

88
00:03:55.003 --> 00:03:59.004
First, we're going to provide the name of our credential,

89
00:03:59.004 --> 00:04:04.009
which is going to be github-SSH-key.

90
00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:09.008
Then for the username, we'll specify our GitHub username.

91
00:04:09.008 --> 00:04:12.003
And then finally we'll need to enter the private key

92
00:04:12.003 --> 00:04:16.004
that we created earlier in the course.

93
00:04:16.004 --> 00:04:20.001
So I'm going to navigate back to my home directory,

94
00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:22.006
where I've also placed the private key.

95
00:04:22.006 --> 00:04:25.002
I'll just echo that out to the terminal

96
00:04:25.002 --> 00:04:30.007
and then I'll go ahead and carefully copy its value.

97
00:04:30.007 --> 00:04:33.002
Okay looks like I got it there.

98
00:04:33.002 --> 00:04:35.006
Now let's return back to Jenkins

99
00:04:35.006 --> 00:04:38.002
and here I'll click this add button,

100
00:04:38.002 --> 00:04:41.004
which allows me to paste in the private key

101
00:04:41.004 --> 00:04:43.002
inside of the form.

102
00:04:43.002 --> 00:04:44.001
All right.

103
00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:46.009
Once that's in place, I'll go ahead and hit, okay.

104
00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.000
To create the credential.

105
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.004
And now you'll see that we have two credentials

106
00:04:51.004 --> 00:04:52.007
stored within Jenkins

107
00:04:52.007 --> 00:04:56.000
that it can use to connect to GitHub.
