00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.001
- If we take a closer look at our Maven project,

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.003
you'll notice one big problem.

3
00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:09.006
By default, the project is configured to use Java five.

4
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:13.007
That's not what I'd recommend for a modern Java application.

5
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:14.005
At a minimum,

6
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:18.003
we should be using a more recent version like Java eight.

7
00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:19.005
To make that adjustment,

8
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:23.007
we need to add some configuration into our Palm.XML file

9
00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:28.004
to adjust some properties used by the Maven compiler plugin.

10
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:30.001
So inside of the Palm,

11
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:33.006
I'm going to add the properties tag and then within it,

12
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:37.002
we'll add two other tags that adjust the configuration of

13
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:38.009
the Maven compiler.

14
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:42.007
The tag will be named maven.compile.source

15
00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:43.008
and then for the value,

16
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.001
we're going to specify 1.8,

17
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:48.004
which corresponds with Java eight.

18
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:51.008
Now there's one more tag we need to add in here.

19
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:56.005
So let's just go ahead and we'll copy this tag, and then

20
00:00:56.005 --> 00:01:01.003
we'll paste it, and switch over from maven.compiler.source

21
00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:05.000
to maven.compiler.target

22
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.009
Okay.

23
00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.000
So that's the configuration we need to switch to Java eight.

24
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.005
Once you have that in place, just right click on the Palm,

25
00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:17.005
go to Maven and then click on update project.

26
00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:19.001
Here within this dialog,

27
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:22.000
hit okay to proceed with the changes.

28
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Then you'll notice that our project gets updated to use

29
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.003
Java 1.8.

30
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:30.002
Now this is still a little bit less than ideal.

31
00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:33.003
Really we want to be using something like Java 11,

32
00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:36.006
which is one of the more recent long-term support versions

33
00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:38.002
of Java.

34
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:41.002
That change is a little bit harder because we'll need to

35
00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:44.006
adjust one of the plugins within our Palm.

36
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:47.008
Like Gradle, Maven also uses plugins.

37
00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:50.007
Some of them like the compiler or the jar plugin

38
00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:53.007
are included in a project by default.

39
00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:54.009
If we want to see those,

40
00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.008
we can click on the effective Palm tag and here I'm just

41
00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:02.008
going to go ahead and search for the compiler plugin.

42
00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:04.000
There you can see it.

43
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.002
It's defined within this plugin tag.

44
00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:11.009
Now currently, we're using version 3.1 of the plugin.

45
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.000
If we want to use Java 11,

46
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.004
this version of the plugin needs to at least be version 3.8

47
00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:22.004
and we need to be running on Maven 3.5 or higher.

48
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:26.009
So let's go ahead and we'll copy the plugin tag,

49
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.008
and then we'll take that XML over to our

50
00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:32.000
Palm.XML files source.

51
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.001
Here I'm going to add another tag build,

52
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:36.006
and then inside of that,

53
00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:40.000
I'm going to add the plugins tag where we can add different

54
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.002
plugins for our build.

55
00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:46.003
Then we'll just paste in the XML inside that tag.

56
00:02:46.003 --> 00:02:49.002
Okay. So we won't need these executions.

57
00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:52.008
So I'm just going to go ahead and remove those and then

58
00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:55.006
we'll need to complete the Maven coordinates for this

59
00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:56.004
plugin.

60
00:02:56.004 --> 00:03:01.004
So I'm going to add a group ID within the plugin tag.

61
00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:08.004
Here the group ID is going to be org.apache.maven.plug-ins.

62
00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:11.005
Okay. Now we can go ahead and make the switch

63
00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:14.009
over to version 3.8.1.

64
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:16.006
So we're up to the standard

65
00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:21.000
we need to run Java 11 in our Maven project.

66
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.006
Now let's just go up to our properties and we can simplify

67
00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:27.007
some of this configuration.

68
00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:30.002
Instead of having two properties,

69
00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:33.000
we now only need a single property.

70
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.006
It's going to be maven.compiler.release.

71
00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:41.005
So let's go ahead and we'll switch the tag.

72
00:03:41.005 --> 00:03:44.001
And then instead of using 1.8,

73
00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:48.006
we can just say 11 for Java 11.

74
00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:51.008
Okay. Now that we have those changes saved to our Palm,

75
00:03:51.008 --> 00:03:55.000
let's go ahead and update the Maven project once again.

76
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So just right click, go to Maven,

77
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.003
then update project and hit okay.

78
00:04:01.003 --> 00:04:02.002
There we go.

79
00:04:02.002 --> 00:04:03.000
That's much better.

80
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Now we're using Java 11.
