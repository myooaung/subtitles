00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.002
- [Kevin] Before we conclude the course,

2
00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:04.009
I want to highlight some other topics you might explore

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.002
and provide you with information about my other courses.

4
00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:12.004
Now that you've seen the power of continuous delivery,

5
00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:13.005
I would recommend checking out some

6
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:15.006
of the quality assurance tools

7
00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:18.000
that can be included in the pipeline.

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.007
We focus mainly on the mechanics

9
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.002
of how the pipeline can deliver changes,

10
00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.001
but there's a huge ecosystem

11
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:29.007
of tools that it can use to test and verify our software.

12
00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:33.004
You might also want to check out progressive delivery.

13
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:35.002
It introduces some advanced techniques

14
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:39.002
for how we continuously deploy our applications.

15
00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:41.004
If you like my teaching style,

16
00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:42.005
I have a few other courses

17
00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:46.004
on the LinkedIn Learning platform that might interest you.

18
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:49.005
I can teach you about other topics like microservices,

19
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:53.001
APIs, Java Collections, Spring, or Git.

20
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:55.008
If you found the GitOps approach we used

21
00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:57.002
in the course interesting,

22
00:00:57.002 --> 00:01:01.003
I also have an entire course on that as well.

23
00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:02.002
If you want to,

24
00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:04.008
tag me when you post your course certificate.

25
00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:05.007
I always like to interact

26
00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:08.000
with learners taking my courses

27
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and enjoy hearing your feedback.

28
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.004
Nothing makes my day brighter than when I hear

29
00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:15.002
from someone who enjoyed a course.

30
00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:17.006
So that's it for now.

31
00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:19.008
Congratulations on finishing the course,

32
00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:21.006
and thank you for taking it.

33
00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:23.004
Now go apply what you learned

34
00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:27.000
and automate your delivery process.
