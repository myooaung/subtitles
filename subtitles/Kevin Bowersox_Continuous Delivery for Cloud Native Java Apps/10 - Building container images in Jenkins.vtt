00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Tutor] Now that we have a Docker file,

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.008
let's build our container image

3
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:07.002
and adjust our Pipeline to perform the task as well.

4
00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:08.004
So to get started,

5
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:11.001
we're first going to package our application using

6
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:12.006
the Maven wrapper.

7
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:15.007
So I'll provide the argument for our jar name

8
00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:17.004
that's required by the build,

9
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:20.002
and I'm just going to name the jar service.

10
00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:24.006
And then I'll tell Maven to execute the package phase.

11
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:30.003
Okay. This will build and package our executable jar.

12
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:32.001
Okay, now that we've built the jar,

13
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:35.007
we can start working on creating our container image.

14
00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:39.002
To do that, we'll use the Docker build command.

15
00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:40.007
When we execute the build,

16
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:43.005
we'll need to pass in the build argument

17
00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:46.004
that we specified in our Docker file.

18
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.008
You'll recall it was named jar file

19
00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:52.005
and here we need to provide the location of the jar.

20
00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:55.005
And we know that within Maven it places the jar

21
00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:57.000
in the target directory,

22
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.008
and then I name the jar service.

23
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:01.008
All right, now that we have that set up,

24
00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:05.003
let's go ahead and we'll provide a tag for this image.

25
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:08.004
I'm just going to call it room service local,

26
00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:11.003
and then we'll tell Docker to find our Docker file

27
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:12.009
in this directory.

28
00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.007
Okay, we can go ahead and start performing the build.

29
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:20.004
And there, it looks like our container image was built.

30
00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:22.000
Let's go ahead and we can take a look

31
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.009
at our images inside of Docker.

32
00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.006
Yep, right there it is.

33
00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:31.002
Now that we know our container image builds,

34
00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:32.009
let's update our Pipeline

35
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.004
so we can build the container image using Jenkins.

36
00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:39.006
So I'm going to go ahead and start out by copying

37
00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:43.006
the command that we use to build the container.

38
00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:46.001
Then I'm going to head over to eclipse

39
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:47.008
and inside of our Pipeline,

40
00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:49.006
I'm going to come down here

41
00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:52.007
to our build container image stage.

42
00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:55.008
Here, I'm going to add a shell step,

43
00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:58.001
and then I'll just paste the instructions

44
00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:02.001
that we executed to build our container image.

45
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:04.002
Now, we're going to make some changes here

46
00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:06.008
to make our Pipeline more flexible.

47
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:11.006
So instead of passing in this jar file location,

48
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:14.002
let's make that a variable.

49
00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:19.003
So I'll go ahead and add a placeholder for the jar location,

50
00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:21.004
and then we're going to do the same thing

51
00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:23.009
for the name of the tag.

52
00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:28.007
I'll just create a new placeholder named image tag.

53
00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:30.009
Okay, now with the command in place,

54
00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:33.008
we can go ahead and create those environment variables

55
00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:37.000
that it will require to build our container image.

56
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.004
That means we'll have to come up here

57
00:02:38.004 --> 00:02:42.004
to the environment section.

58
00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:44.007
The first environment variable that we'll create

59
00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:46.009
is the jar location variable.

60
00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:50.008
So here, we're going to specify the target directory,

61
00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:54.000
which is where Maven will place our executable jar.

62
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.007
And then we're just going to use our jar name variable.

63
00:02:57.007 --> 00:03:02.004
And then after that, we're going add the extension dot jar.

64
00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:06.001
Okay, next we need to create our image tag.

65
00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:09.006
The image tag is going to rely upon the image name,

66
00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:12.003
which we already have declared as a variable.

67
00:03:12.003 --> 00:03:15.000
So I can go ahead and add a placeholder.

68
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.006
Then we'll add a colon,

69
00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:20.002
and then we're going to suffix it with our build number

70
00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:24.002
in order to create a version for that image.

71
00:03:24.002 --> 00:03:26.003
Okay, that should be everything we need

72
00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:30.000
to build our container image within our Jenkins Pipeline.
