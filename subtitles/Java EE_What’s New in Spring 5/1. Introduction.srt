00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,175
Although this course isn't on JUnit,

2
00:00:02,175 --> 00:00:07,404
we're going to look at some of the enhancements in JUnit 5 because

3
00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:10,947
they change the way we do testing inside of Spring 5.

4
00:00:10,947 --> 00:00:14,490
We're going to start off by looking at some of the JUnit

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,298
enhancements and how they've improved overall testing and then

6
00:00:18,298 --> 00:00:21,623
look at the enhancements specifically to Spring.

7
00:00:21,623 --> 00:00:30,000
