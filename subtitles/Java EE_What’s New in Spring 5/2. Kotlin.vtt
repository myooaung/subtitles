00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.418
Originally appearing in 2001,

2
00:00:03.418 --> 00:00:07.799
Kotlin was invented to clean up a lot of things that people

3
00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.046
didn't care for in the Java language.

4
00:00:10.046 --> 00:00:13.675
It was invented and is still mostly used and

5
00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:19.953
maintained by developers at JetBrains, the people who created the IntelliJ IDE.

6
00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:20.218
Currently,

7
00:00:20.218 --> 00:00:22.336
the only other language that appears as full

8
00:00:22.336 --> 00:00:25.572
featured as Kotlin on the JVM is Scala.

9
00:00:25.572 --> 00:00:30.493
Both languages got a different approach into running on the JVM.

10
00:00:30.493 --> 00:00:35.324
Scala was created with the focus of creating a better Java

11
00:00:35.324 --> 00:00:38.326
and a heavy use of functional programming,

12
00:00:38.326 --> 00:00:43.192
where Kotlin, on the other hand, has a syntax that is much closer to Java,

13
00:00:43.192 --> 00:00:44.879
but more like JavaScript.

14
00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.096
It rids you of some of the nuances of Java,

15
00:00:49.096 --> 00:00:52.322
but without the drastic syntax change that people

16
00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:55.177
sometimes experience when switching to Scala.

17
00:00:55.177 --> 00:01:00.298
Kotlin can also be compiled to JavaScript or Java code.

18
00:01:00.298 --> 00:01:04.433
It was formally embraced by Google at Google I/O in

19
00:01:04.433 --> 00:01:07.027
May of 2017 for Android as well.

20
00:01:07.027 --> 00:01:16.000
Now that we've seen some of the history of Kotlin, let's look at what it means for us as far as setting up our project.
