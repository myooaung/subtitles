Developers of large applications have been asking for a long time to

2
00:00:05.369 --> 00:00:09.431
have an index mechanism for faster deployment.

3
00:00:09.431 --> 00:00:10.434
In Spring 5,

4
00:00:10.434 --> 00:00:14.913
they finally answered this request by creating the notion of a component index.

5
00:00:14.913 --> 00:00:19.724
The index is a file that gets deployed with your application and no

6
00:00:19.724 --> 00:00:23.883
longer requires your application to peruse the entire source tree

7
00:00:23.883 --> 00:00:27.975
and develop that index file on the fly.

8
00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:31.296
The magic number seems to be with applications where there are

9
00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:43.000
more than 200 components in your source tree. Let's see how easy it is to create this index file for our application.
