1
00:00:01,612 --> 00:00:02,595
In this course,

2
00:00:02,595 --> 00:00:05,902
we're going to cover JDK versions and the enhancements to

3
00:00:05,902 --> 00:00:08,065
Spring because of the JDK upgrades.

4
00:00:08,065 --> 00:00:12,489
We're also going to look at the latest changes to Spring Core.

5
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:17,451
Spring Core was almost a complete rewrite, and we will discuss why.

6
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:21,699
Next we'll dive into functional programming with Kotlin and the

7
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:25,398
latest language that Spring supports for use and configuration and

8
00:00:25,398 --> 00:00:28,457
whether or not it's a good fit for you.

9
00:00:28,457 --> 00:00:32,139
Then we'll dive into reactive programming and using streams,

10
00:00:32,139 --> 00:00:34,788
and finally we'll look at the testing enhancements

11
00:00:34,788 --> 00:00:37,043
and changes brought by JUnit 5.

12
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:42,274
Although this is a what's new course and not necessarily a step-by-step course,

13
00:00:42,274 --> 00:00:50,000
let's cover the prerequisites and what we will use for displaying the examples in this course.
