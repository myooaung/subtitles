00:00:01.837 --> 00:00:07.011
In this module, we spoke about the Java versions that Spring 5 now supports.

2
00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:09.962
This release of Spring was significant in that it got rid of a lot of a

00:00:09.962 --> 00:00:13.422
lot of old baggage tied to previous versions of the JDK.

4
00:00:13.422 --> 00:00:16.120
We covered that JDK 8 is minimum now,

5
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.148
that the enterprise version is now Java EE 7,

6
00:00:19.148 --> 00:00:22.164
and we also covered that Java 9 is supported,

7
00:00:22.164 --> 00:00:27.153
but one of the more significant pieces is the support for modules.

8
00:00:27.153 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's look at what some of the core updates to Spring are now and what this might mean for you migrating going forward.
