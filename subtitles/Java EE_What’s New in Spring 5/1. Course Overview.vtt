Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01.858 --> 00:00:10.535
My name is Bryan Hansen, and welcome to my course, What's New in Spring 5.

3
00:00:10.535 --> 00:00:12.876
I'm the Director of Development at Software Technology

4
00:00:12.876 --> 00:00:16.087
Group and a long-time Pluralsight author.

5
00:00:16.087 --> 00:00:19.602
It has been four years since the previous major release of the Spring framework,

6
00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:22.675
and there are quite a few improvements and some major overhauls

7
00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:25.634
in a few areas that you need to know about.

8
00:00:25.634 --> 00:00:26.376
In this course,

9
00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:29.284
we're going to learn about the changes introduced by this release

10
00:00:29.284 --> 00:00:32.343
and how to adapt them into your code today.

11
00:00:32.343 --> 00:00:37.015
Some of the major topics that we will cover include changes to the Spring core,

12
00:00:37.015 --> 00:00:41.506
functional programming with Kotlin, reactive programming using WebFlux,

13
00:00:41.506 --> 00:00:45.423
and changes to unit testing using JUnit 5.

14
00:00:45.423 --> 00:00:47.064
By the end of this course,

15
00:00:47.064 --> 00:00:50.828
you'll know about the introduced changes with this release in the API

16
00:00:50.828 --> 00:00:54.012
and how to begin using the new functionality today.

17
00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.538
Before beginning this course,

18
00:00:55.538 --> 00:00:58.973
you should be familiar with Java and Spring development.

19
00:00:58.973 --> 00:01:11.000
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn about what's new in Spring with the What's New in Spring 5 course at Pluralsight today.
