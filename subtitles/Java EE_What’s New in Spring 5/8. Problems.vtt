00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:05.148
What are some of the problems with using streams?

2
00:00:05.148 --> 00:00:09.365
Well debugging reactive apps can prove to be quite difficult.

3
00:00:09.365 --> 00:00:11.032
Because they are asynchronous,

4
00:00:11.032 --> 00:00:15.104
determining when something might happen can be difficult to plan around.

5
00:00:15.104 --> 00:00:19.752
The next thing that is difficult, but only because it is still new,

6
00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:21.650
is interacting with the database.

7
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.896
Reactive databases are becoming more available, but they are a newer concept.

8
00:00:26.896 --> 00:00:31.056
At the time of this recording, Spring supports working with a Mongo database,

9
00:00:31.056 --> 00:00:32.661
but that is just it.

10
00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:36.768
All the documentation on how to work with it is actually incorrect.

11
00:00:36.768 --> 00:00:40.314
This was somewhat expected as the current Spring Boot version

12
00:00:40.314 --> 00:00:42.944
we are working with is still a milestone,

13
00:00:42.944 --> 00:00:48.338
and Spring 5 is stable, but the Boot version is a milestone.

14
00:00:48.338 --> 00:00:52.236
This will get progressively better over the next few months.

15
00:00:52.236 --> 00:00:54.734
And then one other difficulty is that there are a lot of other

16
00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:57.744
frameworks you work with that are still blocking.

17
00:00:57.744 --> 00:01:09.000
As mentioned earlier, database drivers are a current major setback, but so are calls to the file system and synchronous web service calls.
