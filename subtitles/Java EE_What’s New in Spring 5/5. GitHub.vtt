00:00:01.516 --> 00:00:02.308
As usual,

2
00:00:02.308 --> 00:00:06.696
all of the exercise files for a Pluralsight course are available

3
00:00:06.696 --> 00:00:10.108
under the exercise files link per that course,

4
00:00:10.108 --> 00:00:13.903
but I've also made all of these examples available under

5
00:00:13.903 --> 00:00:16.418
my GitHub account at this URL here.

6
00:00:16.418 --> 00:00:21.095
You can go ahead and fork this and clone it into your own

7
00:00:21.095 --> 00:00:24.716
desktop and see all of the exercise files that we are

8
00:00:24.716 --> 00:00:26.006
using throughout this course.

9
00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:29.675
It has all of the examples in Java, Kotlin,

10
00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:33.539
the JUnit testing examples, and there's a basic setup file,

11
00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:37.957
although they're usually just Maven or Gradle projects that

12
00:00:37.957 --> 00:00:41.243
you import right into your workspace.

13
00:00:41.243 --> 00:00:43.283
Since we're just getting going in this course,

14
00:00:43.283 --> 00:00:47.297
let's dive into the next module and look at Java and the JDK

15
00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:55.000
versions that Spring 5 now supports and how this has changed the way we use Spring now.
