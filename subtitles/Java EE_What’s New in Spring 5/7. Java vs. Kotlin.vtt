00:00:01.948 --> 00:00:05.436
Although they aren't necessarily fighting against one another,

2
00:00:05.436 --> 00:00:07.701
having worked through a demo of Kotlin now,

3
00:00:07.701 --> 00:00:09.117
let's look at the same,

4
00:00:09.117 --> 00:00:14.446
exact code that it would take to produce the same thing in a Java application.

5
00:00:14.446 --> 00:00:17.207
One thing to keep in mind though is that both of these

6
00:00:17.207 --> 00:00:18.860
are taking advantage of Spring Boot,

7
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.225
so it might be better to say which language will you

8
00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:24.949
choose to write your Spring Boot app in?

9
00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.439
Key things to watch for we've already discussed,

10
00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.862
but the loss of much of the boilerplate code from Java in the Kotlin app,

11
00:00:32.862 --> 00:00:42.000
specifically things like the curly braces, getters and setters, semicolons, those types of things.
