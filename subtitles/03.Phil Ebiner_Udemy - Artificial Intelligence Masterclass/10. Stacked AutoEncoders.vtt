Hello and welcome back to the course on deep learning to do it well it's taxed out in cotters.

00:05.370 --> 00:05.930
All right.

00:05.970 --> 00:08.720
So here is a normal oughtnt quarter.

00:08.820 --> 00:10.530
So what is a stacked out in car.

00:10.710 --> 00:17.910
Well a stacked out and quarter is if we add another here and there into our outturn cutter and there

00:17.910 --> 00:23.060
we go so we have two stages of encoding and one stage of decoding here.

00:23.190 --> 00:27.960
And what he gets is a very very powerful algorithm.

00:27.960 --> 00:39.360
In fact it's been shown that sometimes this this model can supersede the results that are achieved by

00:39.360 --> 00:45.210
deep belief networks so D-B ends which we talked about previously and that's a very important breakthrough

00:45.210 --> 00:51.710
because a DBMS and diamonds are a whole different type of model.

00:51.750 --> 01:00.450
They're they're based on stacked restrict Boltzmann machines and research and bosomed machines are undirected

01:01.140 --> 01:08.040
neural networks whereas stacked autoworkers are directed neural networks so it's it's very big breakthrough

01:08.040 --> 01:15.000
that's stacked out in Kodos can sometimes supersede the results of the belief networks and a great paper

01:15.000 --> 01:20.970
to look into on this topic is by Pascal Vincent and others it's called Stacked and the noise in our

01:21.030 --> 01:27.570
encoders learning useful representations in a deep network with a local noise in criterion is quite

01:27.570 --> 01:31.290
a large paper also has a banjo in it.

01:31.290 --> 01:38.740
So your show banjo was one of the co-authors on this paper as well and it's it builds upon their 2008

01:38.790 --> 01:41.980
paper which we have already referenced before.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.770
So there you go I hope you enjoyed this journal and if you would like to learn more about stacked in

01:46.770 --> 01:50.510
out callers and definitely this is this paper's a great place to start.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.200
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.760
Until then enjoy the learning.
