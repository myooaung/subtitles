Hello welcome back to the course of deep learning I hope you enjoying our encoders and this is a quick

00:05.310 --> 00:09.450
tutorial on bias's So let's dive straight into it.

00:09.450 --> 00:10.920
We've got to end up in court.

00:10.920 --> 00:16.470
Here again our simplified version that we worked with and I just wanted to point out that sometimes

00:16.470 --> 00:19.160
you will see a bit of a different representation.

00:19.260 --> 00:22.340
It might include something like this and this.

00:22.350 --> 00:28.560
These are just biases so biases mean you might actually say plus one inside each one of them and usually

00:28.560 --> 00:29.050
does.

00:29.250 --> 00:36.330
And Baez just basically means that in your activation function in bold in your in your actuation function

00:36.330 --> 00:38.110
you've got that be over there.

00:38.160 --> 00:40.760
So it's not just wait times x plus B.

00:40.860 --> 00:46.800
And probably the more correct representation which you will more often see than this one is actually

00:46.800 --> 00:47.430
it like this.

00:47.430 --> 00:49.280
This is how it should be presented.

00:49.290 --> 00:56.810
If people are showing biases then they're just out there because bias affects the Lehre ahead.

00:56.850 --> 00:59.950
The law that's in front so just be aware of that.

00:59.970 --> 01:03.230
And if you see that just remember it's just basically a bias.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.500
That's all it is.

01:04.500 --> 01:07.230
It's just a constant in that equation.

01:07.230 --> 01:08.810
Nothing more to it than that.

01:09.060 --> 01:10.560
And that's pretty much it.

01:10.560 --> 01:11.360
Just look out for that.

01:11.370 --> 01:13.730
And I will see you on the next tutorial.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.210
Until then enjoy deep learning.
