Hello and welcome back to the course on deep learning today we're talking about contract of art and

00:04.310 --> 00:04.850
cutters.

00:04.870 --> 00:10.660
This is going to be a very quick tutorial just to introduce the concept and then we'll advise some further

00:10.660 --> 00:13.410
reading where you can dig deeper into it.

00:13.420 --> 00:15.330
So contract of art and colors.

00:15.330 --> 00:21.450
It's this is another regularisation technique just like sparse out in coder's and diagnosing and coder's

00:21.460 --> 00:28.180
which is designed to combat the problem when we have an over complete hidden layer in the ancora like

00:28.180 --> 00:29.020
we have here.

00:29.030 --> 00:33.160
So the problem we have is that the undercoating can just simply take the inputs copy them into the hidden

00:33.160 --> 00:40.120
Lehren and copy them into the output before it actually learning any valuable feature extraction in

00:40.120 --> 00:40.690
its training.

00:40.690 --> 00:42.160
And that's what we wanted to do.

00:42.160 --> 00:44.730
We wanted to be able to extract features.

00:44.830 --> 00:50.290
And so what the contract about and code does is it leverages the whole process this whole training process

00:50.290 --> 00:52.980
where information goes through the eyes and color.

00:53.020 --> 00:55.630
Then we get the outputs and then compare to the inputs.

00:55.630 --> 01:03.910
Well constructive and corners they add a penalty into this last function that that's going back through

01:03.910 --> 01:10.480
the has been propagated by the network and it specifically doesn't allow the Ardern caller to simply

01:10.480 --> 01:12.580
just copy these values across.

01:12.580 --> 01:18.230
How it works how we're not going to go into detail on that because it is very complex.

01:18.630 --> 01:26.650
There's quite a lot of math behind it and we're just going to recommend a wonderful article here by

01:26.650 --> 01:28.120
Saala reify.

01:28.240 --> 01:33.240
It's called contract out and Koehler's explicit environs during feature extraction.

01:33.310 --> 01:38.830
And what I also wanted to mention is that this article has quite a lot of authors has I think five authors

01:39.220 --> 01:41.230
and one of them is Yoshio banjo.

01:41.230 --> 01:44.200
So quite an in-depth study into the topic.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.710
So from this tutorial.

01:45.790 --> 01:51.810
The takeaway is that there is such a thing as contrastive on encoders and based actually on this article.

01:51.810 --> 01:59.840
They say that they can even get better results than noises outturn callers on some certain data sets.

01:59.890 --> 02:04.080
And so it's just important to be aware of the fact that contract of encoders exist.

02:04.090 --> 02:09.130
And if you ever need to dig deeper into contract phone or if you would like to learn more about them

02:09.430 --> 02:17.510
then this is the best place to get started this basic paper by Saala reify and others including Yoshio

02:17.600 --> 02:20.200
banjo and that's it for today.

02:20.200 --> 02:21.460
I look for see you next time.

02:21.460 --> 02:22.960
Until then enjoy learning.
