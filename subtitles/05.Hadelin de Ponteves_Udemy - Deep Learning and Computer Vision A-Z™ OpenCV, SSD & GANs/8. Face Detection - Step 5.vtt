00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.020
Hello and welcome to this new tutorial.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:03.350
All right.

3
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.300
So we just detected our eyes thanks to the detect scale method that we applied from our eyes cascara

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.020
object.

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.680
We gathered the coordinates of the upper left corner the width and the height of the rectangles detecting

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.160
the eyes in eyes.

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.510
And now what we only need to do is to draw these rectangles.

8
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.360
And we're going to do it exactly the same way as how we did it for the faces we're going to start a

9
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.590
new Fulop here inside the First Folio because we are drawing these rectangles in the referential of

10
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.520
the face.

11
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.780
So what we're simply going to do is take this full loop copy and paste it here.

12
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.600
There we go.

13
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.470
And now we just need to replace some things.

14
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:53.430
So So first we're going to introduce some new variable names for well the coordinates of the upper left

15
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.820
corner of the rectangle detecting the I's.

16
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:05.040
So we're going to call them X Y and then the width of the rectangles so E-W and the height of these

17
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.630
rectangles H.

18
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.630
And that's not in faces that's going to be in our eyes.

19
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.490
There we go.

20
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.010
So for my two eyes there are going to be two rectangles and we're getting the coordinates of these rectangles

21
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.470
to width and the heights.

22
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.840
Then what you want to do is draw these rectangles around my eyes your eyes when you look at your code

23
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.840
so saying we're taking the CB2 module from the open C library the rectangle function.

24
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.390
Here is the image on which we want to draw these rectangles.

25
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.510
So that's not a frame but air.

26
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.860
Oh I underscore color.

27
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.550
We want to print these rectangles in the colored frame and then here we need to input the coordinates

28
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.520
of the upper left corner of the rectangle detecting the eyes that x and y.

29
00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:04.800
As we said here and here that's going to be the lower right corner of these rectangles and that's Therefore

30
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.390
X plus E W.

31
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.300
You don't use the width and e y plus H H is the height.

32
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.990
So that just basically gives us the coordinates of the lower right corner of the rectangles.

33
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.900
Then we're going to pick another color because we want to differentiate the rectangles for the face

34
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.480
and the rectangles for the eyes.

35
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.160
So now we're going to choose greens.

36
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.920
I'm putting a 0 here and 2 5 5 here that are to be code.

37
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.680
You can check in on 9 and here.

38
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.740
What was that about.

39
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.540
Well remember that was just the thickness of the edge of the rectangle.

40
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.070
We're going to choose two as well.

41
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.510
That's not very important.

42
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.840
We'll get some perfectly visible rectangles.

43
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.190
All right.

44
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.990
So I think we have everything.

45
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.220
Now we have all rectangles for the eyes.

46
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.630
So the second full loop is actually over.

47
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.980
So we can go back in the first full loop and the good news is that the first full loop is also over

48
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:09.720
because we just wanted to detect the faces and eyes and draw the rectangles so that over we can go back

49
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:17.400
here in the main section of the function and actually we only have one line left to type which is of

50
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.010
course to return what we want and what do we want to return.

51
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.570
Well we want to return the original frame with the rectangles detecting the face and the eyes.

52
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.620
So what do we need to return.

53
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:37.590
Well we simply need to return frame because on this frame we printed here with this line of code.

54
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.400
The rectangles surrounding the face and also with this line of code here.

55
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.900
The rectangles surrounding the eyes because our eye color is a sub zone of the frame.

56
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.310
That's what we specified here.

57
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.400
Our eye color is a subdomain of this from here.

58
00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.480
And so by printing this rectangle in our eye color we're printing the rectangles in the frame so frame

59
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.370
now is the original image with the rectangles detecting the faces and the eyes.

60
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.460
So our function is over.

61
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.800
Congratulations.

62
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.850
We are ready to move on to the next step.

63
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:18.030
Now this will just be about you know turning on the web cam applying the detect function on the streaming

64
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.140
images coming from the webcam.

65
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.430
So remember this detect function is going to be applied on each image one by one but at a very high

66
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:34.380
rate and therefore even in real time we'll be able to see in the video coming from the webcam some rectangles

67
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.810
surrounding my face and my eyes.

68
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.810
And if you're executing at the same time your face and your eyes.

69
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.820
So we actually getting close to the final result.

70
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.330
I can't wait to show you this.

71
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.200
But first let's read the code to apply to detect function and we'll do that in the next until then.

72
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.760
And I can do revision.
