00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,020
Hey guys this is adland a second instructor here.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,850
Now it is my turn to welcome you into the computer vision.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,280
It is of course and we're going to start with this page that we made for you which contains all the

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,930
resources of the course.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,020
So not only contains the code templates but also as you will see some additional reading to accompany

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,470
your understanding of the theory explains in the course.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,810
So this page you can find it at.

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:32,160
W w w that super data signs that come slash computer haif envision and now in this quilt is all I'm

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,380
going to walk you through this page and show you how you can get all these resources.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,040
So as you can see it follows the exact same structure as in the course with our three modules and it

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,810
starts with this section.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:51,870
Welcome to the course that contains the computer vision is that template folder which contains the whole

13
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,750
folder structure with three modules.

14
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,660
But don't be surprised if the folders inside are empty.

15
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,610
That is just for you to have the main folder of the course that I will use in the different tutorials

16
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,910
and then later on when you start the modules you will add the different codes and the different resources

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,790
you want.

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,070
So that's just for you to start with the right structure and then you have this second link here which

19
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,670
is the link to download the virtual platform the virtual platform is a special new tool.

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,840
In this course it contains all the pre-installed packages that you will need to execute the different

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,340
models who will implement.

22
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,170
And so basically once you install the virtual platform you will never have any installation to worry

23
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:31,970
about.

24
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,620
All right.

25
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,460
And then you have two different modules of the Course module one face detection with open Sivy module

26
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:45,300
two object detection with SSD and module 3 image creation with guns and for each of the three modules

27
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,700
you will find the same structure.

28
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,760
First we start with some additional reading so that after you watched intuition lectures by your real

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,130
Who then will recommend some papers to read.

30
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,350
Well these are these papers here that are in the additional reading section.

31
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:07,230
So I recommend to read them that will give you an even deeper understanding of the theory and then of

32
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,050
course you have the code template.

33
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,030
So that's where you download the codes and the data sets for you to execute the models.

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,710
So in the code you will see each time one commented version of the code where each line of code is commented

35
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,340
and one non-committed version of the code and that will be the code we will implement.

36
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,620
So these are just the same codes.

37
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,180
But you can choose to see the comments or not.

38
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:34,130
And after we implement the code together we will tackle the homework challenge of the section.

39
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,080
And as you can see for module one face detection with open city the challenge will be to build a happiness

40
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,750
detector and for this homework and the others you will find the homework challenge instructions and

41
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,320
the homework challenge solution containing the code of the solution.

42
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,340
And then of course new to me you will find a video lecture that explains the solution.

43
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,370
All right and then that's the same for the other modules in module too early detection with SSD will

44
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,720
find again some additional reading the code templates.

45
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,640
So here make sure to download the right code template for your system because as you can see the code

46
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,870
is different whether you have a Mac in Linux or a windows.

47
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,610
So make sure to download the right one.

48
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,220
But then in this module you will find a special element.

49
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,870
It's this one here training the SSD.

50
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,570
We wanted to separate this element in the structure because training SSD is really overwhelming with

51
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,550
a huge code.

52
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,350
So we wanted to put it separately and therefore by clicking on this link you will get the code that

53
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:40,890
you can use to train the SSD model and the other code the code here is just for the detection so only

54
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,040
for this module we separated the detection and the training.

55
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,770
And then again you'll find the homework challenge of module 2 which is by the way really exciting you

56
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,910
will see the video.

57
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,710
It is about detecting some epic horses galloping in Monument Valley.

58
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,940
So it's actually my favorite Homer challenge in the course and you'll see we're going to have a lot

59
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,970
of fun on this.

60
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,300
And so you will find again the homework challenge instructions and the homework challenge solution.

61
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:12,180
And then eventually in module 3 image creation with Gannes you will find your additional reading and

62
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:18,660
then you will find the code templates which contains not only the code to create some images with generative

63
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,580
as the social networks but also the code of the training.

64
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,160
And this time we do everything at the same time.

65
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:25,520
All right.

66
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:31,260
And no homework for this section because you will see that this is a pretty big section and that's because

67
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,160
we implement the whole training from scratch.

68
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,430
But a great and actually the most relevant homework would be to reproduce yourself.

69
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:44,340
The training that is recode from scratch the implementation of the Gannes including the training you're

70
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,140
going to see that this will already be huge an excellent practice.

71
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,820
All right so that's this page.

72
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,470
Make sure to always have it open with you.

73
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,980
It contains some really valuable resources that I highly recommend to check out regularly.

74
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,930
And now Rylands the virtual platform in the next story also make sure before to click on this link here

75
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,950
to download it.

76
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,040
And then once it's downloaded we will install it in the next Tauriel.

77
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,820
Until then enjoy computer vision.
