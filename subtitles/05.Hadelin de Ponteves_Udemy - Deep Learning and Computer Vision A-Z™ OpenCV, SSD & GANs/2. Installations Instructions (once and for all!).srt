00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,630
Hello and welcome to the practical applications of this course I'm super excited to start with you and

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,910
I'm going to start with some good news right now and this Statoil we are going to install everything

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,410
so that at no time you have any installation issue.

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:22,530
We will install all the packages all the libraries anything that we will use to execute the codes and

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,820
execute the models.

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,300
So basically this is just the installation tutorial.

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,220
And then it will only be about coding and executing.

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,450
So this is a new feature we're very excited and proud to give to you.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,330
I'm talking about the virtual platform this virtual platform is the combination of a platform that will

10
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,210
be hosted on the yes Web site.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,310
It is right now in development and a virtual environment that will contain all these packages.

12
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,040
You will need to execute the codes in the models.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,290
So right now and this Statoil what we're going to do is we are going to install an icon that because

14
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,460
we will connect this virtual platform environment to Anaconda.

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,680
And then in a flash light we will be ready to start and execute the models.

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:13,320
So let's do this let's start by downloading Anaconda and then we will install the virtual platform and

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,520
then we'll be good to go.

18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,450
So right now I'm on Google and the first thing I want to do is to go to the Anaconda Web site.

19
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,330
There we go.

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,820
And I can digest that and I can then Google you go to the first link and I can get loud and then you

21
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,420
go to download and I can there right here.

22
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:34,980
We go.

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,450
And then you choose your system.

24
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:44,890
So when those macros are Linux I'm on Mac OS so I'm going to download Python 3.6 version.

25
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:50,450
You must absolutely download Python 3.6 because it will not work on Python 2.7.

26
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,790
So that's important.

27
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:57,720
And then once you're ready you click on this download button and the download will just start.

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,110
Right now it's just starting.

29
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,490
And one minute left.

30
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,050
Perfect.

31
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,540
We will have the ANAC on that platform in one minute.

32
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,870
So that's for a teacher to get a teacher.

33
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,140
But you can click on those things that's very important.

34
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,140
We won't be needing this.

35
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,570
So so far what can I tell you.

36
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,880
Well and I can There is a platform that contains several ideas.

37
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:23,110
We will be using one of these ideas which will be spider because it's like a studio you have a viable

38
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,090
window where you get to see all the variables you create your file explorer.

39
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:33,210
It contains some interactive and dynamic eye bison console so very efficient to execute the code.

40
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,500
This is definitely the one we want.

41
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,420
Everything will work like a wonder.

42
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,280
So here we go download is done.

43
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:46,510
So what I'm going to do now I'm going to go to my download folder where I can find a neck on the package

44
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,010
folder that I just downloaded.

45
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:56,050
So let's double click on it then we will get the installation steps so it can continue continue continue

46
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,560
agree and still for me only That's fine.

47
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:07,690
Continue and install arise and right now it's installing it will just take a couple of seconds and it

48
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,680
should be ready very soon.

49
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,020
All right.

50
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,550
Almost done writing package receipts is perfect.

51
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,140
It's just installing and I can there with all the pages are going to do that.

52
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,280
But we will be installing more packages.

53
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,570
Thanks to the virtual platform.

54
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,610
Here we go.

55
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,670
That's done.

56
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,650
Now we're going to click on close and you can choose to keep it.

57
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,160
That's fine.

58
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,120
Just to keep the download file.

59
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,890
OK.

60
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:39,020
So now Anaconda is installed but we're not going to open it yet because we'll be installing the virtual

61
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,670
platform.

62
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,750
So now stay with me and let's do this.

63
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,320
It's going to be very efficient.

64
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,060
We will just executes one line of code in the terminal.

65
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,390
Or for those of you who are on Windows in the second prompt.

66
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,010
So first of all let's go to the computer vision is that folder that you downloaded in the previous To

67
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:05,630
toil and let's go inside and let's go inside the installations subfolder this installation subfolder

68
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:11,670
contains three way e-mail found one for Linux one for Mac and one for Windows.

69
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,610
You don't have to do anything with those.

70
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,850
Why not file you can open them if you want but please don't nullify anything.

71
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:24,080
These are just why a mail file that contains all the dependencies packages libraries that are going

72
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,080
to be needed for the morals that will be executed in the course but you don't have to open them.

73
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,940
What's We're going to do now is open a terminal or the Anaconda prompt.

74
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:39,380
So for those of you who are on Mac or Linux you just need to open a terminal.

75
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,490
I am on Mac so I just type command space and then terminal here.

76
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,370
Answer.

77
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,300
That's the terminal I suppose know how to open a terminal on Linux you can find it very easily at the

78
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,060
left of your screen.

79
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,760
And now for those of you who are on Windows what you need to do is to go to the lower left corner of

80
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:05,390
your screen click on the windows button then find in the list of programs Anaconda's 3.

81
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:11,270
You go inside and then you will find an icon that prompt you open the prompt and then you will get a

82
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,440
black rectangle like this a black screen.

83
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,330
And now we are on the same page.

84
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,290
We just need to type something that will install everything and then we'll be good to go.

85
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:28,580
OK so now you guys on Mac and Linux have your terminal opened and you guys on Windows have your and

86
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,140
can that prompt open.

87
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,100
And then we're going to type a command line to install everything.

88
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:40,060
But first we need to be in the folder that contains the Y MFL.

89
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,100
So we have two choices now.

90
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,340
Either you find this folder which is the installation folder through the terminal you know by typing

91
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:54,150
CD then desktop because the computer vision it is that folder is on my desktop and then computer vision

92
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:01,750
it is that then instillations that we go and then you press enter but maybe that's not the best way.

93
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,750
If your computer vision is full there is somewhere hidden in your system.

94
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:15,490
So in that case what you can do also is just take the way a male that corresponds to your system.

95
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:22,520
So for example my way email is Mac so I'm copying this I'm putting it in my main folder which is an

96
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,240
law here I can paste that here.

97
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,210
All right.

98
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:33,990
And now since my terminal is in the right folder along which contains my way e-mail Well I'm ready to

99
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,230
type the command to execute the code.

100
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:42,690
So as you want it's whether you are comfortable not with navigating inside your system that's the two

101
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,810
possibilities.

102
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:49,340
The only thing that matters right now is that your terminal or Anaconda prompt is connected to a folder.

103
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,060
And the way a mail file corresponding to your system must be in that folder.

104
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,170
So if that's the case what you only need to do is type Konda

105
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:07,570
create then minus f then virtual platform.

106
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,400
And then if you are a Mac you type Mac.

107
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:16,570
If you are on Windows you type windows and if you are on Linux you type Linux.

108
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,100
I am on Mac so I have Mac and then don't forget the dot.

109
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,780
Why.

110
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,070
Well that's all you press enter and this will install everything.

111
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,620
And at no time will you ever have to install anything else.

112
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,410
So let's press enter and let's see the magic.

113
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,630
There we go using an icon that API fetching package.

114
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:44,720
Metzer that's out and it's going to install everything now and this shouldn't take a while.

115
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,950
This should take like one minute to two.

116
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,620
Let's see something back package specifications and there we go.

117
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,640
Isn't it beautiful.

118
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,080
Everything is being installed.

119
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,430
And we won't have to bother about this after that.

120
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,980
So that's pre-reg saying that's a new feature.

121
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,130
That's the virtual platform behind the scene.

122
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,780
You know we're installing a virtual environment.

123
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:10,250
But of course then you will have the virtual platform the graphic virtual platform on the LDS web site

124
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,640
which is still in development.

125
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,700
So beautiful it's going to take maybe one more minute.

126
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,240
So let's see.

127
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,950
So as you can see it's installing some packages like f f MPEG because we'll be working on some videos.

128
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:33,200
It's installing pipe and 3.5 3.6 because by then 3.6 have some issues with by.

129
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:38,530
It's installing by George of course because it is the most powerful to implement neural networks.

130
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:43,300
It's installing open C.V it's installing side by it's installing.

131
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:52,030
Well everything we need and even some more stuff that like you know very useful bits that we won't be

132
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,830
using it but it's because of the dependencies.

133
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:57,570
You know when you and someone package you have to install some different packages.

134
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,320
So but anything you'll have everything you need.

135
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:00,870
OK.

136
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,810
So I think that was the last one to install.

137
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:10,250
And now you just need to wait a few more seconds and we will be ready to start very soon.

138
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:16,600
I'm so excited and so excited because then I will show you right now the folder that contains all the

139
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,750
models and we will test the virtual platform to make sure that it works we will test it with the first

140
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,570
model.

141
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,720
So let's see let's see what's going to happen.

142
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,350
All right.

143
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,640
Yet that looks like it's the end.

144
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,500
It's going to be the end in a matter of seconds.

145
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,100
And there we go.

146
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:35,730
Yes.

147
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,480
Perfect.

148
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,530
So no error.

149
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,660
Everything is fine.

150
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,980
It tells you some stuff like to activate this environment use source activate virtual platform.

151
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,590
Don't worry about that you won't have anything to do about that.

152
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,220
I will show you what to do right now.

153
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,670
It's so easy.

154
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,460
So let's do this.

155
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,870
You can close your terminal or Anaconda prompt now.

156
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,800
And now what we're going to do is open Anaconda.

157
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:03,640
So for those of you who are on Windows you can find it by clicking on the windows button at the lower

158
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:09,890
left corner and then find an icon that 3 but you have to find an eye can the Navigator.

159
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,520
And here on Mac I'm going to type Anaconda navigator like this.

160
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,750
It's in my apps.

161
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,800
And there we go.

162
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,240
And I can that is about open initialising.

163
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:29,660
And here is Anaconda and now the only thing that we have to do to connect to the virtual platform.

164
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,210
There is nothing more easy.

165
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,690
You get two applications on then you click on this little arrow.

166
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,150
And here we go.

167
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,370
Here is the virtual platform you click on the virtual platform.

168
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,600
It's loading.

169
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:45,340
And now we are connected to the virtual platform inside Anaconda.

170
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,550
That's beautiful.

171
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:51,100
So now the only thing that you have to do left is just click on launch you know that's the idea we're

172
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,390
using spider.

173
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:58,980
You click on knowledge and you'll be inside of a beautiful studio which will use to execute the models.

174
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,070
There we go.

175
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,440
So I'm going to quickly present Spider.

176
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,030
This is the area where you have your code.

177
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,750
This is the bison console.

178
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,450
Make sure that you have the item console and not the button console.

179
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:15,280
Here you have three windows Falak 4 or you have all your files your folders.

180
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:21,040
So we will find the computer vision areas that folder will explore where you have all the variables

181
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,470
you create and help if you need some help sometimes you will get the help to get some informations of

182
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,840
the object's classes we're going to use.

183
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:33,770
But the first thing we're going to do is we're going to go to explore and find the computer vision it

184
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,640
is that folder.

185
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,910
So as you saw it is in my desktop there it is computer vision is that.

186
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,270
And now we're going to test the virtual platform to make sure that it works.

187
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,830
So I'm going to click on computer vision it is.

188
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,180
Let's test for example module one face recognition.

189
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:57,610
So in each of the folder modules you will have to code the commented version of the code and the code

190
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,530
without comment.

191
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:04,530
So the command version of the code is the name of the module face recognition and this quirk invented

192
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:10,200
and the no commented version of the code is face recognition and is going to comment.

193
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:16,210
You can find the same for the other module to object detection object detection commented object detection

194
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:21,920
of Cummins and for Gannes DC again come into DC again no comment.

195
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,070
This again means deep convolutional again.

196
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:32,900
And then you have some other foules which are some other bytes and files or XML files or some folders

197
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,780
that contain some tools that are required for the models.

198
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:42,140
So for example here for face recognition the tools are two Cascades one cascade for the eye and one

199
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,470
cascade for the face.

200
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:48,950
These are ex-MIL files and theres just to be able to detect the eyes and the face with open city but

201
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,230
the code the heart of the code is one of these vowels.

202
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:59,300
So you have to come into the version of the code and we together are going to retype the code line by

203
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,170
line so that you can understand what's going on.

204
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:06,050
But for example I did a double clicking on face recognition commented and we're going to test it out

205
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,040
right now.

206
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:13,270
So as you can see each line of code is commented that's the same for the other code and to test it we

207
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:18,440
simply need to select the whole code by pressing command or control a and then to execute.

208
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,480
We simply press command or control enter and there we go.

209
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,410
Is it working.

210
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,700
Yes it is I'm going to show that to you right now.

211
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,550
Here it is.

212
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,740
That's the result of Module 1.

213
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,270
So hi guys welcome.

214
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,230
Welcome to my place.

215
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,980
This is actually where I'm recording all the tutorials.

216
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:45,420
So this is face recognition as you can see we detect very well my face in blue and my eyes in green.

217
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,440
So that's one of the models we implement and of course that's a very classic example.

218
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:55,230
But don't worry the more you will progress and of course the more you will get some very very powerful

219
00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:00,380
models especially the one for object detection and the one from module 3.

220
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:06,710
And also this virtual platform will be updated through time we'll add some new stuff some new models.

221
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,770
So make sure to keep in touch with it.

222
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,700
All right so I'm going to press on cute to exit this.

223
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,070
There we go so that works very well.

224
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,680
We don't have to test it for the others.

225
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,450
I actually tested it 10 times to make sure that it works.

226
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,650
I tested it on Linux Windows and Mac.

227
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,940
So you should not have any problem.

228
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,300
All right.

229
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,250
So I hope it's clear.

230
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,690
I hope you manage to get to where I am right now.

231
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,910
Is it getting this code if it's not the case.

232
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,710
You can ask some questions in the Q&amp;A.

233
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,990
We will assist you.

234
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,180
There is a great support team that will be very happy to help you.

235
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,610
All right so I can't wait to start coding all this.

236
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,580
And until then enjoy computer vision.
