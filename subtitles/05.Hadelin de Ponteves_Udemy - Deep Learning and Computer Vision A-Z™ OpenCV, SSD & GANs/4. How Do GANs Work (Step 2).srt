1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,280
Step two is basically the same thing.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,900
But now the networks have been more trained which is going to do this again to reiterate this whole

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,420
process and understand it better.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:18,450
So Step Two noise goes into the generator generator generates images which are not.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,570
They don't look as random anymore.

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:28,230
They're kind of a bit clearer and we'll understand why in just a second off once we were finishing up

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,580
with Step two we'll understand how they generate or understand these things.

8
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:38,030
But basically through the through the back propagation error the declaration of error understood where

9
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,730
it was making mistakes in the it.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,320
It's adjusted its weight and now is generating images which are a little bit more like dogs.

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,270
And now we're going to train the discriminator again and for that we need some images of dogs.

12
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,410
A new batch.

13
00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:01,390
And now we're going to put all of those into the discriminator along with the images of the dogs and

14
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,900
it will output some values so I'll put the values now we need to compare the values to the actual numbers

15
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:13,420
that we want that we know which ones are those which are not dogs the top ones are not dogs but the

16
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,110
dogs.

17
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:21,940
So we tell that to the discriminator this cremator Kalka is the era that propagates the arrow through

18
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,650
its network and therefore learns from that and the weights are obtained.

19
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,870
So next time we'll do a better job at discriminating dogs versus dogs.

20
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,810
So it's learning.

21
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:37,120
So it's now at some level to kind of like metaphorically speaking.

22
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,870
And now we want to train the generators so the.

23
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,470
So we want to get rid of that the generator generator and then we're going to use the same image.

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,790
We're going to put them through the network of the discriminator is going to output some values.

25
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,710
As you can see these values are lower.

26
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:58,840
So if I go back you'll see that the values were apparently is open for the point to now the values are

27
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:07,360
0.5 inches or 21 so they draw because the discriminator has learned what how that these don't really

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,010
look like dogs.

29
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,630
But as you can see they don't.

30
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,780
They didn't drop as low they were like dropping to like a complete zero.

31
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,040
We'll talk about that later further down when we're doing Step Three.

32
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:24,390
But for now just kind of noticed that what do we want to discuss now though is that what happens.

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,390
How does a generator kind of like get better.

34
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,860
Well I think of that intuitively.

35
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:35,000
Well we again we take these values we calculate errors because we want these values to be ones.

36
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,510
That's what the generator wanted wants to trick the discriminator and this error these errors of backburn

37
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,340
brigade through to the discriminator and the weights are updated and the way to think of it intuitively

38
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:55,390
is these networks are huge What's what we have drawn here is like these are very small just representations

39
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,950
of those networks just like images to show that this is indeed a network.

40
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,250
But in reality those areas are much much bigger.

41
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:08,230
And the way to think about it is that the there's the communication happening between the general discriminant

42
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,260
So the generator creates these images.

43
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,580
Since this criminal says hey this computer I have some images here.

44
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,350
Do you do you think these are images of dogs or not.

45
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,800
And what do you think the possibilities are.

46
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,790
And the distributor looks at them and says oh well you know those don't really look like dogs to me

47
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,270
I'll give them about 20 percent probability 10 percent probability of 50 percent possibility and then

48
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,550
that discriminators like Are you OK.

49
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,690
You're totally right.

50
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,770
I was trying to trick you.

51
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,700
These are not dogs but can you tell me what I did wrong.

52
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,670
You know like what where did I go wrong.

53
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:45,070
And the discriminator in this case my look at the images and say this is the back propagation we're

54
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:51,700
kind of like this is the intuitive understanding of the back propagation process and gry indecent the

55
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:59,440
discriminator might say something like look I checked your images of dogs you know you know the images

56
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,860
you send me and I really have seen images of dogs.

57
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,910
So I know that dogs normally for instance have eyes.

58
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:13,240
Your dogs have some little black dots which don't really look like eyes to me and you're missing out

59
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,680
on eyes or you know you're you know we don't have enough paws or you don't have tails and your dogs

60
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,480
those don't look like dogs to me or they're not.

61
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,580
They don't look three dimensional enough they look very flat dogs and all three look three dimensional

62
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,130
to me.

63
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,490
So and that's this process of back propagation.

64
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:35,230
This error is actually that's what it's kind of like overall in human language telling that discriminate

65
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:42,530
the generator but in reality of course it's just telling the generator that hey you know you got to

66
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,970
go to this part of your image doesn't feel right.

67
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,130
This part of the image doesn't feel right and just basically dealing with individual pixels and how

68
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,790
it's how they should be updated for these images to better resemble dogs.

69
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,750
And then the weights of the neural network are up.

70
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,440
So the next time we'll do a better job the generator.

71
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,390
So step three.
