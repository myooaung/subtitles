00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,670
Hey guys welcome back to the deploring and Chad part is that of course.

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,640
Hope you're enjoying the show so far.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,460
And in this video we're going to have a quick walk through Africa.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,890
I wanted to show you around what life is like here.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,770
Now while we have this walk I also wanted to give you a quick heads up.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:24,010
You did me very soon is going to ask you to leave early for this course now.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,020
I know it can be difficult to judge the quality and value of a course this early on.

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,770
However the enemy review system has simply changed and they're asking you to leave review earlier and

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,380
earlier on in the course.

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,680
Now having said that we're not going to ask for a five star review but what we would like to ask is

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:45,090
that if you are not yet familiar enough with the Course to rated 5 stars then please scroll through

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,550
tutorials.

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,800
Please have a look at the different topics that recover from both the intuition and practical side of

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,010
things.

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:56,260
All the wonderful things that you will learn in the course and hopefully seeing that will give you the

16
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,230
confidence to write this course after course.

17
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,090
If on the other hand you feel that something is wrong with the course if you are unsatisfied about something

18
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,370
then before you write the course please let us know.

19
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,970
You can contact the superdense and support team directly or you can leave us a message in the course

20
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:13,800
Q&amp;A.

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,120
We will see if you'd like and we will get back to you or fix whatever the issue is you're seeing is

22
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,360
and hopefully once that is done that will give you the confidence to rate this course a five star course.

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,250
Now on that note if something is on please let us know.

24
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,660
But if you are satisfied about everything if you're having fun and you're looking forward to the journey

25
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:37,060
ahead then and you think that this is indeed a five star course and police raid it appropriately so

26
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,910
that everybody else in the world will know that this is the FISA court and they can learn about Chad

27
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,180
boss from this course.

28
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:50,500
Once again guys thanks so much for being part of deep learning but it is very exciting having on board

29
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,230
you've got a super fun and exciting journey ahead of you.

30
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,740
And I can't wait for you to dive into it.

31
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,210
And I look forward to seeing you throughout the tutorials.

32
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,200
Until then enjoy Chadbourne.
