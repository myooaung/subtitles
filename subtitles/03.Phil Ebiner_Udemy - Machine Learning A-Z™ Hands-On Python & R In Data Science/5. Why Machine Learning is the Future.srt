00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:05,560
Hello and welcome back to the course of machine learning today we're going to find out why machine learning

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,700
is the future.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,570
Are you excited.

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,440
I'm pretty excited.

5
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,790
Let's get started.

6
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:10,120
All right.

7
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:16,310
So here we've got a cloud and it's a word cloud and it just illustrates that data is everywhere.

8
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,810
We live in the 21st century.

9
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,370
And wherever you go this data and in fact there's even a term for it data exhaust.

10
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,510
So as you go by of your day you're constantly leaving this data exhaust your eye whether it's through

11
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:33,190
your text messages that you're sending or you're going on Facebook or just simply walking through the

12
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:38,260
city and different antennas are picking you up you're leaving GPS GPS data.

13
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,950
So you're constantly leaving this data exists whether you are aware of it or not.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,190
And probably the only way to not leave dead exhaust is to go live in the forest for a couple days.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:57,680
So that's the reality we live in and this data is is just growing exponentially it's accumulating all

16
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,350
the time.

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:04,030
And let's see how this has been happening throughout the history of the human race.

18
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,630
So here we go.

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:15,290
Since the dawn of time up until 2005 humans had created 130 exabytes of data.

20
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:22,570
So you're probably sitting there thinking Carol that sounds really cool but it is very hard to imagine

21
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,080
what what the heck an exabyte is and that means nothing to me.

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,570
OK.

23
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,130
Fair enough.

24
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:32,940
So let's go and drill into this to understand what this actually represents.

25
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:41,050
So here have got a letter a right so letter as a single letter and a letter on a computer takes up one

26
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,750
byte of data.

27
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:48,520
Now if we zoom out a thousand times we have a thousand letters and 1000 letters represents about a page

28
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,610
on a small book and that fits into one kilobyte.

29
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:58,870
Now if we zoom out another thousand times and we have a thousand kilobytes which is a megabyte and that

30
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,530
is about a book with 500 pages double sided.

31
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,790
Now if we zoom out another thousand times we get a gigabyte.

32
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:13,460
And believe it or not you can fit the human genome onto one gigabyte So it actually takes about seven

33
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:19,510
hundred twenty five megabytes of space and you can encode if you think about it you encode a whole human

34
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,840
being on a one gigabyte bus.

35
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:28,270
You'll probably say that's you know a human is not just his genome it's just his DNA it's also the life

36
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,650
experiences that he has.

37
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,430
You know all the things that he does in his life you can put that on to the goodbye.

38
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,880
Well how about Wismer another thousand times and we get one terabyte.

39
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,880
And now if you take an HD camera and you walk around a person for his whole life.

40
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:49,090
So for about 80 years every minute every second of their life and you feel everything they do and you

41
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,520
put all of that in HD video that will fit into one terabyte.

42
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,960
So that's already getting impressive right now.

43
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,160
Let's zoom out another thousand times and this is one of my favorite representations.

44
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,300
So here we've got the Amazon rain forest.

45
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:09,550
It has about 1.4 billion acres of trees every acre has about 500 trees in it.

46
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,850
So that makes it about 700 billion trees in the Amazon rain forest.

47
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:20,560
So if you take all of those trees and hypothetically I'm not saying this should be done but hypothetically

48
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:26,200
if you take all those trees and you were to chop them down put them into paper and fill every single

49
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:34,840
page of their paper with letters with text then you will get about one to two terabytes of data.

50
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:40,600
So that should give you an idea of how huge a terabyte is.

51
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:46,420
Now if you zoom out another thousand times that's where you get an exabytes on Exabyte is a thousand

52
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,910
terabytes.

53
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:56,020
So now this should be a bit more impressive that since 2000 since the dawn of time up until 2005 humans

54
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:04,210
have created 130 exabytes of data and includes everything includes all of the books written all of the

55
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:09,380
songs that we're saying all of the words that were spoken.

56
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,080
Everything that humans have created was about 130 exabytes of data.

57
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:20,900
Now in 2010 that number was already 1200 exabytes.

58
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:27,610
So you can see that in the following five years humans create so much more data then in the next five

59
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,720
years in 2015 this number became seven thousand nine hundred exabytes.

60
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:39,440
Then in 2020 this number is estimated to be fourteen thousand nine hundred eggs or bytes of data.

61
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,140
As you can imagine these numbers are astonishing.

62
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,330
But what's even more astonishing is the growth exponential growth of data that we're seeing.

63
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,300
And if you visualize it it looks something like this.

64
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,470
This is the reality that we live in the world that we live in.

65
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,250
How quickly data is growing every single year.

66
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,660
So this is an actual study it was done by DC and a sport sponsored by EMC.

67
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,800
So this is all researched.

68
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,670
Now what is not research is these lines that I'm going to draw now but this is my impression of what's

69
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,730
going on in the world.

70
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:22,090
This is where I think we have we are as data scientists our capacity to process as data scientists though

71
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,640
the data that's in the world.

72
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:30,540
And then if you draw the machines this is the line that represents how much of the data machines are

73
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,010
actually using that exists in the real world.

74
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,010
And so where does machine learning come into play.

75
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:43,230
Well machine learning is the potential that presents a potential to use this data that is not being

76
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,170
used only equipped with machine learning algorithms.

77
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:53,340
Can you step up to that challenge and make sense and add value from the data that is growing so quickly

78
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,040
in fact exponentially.

79
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:00,530
And that is why machine learning is actually a degree is being taught at universities in fact Huddleston

80
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:05,120
who is the second instructor on this course he has a masters in machine learning.

81
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,870
And throughout this course I'll be sharing my intuitive understanding of machine learning with you and

82
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:15,910
huddle on will be sharing his practical skills and applications that he's learned through his masters

83
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,240
and through his real world experience applying machine learning.

84
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:24,650
So we really hope you're going to enjoy this course and we can't wait to see you throughout the classes.

85
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,360
I'm sure by now you're pretty excited about what's to come.

86
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:32,790
And you totally should be because what we'll be presenting in this course is the cutting edge of data

87
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,020
science and machine learning.

88
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,690
Can't wait to see in the next tutorial.

89
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,530
Until then in Germany in learning
