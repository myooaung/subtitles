00:00:00.270  -->  00:00:05.820
Hello and welcome to this art tutorial and the following tutorials we will be implementing multiple

2

00:00:06.030  -->  00:00:07.300
regression in our.

3

00:00:07.410  -->  00:00:13.260
And right now as usual we are going to start with the basics which is to set our folder as working directory

4

00:00:13.270  -->  00:00:13.570
.

5

00:00:13.890  -->  00:00:16.050
So right now I'm on my desktop.

6

00:00:16.170  -->  00:00:18.360
I'm going to my machine or any folder.

7

00:00:18.510  -->  00:00:21.110
Then part two regression.

8

00:00:21.360  -->  00:00:23.910
And then we want to go to multiple regression.

9

00:00:24.090  -->  00:00:25.560
And here is the folder.

10

00:00:25.560  -->  00:00:31.230
Make sure that you have the 50 start ups that has the file and if that's the case you're ready to click

11

00:00:31.230  -->  00:00:33.790
on this more button here to set the folder.

12

00:00:33.810  -->  00:00:35.630
As a working directory.

13

00:00:35.710  -->  00:00:37.000
All right.

14

00:00:37.040  -->  00:00:44.460
Now let's start with step one which is to prepare the data to make our multiple linear regression ready

15

00:00:44.460  -->  00:00:45.690
to be built.

16

00:00:45.720  -->  00:00:50.610
So as usual we are going to use our template the data pre-processing template that we made in part 1

17

00:00:50.630  -->  00:00:50.840
.

18

00:00:51.180  -->  00:00:57.500
And we're just going to copy this copy and paste it here.

19

00:00:57.660  -->  00:00:58.650
All right.

20

00:00:59.070  -->  00:01:01.720
And now let's take care of the few things to change.

21

00:01:01.890  -->  00:01:10.430
So first we will change the name of the dataset which is here 50 startups.

22

00:01:11.220  -->  00:01:19.320
All right 50 startups Dutchie as we we can select this and execute to have a look at our set.

23

00:01:19.440  -->  00:01:20.560
Here it is.

24

00:01:20.850  -->  00:01:22.670
And that's the data set.

25

00:01:22.800  -->  00:01:24.660
I'll remind what this dataset is about.

26

00:01:24.660  -->  00:01:32.460
So this contains informations of startups actually 50 startups and these informations are some amount

27

00:01:32.460  -->  00:01:33.690
of money spent.

28

00:01:33.690  -->  00:01:41.370
So for example there is the amount spent in R&D administration marketing and finally there is also the

29

00:01:41.370  -->  00:01:44.200
state in which the startup operates.

30

00:01:44.580  -->  00:01:50.250
And finally we have a last column here which is the profit and thats the profit we want to predict with

31

00:01:50.250  -->  00:01:51.940
our multiple in our regression models.

32

00:01:51.960  -->  00:01:59.520
And we want to predict that profit based on this independent variables which are the R&D spend the administration

33

00:01:59.820  -->  00:02:01.750
marketing spend in the States.

34

00:02:01.770  -->  00:02:08.100
So we are doing this because we are doing a mission for investors who want to know in which startup

35

00:02:08.220  -->  00:02:09.830
they should invest their money.

36

00:02:09.930  -->  00:02:15.580
And so not only they want to predict the future profits for new startups based on the same informations

37

00:02:15.930  -->  00:02:21.900
but also they want to see which independent variable has the highest effect on the profit and which

38

00:02:21.900  -->  00:02:26.190
one governs the relationship between the profit and those independent variables.

39

00:02:26.220  -->  00:02:31.820
Is there an independent variable that has a highest effect than another one does the states in which

40

00:02:31.820  -->  00:02:34.800
the star operates have an impact on the profit.

41

00:02:34.920  -->  00:02:38.680
We'll find that out thanks to our multiple regression model in our.

42

00:02:38.880  -->  00:02:45.330
And thanks to this model the investors will be able to draw some insights from our results.

43

00:02:45.800  -->  00:02:46.140
Okay.

44

00:02:46.140  -->  00:02:52.550
So now the next step of the first data pre-processing is to split the data set into the training set

45

00:02:52.650  -->  00:02:53.650
and the test set.

46

00:02:54.000  -->  00:02:56.820
But is it the subset we need to do right now.

47

00:02:56.820  -->  00:03:03.480
I know that the template is suggesting that but let's not forget that in our data sets we have one specific

48

00:03:03.480  -->  00:03:06.930
variable which should strike our attention.

49

00:03:07.590  -->  00:03:13.470
Well it's this one it's the state variable because it contains category's which means it's a categorical

50

00:03:13.470  -->  00:03:14.210
variable.

51

00:03:14.430  -->  00:03:19.920
And remember when we have a categorical variable like this with category's written in text this would

52

00:03:19.920  -->  00:03:25.950
cause some issues in our machine learning model equations because how do you want to make a linear equation

53

00:03:26.190  -->  00:03:30.020
with one of the variable rigidness text will make any sense.

54

00:03:30.030  -->  00:03:38.100
So what we're going to do of course is to encode the state variable and to do this we are going to use

55

00:03:38.310  -->  00:03:43.800
what we learned in part when data processing on the we didn't include that in the template because this

56

00:03:44.130  -->  00:03:49.590
will actually be one of the only examples where we'll need to encode our categorical data.

57

00:03:49.590  -->  00:03:51.200
We put it in a separate file.

58

00:03:51.330  -->  00:03:54.080
And so right now we're going to open the separate file.

59

00:03:54.390  -->  00:04:01.360
So I'm going to jump back to my folder Part 1 data pre-processing which is here and here we go.

60

00:04:01.530  -->  00:04:04.720
So the categorical data or our files here.

61

00:04:04.740  -->  00:04:06.160
So let's open it.

62

00:04:06.390  -->  00:04:07.400
Here it is.

63

00:04:07.800  -->  00:04:14.570
And right now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this copy.

64

00:04:14.670  -->  00:04:19.850
So you have the same file so you can also take it from your folder or take it from the course.

65

00:04:20.010  -->  00:04:26.760
And let's go back to our multiple linear regression file and paste that here.

66

00:04:27.090  -->  00:04:27.770
OK.

67

00:04:28.020  -->  00:04:33.300
Then of course we need to change a few things here so we need to change the name of our categorical

68

00:04:33.300  -->  00:04:34.080
variable.

69

00:04:34.080  -->  00:04:38.070
So in part 1 it was country and here in this state.

70

00:04:38.610  -->  00:04:39.210
OK.

71

00:04:39.390  -->  00:04:40.100
Same here.

72

00:04:40.140  -->  00:04:43.140
We need to change country by state.

73

00:04:43.470  -->  00:04:46.760
Let's not forget to align this this is very important in our.

74

00:04:46.870  -->  00:04:52.470
And in any programming language we go there.

75

00:04:52.830  -->  00:04:54.600
And now we need to change the levels.

76

00:04:54.660  -->  00:04:59.670
So before you know the categorical variable was the countries in the three categories where France Spain

77

00:04:59.670  -->  00:05:05.990
and Germany and here are three categories are New York California and Florida.

78

00:05:06.660  -->  00:05:07.980
So let's look at another data set.

79

00:05:07.980  -->  00:05:15.180
Actually I will close that because we no longer needed to hear our levels are we said New York

80

00:05:18.900  -->  00:05:24.770
California and Florida.

81

00:05:25.440  -->  00:05:26.060
OK.

82

00:05:26.280  -->  00:05:27.480
And then the labels.

83

00:05:27.480  -->  00:05:33.900
That is the numeric numbers which are actually factors the numeric factors that are going to replace

84

00:05:33.900  -->  00:05:36.890
these three tests here New York California and Florida.

85

00:05:36.990  -->  00:05:39.660
Are these numbers you choose here for labels.

86

00:05:39.660  -->  00:05:40.950
So here we have one two three.

87

00:05:40.950  -->  00:05:43.650
That means that New York is going to be one.

88

00:05:43.680  -->  00:05:46.680
California is going to be two and Florida's going to be three.

89

00:05:46.740  -->  00:05:51.870
You're going to see I'm going to select this and execute.

90

00:05:51.960  -->  00:05:52.390
All right.

91

00:05:52.410  -->  00:05:59.100
And now let's look at our data set as you can see the state is now encoded with the 1 2 3 values.

92

00:05:59.130  -->  00:06:03.200
So one for New York two for California and three for Florida.

93

00:06:03.630  -->  00:06:04.510
Let's go back.

94

00:06:04.680  -->  00:06:05.610
OK.

95

00:06:05.640  -->  00:06:12.000
So re-encoding is done and that's a much better thing for our model now now our model has a greater

96

00:06:12.000  -->  00:06:13.060
chance to work.

97

00:06:13.410  -->  00:06:19.340
And now the last thing we need to do is to split the dataset into training set and the test set.

98

00:06:19.350  -->  00:06:25.440
So here let's not forget to change the name of the dependent viable here which is not purchased but

99

00:06:25.800  -->  00:06:28.350
profit.

100

00:06:28.350  -->  00:06:29.230
All right.

101

00:06:29.370  -->  00:06:32.120
And then we need to change a split ratio if necessary.

102

00:06:32.280  -->  00:06:37.590
Let's see we have 50 observations so a good split would be to have 40 observations in the train set

103

00:06:37.650  -->  00:06:39.590
and 10 observations in a test set.

104

00:06:39.750  -->  00:06:43.020
So that makes actually a 90 percent split ratio.

105

00:06:43.140  -->  00:06:46.560
80 percent going to the training set and this is already what we have.

106

00:06:46.560  -->  00:06:47.440
Perfect.

107

00:06:47.460  -->  00:06:49.920
So we don't have to do anything here for the split ratio.

108

00:06:50.100  -->  00:06:55.680
And we are ready to take all of these and execute.

109

00:06:55.950  -->  00:06:57.220
And here we go.

110

00:06:57.750  -->  00:07:01.960
Let's have a look at our training set and our test set.

111

00:07:03.210  -->  00:07:03.730
Here it is.

112

00:07:03.730  -->  00:07:04.980
That's the training set.

113

00:07:05.160  -->  00:07:11.570
OK so it contains 40 entries for the observations grades we have are encoded variable for state.

114

00:07:11.610  -->  00:07:12.840
That's perfect.

115

00:07:12.840  -->  00:07:18.530
And then a test set that contains 10 observations and everything looks fine.

116

00:07:18.540  -->  00:07:18.960
All right.

117

00:07:18.960  -->  00:07:27.090
So let's go back to multiple regression and the last step is feature scaling but ask for simple in the

118

00:07:27.150  -->  00:07:30.870
regression we won't need to apply features scaling manually.

119

00:07:30.870  -->  00:07:36.750
This will be taken care of with the function that we're going to use to fit multiple in our regression

120

00:07:36.750  -->  00:07:37.830
to our training set.

121

00:07:38.040  -->  00:07:39.930
So we're all fine we're all good here.

122

00:07:40.050  -->  00:07:44.790
We are ready to move on to the next step and that's what we're going to do in the next two Tauriel.

123

00:07:45.030  -->  00:07:46.320
Thank you for watching this one.

124

00:07:46.410  -->  00:07:48.950
And I look forward to seeing you in the next one.

125

00:07:48.990  -->  00:07:50.720
Until then enjoy machine learning
