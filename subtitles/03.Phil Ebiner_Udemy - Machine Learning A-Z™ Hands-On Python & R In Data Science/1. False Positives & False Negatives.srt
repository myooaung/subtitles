00:00:00,300  -->  00:00:04,010
This tutorial we will be talking about false positives and false negatives.

2

00:00:04,170  -->  00:00:13,560
As you remember where we were using the logistic regression function to observe where for random values

3

00:00:13,560  -->  00:00:20,850
of the independent variable will end up in terms of y had so in terms of the predicted value for the

4

00:00:20,850  -->  00:00:28,110
dependent variable and we agreed that anything below the 50 percent line will be projected downwards

5

00:00:28,110  -->  00:00:35,850
onto the zero horizontal line and anything above the 50 percent line will be projected upwards onto

6

00:00:36,180  -->  00:00:45,090
the 100 percent horizontal line and that allowed us to turn probabilities into actual predictions.

7

00:00:45,090  -->  00:00:48,710
So either yes or no.

8

00:00:48,740  -->  00:00:53,710
Now let's take a step back where did we get these four values from.

9

00:00:53,730  -->  00:01:00,480
So we took four random values of the independent variable and we just had a look at what would happen

10

00:01:00,480  -->  00:01:07,800
to them how we can use how we would use the logistic regression function to ascertain what probability

11

00:01:07,800  -->  00:01:11,320
they have and what y had values have.

12

00:01:11,640  -->  00:01:18,090
So we take another step back and we forget about these four random values and instead of taking four

13

00:01:18,090  -->  00:01:22,940
random values of the independent variable about we take for unknown values.

14

00:01:22,950  -->  00:01:26,790
In fact let's take four values for the independent variable.

15

00:01:26,790  -->  00:01:28,050
From our data set.

16

00:01:28,080  -->  00:01:32,900
So let's just pick out four values that we really know they exist in our data set.

17

00:01:32,900  -->  00:01:38,430
And we use them to create this logistic regression.

18

00:01:38,430  -->  00:01:42,380
And let's do the same thing with them let's see where they will end up.

19

00:01:42,540  -->  00:01:44,080
If we apply the model to them.

20

00:01:44,310  -->  00:01:48,060
And as you can see here the label of the vertical axis change too.

21

00:01:48,060  -->  00:01:48,670
Why.

22

00:01:48,690  -->  00:01:55,050
Because this is the we already know that in red is the actual value of the dependent variable because

23

00:01:55,050  -->  00:01:56,250
we know the result.

24

00:01:56,250  -->  00:02:01,200
Those are the people on the bottom so observation is number one and number three they didn't take up

25

00:02:01,200  -->  00:02:02,780
the offer the email offer.

26

00:02:02,910  -->  00:02:10,060
And the observations on the top people number two and four they did take up the email offer.

27

00:02:10,140  -->  00:02:16,650
So let's see what happens to them if we apply our logistic regression model.

28

00:02:16,680  -->  00:02:23,760
So step number one would be to project these values onto the curve makes sense right.

29

00:02:23,760  -->  00:02:30,450
So we just want to see where they all end up on the curve that's all blue dots over there that's where

30

00:02:30,450  -->  00:02:32,810
they have been modeled by the curve.

31

00:02:33,180  -->  00:02:37,700
Now we can and from here we can say what the probabilities are you just have to project to the left

32

00:02:37,710  -->  00:02:41,840
and you can see approximately that for a version number one.

33

00:02:41,880  -->  00:02:48,280
It's about maybe 20 percent 10 15 percent may say 15 percent observation or two.

34

00:02:48,450  -->  00:02:54,660
It's about 40 percent absorption of three I would say about 70 percent observational before about 85

35

00:02:54,660  -->  00:02:55,490
percent.

36

00:02:55,800  -->  00:02:58,910
But we're not interested in probabilities per se.

37

00:02:58,920  -->  00:03:05,160
Right now what we want to get to is the actual y hat we want to see what the predictive value will be

38

00:03:05,160  -->  00:03:11,610
so we wanted to say we want to see if the model will tell us are these people going to take up off or

39

00:03:11,610  -->  00:03:12,030
not.

40

00:03:12,060  -->  00:03:15,570
And why would we want to do this is because we already know the result.

41

00:03:15,570  -->  00:03:15,840
Right.

42

00:03:15,840  -->  00:03:22,710
We already know what the result will be or was and we just want to see we want to kind of assess the

43

00:03:22,710  -->  00:03:27,800
model we want to see how well it's working and if it's going to make any mistakes.

44

00:03:28,140  -->  00:03:33,910
So let's go ahead and proceed with our logic for getting the y hat and what was the logic there.

45

00:03:33,990  -->  00:03:39,450
Well the same thing that we discussed just a few minutes ago at the site of the Statoil anything we're

46

00:03:39,450  -->  00:03:42,570
using this arbitrary horizontal line 50 percent.

47

00:03:42,600  -->  00:03:49,460
So anything below this line is going to be projected onto the horizontal line which is zero.

48

00:03:49,530  -->  00:03:56,310
So where we're saying that the offer is not going to be taken up and anything above the 50 percent line

49

00:03:56,400  -->  00:04:00,980
will be projected onto the horizontal line which is 1 or 100 percent.

50

00:04:01,170  -->  00:04:06,750
Where is saying that those people that end up on that line are different going to take up the offer

51

00:04:06,760  -->  00:04:07,110
.

52

00:04:07,470  -->  00:04:10,360
So let's go ahead and do that.

53

00:04:10,530  -->  00:04:17,820
There we go in gray We have our projections or our predicted values so white hat isn't great and it's

54

00:04:17,820  -->  00:04:23,490
very interesting to see both why and why had on one chart so that means what actually happened is in

55

00:04:23,490  -->  00:04:26,740
red and what we predicted was going to happen isn't great.

56

00:04:27,120  -->  00:04:30,750
And right away you can see that for absorptions number one and number four.

57

00:04:30,750  -->  00:04:40,230
So for those people in observation the morning before they we predicted correctly so we said for Person

58

00:04:40,230  -->  00:04:43,700
number one we predicted that she won't take up the offer.

59

00:04:43,800  -->  00:04:50,980
And he actually did not take up the offer because the red mark is also on the same horizontal line.

60

00:04:51,360  -->  00:04:53,220
Now for observation and before.

61

00:04:53,220  -->  00:04:56,900
Same thing we predicted that that person will will take up the offer.

62

00:04:57,000  -->  00:04:58,880
And they did take up the offer.

63

00:04:59,100  -->  00:05:02,140
That's good but now let's have a look at the rest of them.

64

00:05:02,190  -->  00:05:08,040
Number three you can see that for observation number 2 the gray lines at the bottom.

65

00:05:08,160  -->  00:05:14,640
The green marks at the bottom meaning that the model is predicting for this person based on their gender

66

00:05:14,640  -->  00:05:15,650
based on their age.

67

00:05:15,690  -->  00:05:21,840
Well in this case just age because we're doing a single variable logistic regression.

68

00:05:21,840  -->  00:05:28,980
So based on their age this model is saying that this person is not going to take up the offer because

69

00:05:28,980  -->  00:05:30,420
the gray market is at the bottom.

70

00:05:30,420  -->  00:05:36,390
However we can see that the red mark is at the top meaning that this person did take up the offer and

71

00:05:36,480  -->  00:05:40,290
that means that the logistic regression made an error here.

72

00:05:40,500  -->  00:05:43,770
And same thing for person number three.

73

00:05:44,130  -->  00:05:50,220
The gray market is at the top and that means that the models predicting that the person will will take

74

00:05:50,220  -->  00:05:54,720
up the offer but the red marks at the bottom meaning that the person didn't actually take up the offer

75

00:05:55,080  -->  00:06:02,130
and therefore the logistic regression made a mistake once again and these mistakes they actually have

76

00:06:02,130  -->  00:06:02,990
specific names.

77

00:06:03,000  -->  00:06:09,240
So the top mistake over there is a false positive or a type 1 error.

78

00:06:09,270  -->  00:06:10,890
What does post false positive mean.

79

00:06:10,950  -->  00:06:16,350
Well it means that we said we predicted a positive outcome but it was false.

80

00:06:16,350  -->  00:06:17,890
So we were.

81

00:06:17,970  -->  00:06:20,920
We predicted an effect that did not occur.

82

00:06:21,390  -->  00:06:26,730
And the other mistake you see here has a different name is called a false negative.

83

00:06:26,730  -->  00:06:32,300
So we predicted that there won't be an effect but the effect actually did occur.

84

00:06:32,310  -->  00:06:38,010
So our prediction was negative meaning there won't be an effect but it was a false negative and it's

85

00:06:38,010  -->  00:06:39,760
called a type 2 type of error.

86

00:06:40,080  -->  00:06:45,680
And the way I personally remember them is it's important also to distinguish between the two.

87

00:06:45,690  -->  00:06:56,070
The way I personally remember them is I think of type 1 as less dangerous than type 2 so type type 1

88

00:06:56,070  -->  00:07:00,810
is less for me in my in my mind although it's not necessarily the case.

89

00:07:00,830  -->  00:07:05,300
But the way that's the way I remember them that type 1 is kind of like a warning.

90

00:07:05,310  -->  00:07:09,690
So that's why there's an ordered orange explanation mark and it's it's a false positive.

91

00:07:09,690  -->  00:07:12,690
So basically you said something is going to happen but it didn't happen.

92

00:07:12,690  -->  00:07:15,360
So you said maybe will be an earthquake but there wasn't an earthquake.

93

00:07:15,360  -->  00:07:17,570
So you know that's not the end of the world.

94

00:07:17,700  -->  00:07:24,460
But false negative is a bit worse in my view once again understanding because once you say something's

95

00:07:24,480  -->  00:07:28,470
not going to happen but it actually does happen then you can't even be prepared for it.

96

00:07:29,130  -->  00:07:34,570
And that's why Type 2 is false negative and that's how I remember them personally.

97

00:07:34,710  -->  00:07:36,290
But once again it could be.

98

00:07:36,300  -->  00:07:37,410
Absolutely.

99

00:07:37,560  -->  00:07:43,020
They can both be pretty serious errors especially when you are dealing with like medical conclusions

100

00:07:43,020  -->  00:07:44,590
and stuff like that.

101

00:07:44,610  -->  00:07:48,600
So those are false positives and false negatives.

102

00:07:48,960  -->  00:07:54,920
We will be using them more when we talk about the confusion matra matrix in the next tutorial and I'll

103

00:07:54,920  -->  00:07:55,980
look for you next time.

104

00:07:55,980  -->  00:07:57,240
Until then happy analyzing
