00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.380
Hello and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.400
OK so we are almost done with Part 1 data processing.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.760
I can't wait to start making the machine learning models.

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.710
We just need three more tutorials to make our data set perfectly prepared before starting the models

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.150
and then we'll be good to go.

6
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.900
Okay.

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.690
So today we're going to talk about the fact that we need to split the data set into a training set and

8
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.680
a test set.

9
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.590
And I'll explain why we need to do that right now.

10
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.020
So let's go to Google Sheets.

11
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.450
While I'm on google sheets.

12
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.930
But you can be on Excel you can be on whatever tool you want.

13
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.750
But here is the data set open with google sheets.

14
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.670
So we have our 10 observations.

15
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.780
And this is the data set.

16
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.450
This is the whole dataset.

17
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.310
And what we should do in any machine learning models is that we're going to split this dataset into

18
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.990
two separate sets which are going to be the training set and the test set.

19
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.900
Now why do we need to do this.

20
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.490
Well when you take a step back and focus on the name machine learning itself you understand that this

21
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.720
is about a machine that is going to learn something well here.

22
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.360
It's your algorithm it's your model that is going to learn from your data to make predictions or other

23
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.780
machine learning goals.

24
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.260
And so your machine learning model is going to learn to do something on your data set by understanding

25
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.900
some correlations that there is a new data set.

26
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.850
And imagine your machine learning model is learning too much on the data set like it's learning too

27
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.210
much to correlations then I'm not sure its performance would be great on the new set with slightly different

28
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.320
correlations.

29
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.380
You know it's like a student who is learning by heart his lesson.

30
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.430
And then when he takes the exam he might be in trouble because he learned too much his lesson by heart.

31
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.980
And he does not manage to make the connection between what he learned and the exam.

32
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.660
And it's the same for machine learning.

33
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.550
We are going to build our machine learning models on a data set but then we have to test it on a new

34
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.020
set which is going to be slightly different from the data set on which we build the machine learning

35
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.770
model.

36
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.250
So we have to make two different sets of training set on which we build the machine only model and a

37
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.860
test set on which we test the performance of this machine learning model and the performance on the

38
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.200
test set shouldn't be that different from the performance on the training set because this would mean

39
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.720
that the machine learning models understood well the correlations and didn't learn them by heart so

40
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.880
that he can adapt to new sets and new situations.

41
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.150
Okay.

42
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.320
So that's the idea about splitting the data set into a training set and a test set.

43
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.510
And now let's see it on r.

44
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.900
So here we are the section is really splitting the data set into the training set and test set and let's

45
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.290
start coding the thing now that you understand well the difference between a training set and a test

46
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.520
set.

47
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.050
We're going to do it a little faster so new thing here we have to import a library.

48
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.750
We're going to import the library that is going to make a good split of the data set into the training

49
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.070
set in the test set and this library is called S.A. tools.

50
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.210
So let's import it here I'm going to the package tab to see the list of the libraries.

51
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.680
Here you can see that the S.A. tools libraries here I have it installed on the packages because I installed

52
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.840
it before but it's probably not the case for you if you're starting after for the first time.

53
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.470
So we're going to install it to install a library in r It's very simple you have to type install that

54
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.810
packages and then in parenthesis quotes and then the name of the library in quotes.

55
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.420
So here we type a tools and we're ready to go.

56
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.460
So then you have to select this line and press the commander control enter to execute.

57
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.480
Here it is.

58
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.850
And right now it's installing the package CEA tools okay perfect.

59
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.550
So then you have to put it as a comment because you won't need to install it again.

60
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.060
But then as you can see we just installed to see a tool library but it's not activated yet.

61
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.740
You know it's not selected and we have to select it so to select a library you have two choice either

62
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:08.750
you click on the box here as you can see this generates the scripts here or you know if you have some

63
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.080
scripts that you want to automate and execute once in a time well you can specify in your script that

64
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:22.220
you want to include the library and to do this you just need to type library parenthesis and see a tool

65
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:30.280
the name of your library not in quotes actually this time library Seattle's okay perfect and now you're

66
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.990
ready to go.

67
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.330
We can check it S.A. tools is not selected right now.

68
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:41.330
And if I select this and press criminal control to execute now it is now it selected.

69
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.780
Okay.

70
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.260
So now we imported the CIA tools library that is going to make a good split of the data sent into the

71
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.850
training set in the test set.

72
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:56.190
So now let's make the split so remember in Python for those of you who follow the python tutorial we

73
00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.180
used random state equals zero so that we get the same results.

74
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.030
Well here it's gonna be the same we're going to set a seed to have the same results only we're gonna

75
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.650
do it now.

76
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.970
And we're not going to wait to be in the function in the library that makes the split.

77
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:19.080
So to do it we have to set the same seed and so we can type set that seed and in parentheses we can

78
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.050
choose any number we want it can be this number you know that's a seed if we both choose this number

79
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.520
we'll have the same result but let's choose a more simple number let's use for example 1 2 3.

80
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.810
And now let's make the split.

81
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.920
It's not as simple as in Python where we making in one line here we're going to have to prepare the

82
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.640
method that we are going to call split.

83
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.820
That is the method that is going to make the split of your data set into the training set and the test

84
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:53.720
equals and then simple that split OK.

85
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.590
Now if you want we can press F1 to see what we have to input adjacency sample that split split data

86
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.460
in test and train set.

87
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.320
Let's see the arguments.

88
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.940
The first argument is why.

89
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.860
So that's not the same argument that we had to put forth python and Python we had to put both the matrix

90
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.920
of features x and the dependent variable vector Y.

91
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:17.940
Here we only have to put y on there we're gonna take Y the following where we're going to type dataset.

92
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.750
Dollar sign per chased because your dependent variable is per Chase.

93
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.160
Okay.

94
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.120
That's okay with the first parameter.

95
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.800
And then what is the second parameter.

96
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.650
It's split ratio.

97
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.030
OK.

98
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.740
So split ratio.

99
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.550
That's right split ratio here.

100
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:39.080
And so split ratio is just a percentage of the observations that you want to put in your training set.

101
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.820
So let's be careful in Python we put the percentage for the test set.

102
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.280
And here we have to put it for the training set.

103
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.820
So remember in it in Python we chose 20 percent for a test.

104
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.680
So here logically for the training set we will choose 0 point 8.

105
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.670
Okay.

106
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.260
So what will the split return.

107
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.280
So it will return true or false for each of your observations.

108
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.700
That means that each observation will have either true or false and it is gonna be true if this observation

109
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:12.000
was chosen to go to the training set and false if the observation was chosen to go to the test set.

110
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.310
So let's have a look.

111
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.180
Let's select this under control.

112
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.890
Let's enter to execute and here it is.

113
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.120
We have the split here.

114
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.760
So now let's go to the console and right split right.

115
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.460
Enter.

116
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.280
All right.

117
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.800
You see that you have 10 values and so true means that the observation goes to the training set and

118
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.110
false mean that the observation goes to the test set.

119
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.780
Okay.

120
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.740
So now what we have to do is to create the training set and the tested separately.

121
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:46.630
So we're going into this will type training set which is gonna be the name of our training set actually.

122
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:47.820
Let's make it simple.

123
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.620
So training set equals subset parenthesis.

124
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:57.490
And here is the first argument we put data set because it's a training set as a subset of the data set

125
00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:04.290
and here we will specify that we want the split equals equals true and that's it.

126
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.270
Okay.

127
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.300
That's it for the training set.

128
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.470
Now let's copy this line

129
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:15.930
pasted here and here we're gonna change training set to test set.

130
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.460
And of course we're gonna change.

131
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:25.710
Split equals equals true to false because the test sets are the observations for which the split equals

132
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:26.550
false.

133
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:31.410
And now we're ready we are ready to make the split of the data set into the training set in the test

134
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:31.640
set.

135
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:36.620
So let's execute these lines command control plus enter to execute.

136
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.320
And here we go test and training sets are created.

137
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.790
Let's look at them.

138
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:46.140
So let's click on the training set here and the test set.

139
00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.370
Let's move that here and that here OK.

140
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.990
Let's look at the training set first.

141
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.290
OK.

142
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.430
We see that we have eight observations.

143
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.400
Okay good.

144
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.540
And now let's look at the test set.

145
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:03.240
Now we can clearly see that we have two observations with six and nine perfect OK.

146
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.430
So that's it for this tutorial.

147
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:10.560
You now know how to split your data set into a training set and a test set.

148
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.810
This is a must do in any machine learning models you have to test the performance of your machine learning

149
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.330
model into a separate test set.

150
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.470
So congratulations.

151
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:25.140
Now you're almost ready to begin the journey of making exciting machine learning models.

152
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:30.420
We just have one thing to do left feature scaling your understanding the next material why it's so important

153
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.160
to do this.

154
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.770
So I look forward to seeing you there.

155
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.560
And until then enjoy machine learning.
