Hello and welcome to the arts or Tauriel.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,260
So now in this new step of the cleaning process we will remove all the punctuations and the reviews

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:15,300
of the corpus and it's going to be as simple as before we will copy this line pasted below and instead

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:23,670
of remove numbers here we will and put remove punctuation as simple as that we don't need anything else

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:29,340
and that's ready to remove any punctuation in all the reviews of the corpus.

6
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,570
All right so let's check it out.

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,380
We can actually check it out with the first review while thrilled.

8
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,070
I love this place.

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,240
And so what we're supposed to obtain after applying this remove punctuation function and all the reviews

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,240
of the corpus through the TMI function.

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,680
Well the three little dots are supposed to disappear.

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,470
All right so let's check it out.

13
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:55,940
So remember in the actual version of the corpus right now the first review is wow three little dots.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,140
Love this place.

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:04,620
So now let's select this new line of code execute your corpus of review created with all the punctuation

16
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,230
removed.

17
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:11,790
So let's go back to the console and let's press the up arrow to get the line of code that is giving

18
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,330
us access to the first review.

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,020
Here it is.

20
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,810
So let's press Enter NOW and as you can see the three little dots disappeared.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,900
Therefore that's exactly what the removed punctuation function does here.

22
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:32,460
It removes any kind of punctuation including dot comers Collins semi-colons or any other kind of punctuation.

23
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,110
All right.

24
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,910
So next up done we are ready to move onto the next step which will be to remove all the non-relevant

25
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,450
words in the reviews.

26
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,450
So for example if we have a look at this first review here.

27
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,730
Well this is not very relevant.

28
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,070
You know this doesn't give any hint on knowing whether the review is positive or negative.

29
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,930
So this is typically a word that we don't want to have in the final sparse matrix because this is not

30
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,780
relevant.

31
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:00,330
So we will remove it and the next step of the cleaning process and we'll do the same for all the other

32
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,610
words of the same kind.

33
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,530
So let's do that in the next tutorial.

34
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,300
And until then and you're learning
