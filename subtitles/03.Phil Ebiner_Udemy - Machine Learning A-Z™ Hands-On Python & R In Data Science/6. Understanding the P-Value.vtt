00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.880
Hello and welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.390
Today, we're talking about p values and statistical significance.

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.830
Quick heads up.

4
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:14.010
This tutorial is borrowed from another course of Ã…rhus called Statistics for Business Analytics and

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.790
Data Science.

6
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:24.930
A to Z, if you hear references to a Z score and hypothesis testing and other parts that are relevant

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.130
to that course, but not relevant to the course in which we're in right now.

8
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.360
Then please ignore them.

9
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.910
The focus of this tutorial, what you want to get out of it is P values.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.220
What they mean, how to feel about them and what statistical significance, significance and means and

11
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.350
what hypothesis testing is all about.

12
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.080
So with that in mind, here we go.

13
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.140
Hello and welcome back to the course on statistics.

14
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.070
Today, we've got a very exciting topic, statistical significance.

15
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.490
And it's very exciting because I know that from my experience from my career, it's a question that

16
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.400
is always asked, or at least you ask yourself this question, is my results statistically significant

17
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.820
or not?

18
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.030
Or are these insights statistically significant or not?

19
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.710
And if you don't understand statistical significance, then it's a question that you dread from your

20
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.840
manager or the person that you're reporting to because you cannot substantiate your results.

21
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.360
You found some stuff, but you don't know if it's right or wrong.

22
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.280
And in this section, we're going to be exploring this concept in a lot of detail and we're going to

23
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.200
be referencing it a lot.

24
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.360
And you will get a great understanding.

25
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.900
Hopefully you'll be able to build a strong understanding of statistical significance.

26
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.670
However, in this tutorial, what we're going to focus on is an on the intuition, behind statistical

27
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.940
significance of what how you can link how you feel about an experiment to what actually statistical

28
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.900
significance is.

29
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.310
So let's have a look.

30
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.370
All right.

31
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.010
So here we've gone.

32
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.320
Experiment a coin toss.

33
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.700
I know it's always a coin toss, but a coin toss is, in all fairness, a great example to get started

34
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.530
with because it is so simple.

35
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.270
There's only two possible outcomes.

36
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.120
And you're already done this so many times in your life that you know kind of what to expect.

37
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.010
And that's why it will help us build intuition.

38
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.190
So there are two possible versions or two possible situations.

39
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.610
Kind of like we're going to start talking about hypothesis testing right now.

40
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.670
We're talking about hypothesis testing with thinking about two possible alternative universes, if you

41
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.110
will, if you want to put it that way.

42
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.230
So one possible universe is that in that universe, it's a fair coin in that scenario, in that environment.

43
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.710
But probably I like the way to put it as in the universe.

44
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.060
So in that universe, there is a fair coin.

45
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.080
So that's that's our original assumption as as go to H zero, that's the null hypothesis that we're

46
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.010
starting off with.

47
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.070
And then H one is the alternative universe or the alternative hypothesis, sometimes also called H a.

48
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.050
And in this universe, this is not a fair coin.

49
00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.070
So we want to understand which universe do we live in or which situation are we actually dealing before?

50
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.110
What is the truth?

51
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.220
That's what we're trying to assess.

52
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.300
Is it a fair coin?

53
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.950
Is the null hypothesis correct or is it not a fair coin?

54
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.290
And then the alternative hypothesis is correct.

55
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.490
And so the way we're gonna go about this is we're going to assume that H zero or the null hypothesis

56
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.270
is true.

57
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.250
So, again, to assume they will live in the first universe and then based on our experiment, we're

58
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.740
going to see if we can contradict that, if we're going to come to a contradiction and say, oh, actually,

59
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.090
our assumption was incorrect.

60
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.460
And we'll talk more about that towards the end of the sartorial.

61
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.900
But for now, let's assume that you've got a coin that you're tossing that some or somebody is going

62
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.810
to toss just now and you're assuming it's a fair coin.

63
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.890
We live in that universe.

64
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.670
So the coin is toss the first time and the result is tails.

65
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.440
The question is, how do you feel about this figure?

66
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.350
Forget about of statistics for a second.

67
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.430
How do you feel about this?

68
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.610
Do you feel that this is a fair coin or coin is rigged?

69
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.800
You probably feel that it is likely a fair coin.

70
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.340
This is a totally probable outcome in that universe that we have assumed we live in.

71
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.630
In the age zero universe.

72
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.070
The probability of that is 50 percent.

73
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.760
So it could have been has could have been tails.

74
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.200
No problem.

75
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.980
Then the coin is tossed a second time and tails again.

76
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.690
How do you feel about this now?

77
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.680
Do you feel that the coin is rigged or do you feel that is a fair coin?

78
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.470
Well, let's look at the probability of this happening in our universe that we're living in in the age

79
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.560
zero hypotheses.

80
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.350
The probability of that happening, if this is a fair coin is 25 percent.

81
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.330
So no big deal could happen.

82
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.180
Then the coin is tossed again and again.

83
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.990
It's tails.

84
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.570
OK, so what?

85
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:37.760
How do you feel about that now?

86
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.850
What do you feel about having three coins, three times the same coin as tossed and you get every single

87
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.510
it's tails.

88
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.780
Well, you know, it might be a bit a bit suspicious, but it's fairly OK.

89
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.940
Because in our universe in which we live in.

90
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.380
In the Ajmera universe, where the coin is assumed, to be fair, this could have happened.

91
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.240
And the possibility of that happening is.

92
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.040
Twelve percent.

93
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.380
But then that coin is tossed again.

94
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.610
And guess what?

95
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.900
It's tails again.

96
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:07.160
All right.

97
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.100
So are you getting a bit suspicious now?

98
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.630
Do you feel that if this were a fair coin, this would be quite hard for this to happen?

99
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.190
Well, in the universe and we assume we live in in the age zero universe where the null hypothesis is

100
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.870
is assumed to be true or when the null hypothesis is true and we assume we're in that universe.

101
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.730
Well, in that case, this could have happened with probability of six percent.

102
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.080
All right.

103
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.470
And then the coin is tossed again and again.

104
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.580
It is tails.

105
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.620
Now, how do you feel about it?

106
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:46.760
How do you feel about seeing somebody toss a coin and then getting tails every single time, five times

107
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.120
in a row?

108
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.670
Well, you feel a bit.

109
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.600
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm assuming you feel a bit uneasy about that.

110
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.920
Did you feel that something might be going on here?

111
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:05.270
Something is a bit not right or it's a bit suspicious that this coin is has had tails five times in

112
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.510
a row.

113
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.700
And your feeling is correct.

114
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.580
You're feeling is natural because the probability of this happening, if we assume that it is a fair

115
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.710
coin, the probability of this happening is only three percent.

116
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:23.870
So if we assume that we live in a universe where the null hypothesis is true, where the coin is a fair

117
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:29.630
coin, we would have only seen this with a likelihood of three percent, meaning that you would have

118
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.390
to watch this experiment on 33 different occasions.

119
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.540
Like you watch it today, you watch it tomorrow, you watch it another day.

120
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.380
You'll have to watch it on 33 different days or 33 different times.

121
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.010
This experiment of five Quinton's would have to be conducted only once you would see this result.

122
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.740
So it's a very low probability.

123
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:51.560
And that's why you're feeling of this is some something's going on here is completely valid, completely

124
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.130
justified.

125
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.200
But then let's see what happens.

126
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.430
A coin is tossed again and this time it's guess what?

127
00:06:58.910 --> 00:06:59.630
Tails again.

128
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.850
I know you're probably expecting heads now.

129
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.150
It's tails again.

130
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.380
What do you think is going on here?

131
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.070
How do you feel about this coin?

132
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.010
Do you feel that it's a it's still a fair coin?

133
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:16.100
Do you feel that our assumption that it's a fair coin is correct or do you feel uneasy about that assumption?

134
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.860
Do you feel that something might be suspicious here?

135
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.200
And if you feel there's something very suspicious here, you are again, very well, just for even more

136
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.480
than so than previously, because possibility of that happening is about one percent, one percent only.

137
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:35.480
And then what is going on here is that the probability of this happening is dropping as you get more

138
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.740
and more tails.

139
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.160
And in terms of this course, in further down, we'll be operating with the term P value.

140
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.840
In fact, we've already seen P values.

141
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:49.040
When we looked at the Z score table previously, when we were looking up the Z scores.

142
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.880
Well, in that table, in the middle, what you have is actually a P value.

143
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:58.850
So you can see that the P value is dropping out simply the probability of this happening, given that

144
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:03.800
we're in a universe where the null hypothesis is true and this is very important to understand that

145
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:09.830
if we in this universe, this top universe, then this is what the P value looks like.

146
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.010
It's very unlikely that you'll get six tails in a row.

147
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:18.470
However, if you think about it for a second, if we were in this universe where it's not a fair coin,

148
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:25.790
where it's for example, it's a weighted coin or both sides of the coin are tails that if you have a

149
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:30.830
coin like that, if we were in this universe, then these P values re completely different.

150
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:31.730
They wouldn't be like this.

151
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:35.980
The P values would be 100 percent, 100 percent, hundred percent, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.

152
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.490
And so in if we lived in the second universe, we wouldn't get that feeling.

153
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.630
We wouldn't get suspicious over here or even more suspicious or here.

154
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.840
We would totally be comfortable of this because we know that the coin has two tails on each side.

155
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.100
There's a tails on the coin.

156
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:57.370
And therefore, we would be totally comfortable with one one tails and our own two tails and or three,

157
00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.270
four or five, six tells in a row.

158
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.050
We wouldn't get any uneasy feeling about it if we lived in this universe.

159
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:09.530
However, the way hypothesis testing works is that we assume we live in this universe over here at the

160
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.900
top, the null hypothesis universe.

161
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:16.280
And then we want to see will we get whatever our experiment is?

162
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:22.580
Will we get uneasy and uneasy feeling about and this uneasy feeling in mathematical terms?

163
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:27.830
You can't just go up to your boss and say or your manager or your client, you guys just go and say,

164
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.080
I had an uneasy feeling about this.

165
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.790
I don't think it's true.

166
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.930
Of course, they have to put in mathematical terms, and that's where statistical significance comes

167
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:36.050
in.

168
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:41.270
So statistical significance is basically this line over here, as simple as that five percent.

169
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:46.790
So that's where you start getting this uneasy feeling, just as just after the six percent, you started

170
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.020
being very suspicious about things going on.

171
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:49.760
And that's about right.

172
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:53.660
That's because as soon as something is, five percent are less likely to happen.

173
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.950
That's the alpha here.

174
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.820
Then that is like five percent is like one out of 20.

175
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.080
So that's when we.

176
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.360
The line and we say, OK.

177
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:08.760
So that is it's so unlikely, I am so unlikely to see this by random that I'm going to reject this null

178
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.240
hypothesis.

179
00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.580
I'm going to say that because I'm seeing this.

180
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.120
And it was so unlikely to happen at random.

181
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.650
This cannot be true.

182
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.890
And that's where you say that I am confident.

183
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:26.340
I'm rejecting this whole null hypothesis of 95 percent confidence that I'm 95 percent sure that we don't

184
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.360
live in this universe.

185
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.010
There's there's a five percent chance that we do.

186
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.130
But I am 95 percent sure that we don't live in this universe.

187
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:37.770
I'm going to reject that hypothesis and I'm going to state that we live in a universe where this coin

188
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:38.670
is actually rigged.

189
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:44.100
And you can set this confidence level to whatever you like and you can set it to 10 percent and you'd

190
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.300
be rejecting over here.

191
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.440
You can set it to one percent.

192
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.770
You could be rejecting or here.

193
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.550
So it depends on your experiment.

194
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:51.620
Most of the time.

195
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.790
Ninety five is a good level to go with.

196
00:10:54.090 --> 00:11:00.180
But sometimes especially in medical trials and things like that, where it's a people's lives depend

197
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:06.840
on that, the results or the confirmation or not confirmation or like where there is whether or not

198
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.520
we reject the null hypothesis.

199
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.600
In most cases, you might want to sometimes require that you said it to 99 percent.

200
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:16.680
So depends on your experiment and on your on what you're doing with those results.

201
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.090
But generally speaking, this is what's Disko significance all about.

202
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:28.200
It's the point where in human intuitive terms, you get uneasy about the null hypothesis being true

203
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:33.210
and you get super suspicious about it in mathematical terms is just where you draw the line and you

204
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:39.720
say, okay, I have enough confidence or like this is sufficient level of confidence for me to reject

205
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.560
the null hypothesis.

206
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:44.520
So I actually am going to state that we live in this alternate universe.
