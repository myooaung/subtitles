Hello and welcome back to the course and machine learning I hope you enjoyed the previous tutorials

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:09,420
and that today we're going to talk about the different types of kernel functions.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:15,400
So the final thing that you need to know about the kernel SVM is that the radial basis function which

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:23,670
also called the Gaussian function is not the only Chornobyl function that is used in this method.

5
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,170
So let's have a look at a couple.

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,640
So here we've got the Galson or the RB of Colonel which we've already spoken about.

7
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:35,940
Then there's also a popular choice which is a sigmoid kernel and that's the former on the right it's

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,310
in a bit of a different notation.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:47,280
But the essence is the same is that you still select a landmark and then then from there depending on

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,190
the distance a landmark different results will occur.

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:59,970
But in this case as you can see this kernel of function is directional so anything even like just looking

12
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,020
at in this two dimensional space is just a projection.

13
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,930
You see that anything to the right will be automatically right away will have a high value so will be

14
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,400
included in your classification anything till after will be excluded so sometimes you might require

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,050
these situations so maybe if you look at a two dimensional space just imagine those points where we

16
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:24,380
had points on one side are not in your classification on the other side.

17
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:33,210
Are you in your classification you want to somehow outline that decision boundary or highlight that

18
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,490
points.

19
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:41,430
Pauses certain points are should be in your classification then a sigmoid kernel is a popular choice.

20
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,240
Also we've got a polynomial kernel's which are also popular.

21
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:54,900
One of the more popular choices and here you can have like a pull in arm which dictates how your kernel

22
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,530
behaves.

23
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,170
And you can go into more detail on that.

24
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:06,630
So this tutorial is not for us to discuss the specifics of each one of these kernels but just to show

25
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,910
you that they exist and help you be aware of the different types.

26
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,930
And so these are the most popular choices.

27
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,760
Galson are B-F sigmoid and polynomial.

28
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,460
And now what are we going to do is we're going to actually go and have a look at them in three dimensions.

29
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,560
I found a really cool Web site where we can have a look at that and we'll go and check it out.

30
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,070
So what I need is here it is.

31
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,780
And so if you go to this Web site which is M-L kernel's dot read the docs dot I O slash and slash later

32
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,060
slash kernel functions that age HTML.

33
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:49,350
You'll see some wonderful pictures here so if you scroll down you'll be able to find some very interesting

34
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:56,340
different types of kernels in a three dimensional space so you need to read more about the way they

35
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,170
design them.

36
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,970
And you know how the formulas work so they're a bit different to what we discussed.

37
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:11,610
But nevertheless the kernel This gives you a good overview of the kernel functions that exist and that

38
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,110
you know sometimes are used.

39
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:21,300
Probably the ones the three that we highlighted would be more than enough for most scenarios that you

40
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,690
might come across but it's always always good to know that other types of kernels also exist and they

41
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:28,690
are available to.

42
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,980
So there's a sigmoid kernel which we talked about as well.

43
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,100
So hopefully that's going to be a good overview for you as well.

44
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,140
And now I'm going to wrap up this tutorial on that note.

45
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,150
Hope you enjoyed learning about the kernel SVM and I'll look for the next time.

46
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,830
Until then happy analyzing
