00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.200
Our my friends.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.850
Are we ready for that exciting step of visualizing the clusters.

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.570
Well yes we are 100 percent ready.

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.070
We are 100 percent ready because indeed we have our y k means dependent variable which contains you

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.490
see all the different cluster values for each of the customers.

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.930
And so now we're going to use that variable in order to plot these clusters on a nice 2D chart.

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.770
All right so let's do this.

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:31.590
Let's start by creating a new code cell and the way we're gonna do this will be by doing several scatter

9
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.620
plots for each of the clusters.

10
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.990
So we will actually scatter plot cluster one then we will scatter plot cluster to up to cluster five.

11
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.380
All right.

12
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.950
So you know how to scatter plot.

13
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.900
There is this function which we actually used before in both regression and classification that function

14
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.470
is of course scatter.

15
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.790
And this function belongs to the map bluntly that by plot module and therefore we're going to call our

16
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.080
shortcut here P L T from which we'll call indeed this scatter function.

17
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.600
All right.

18
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.970
So remember what do we have to input inside this scare function.

19
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.940
Well actually everything is here.

20
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.550
First we have to input the x coordinates of the points.

21
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.620
Then the y coordinates of the points then that's decided will actually specify a size that's the color.

22
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:26.760
We will also specify color to you know distinguish our different clusters and we will also specify.

23
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.680
Well it is not here but will specify a label because indeed we would like to label each one of our clusters.

24
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.850
Okay great.

25
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.480
There we go.

26
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.840
So as we said we're going to use the scatter function to scatter plot each of the five clusters.

27
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.400
So we're actually going to call five times the square function with different inputs.

28
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.700
And now we're starting with cluster number one cluster of index zero.

29
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.760
So now the question is according to you how are we going to scatter plot all the customers who belong

30
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.470
to cluster one two cluster of index zero.

31
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.940
You know this customer this customer this one and this one and this one and this one all the customers

32
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.030
that have a zero here will be scatter plotted on this truly chart thanks to this first function we're

33
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.070
calling.

34
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.300
All right well let's just take it step by step.

35
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.650
As we just saw the first argument we have to put here are the x coordinate of these customers who belong

36
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.870
to cluster 1.

37
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.230
All right.

38
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.620
So.

39
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.380
Well naturally the first thing we must do is start with X..

40
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.740
Right.

41
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.210
Because X contains exactly the different customers.

42
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.520
You know remember X is actually the matrix of two columns containing the annual income in the first

43
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.160
column and the spending score in the second column and each row of X corresponds to a different customer.

44
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.210
And therefore for each customer the x coordinate will be the annual income and the y coordinate will

45
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.970
be the spending score.

46
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.880
So here in order to get the x coordinate which is our first argument well we have to specify in a pair

47
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.120
of square brackets.

48
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:12.180
And then after the comma Well the index 0 because that's the first index of the matrix X therefore the

49
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.530
index of the first column.

50
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.730
The annual income which is indeed the x coordinate but as you notice I put this index of the column

51
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.080
after the comma.

52
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.520
And now guess what must be before the comma and which corresponds of course to the rows we want to select

53
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.970
in this cluster one.

54
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.110
Well there you go I have a question for you.

55
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.250
According to you what are the rows of the matrix of features X that we want to select for this first

56
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.540
cluster.

57
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:50.280
Well very simply these rows have to be all the rows corresponding to the customers who belong to cluster

58
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.770
one.

59
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.030
And how can we specify this here.

60
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.130
You know to the left of this comma to specify that we only want to select the rows of the customers

61
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.920
who belong to cluster one.

62
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.880
Well the trick is to use r y k means variable.

63
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.910
We're gonna call r y came into variable and we're going to specify here to the left this comma you know

64
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:21.660
to select the rows where we're going to specify y key means w equal and zero so that it will select

65
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:29.210
among these rows here all the customers for which the Y came in is variable equals zero.

66
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.250
Therefore that means it will select this customer.

67
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.680
This customer this customer you see all the ones for which wiki means is equal to zero.

68
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.840
And that's the trick.

69
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.960
In order to here in these select all the rows corresponding to the customers that belong to class 0.

70
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:52.410
So these select all these rows in this select the first column meaning the annual income which indeed

71
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.140
corresponds to the x coordinate.

72
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.740
All right.

73
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.680
So a bit tricky at first but now it all makes sense.

74
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.890
We're just selecting right rows in the right column and now we're gonna do the same for the y coordinate

75
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.140
and we're going to do this efficiently so I'm copying this.

76
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.740
And now according to you for the y coordinate what do we need to replace here.

77
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.780
Well for the rows.

78
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.680
Well that's exactly the same we still want the same rows corresponding to the customers for which y

79
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.100
came in is equal to zero meaning the customers of cluster zero.

80
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:30.360
But for the column we of course want to select the index one which corresponds to the spending score.

81
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.960
Right.

82
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.970
X has two columns the column of index 0 which is the annual income.

83
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.450
And the column of index one which is the spending score.

84
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.620
And that's exactly how we select here all the y coordinates of the customers that belong to cluster

85
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.320
one cluster of index row.

86
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.090
All right.

87
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.620
All right.

88
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.070
So that was a trick and now let's add the simple stuff.

89
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:56.640
So there was the size S equals and we're going to choose a size of one hundred here which will you know

90
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.950
just display some big enough points so that we can see them and each of these points will be of course

91
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.900
the different customers of cluster zero.

92
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.920
Okay.

93
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.750
And then as we said we want to add a color for which the programmer's name is C..

94
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.520
And well let's just choose our first cluster to have the color red.

95
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.090
Okay.

96
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.470
Sorry.

97
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.980
I'm going to clean all this because you don't see much but there you go.

98
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.750
That's the size and that's the color.

99
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:30.600
And then as we said we also want to add actually a label right to name each of our clusters and this

100
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.560
cluster we will call it you know very simply cluster one we can give different names after all.

101
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.050
You know once we visualize the clusters but so far we will just call them cluster 1.

102
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.610
Okay.

103
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.760
So that's how we scatter plot our first cluster.

104
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.690
Containing all the customers belonging to cluster one.

105
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.990
All right.

106
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.410
Perfect.

107
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.510
So now let's do the same for the other clusters.

108
00:06:52.530 --> 00:07:00.000
So I'm going to actually copy this line of code and we're going to paste it right below to plot the

109
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.790
second cluster and then the third one fourth one and the fifth one.

110
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:04.070
All right.

111
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.140
So according to you now what do we have to change in this second row in order to plot the second cluster.

112
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:16.950
Well if you understood how we plotted that first cluster then you should have absolutely no issue to

113
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:23.230
figure out how to plot this second cluster of course which we only need to change here in the coordinates.

114
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:30.690
Is that value of y k means which this time is not equal to zero but should be equal to the value of

115
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.880
cluster number two which has index 1.

116
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:34.170
Right.

117
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.410
Because index is in Python stopped from zero.

118
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:42.030
And same here same for the y coordinates and then all the rest is the same the selected x coordinate

119
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:46.890
the selects the y coordinate then which is the same size then of course we're going to choose a different

120
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:53.840
color we're gonna choose this time blue and then the label will be this time cluster two.

121
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:54.300
All right.

122
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.310
Very simply.

123
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.260
Now let's do the same for the third cluster.

124
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.500
This time y k means will be equal to two.

125
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.270
Same here.

126
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.070
And which is the same size a new color which will be this time.

127
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:12.390
Well Green and the label will be cluster three.

128
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.760
Okay let's plug that again.

129
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.850
Why k means we'll be equal this time two three.

130
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.130
That's for cluster number four then.

131
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:26.640
Here same y came as equal three same size different color which will be this time we must start to become

132
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.390
a notice here.

133
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.460
So let's see.

134
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.220
SIMON You know this color is pretty nice.

135
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:41.400
Cluster this time for and finally last cluster this time we want to select all the customers belonging

136
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.810
to cluster number five for which all the y humans value are equal to four.

137
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:47.190
Right.

138
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.280
So here replacing again three by four.

139
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.730
And same size new color which we will choose to be magenta.

140
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.690
And finally label cluster number five.

141
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:05.370
And congratulations we just plotted are five clusters but we're gonna do even better.

142
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:10.800
We're now going to plot the central centuries of each of these clusters and to do this we will use once

143
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.950
again the scatter function inside which.

144
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:19.440
Well that's the same we have to input the different coordinates of these five centuries and then a size

145
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.120
which will be a bigger size that we can really see them well and another color and a label.

146
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.370
All right let's do this.

147
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:30.610
So here you can't really guess what is going to be the x coordinate and the y coordinates.

148
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.710
So I'm going to tell you right away you can actually get them.

149
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:40.020
Thanks to our Caymans object because the Caymans class as we saw when implementing the Elbow Method

150
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.200
contains some attributes we already used.

151
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.830
One of its attributes which was the WC assess value.

152
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.960
Remember that was in Russia.

153
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:55.110
And now we're going to use another attribute for more came into object which is simply cluster centers.

154
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:55.560
Right.

155
00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:01.420
And the cluster centers attribute is actually to the array which the rows correspond to the different

156
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.870
centuries and the columns correspond to their coordinates.

157
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:10.600
And so here in the scatter function the coordinates of these centuries will be first key means.

158
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:16.780
So here I'm going to keep an object from which I'm getting this attribute we want which is there you

159
00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.030
go this one cluster of centers.

160
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:25.540
And since as we said it is to the array containing in the rows well the different centuries and in the

161
00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:30.000
columns there coordinates well for the rows we're going to take everything.

162
00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:31.840
That's why I'm adding a cone here.

163
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:38.080
But for the column here since we are dealing with the X coordinates we're just gonna take the first

164
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:44.740
column which has index 0 and which corresponds of course to the x coordinates of these cluster centers.

165
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:51.820
All right then we're going to copy this because now we'll have to enter the y coordinates of these centroid

166
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.380
these cluster centers.

167
00:10:53.440 --> 00:11:00.430
And therefore I'm basing that here and replacing zero here by the index one which corresponds of course

168
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:06.040
to the index of the second column inside this cluster Center's array and which corresponds of course

169
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.500
to the y coordinates of the central eight.

170
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.370
All right.

171
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.200
Very simply.

172
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:16.270
Now we have both the x and y coordinates and so we're going to add the rest of the simple stuff which

173
00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:22.690
are first the size and here we're going to choose a larger size like 300 in order to clearly highlight

174
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:29.700
the centuries among all these observation points corresponding to the customers in each cluster as equals

175
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:36.430
three hundred and then a color which will choose to be you know yellow will clearly see them.

176
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:45.790
And finally a label which will choose to be in quotes sent true eats and perfect.

177
00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.000
And now we're basically done with the to the plot.

178
00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:55.240
All there is left to do here is just to add a nice title a nice label to the x axis a nice label to

179
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.940
the y axis and then just show it.

180
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.270
So we're gonna do this now we're going to do this efficiently Well you know I have an idea.

181
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:09.670
We can actually take what we did here that we don't have to retype everything again and will just change

182
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.110
the input.

183
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:12.240
So there we go.

184
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.700
I'm going to base that right here.

185
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.370
So let's see for the title.

186
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.470
We're gonna choose.

187
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:24.460
Well let's say clusters of customers right then for the X label.

188
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:28.510
Well we're gonna choose annual income.

189
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:28.780
Right.

190
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:34.120
Because remember that the x coordinates correspond to the first column here.

191
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.750
Annual income.

192
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.700
And the y coordinates will be the spending's core.

193
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:43.830
So annual income here and you can specify that it is indeed in K dollars.

194
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.820
Okay good.

195
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:52.570
And then for the Y label now as we just said it is the spending score and we can specify the scale from

196
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.010
1 to 100.

197
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.110
Perfect.

198
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.630
And finally P LTE dot show.

199
00:12:58.630 --> 00:12:59.810
So there you go my friends.

200
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.660
We're ready to visualize the clusters.

201
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:09.580
So let's hope I didn't make any mistake and let's play this cell in order to.

202
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.660
Yes perfect.

203
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:18.130
In order to visualize the clusters so we can clearly see that we have five clusters of customers.

204
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:21.840
And so now let's analyze them in order to understand what they are.

205
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:27.850
Because I remind that the goal of doing this you know the goal for the MA to do clustering here is to

206
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:34.090
understand better their customers you know is to extract some insights from their customers in order

207
00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:39.250
to you know boost the business by making some offerings you know some relevant offers to the different

208
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:42.160
clusters of customers that are in this group.

209
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:42.420
Okay.

210
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.390
So let's see.

211
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:50.070
Let's start with this cluster which should corresponds to the color sign which therefore is cluster

212
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:50.450
4.

213
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:57.220
Actually I have an idea we can actually add the legends and the tree to do that is to call the legend

214
00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.150
function by still mad plus labor.

215
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:04.840
See if we play this now we will get the legend See that's easier for us now.

216
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:11.230
So indeed as we just said this cluster of cosine corresponds to cluster number four.

217
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.690
And what is it characterized by.

218
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:20.350
Well this cluster basically contains all the customers that have a low annual income and who spends

219
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.840
very few in the mall.

220
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:22.110
All right.

221
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.640
So that's the first cluster.

222
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:30.490
Then this cluster here corresponds to cluster number five and contains all the customers who earn a

223
00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:38.500
high annual income but still who don't spend much in the mall then this cluster cluster no one is the

224
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:45.460
cluster of the customers who earn a low annual income and yet have a high spending score.

225
00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:45.890
All right.

226
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:46.810
Interesting.

227
00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:52.010
I'll make my comments afterwards on how to leverage these clusters and you know boost business maybe.

228
00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:52.960
So there we go.

229
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:58.990
Let's continue this cluster of response to cluster number three and contains all the customers that

230
00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:05.200
earn a high annual income and also who spend a lot in the mall.

231
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:12.130
And finally there is this cluster which is like an average cluster and contains customers that earn

232
00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:16.730
an average annual income and spend normally in the mall.

233
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:23.650
Okay so interesting we have these different classes of customers and so now you know some business strategies

234
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:30.310
or business ideas or you know marketing ideas would be for example to target better our customers for

235
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.760
example.

236
00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:37.330
These customers here who belong to cluster three and are characterized by a high annual income in a

237
00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:43.690
high spending score well to these customers we could truly target them the most when there are some

238
00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:44.350
new offers.

239
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:49.660
You know some new deals because indeed these are with these customers that you'll get the highest chance

240
00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.180
to sell your products right.

241
00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:52.340
Because they spend a lot.

242
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:57.490
And besides they have high annual income therefore a high potential to buy a lot of stuff.

243
00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:02.310
But then you know as a mom you are responsible and you have some ethics.

244
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:09.190
Well for these customers who seem to earn a low annual income but yet seem to have a problem spending

245
00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.310
too much maybe in the mall.

246
00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:17.920
Well maybe that the mall would like to be responsible and protect these customers by not targeting them

247
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:24.310
too much with new deals and new irresistible offers that after all maybe these customers don't need

248
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:25.360
at the end of the day.

249
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:31.290
So yes there is some social responsibility or some ethics in the mall.

250
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.470
Well they would limit perhaps the targeting to these customers.

251
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:40.260
You know the advertising and all the digital marketing deployed to these customers.

252
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:40.540
Right.

253
00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.520
So that's another insight we could get.

254
00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:47.730
Or another new action item in the strategy which aims to indeed boost the business.

255
00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.980
But at the same time be socially responsible.

256
00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:54.090
Then what can we do with this cluster as well.

257
00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:57.490
Same you know low annual income and low spending score.

258
00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:03.310
Well if I was in the board of the mall I would actually not do anything with this cluster because you

259
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:06.430
know we don't really have to protect them because they don't spend much.

260
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:10.150
And besides they have a low income so we don't want to target them too much.

261
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:14.350
What about this one now a high annual income and a low spending score.

262
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:15.910
Well that's another closer.

263
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.690
That would be interesting to target right.

264
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:23.950
Because maybe we're missing out on a lot of customers who don't seem to take much action in the mall

265
00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:24.510
here.

266
00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:30.490
So maybe you know for these classes we could brainstorm on how to send them some better advertising

267
00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:35.980
that attract them more and track them better into the mall so that they can purchase more products and

268
00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.940
increase their spending score.

269
00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.420
So that's what I would do with this cluster.

270
00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:46.300
I would try to improve the advertising so that they can become better customers more loyal customers

271
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.830
who spend more in the mall.

272
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:53.170
And finally while this cluster again not much we could do because at the same time we would like to

273
00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:57.820
target them but not too much because we don't want to target the ones that have a low annual income.

274
00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.070
So we want to protect them at the same time.

275
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.790
And there you go.

276
00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:05.790
I wouldn't do too much here but you see that's exactly the purpose of doing clustering.

277
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:12.040
We identified some different clusters of customers and for each of them we can deploy different marketing

278
00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:18.220
strategies or different business strategies which will boost customers in some of the clusters and will

279
00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.740
protect them in other clusters.

280
00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.000
You see you see the point.

281
00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:27.100
That's exactly the kind of insights that you can get from clustering.

282
00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:27.490
All right.

283
00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.890
So I hope you enjoyed this practical activity.

284
00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:37.210
Congratulations of course for building training and running this K Means algorithm on this data set.

285
00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:41.740
I remind that here we got a clear visualization because we only chose two features.

286
00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:47.410
But keep in mind that the Caymans algorithm can be run on data sets with many features you know more

287
00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:48.000
than two.

288
00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:53.980
But in that case you won't get a clear visualization but you will still get you know that vector containing

289
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:58.120
all the different clustered numbers for each of your observations.

290
00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:02.890
And then you can still gather them in different groups corresponding to each of the clusters.

291
00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:03.160
All right.

292
00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:08.080
So that's implementation still works very well for your other datasets with more features.

293
00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.510
That's what I wanted to say.

294
00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:15.120
And now my friends we're going to move on to the next section which will either be about you know K

295
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.650
Means in or if you also want to learn or or if you're only into python.

296
00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:26.200
Well you will join me in the next section after that to implement this time another type of clustering

297
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.930
model which is hierarchical clustering.

298
00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.280
So wherever you choose.

299
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.040
I can't wait to see you soon in a new section.

300
00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.980
And until then enjoy machine learning.
