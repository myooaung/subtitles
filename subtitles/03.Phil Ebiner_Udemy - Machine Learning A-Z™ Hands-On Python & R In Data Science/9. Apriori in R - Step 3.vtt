00:00:00.300  -->  00:00:02.550
Hello and welcome to our tutorial.

2

00:00:02.670  -->  00:00:07.770
So in the previous tutorials within the day pre-processing step and then we train our a priori model

3

00:00:07.770  -->  00:00:16.410
and the data set with a minimum support of 0.03 0.3 percent and a minimum confidence of 40 percent.

4

00:00:16.410  -->  00:00:21.840
And now we did the job and we are finally getting to the exciting step which is to visualize the results

5

00:00:21.840  -->  00:00:21.900
.

6

00:00:21.900  -->  00:00:24.700
That is to look at the rules explicitly.

7

00:00:24.790  -->  00:00:30.690
We're going to have the list of the strongest rules and we will eventually know how to place the products

8

00:00:30.780  -->  00:00:32.480
to optimize the sales.

9

00:00:32.670  -->  00:00:34.680
OK so let's do it without waiting.

10

00:00:34.680  -->  00:00:38.150
This will actually be very easy as well we will only need one line.

11

00:00:38.280  -->  00:00:44.780
But before we write that line let's jump back to the a priori algorithm intuition slide to see the steps

12

00:00:44.780  -->  00:00:48.370
we already did in the algorithm and what steps we need to do left.

13

00:00:48.600  -->  00:00:53.380
OK so step one was to set the minimum support and confidence that was done here.

14

00:00:53.400  -->  00:00:58.650
We set the minimum support here of 0.3 percent and the minimum confidence of 40 percent.

15

00:00:58.650  -->  00:01:00.140
That's not our final word.

16

00:01:00.150  -->  00:01:05.270
We might need to change the confidence again that we did the first half anyway.

17

00:01:05.610  -->  00:01:11.550
And then the second step is to take all the subsets introns actions having higher support than the minimum

18

00:01:11.790  -->  00:01:13.480
0.3 percent support.

19

00:01:13.770  -->  00:01:14.360
Okay.

20

00:01:14.580  -->  00:01:19.780
So Step 2 was actually completed when we trained a priori on our dataset.

21

00:01:19.800  -->  00:01:22.160
So the function itself.

22

00:01:22.320  -->  00:01:24.060
And that's the same for Step three.

23

00:01:24.060  -->  00:01:30.300
Step three is to take all the rules of these subsets that have a higher supports than 0.3 percent.

24

00:01:30.690  -->  00:01:36.240
And so we need to take all the rules of the subsets that have higher confidence than this minimum confidence

25

00:01:36.240  -->  00:01:37.300
of 40 percent.

26

00:01:37.350  -->  00:01:42.150
And so again this was completed when we trained the a priori model on a data set.

27

00:01:42.240  -->  00:01:44.250
Thanks to this a priori function.

28

00:01:44.440  -->  00:01:44.720
OK.

29

00:01:44.730  -->  00:01:45.880
So Step three done.

30

00:01:46.050  -->  00:01:48.180
And now we're finally getting to step four.

31

00:01:48.360  -->  00:01:51.920
And that's the step that will lead us to the visualization of the results.

32

00:01:52.140  -->  00:01:56.830
So this Step Four is to sort the rules by their decreasing lift.

33

00:01:57.160  -->  00:02:03.880
As Carol explains intuition to toil to lift is the best metric to measure the relevance of a row.

34

00:02:03.960  -->  00:02:09.680
So that's why we're sorting the rules by their left rather than their confidence or their support.

35

00:02:09.720  -->  00:02:13.120
So that's what we're going to do in this single line of code.

36

00:02:13.470  -->  00:02:16.700
And to do this we're going to use the inspect function.

37

00:02:16.890  -->  00:02:23.790
So we type here inspect and so in this inspect function we can directly have a look at the rules by

38

00:02:23.790  -->  00:02:25.500
typing rules here.

39

00:02:25.740  -->  00:02:30.660
And then you know if we want to have a look at the first 10 rules we need to specify here in brackets

40

00:02:30.870  -->  00:02:32.860
one in 10.

41

00:02:32.940  -->  00:02:35.060
So here we will get the first 10 rows.

42

00:02:35.280  -->  00:02:41.430
Well that's not very interesting because this will just give us the 10 first rules found by our pretty

43

00:02:41.430  -->  00:02:44.570
remodeled so that's not going to be the rules.

44

00:02:44.640  -->  00:02:48.220
Having the highest lifts that is the most relevant rules.

45

00:02:48.270  -->  00:02:54.960
So that's why right now we need to sort the rules to get Indeed the 10 first rules that have the 10

46

00:02:54.960  -->  00:02:56.200
highest lifts.

47

00:02:56.250  -->  00:03:02.220
So let's do this we need to add another function here which is the sort function which obviously is

48

00:03:02.220  -->  00:03:06.290
used to sort any table by a decreasing or increasing variable.

49

00:03:06.300  -->  00:03:12.880
So actually the first argument of this sort function is rules that contains all the rules found by our

50

00:03:12.890  -->  00:03:21.360
priori model and then the second argument is by which tells by what we want to sort the rules.

51

00:03:21.360  -->  00:03:24.610
And of course we want to sort the rules by their left.

52

00:03:24.660  -->  00:03:32.830
So here we'll add by equals and then left and we keep this one content here to get the 10 first rule

53

00:03:32.830  -->  00:03:34.850
that have the 10 highest left.

54

00:03:34.890  -->  00:03:38.710
All right so that's actually ready we are ready to visualize the results.

55

00:03:38.730  -->  00:03:43.110
That is to clearly see what the rules are what the strongest rules are.

56

00:03:43.350  -->  00:03:46.850
OK so let's execute this.

57

00:03:47.130  -->  00:03:48.650
And here we go.

58

00:03:48.660  -->  00:03:53.960
All right that's Thoreau's as I told you we get very explicit and clear rules.

59

00:03:53.970  -->  00:03:59.700
The first rule is if people buy mineral water and whole wheat pasta they will also buy olive oil in

60

00:03:59.700  -->  00:04:01.290
40 percent of the cases.

61

00:04:01.470  -->  00:04:07.260
And the second rule is if people buy spaghetti and tomato sauce they will also buy ground beef and 48

62

00:04:07.260  -->  00:04:08.700
percent of the cases.

63

00:04:08.760  -->  00:04:14.040
Then if people buy french fries and Herb and pepper They will also buy ground beef in 46 percent of

64

00:04:14.040  -->  00:04:15.130
the cases.

65

00:04:15.150  -->  00:04:16.550
So that's how the rules work.

66

00:04:16.560  -->  00:04:19.310
That's how they are presented thanks to this package.

67

00:04:19.320  -->  00:04:23.440
And so these are the first 10 rules with the 10 highest lifts.

68

00:04:23.610  -->  00:04:28.110
However do you see something that is not necessarily very relevant here.

69

00:04:28.110  -->  00:04:34.230
Well if we have a better look at these rules we can notice that some products are present in a set of

70

00:04:34.230  -->  00:04:39.570
items not because they make a good association but because they have a high support.

71

00:04:39.630  -->  00:04:42.340
A good example of this is the chocolate here.

72

00:04:42.540  -->  00:04:47.490
This set of items composed of chocolate and herbal pepper corresponds to some customers that bought

73

00:04:47.730  -->  00:04:51.510
chocolate and Herb and pepper in their basket and according to this rule.

74

00:04:51.630  -->  00:04:56.020
Well these customers also buy ground beef in 44 percent of the cases.

75

00:04:56.160  -->  00:05:00.180
But the thing is they don't want to buy ground beef because they have some chocolate in their basket

76

00:05:00.180  -->  00:05:01.250
in the first place.

77

00:05:01.260  -->  00:05:06.120
Again that doesn't make any sense but it's not because the confidence is too low this time it's because

78

00:05:06.420  -->  00:05:08.930
the chocolate has a very high support.

79

00:05:09.000  -->  00:05:14.790
We can see that here chocolate is the fifth product most chased by these French customers in the south

80

00:05:14.790  -->  00:05:20.970
of France and therefore this product chocolate here falls in a lot of baskets and especially in this

81

00:05:21.180  -->  00:05:26.130
basket number six here composed of chocolate and Herb and pepper as well as this basket number seven

82

00:05:26.130  -->  00:05:28.900
here composed of chocolate mineral water and shrimp.

83

00:05:29.070  -->  00:05:35.320
And by the way in this same basket there is mineral water that also falls in this eight's basket here

84

00:05:35.330  -->  00:05:35.450
.

85

00:05:35.610  -->  00:05:39.400
And that's because mineral water is the most pre-Chase product in the store.

86

00:05:39.540  -->  00:05:42.150
So of course it's falling in a lot of baskets.

87

00:05:42.180  -->  00:05:44.610
So these products have high support.

88

00:05:44.620  -->  00:05:49.620
However this doesn't mean that we have to change the support now because first we still want to validate

89

00:05:49.710  -->  00:05:54.660
our first business point which was to conserve only the products that are bought at least three or four

90

00:05:54.660  -->  00:05:55.470
times a day.

91

00:05:55.620  -->  00:06:00.660
But what might be helpful to change now is the confidence because indeed we asked for the rules that

92

00:06:00.660  -->  00:06:07.170
have at least a 40 percent confidence you can see that all the rules here have confidence over 40 percent

93

00:06:07.190  -->  00:06:07.370
.

94

00:06:07.590  -->  00:06:13.230
And the reason the rules have high confidence is because the rules are associated to the baskets that

95

00:06:13.230  -->  00:06:18.990
contain the most pre-Chase products in the store because of course if the baskets contain the most purchase

96

00:06:19.060  -->  00:06:20.380
products in the store.

97

00:06:20.610  -->  00:06:26.850
Well these products will get together in the baskets and it won't be because of some association rules

98

00:06:27.030  -->  00:06:28.620
related to this principle.

99

00:06:28.620  -->  00:06:34.710
People who bottled so but it will be because simply the baskets contain the most purchased product overall

100

00:06:34.750  -->  00:06:34.950
.

101

00:06:35.130  -->  00:06:39.900
So in order to avoid this the first idea would be to change the support but we don't want to change

102

00:06:39.930  -->  00:06:44.730
our business related starting points you know to consider the products pre-Chase at least three or four

103

00:06:44.730  -->  00:06:45.500
times a day.

104

00:06:45.690  -->  00:06:51.600
So the other idea that remains left is of course to change to confidence because if you reduce the confidence

105

00:06:51.600  -->  00:06:52.070
now.

106

00:06:52.200  -->  00:06:57.510
Well we won't get the specific rules that exist because they're associated to the most pre-Chase products

107

00:06:57.510  -->  00:06:59.170
that fall in the same basket.

108

00:06:59.290  -->  00:07:04.190
But we will get the most relevant rules that we are looking for and that are related to this principle

109

00:07:04.190  -->  00:07:04.300
.

110

00:07:04.320  -->  00:07:05.880
People who bought also bought.

111

00:07:06.000  -->  00:07:07.990
So that's what we're going to do right now.

112

00:07:07.990  -->  00:07:10.740
We're going to change the confidence well reduce that.

113

00:07:10.740  -->  00:07:13.860
And what we're going to do is what we already did the first time.

114

00:07:13.860  -->  00:07:20.700
You know remember we had a confidence of 0.8 that gave us no rule and then we divided it by two to obtain

115

00:07:20.700  -->  00:07:25.700
this confidence of 0.4 that gave us this rules related to the most pre-Chase products.

116

00:07:25.710  -->  00:07:31.950
So now we're going to do the same and divided confidence by two again to get a confidence of 20 percent

117

00:07:32.340  -->  00:07:39.080
and that should lead us to some more relevant rules that are related to the association rules that we're

118

00:07:39.090  -->  00:07:43.070
looking for related to the principle people who bottles were bought.

119

00:07:43.340  -->  00:07:43.790
OK.

120

00:07:43.860  -->  00:07:45.580
So let's do it.

121

00:07:45.600  -->  00:07:52.800
Let's try these new rules because by selecting this line in executing it the apriori model will be trained

122

00:07:52.800  -->  00:07:53.370
again.

123

00:07:53.490  -->  00:07:55.080
And so we will get some new rules.

124

00:07:55.110  -->  00:07:57.250
So let's do it execute.

125

00:07:57.420  -->  00:07:58.420
And here it is.

126

00:07:58.560  -->  00:07:58.860
OK.

127

00:07:58.860  -->  00:08:07.020
First of all we get a lot more calls we get 1348 wells and that's expected of course because since we

128

00:08:07.020  -->  00:08:10.310
reduced the confidence down to 0.2.

129

00:08:10.410  -->  00:08:16.850
Well of course the algorithm found a lot more rules but don't worry we will not have a look at the 1344

130

00:08:16.850  -->  00:08:17.450
rules.

131

00:08:17.490  -->  00:08:22.380
We will still look at the 10 rules with the 10 highest lifts and that's what we're going to do right

132

00:08:22.380  -->  00:08:26.090
now by selecting this line and execute it.

133

00:08:26.130  -->  00:08:27.770
And here are the new rules.

134

00:08:27.930  -->  00:08:28.220
Okay.

135

00:08:28.220  -->  00:08:29.210
So let's have a look.

136

00:08:29.310  -->  00:08:35.970
The first rule is if people buy mineral water and whole wheat pasta they will buy olive oil in 40 percent

137

00:08:36.000  -->  00:08:36.940
of the cases.

138

00:08:37.080  -->  00:08:37.670
OK.

139

00:08:37.740  -->  00:08:42.180
So that's a rule that makes a lot of sense even if there is still mineral water.

140

00:08:42.330  -->  00:08:47.910
But you know it's still a rule that makes sense because you know this might be related to some people

141

00:08:47.910  -->  00:08:51.810
who are looking to have some healthy meals with mineral water.

142

00:08:51.810  -->  00:08:53.410
Whole wheat pasta.

143

00:08:53.640  -->  00:08:56.610
And of course Olive oil is very healthy as well.

144

00:08:56.610  -->  00:08:58.450
So these go well together.

145

00:08:58.500  -->  00:09:04.050
And actually this is kind of a relevant rule of all should be placed not too far from whole wheat pasta

146

00:09:04.070  -->  00:09:04.550
.

147

00:09:05.040  -->  00:09:12.030
OK then the second rule is if people buy frozen vegetables milk mineral water then they will buy soup

148

00:09:12.360  -->  00:09:15.310
and 27 percent of the cases.

149

00:09:15.360  -->  00:09:18.180
Again this is a rule that actually makes sense.

150

00:09:18.180  -->  00:09:23.500
Still related to the need of having healthy meals and milk can go quite well with soup.

151

00:09:23.670  -->  00:09:29.760
Well I know this is the case for French people French people do tend to put some milk in their soup

152

00:09:29.770  -->  00:09:29.930
.

153

00:09:30.210  -->  00:09:36.320
And oh by the way speaking of French tradition this is typically what French people love.

154

00:09:36.360  -->  00:09:37.220
Absolutely.

155

00:09:37.260  -->  00:09:38.830
For much along with honey.

156

00:09:38.850  -->  00:09:43.290
So for much more for those of you who don't know it's kind of some carraige cheese I invite you to look

157

00:09:43.290  -->  00:09:44.190
at Wikipedia.

158

00:09:44.340  -->  00:09:50.260
But anyway this goes very well with honey you know in a lot of French restaurants you will find from

159

00:09:50.320  -->  00:09:56.520
us along with honey in the desserts menu but people also make this at their place.

160

00:09:56.520  -->  00:10:02.600
So that's kind of a very good association rule even if prematch blog is very different than honey.

161

00:10:02.760  -->  00:10:08.820
Well these two products associate very well and you know the direction counts here because if we want

162

00:10:08.820  -->  00:10:13.910
to buy from us then we want to buy honey because honey goes very well on to from us blow.

163

00:10:14.160  -->  00:10:20.120
But if we buy honey we don't necessarily want to buy from us because we don't want to have for much

164

00:10:20.120  -->  00:10:21.180
more in our honey.

165

00:10:21.210  -->  00:10:26.460
It's rather we want to have honey on our blog and not from us on our honey.

166

00:10:26.670  -->  00:10:27.320
All right.

167

00:10:27.780  -->  00:10:31.800
And then what do we have we have if people buy spaghetti and tomato sauce.

168

00:10:31.800  -->  00:10:33.660
They want to buy ground beef.

169

00:10:33.780  -->  00:10:35.380
Well that makes a lot of sense.

170

00:10:35.380  -->  00:10:39.070
That's of course to make some spaghetti the.

171

00:10:39.120  -->  00:10:45.120
All right so interesting quite classic you know we don't need a machine learning algorithm to find out

172

00:10:45.120  -->  00:10:51.870
about this rule but you know it's actually what French people love associating in their basket.

173

00:10:51.880  -->  00:10:57.750
So of course the ground beef shouldn't be too far from the spaghetti and the tomato sauce.

174

00:10:57.750  -->  00:11:04.210
And then this rule if people buy like cream they will buy chicken and 29 percent of the cases.

175

00:11:04.500  -->  00:11:07.580
So not necessarily obvious.

176

00:11:07.680  -->  00:11:14.550
You know if the manager of the store had to place the product itself without any algorithm this manager

177

00:11:14.550  -->  00:11:19.670
would not have necessarily thought to place the chicken next to the like cream.

178

00:11:19.830  -->  00:11:25.140
And you know if we try to explain this rule it's probably because you know people who buy some light

179

00:11:25.140  -->  00:11:27.990
cream want to pay attention to what they eat.

180

00:11:28.110  -->  00:11:34.000
And so since chicken is a lighter meat and maybe healthier meat than red meat like ground beef.

181

00:11:34.200  -->  00:11:39.360
Well if they buy like cream and want to associate it with some meat well they would rather choose chicken

182

00:11:39.930  -->  00:11:45.840
that's you know if we try to explain the rules with some good sense and then what do we have we have

183

00:11:45.900  -->  00:11:50.100
if people buy past they will buy as collodion 37 percent of the cases.

184

00:11:50.340  -->  00:11:55.830
Well why not that goes well together well that's simply what French people in the south of France love

185

00:11:55.830  -->  00:11:57.420
to eat in their meals.

186

00:11:57.570  -->  00:12:02.810
And maybe that's also related to French taste that French people associate like cream with chicken.

187

00:12:02.970  -->  00:12:07.830
If we were in India it would probably have been better here for you know but a chicken which is a very

188

00:12:07.830  -->  00:12:09.310
good Indian meal.

189

00:12:09.530  -->  00:12:14.910
OK and then we have French fries and Herb and pepper that go very well with ground beef of course.

190

00:12:15.000  -->  00:12:18.890
That's a classic French meal then cereals spaghetti ground beef.

191

00:12:19.010  -->  00:12:19.310
OK.

192

00:12:19.320  -->  00:12:24.600
That's a rule that doesn't make much sense and maybe it's due to the same logic that I was explaining

193

00:12:24.630  -->  00:12:30.420
earlier that is that you know a lot of people like cereals that a lot of people buy spaghetti so spaghetti

194

00:12:30.420  -->  00:12:32.760
and cereals often fall in the same basket.

195

00:12:32.970  -->  00:12:38.280
And since a lot of people associate spaghetti with ground beef Well we find this rule if people buy

196

00:12:38.280  -->  00:12:40.640
cereals and spaghetti they will buy ground beef.

197

00:12:40.740  -->  00:12:43.030
So let's be careful with this one.

198

00:12:43.050  -->  00:12:49.360
Cereals is not necessarily associated to ground beef but you know we can investigate further.

199

00:12:49.590  -->  00:12:50.220
OK.

200

00:12:50.370  -->  00:12:55.170
And then we have these last two rules that people buy frozen vegetables mineral water and soup.

201

00:12:55.320  -->  00:12:56.730
They're likely to buy milk.

202

00:12:56.790  -->  00:12:58.690
And 60 percent of the cases.

203

00:12:58.740  -->  00:13:01.390
Well this was probably related to two facts.

204

00:13:01.410  -->  00:13:07.680
First the fact that milk goes very well with soup for French people and also because you know all this

205

00:13:07.680  -->  00:13:08.790
looks very healthy.

206

00:13:08.790  -->  00:13:10.810
So that goes quite well together.

207

00:13:11.010  -->  00:13:15.850
And then the rest rules French fries and ground beef that go very well with her and pepper.

208

00:13:15.870  -->  00:13:21.010
Yes because of course here we have French fries and herbal pepper that lead to ground beef.

209

00:13:21.180  -->  00:13:26.460
Well of course an association rules the other direction can sometimes be true and that's exactly the

210

00:13:26.460  -->  00:13:27.290
case here.

211

00:13:27.300  -->  00:13:32.320
Here we have if people buy ground beef and French fries they also buy herb and pepper.

212

00:13:32.340  -->  00:13:37.790
That's kind of a triangle association rules here that we observe with the three sides of the triangle

213

00:13:37.800  -->  00:13:41.180
being French fries ground beef and Herb and pepper.

214

00:13:41.490  -->  00:13:46.620
So that's quite common but it's not always the case to observe the two directions.

215

00:13:46.620  -->  00:13:47.140
OK.

216

00:13:47.310  -->  00:13:50.670
So that's definitely very helpful for the store.

217

00:13:50.670  -->  00:13:55.430
Now thanks to these rules we can experience a new placement of the products here.

218

00:13:55.530  -->  00:13:59.640
We can also look at the 21st rules with the 21st lifts.

219

00:13:59.760  -->  00:14:02.540
We won't do it now because we get the point here.

220

00:14:02.610  -->  00:14:07.410
However what we can do is you know we actually try another support.

221

00:14:07.410  -->  00:14:12.510
We tried three values for the confidence which we only tried one value of the support.

222

00:14:12.720  -->  00:14:15.240
And remember we had this hypothesis.

223

00:14:15.300  -->  00:14:20.130
I'm in this business starting point when we said that we wanted to conserve the products that are bought

224

00:14:20.250  -->  00:14:21.970
at least three or four times a day.

225

00:14:22.110  -->  00:14:28.470
Well this support here 0.03 is related to the business starting point of considering products that are

226

00:14:28.470  -->  00:14:30.460
bought at least three times a day.

227

00:14:30.570  -->  00:14:34.150
Then what if we consider turn out products that are bought at least four times a day.

228

00:14:34.380  -->  00:14:36.240
So that's what we're going to do right now.

229

00:14:36.240  -->  00:14:39.510
This is the only other support value that we're going to try.

230

00:14:39.660  -->  00:14:41.010
So let's try this.

231

00:14:41.010  -->  00:14:46.230
Remember the computer that leads to the supports If we consider products that are bought at least four

232

00:14:46.230  -->  00:14:53.560
times a day then on average these products will be bought four times seven times a week.

233

00:14:53.820  -->  00:14:58.800
And then in order to get the support we need to divide it by the total number of transactions which

234

00:14:58.800  -->  00:15:01.940
is seven thousand five hundred.

235

00:15:02.410  -->  00:15:02.760
Right.

236

00:15:02.760  -->  00:15:09.690
So let's see what we get we get a minimum support of 0 point oh thirty 37.

237

00:15:09.810  -->  00:15:14.450
So this time if we round it we get a minimum support of 0.04.

238

00:15:14.460  -->  00:15:20.970
So let's try this one 0.04 that corresponds to products that are purchased at least four times a day

239

00:15:21.090  -->  00:15:22.540
instead of three previously.

240

00:15:22.680  -->  00:15:27.230
So let's try and you Priore model again to obtain the new rules.

241

00:15:27.270  -->  00:15:34.950
So I'm going to execute this and we get the new rules and since we increased the support we find a smaller

242

00:15:34.950  -->  00:15:35.840
number of rules.

243

00:15:35.880  -->  00:15:41.030
Eight hundred and eleven rules compared to previously you know we had more than 1000 rules.

244

00:15:41.070  -->  00:15:45.860
That's because we increased the support and kept the same 20 percent confidence.

245

00:15:46.020  -->  00:15:46.600
Okay.

246

00:15:46.680  -->  00:15:51.030
So now let's have a look at these new rules ordered by their decreasing left.

247

00:15:51.250  -->  00:15:51.600
Okay.

248

00:15:51.600  -->  00:15:53.810
So let's execute this.

249

00:15:53.880  -->  00:15:55.170
And here are the new rules.

250

00:15:55.290  -->  00:16:01.260
Okay very interesting first by increasing the support and therefore excluding some products that have

251

00:16:01.320  -->  00:16:05.810
supports between 0.03 and 0.04.

252

00:16:06.060  -->  00:16:11.020
Well remember this first rule if people buy light cream they will also buy chicken.

253

00:16:11.130  -->  00:16:13.380
Well this rule now became the top four.

254

00:16:13.530  -->  00:16:19.770
That's definitely a great rule to cancer and chicken should definitely be close to lifestream again

255

00:16:19.770  -->  00:16:20.450
than we have.

256

00:16:20.610  -->  00:16:22.740
If people buy past that they buy as Cologne.

257

00:16:22.920  -->  00:16:25.090
Well we also had this rule before.

258

00:16:25.110  -->  00:16:26.610
However we have a new rule here.

259

00:16:26.730  -->  00:16:29.630
If people buy pasta they will also buy shrimp.

260

00:16:29.820  -->  00:16:31.900
Yes of course this is the South of France.

261

00:16:31.950  -->  00:16:33.370
People are close to the sea.

262

00:16:33.400  -->  00:16:40.140
Well either the Mediterranean Sea or the Atlantic Ocean and of course people love associating shrimp

263

00:16:40.470  -->  00:16:41.760
with their pastor.

264

00:16:41.820  -->  00:16:45.370
That's a very common and exquisite meal in the south of France.

265

00:16:45.570  -->  00:16:51.240
And then what we have we have if people buy eggs and ground beef they are likely to buy herbal pepper

266

00:16:51.600  -->  00:16:53.370
in 20 percent of cases.

267

00:16:53.520  -->  00:16:57.520
Well of course Bieber is very good on both eggs and ground beef.

268

00:16:57.870  -->  00:17:04.200
And then we have the same kind of rules as before except for this new rule here French people love to

269

00:17:04.260  -->  00:17:07.750
associate mushroom cream sows with cologne.

270

00:17:07.950  -->  00:17:09.720
So indeed a very good meal.

271

00:17:09.780  -->  00:17:12.520
Mushroom cream sauce goes very well with Club.

272

00:17:12.800  -->  00:17:13.130
OK.

273

00:17:13.140  -->  00:17:20.180
So interesting new rules that we have seen when we increase the support so the manager of the store

274

00:17:20.190  -->  00:17:25.980
now should you know experience this new rules that we observe here by placing the new products of these

275

00:17:25.980  -->  00:17:31.340
rules next to each other than experience for a few weeks and then observe the impact on the sales.

276

00:17:31.410  -->  00:17:36.550
How much does sales increase how much the revenue increases and then see if the business goals are achieved

277

00:17:36.560  -->  00:17:36.670
.

278

00:17:36.810  -->  00:17:42.740
And if that's the case try to strengthen the rules or try some more powerful rules by changing the support

279

00:17:42.740  -->  00:17:47.940
and confidence or on the other hand if the business goals are not achieved well same we can try to get

280

00:17:47.940  -->  00:17:51.650
some new by increasing the confidence and maybe the support.

281

00:17:51.870  -->  00:17:58.350
Well that's all related to experience that's what data analysts and managers do in retail stores whether

282

00:17:58.350  -->  00:18:02.040
they are online stores or grocery stores or any kind of stores.

283

00:18:02.220  -->  00:18:05.480
Well they used these association rules and I them.

284

00:18:05.520  -->  00:18:11.550
And of course combined these rules with other recommendation system techniques like collaborative filtering

285

00:18:11.550  -->  00:18:17.790
with you know the user profiles that can add some additional relevant info and also other more advanced

286

00:18:17.790  -->  00:18:21.560
techniques like the neighborhood model latent factor morals.

287

00:18:21.660  -->  00:18:25.580
Well they combine a lot of models to increase the sales and the revenue.

288

00:18:25.920  -->  00:18:28.960
But here you have a very good technique very powerful technique.

289

00:18:29.010  -->  00:18:30.370
Association rules.

290

00:18:30.420  -->  00:18:35.900
So congratulations for having implemented this first recommendation system in some way.

291

00:18:36.150  -->  00:18:41.520
And I really hope this will be useful for your business and your work and don't hesitate if you have

292

00:18:41.520  -->  00:18:42.890
any questions about this.

293

00:18:42.900  -->  00:18:45.390
We will answer your questions very quickly.

294

00:18:45.480  -->  00:18:47.490
So that was the a priori algorithm.

295

00:18:47.520  -->  00:18:49.560
I was very happy to build this model with you.

296

00:18:49.560  -->  00:18:50.930
Congratulations again.

297

00:18:50.940  -->  00:18:56.820
Now in the next section we're going to implement the Ekla algorithm which is very close to the apiary

298

00:18:56.820  -->  00:18:59.040
algorithm but much more simple.

299

00:18:59.040  -->  00:19:03.360
So that's another very good solution if you want to be very efficient and don't have too much time to

300

00:19:03.360  -->  00:19:08.370
experience different values of the support and the confidence because indeed you will see that there

301

00:19:08.370  -->  00:19:11.820
is no confidence parameter in the Ekla algorithm.

302

00:19:11.820  -->  00:19:16.410
So I look forward to building this new association rule model with you in the next section and sell

303

00:19:16.410  -->  00:19:17.820
them in Germany learning
