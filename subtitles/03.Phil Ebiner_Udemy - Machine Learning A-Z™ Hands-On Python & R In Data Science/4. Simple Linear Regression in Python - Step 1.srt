00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,170
Hello my friends.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,780
Congratulations again for completing part 1 data processing.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,400
You are now ready to build machine learning models and the first models that we're going to build together

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,350
are regression models.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,470
Welcome to part two on regression.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:24,090
This is the branch of machine learning that aims to predict some continuous real numbers like for example

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,360
a salary or a temperature or any kind of continuous numerical value.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,720
And together we will build the best models to make these predictions.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,830
And so now first of all let's make sure we're all on the same page.

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:44,520
This is the whole machine learning it is that folder containing all the codes in Python and R and the

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,060
data set I gave you the link of this folder right before this tutorial you know in the article to make

12
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,520
sure to connect to this folder and also make sure to download the whole folder in order to get the data

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,620
sets because we will have indeed to import them whenever we build a machine learning model.

14
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,550
All right.

15
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:09,810
And so now since we're all on the same page let us start our new journey within regression Part Two

16
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,410
regression.

17
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,290
There we go.

18
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,090
There are several sections inside each section corresponding to a different regression model.

19
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,710
We're going to start with simple in our regression which is the simplest machinery model you could ever

20
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,210
build.

21
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,020
And so it's good that we start with this because indeed with this one we will only have one independent

22
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,450
variable you know one feature and of course one continuous real value to predict.

23
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,280
Then we will move on to multiple linear regression which is based on the same equation than simple in

24
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,290
our regression.

25
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:45,540
Only this time we will have several features instead of one then we will move on to polynomial regression

26
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,170
which will allow us to tackle some nonlinear datasets you know datasets with nonlinear correlations

27
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,870
as opposed to previous models simple in a regression and multiple in your regression which can provide

28
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:03,930
some amazing and accurate predictions for linear datasets you know datasets with linear correlations.

29
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,960
Then after polynomial regression we will move on to support vector regression which is another kinds

30
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:16,930
of nonlinear model that can make some accurate predictions for nonlinear datasets with nonlinear correlations.

31
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,900
And then finally we will move on to Decision Tree regression and random forest regression which can

32
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,360
provide an alternative to predict an outcome for nonlinear datasets.

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,700
So you'll have many options you know after this part 2 you will have basically a toolkit of several

34
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,950
regression models.

35
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:39,120
And so whenever you end up with a new dataset where you have to predict a real continued outcome well

36
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,660
you can just try all of them and select in the end the one that has the best accuracy and thanks to

37
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,880
the code templates that will result from each of these sections you know you will get very clear code

38
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,760
templates that you can adapt to your own data sets so that you can try these models on your own data

39
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,260
sets in a flashlight quickly and efficiently so that you can select the best one giving you the best

40
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,240
accuracy.

41
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,080
And so now in this first section in regression we're going to start with simple linear regression of

42
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,730
course.

43
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,610
So there we go.

44
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,510
Make sure to go inside this folder.

45
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,760
We're gonna start with Python so let's go inside it's Python folder and you will find inside two files.

46
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:24,150
First the dataset salary data that Sizwe and of course are Python implementation which has the AI Python

47
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,610
notebook format which I remind you can run on either Google Q lab or Jupiter notebook.

48
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,660
And of course we're going to implement this model together on Google color.

49
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:39,660
But first let me explain the dataset and the problem that we're going to solve with simple in a regression

50
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,940
and to do this I'm going to open our data set here and explain what this is about.

51
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:46,560
All right.

52
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,140
So first I want to reassure you that indeed this is a very simple dataset you know with only three observations.

53
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,020
And of course in real life the datasets are more complex.

54
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,980
But I want to start working on a simple dataset so that we can really focus on how to build the model

55
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,700
itself.

56
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,530
You know because if we had a complex dataset we would lose a bit or focus on the model.

57
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,390
And I really want us to focus on the model.

58
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,590
So let me describe the dataset it is a dataset containing as you can see 30 observations and two columns

59
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,000
with of course one feature.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,580
This is the feature years of experience and the dependent variable which we want to predict which is

61
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,720
the salary.

62
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:32,100
So let's say that this dataset belongs to a company that gathered data of some of their employees collecting

63
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,270
for each of them their years of experience and their salary.

64
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:43,260
So you see each row of the data set here corresponds to different employees corresponds to one employee

65
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:48,510
of the company and for each employee of this company we have indeed the number of years of experience

66
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,170
in the company and their salary.

67
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:51,980
OK.

68
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:59,430
And so the goal very simply is to build a simple in your regression model that will be trained to understand

69
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:06,470
the relations between the number of years of experience and the salary so that it can predict for a

70
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:12,350
new employee you know having a new number of years of experience well the corresponding salary or the

71
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,690
salary that this person should get.

72
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:20,510
So you see that's a very easy problem but at least you'll know how to build a simple in a regression

73
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,680
model and perfectly master it in all the detail.

74
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,940
And then I want to say something very important.

75
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,580
Remember that we're going to build each time some code templates which you can adapt to your own datasets

76
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:37,100
so that when you want to use the code on plate on your own data set you will only have one thing to

77
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,010
change which will be the name of your data.

78
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:45,890
I will always make sure to make the code templates as much generic as we can so that you only have one

79
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,370
or two things to change when you want to deploy them on your data sets.

80
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,300
All right.

81
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,410
So great.

82
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,880
That's for the dataset.

83
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:58,400
And now we're going to move on to the implementation simple in our regression I Python notebook which

84
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,030
we're going to open with Google Code laboratory.

85
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,510
If you don't like collaborate to read that story fine you can open it with Jupiter and notebook and

86
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:11,180
you also have the python thousand folder that was also given to you in the previous tutorial if you

87
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,020
want to run it for example on an icon the spider or even the classic Python terminal.

88
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,400
Okay.

89
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,540
All right.

90
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,280
So that's simple in a regression.

91
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,430
Let's see how this implementation is structured.

92
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,710
First we're going to import the libraries.

93
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,830
You recognize the first steps of the data processing phase which we covered in parts one second.

94
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,480
We're going to import the data set then.

95
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,620
Third we're going to split the dataset into the training set and test set.

96
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,000
Then we're going to train the simple in our regression model on the training set.

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,330
Then we're going to predict the test result.

98
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,750
Then we can visualize the training that results and visualize the test results.

99
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,650
But I don't want to show you this too much right now because I want to keep the surprise for the end.

100
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,690
And so what we're gonna do now.

101
00:06:53,690 --> 00:07:00,350
Because remember this is given in read only mode so you can not code or do any modifications inside.

102
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,130
But remember I want this course to be as much practical as possible.

103
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:10,670
I want you to really learn by doing and therefore what we're going to do now is implement this whole

104
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:17,510
simple in our regression model from scratch together and to do so we are going to create a copy of this

105
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:22,010
file by clicking here on Save a copy in drive.

106
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:28,250
This will create a new copy on your drive in which you will be able to do some modifications or implement

107
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,870
the new model.

108
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,380
All right.

109
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,390
Great.

110
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:37,040
Now we just have to do one thing it is to remove all the code cells because we are going to re implement

111
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,850
it from scratch.

112
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,720
Step by step.

113
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,490
So let's do this.

114
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,890
We just need to click this trust button here on only the good cells.

115
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:50,290
Make sure to keep the texts in order to highlight you know the structure of this implementation.

116
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,070
There we go.

117
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,370
Let's just delete everything here and one last.

118
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,510
Perfect.

119
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:01,190
So now we have the whole structure of the implementation you can clearly see the different steps that

120
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,790
we're going to implement together.

121
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,580
I will ask you to implement some of them on your own and of course then we will implement a solution

122
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,200
together.

123
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,610
But that's because I really want you to learn by doing.

124
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,200
I really want you to take action and try to implement some parts of the models on your own.

125
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:16,580
All right.

126
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:16,970
Perfect.

127
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,260
And now I want you to think what is going to be our first step here.

128
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,420
Based on you know what we covered in part 1.

129
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:32,180
Well our first step is obviously the data processing phase in which we have to import a data set and

130
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:38,570
maybe use some tools in order to pre process it the right way so that our future is simple in a regression

131
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,260
model can be ready to be trained on this data set.

132
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,010
All right.

133
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:49,040
And now I'm excited because I'm going to show you the efficiency of the data processing template and

134
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,930
how easy and fast it will be for us to process our data set here.

135
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:59,900
So what we're going to do now is we're going to go to that previous folder in the data processing folder

136
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:08,050
which was in part one data processing accessing the python section and there we go.

137
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,660
Now we're going to open that template.

138
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,650
Perfect.

139
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:18,290
And you're going to see we're simply going to do some copy paste and you'll see that we will only have

140
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:24,650
one thing to change and then the data repricing phase will be ready and done it will be done for us

141
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:30,380
to move on with the next step which will be of course to train the simple in a regression model on the

142
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,370
training set.

143
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,060
All right.

144
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,220
So now I'm going to show you what I've just said.

145
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,290
I'm simply going to do some copy paste here.

146
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:45,170
There we go to import first the libraries and then adding them in a new code sale then to import a data

147
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,020
set.

148
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:52,430
I'm simply going to copy paste this second coat sale and you'll see that I will have almost nothing

149
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,330
to change.

150
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,580
So creating a new coat sale here basting it.

151
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:04,540
And finally let's do that final step step of the day repricing phase to split the data set into the

152
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,080
training set and the test set to ignore.

153
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:12,380
I remind had the separate entities where we're going to train separately the model and then evaluate

154
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:12,910
it.

155
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,630
So there we go.

156
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,920
Let us based it.

157
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:21,010
And now as I've told you we only have one little thing to change which is of course the name of the

158
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:21,780
dataset.

159
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:29,790
And I remind the name of the dataset is we're going to go back to our regression folder here very quickly

160
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,200
or to regression simple in a regression python.

161
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,880
And there we go.

162
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,570
Here we are.

163
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,490
And as you can see this is salary underscore data.

164
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,250
So the only thing I have to change here is the name of dataset.

165
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,560
And then voila.

166
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:49,180
Everything is ready the data depressing phase is ready because indeed this takes automatically the features

167
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,260
because it selects all the columns except the last one.

168
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:57,210
And this select automatically the dependent variable vector because it selects the last column.

169
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,080
So here of course we have only one feature therefore one column for the features and one column for

170
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,060
the dependent variable.

171
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,120
But you'll see for example that from multiple in our regression it will be exactly the same.

172
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,060
We will have absolutely nothing to change here.

173
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:10,770
Okay.

174
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,540
So now let me show you the beauty of the result.

175
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:19,150
Don't forget of course to upload the dataset before you know running these cells here.

176
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,550
So to upload the data set you indeed need to click this folder here.

177
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:29,680
Then it's going to connect to a runtime to enable file browsing after which you'll be able to upload

178
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:30,580
your data set.

179
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,620
There we go.

180
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:38,050
So you click this upload button here then you go to you know this whole machinery is at for there which

181
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:43,570
was provided to you in just the previous tutorial you know which had to download if not already.

182
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,760
So indeed we're going to go inside this further than we're going to go to part two regression than simple

183
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,860
in our regression than Python.

184
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,700
And there we go.

185
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,550
We select our dataset salary data.

186
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,500
We open it and now it is indeed in Google collab.

187
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,650
So perfect.

188
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:06,880
And now we're simply going to execute each of these cells first importing the libraries then importing

189
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,660
the data set perfect.

190
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,040
And now splitting the data set into the training set and tested and done.

191
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,880
Now the data repricing phase is over and we can move on to the next step.

192
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,610
Training the simple in our regression model on the training set.

193
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:29,460
So we're going to train our simple in our regression model to understand the correlations between numbers

194
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:34,630
of years of experience of these employees in the companies and their respective salary.

195
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:39,540
So it will understand and calculate all the correlations after which we will be able to predict some

196
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,620
new observations on which the model wasn't trained.

197
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,070
So I can't wait to start this new step in the next material.

198
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,960
And until then enjoy machine learning.
