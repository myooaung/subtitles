00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.480
Hello my friends and welcome to this new practical activity which will be you know an exciting one because

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.630
after implementing the UCB algorithm we're about to implement a new one and we will see if this new

3
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.990
one which is Thomson sampling will beat the UCB.

4
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.860
So I just want to say here that it's important that you check out first they used to be section you

5
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.190
know and the practical activity before doing this one because we will work on the same data set and

6
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.420
I will mention several times the U.S. visa that we can compare the two performances.

7
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.680
All right.

8
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.460
So make sure to check out first the section on upper confidence bound.

9
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.600
And if that's the case you're ready to go.

10
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.270
Okay.

11
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.240
And then let us make sure everyone here is on the same page.

12
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.400
I give you the link to this further machinery.

13
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.070
It is that coding data set right before this tutorial in the article.

14
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.640
So make sure to connect to it.

15
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.500
And now all good we can start.

16
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.240
So let's do this.

17
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.910
I can't wait to not only implement that new model Thompson sampling but also to see if we're going to

18
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.360
beat the UCB meaning if we're going to manage to catch that best ad in 500 rounds or less.

19
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.900
Okay.

20
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.410
So once again I give you the slide of the whole Thompson sampling algorithm.

21
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.680
So I really recommend that you open it you have the three steps which we will implement together in

22
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.850
the following tutorials.

23
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.060
And once again you will implement the steps on your own.

24
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.210
Before we do it together because that's the best way to practice and progress in machine learning.

25
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.870
So that's the slide.

26
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.270
And now we're going to go into the python folder in which you're going to find two files.

27
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.170
Well that exact same dataset of the 10000 rounds or you know the 10000 users in the rows and then 10

28
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.580
add in the columns.

29
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.030
And so I remind that successively we're going to show ads to each of these users.

30
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.600
And because this dataset is a simulation Well we know for each of them on which ad they're going to

31
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.230
click.

32
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.260
So for example this user is going to click only on this ad at number 8.

33
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.850
All right.

34
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.680
So that's the same dataset.

35
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.970
And now here is the implementation.

36
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.040
Thompson sampling in the IP y and B format.

37
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.470
So if you're ready let's open it in either Google collaboratively or Jupiter notebook and now we'll

38
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.240
show you what we're gonna do with it.

39
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.960
We won't have actually to re implement it from scratch because it is actually very similar to the UCB

40
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.110
implementation in the sense that we have the same data processing the same beginning of implementation

41
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.000
when implementing the model in the cell.

42
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.490
And the same code with the histogram in the end.

43
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.210
So we will actually only re implement part of this cell you know where we have indeed to implement those

44
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.220
three steps of Thompson sampling.

45
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.830
Okay.

46
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.300
So but first of all as usual this notebook is in read only mode.

47
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.920
That's because you all have access to it.

48
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.950
We can't modify it of course therefore we're going to create a copy here by clicking file and then save

49
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.450
a copy and drive.

50
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.240
And this will create a copy and that's where we will read implement part of this implementation where

51
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.730
we have something different than before with UCB.

52
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.020
All right.

53
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.380
So well speaking of this let's see where we have that difference.

54
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.680
Okay.

55
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.120
So first of all you see that we have the exact same structure as before you know we first imported libraries.

56
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.610
Then we import a data set then we implement the Thompson sampling algorithm.

57
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.440
And finally we visualize the results in the histogram.

58
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.730
And they're going to click on it because we will keep the surprise for the end.

59
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.840
But there you go.

60
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.540
That's the exact same structure.

61
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.710
Now not only this is the exact same structure but here this is the same code here as well.

62
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.300
This is the same code you know we import do set the exact same way and here.

63
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.220
Well here we import a different library which is the random library and that's because you know we'll

64
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.210
have to work with beta distributions you know when we take a random draw from the beta distributions.

65
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:48.060
Well we do this with this random library instead of the math library in the UCB implementations which

66
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.640
by the way I've kept here because you know at the end we will compare the two results of Thompson sampling

67
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:54.930
and UCB.

68
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:55.570
So there we go.

69
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.480
We import this library then we had the exact same parameters here.

70
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.800
That's the total number of rounds or you know the total number of users to whom we show successively

71
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:05.820
the ads.

72
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.200
Then this is a number of ads.

73
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.240
You know we have 10 ads among which we want to find the best one you know the one with the highest conversion

74
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.640
rate and about that I insist to remind that there is this important assumption in the data set that

75
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.520
each ad has a fixed conversion rate.

76
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.590
And the goal of our implementation is not the goal of what we're doing here you know reinforcement learning

77
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.940
with online learning.

78
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.170
Well the goal is to find that ad having the highest conversion rate.

79
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.700
All right.

80
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.490
So so far.

81
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.300
Exactly the same just that library changes.

82
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.430
You know we're using a different library than here is the same.

83
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.430
We make this variable to prepare you know the list of all the ads that will be selected over the round

84
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.020
and we initialize that list as an empty list.

85
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.410
So exactly the same.

86
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.720
Now this is where things change.

87
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.770
So actually we will delete everything from here.

88
00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:00.300
You know we will delete all this cell you know or the bar of the cell from here and we will implement

89
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.760
all this because all the rest is the same and same for this histogram.

90
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.610
You know this is the exact same code as in the UCB.

91
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.660
Basically everything here is the exact same code as in the UCB except for this line where we import

92
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:18.990
different library and only what we are about to implement right now is specific to Thompson sampling.

93
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.680
So that's why I told you to really study first the practical activity of UCB.

94
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.360
If you did not do it already because indeed we're going to start from here instead of re implementing

95
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.450
everything we already did.

96
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.870
So there you go my friends.

97
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.180
Now we're ready to start.

98
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.010
So join me in the next story or to implement Thompson sampling.

99
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.470
And then in another tutorial after that we will of course visualize the final result and compare them

100
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.760
with UCB.

101
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.700
I can't wait to start see you in the next material.

102
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.530
And until then enjoy machine learning.
