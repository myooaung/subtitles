00:00:00,630  -->  00:00:03,070
Hello and welcome back to the course of machine learning.

2

00:00:03,240  -->  00:00:07,350
Today we're going to cover off some additional comments about the Navy base class fire.

3

00:00:07,350  -->  00:00:08,580
All right so let's have a look.

4

00:00:08,620  -->  00:00:10,050
Droguet What three things.

5

00:00:10,050  -->  00:00:13,530
Number one is the question of why is it called Neive.

6

00:00:13,560  -->  00:00:18,890
Number two is the appeal of X and how we can potentially drop it sometimes al-Shehri a quick shortcut

7

00:00:18,910  -->  00:00:19,250
.

8

00:00:19,560  -->  00:00:24,550
And number three is what happens when there's more than two features involved in your dataset.

9

00:00:24,570  -->  00:00:24,920
All right.

10

00:00:24,930  -->  00:00:26,510
So let's get started.

11

00:00:26,520  -->  00:00:31,600
Question Why is this algorithm called the native base algorithm.

12

00:00:31,860  -->  00:00:33,410
Well the answer is pretty simple.

13

00:00:33,420  -->  00:00:40,620
The answer is because the Bayes theorem requires some independent assumptions and the base theorem is

14

00:00:40,620  -->  00:00:47,520
the foundation of the Navy base machine learning algorithm and therefore the data base machine learning

15

00:00:47,550  -->  00:00:54,210
algorithm also relies on these assumptions which are often times not correct and therefore it's kind

16

00:00:54,210  -->  00:00:56,920
of naive to assume that they're going to be correct.

17

00:00:56,940  -->  00:00:58,030
That's the reason why it's cold.

18

00:00:58,050  -->  00:01:01,170
Let's go back to our example and see what what that means.

19

00:01:01,170  -->  00:01:02,970
So here we've got age and salary.

20

00:01:03,090  -->  00:01:03,470
Right.

21

00:01:03,480  -->  00:01:09,180
And based on those we're using the Neve base algorithm to classify our datapoints into people who drive

22

00:01:09,180  -->  00:01:11,640
to work or people who walk to work.

23

00:01:12,060  -->  00:01:18,600
Well the Bayes theorem the way we apply it actually requires that age and salary have to be independent

24

00:01:18,870  -->  00:01:20,400
of the variables that we're working with.

25

00:01:20,400  -->  00:01:25,980
In this case is your salary have to be independent and that is like a fundamental assumption of the

26

00:01:25,980  -->  00:01:30,750
base theorem and then you can only apply it and then you can't get those probabilities and so on.

27

00:01:30,960  -->  00:01:37,900
But in our case if you just think about it fundamentally it is probably not the case.

28

00:01:37,920  -->  00:01:44,010
Probably there is some sort of correlation between age and salary because as a person gets older their

29

00:01:44,100  -->  00:01:49,290
experience grows their their number of years that they've spent and the workforce grows and therefore

30

00:01:49,290  -->  00:01:53,050
their salary grows so it's natural for the salary to grow if age.

31

00:01:53,070  -->  00:01:58,560
It might not be a super strong correlation for it not for everybody but overall there is some sort of

32

00:01:58,560  -->  00:01:59,120
correlation.

33

00:01:59,120  -->  00:02:03,150
So they're not absolutely independent variables and also you can even see that from the chart you can

34

00:02:03,480  -->  00:02:08,150
just by looking at our child see that there's some sort of correlation between the two variables.

35

00:02:08,490  -->  00:02:13,920
And therefore given that they are not independent you can't really apply the Bayes Theorem and therefore

36

00:02:13,920  -->  00:02:19,830
you can apply the base algorithm to machine learning and that's why it's called Neive a base algorithm

37

00:02:19,830  -->  00:02:26,670
because oftentimes it's applied even though the variables or the features are not independent or not

38

00:02:26,670  -->  00:02:31,020
completely independent and it's still applied and it still gives good results.

39

00:02:31,080  -->  00:02:34,860
And that's why it's called naive because it's a naive assumption.

40

00:02:34,860  -->  00:02:35,700
All right.

41

00:02:35,700  -->  00:02:37,370
Number two P.O. Box.

42

00:02:37,470  -->  00:02:40,440
So let's have a look at what we performed.

43

00:02:40,440  -->  00:02:46,360
So kind of like rewind and analyze what we did in our steps in the proof.

44

00:02:46,380  -->  00:02:50,450
So in step 2 what we did is we took over.

45

00:02:50,460  -->  00:02:55,400
So when we were calculating X we drew a circle around our new point.

46

00:02:55,400  -->  00:02:58,350
We were moved the data point just so it's not in the way.

47

00:02:58,350  -->  00:03:00,130
And then we shaded the area.

48

00:03:00,150  -->  00:03:07,770
And so what is P.O. Box will peel back is the likelihood that a randomly selected point from this dataset

49

00:03:08,100  -->  00:03:13,630
will exhibit the features similar to the datapoint that we are about to add.

50

00:03:13,740  -->  00:03:19,310
And as we agreed anything in that circle is deemed to be similar to our data point.

51

00:03:19,320  -->  00:03:25,890
Another way to think about it is what happens if I throw in a random variable or random data point into

52

00:03:25,890  -->  00:03:27,620
this data set right now.

53

00:03:27,810  -->  00:03:32,820
What is the likelihood that it will fall into the circle what is the likelihood that it will exhibit

54

00:03:32,880  -->  00:03:39,720
features similar to the features of the point that I'm about to add into the data set.

55

00:03:39,750  -->  00:03:45,750
So basically it falls into that circle and so pay of X is the number of similar observations or similar

56

00:03:45,750  -->  00:03:50,240
observations means observations similar to the points that we're about to add.

57

00:03:50,430  -->  00:03:54,390
Divided by the total number of observations which is true in our case.

58

00:03:54,450  -->  00:03:59,620
So it's four four we can see that there's four points in this circle right now divided by three.

59

00:03:59,970  -->  00:04:05,520
And the interesting thing here is that this result is the same both times.

60

00:04:05,520  -->  00:04:11,320
So this is in step two in step one where we were calculating for the people who walk to work.

61

00:04:11,340  -->  00:04:13,860
So the ability for people who walk to her.

62

00:04:13,890  -->  00:04:20,150
It was the same so basically X doesn't change with you calculating it in in the instep one where we're

63

00:04:20,220  -->  00:04:25,080
calculating the probability that the person with these features is a person who walks to work or if

64

00:04:25,080  -->  00:04:29,870
you calculate in the Step 2 scenario where you are calculating if that person with these features is

65

00:04:29,870  -->  00:04:33,850
a person who drives to work and therefore it's the same time.

66

00:04:33,880  -->  00:04:34,560
So what does that mean.

67

00:04:34,560  -->  00:04:38,800
Well let's have a look at formalists so you can see that the formula in step 1 it was p off.

68

00:04:38,810  -->  00:04:45,570
The problem of person who exhibits features X that he walks he or she works walks to work and there's

69

00:04:45,610  -->  00:04:51,070
a formula in Concepcion X is at the bottom and for a step two it was a possibility of a person who exhibits

70

00:04:51,070  -->  00:04:55,050
features X being a person who drives to work.

71

00:04:55,210  -->  00:04:57,190
And as you can see proof of X is at the bottom here.

72

00:04:57,190  -->  00:05:00,300
So what did we do in step 3.

73

00:05:00,310  -->  00:05:00,520
Right.

74

00:05:00,520  -->  00:05:02,280
So let's move on to Step Three from here.

75

00:05:02,280  -->  00:05:03,820
Step three we compared the two.

76

00:05:03,820  -->  00:05:10,210
So now if we take these two formulas these right sides of the formulas and put them into the comparison

77

00:05:10,510  -->  00:05:11,210
like that.

78

00:05:11,220  -->  00:05:14,010
You will see that at the bottom the denominator is the same.

79

00:05:14,020  -->  00:05:18,970
Now though we know that the demon nominator is not zero and it's actually greater than zero probabilities

80

00:05:19,380  -->  00:05:21,500
is never less than zero and we know it's not zero.

81

00:05:21,520  -->  00:05:22,860
So we can just get rid of it.

82

00:05:22,860  -->  00:05:23,180
Right.

83

00:05:23,210  -->  00:05:28,030
We can multiply both sides by X and therefore the sign won't change.

84

00:05:28,060  -->  00:05:30,320
And also we'll get rid of the denominator.

85

00:05:30,580  -->  00:05:33,930
And that way we won't actually have to perform that calculation.

86

00:05:33,930  -->  00:05:35,640
So that's one less calculation to perform.

87

00:05:35,640  -->  00:05:42,280
So you can just compare the top part of these calculations and so that is what is done a lot of the

88

00:05:42,280  -->  00:05:42,520
time.

89

00:05:42,520  -->  00:05:47,500
So if you've done other courses on machine learning or if you've read some maybe articles on machine

90

00:05:47,500  -->  00:05:54,490
learning you will find that this is oftentimes the case and also sometimes it is not mentioned that

91

00:05:54,550  -->  00:06:00,070
this is happening so sometimes it's assumed that or it can be assumed that you know what's going on

92

00:06:00,070  -->  00:06:00,150
.

93

00:06:00,160  -->  00:06:02,500
So just be careful that look out for that.

94

00:06:02,500  -->  00:06:03,940
And it's an Izabella approach.

95

00:06:03,970  -->  00:06:09,470
As we discussed it's totally valid to do it that way but that is only if you're comparing the two.

96

00:06:09,470  -->  00:06:13,870
Right if you're only comparing the two then you can do that if you actually wanted to calculate the

97

00:06:13,870  -->  00:06:14,600
value.

98

00:06:14,620  -->  00:06:16,790
So we said 75 percent 25 percent.

99

00:06:16,960  -->  00:06:22,390
You want to calculate the value can't do that because it will be two different realities because you're

100

00:06:22,390  -->  00:06:24,640
supposed to divide by a certain value.

101

00:06:24,640  -->  00:06:26,100
It's not the actual value.

102

00:06:26,110  -->  00:06:33,300
And moreover if you want to like it comparing is OK but calculating the actual value and maybe some

103

00:06:33,310  -->  00:06:37,930
perform some operations or you know you calculate the value from this.

104

00:06:37,930  -->  00:06:42,650
You want to compare the value from this scenario to a value from another problem right.

105

00:06:42,650  -->  00:06:48,430
Like a value from a different kind of a scenario where p of X will be different right.

106

00:06:48,490  -->  00:06:53,720
Not from this particular example that you're working with.

107

00:06:53,740  -->  00:06:57,460
You want to compare the probability of the person being a person who walks to work.

108

00:06:57,510  -->  00:07:02,980
In this example to the possibility of that person being a person who walks to work from a different

109

00:07:02,980  -->  00:07:06,990
example right where it will be different if you want to compare across like that.

110

00:07:07,000  -->  00:07:10,770
That will also not work because you know X is different so be careful of that.

111

00:07:10,900  -->  00:07:15,110
It's always the safer and safer way is always just to perform the full calculation.

112

00:07:15,310  -->  00:07:20,560
But if you're doing an orphan or if you just want to save some time or if you just maybe we're reading

113

00:07:20,560  -->  00:07:26,370
other literature then it's it's also good to know about this approach where the denominator can be dropped

114

00:07:26,450  -->  00:07:28,610
when just comparing between the two.

115

00:07:28,960  -->  00:07:29,220
All right.

116

00:07:29,230  -->  00:07:34,420
So that was another point or like kind of a there or maybe one shortcut.

117

00:07:34,420  -->  00:07:36,400
And so the last point for day.

118

00:07:36,490  -->  00:07:39,730
What happens when we have more than two classes.

119

00:07:39,740  -->  00:07:44,500
So remember in this scenario I only had two classes the red the green or the people who walk to work

120

00:07:44,500  -->  00:07:48,260
and the people drive to work what happens when you have more Klaas's.

121

00:07:48,280  -->  00:07:50,660
How is the challenge different.

122

00:07:50,800  -->  00:07:56,770
Well when do we have only two classes we compared as we remember we compared the people the probability

123

00:07:56,760  -->  00:08:02,050
that a person who exhibits features X walks to work so basically that new data point that we added.

124

00:08:02,080  -->  00:08:05,650
What is the probability that it's a person who walks to work versus what's the probability that that

125

00:08:05,650  -->  00:08:08,100
new data point is a person who drives to work.

126

00:08:08,260  -->  00:08:14,770
And it turned out that we were comparing 75 percent versus 25 percent and 75 percent was greater than

127

00:08:14,760  -->  00:08:20,160
25 percent and therefore probability of the person of that person be a person who walks to work was

128

00:08:20,170  -->  00:08:23,150
greater than that person being a person who drives to work.

129

00:08:23,170  -->  00:08:27,150
And therefore we decided to classify them as a person who walks to work.

130

00:08:27,310  -->  00:08:29,110
And it's very straightforward.

131

00:08:29,130  -->  00:08:34,750
And moreover you'll find that every time when you just have two classes it'll always add up to one.

132

00:08:34,750  -->  00:08:37,730
So we didn't even have to calculate the second one.

133

00:08:37,780  -->  00:08:42,990
We could have just stopped at this one because if this is 75 percent this one is automatically 25 percent

134

00:08:43,010  -->  00:08:43,170
.

135

00:08:43,350  -->  00:08:47,780
So always going to be like that if you have two classes the way changes if you have three classes it

136

00:08:47,860  -->  00:08:49,360
is it gets more interesting right.

137

00:08:49,390  -->  00:08:51,280
So you've Calford one and there is.

138

00:08:51,300  -->  00:08:52,900
Then there are still two more left.

00:08:52,890  -->  00:08:59,020
So if you're working with one of just two classes since you calculate one you're done you can decide

140

00:08:59,010  -->  00:09:04,850
right away if it's greater than 50 percent then you assign that class if it's less than 50 percent yes

141

00:09:04,870  -->  00:09:10,630
another class if it's equal to 50 percent then you've got like a tie whereas if you have two or three

142

00:09:10,620  -->  00:09:15,270
or more classes then just counting the one won't be enough because then you have two other ones and

143

00:09:15,280  -->  00:09:21,340
you would still have to calculate and at least another one so just means that it's more of an interesting

144

00:09:21,580  -->  00:09:28,300
selection problem when you have more classes that's pretty much the main thing that changes when you

145

00:09:28,300  -->  00:09:29,660
have more classes.

146

00:09:30,010  -->  00:09:31,150
And there we go.

147

00:09:31,140  -->  00:09:37,440
That's all for today I hope you enjoy these extra tips on the naive base class fire.

148

00:09:37,600  -->  00:09:39,530
And I look forward See you next them.

00:09:39,540  -->  00:09:41,260
Until then in Germany in learning
