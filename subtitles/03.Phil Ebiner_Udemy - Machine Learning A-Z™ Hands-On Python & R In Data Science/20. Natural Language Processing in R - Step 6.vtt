00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.610
Hello and welcome to this art Tauriel.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.280
So we're still trying as hard as we can to simplify the corpus in order to reduce the future sparse

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.710
matrix of features as much as possible.

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.530
And so far we put all the words in lower cases.

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.940
We removed all the numbers and removed all the punctuation.

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.340
And in today's tutorial we're going to remove all the non-relevant words of our reviews.

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.890
So what is a non-relevant word.

8
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.630
It's for example this word here.

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.440
Indeed if we know that this first review Well look this place is a positive review.

10
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.970
It's not thanks to this word.

11
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.910
It's of course thanks to the luffed word.

12
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.930
So that means that this word here is not a relevant word.

13
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.800
And so it's totally non-relevant for us and not useful to include it in the future sparse matrix that

14
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.800
will be nothing else than the matrix of features and the outcome whether the review is positive or negative.

15
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.890
So that's what we'll do in this tutorial.

16
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.770
We will remove all these non-relevant words and we will update our corpus of reviews by removing all

17
00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.730
these works.

18
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.490
All right so same as before.

19
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.480
Very simply we take this line copy and pasted below.

20
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:15.160
And in this line we're going to replace remove punctuation by remove words but that's not all this time

21
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.060
it's not as simple as before.

22
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.450
We need to add something which is a something that will specify which words we want to remove.

23
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:29.110
And actually there is a built in list of non-relevant words that is called Stop words and that basically

24
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.810
contains all the non-relevant words like this.

25
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.110
All those articles prepositions like and or well you know all these words that don't help the machine

26
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.390
learning algorithm figure out to read use positive or negative.

27
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.040
So this list of non-relevant words in the Stoppard's list is practically always used in natural language

28
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.700
processing because indeed these words will never help you or your algorithm to classify your text so

29
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.480
you will most of the time use it.

30
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.840
And therefore that's a very important step because of course that simplifies the corpus and reduces

31
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.510
the future sparse matrix very much so as I just said this is not what we only need to input in this

32
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.920
DMA function we need to input a third parameter and that corresponds to the words we want to remove.

33
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.320
There is all the non-relevant words and these words are in this stop word function.

34
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.390
All right.

35
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.880
So basically this returns all the words that are not relevant for our model and therefore thanks to

36
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.010
this function here we will remove all the words returned by this Stoppard's function.

37
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.460
All right so that's all for this line of code but we need to add a little something.

38
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.590
Well especially for you if you're doing natural language processing for the first time which is a library

39
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.890
that we need to install and import to be able to use this upwards function because this function is

40
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.200
not included in the default package of our So we need to install the required package to use this function

41
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.680
and this package actually has a funny name.

42
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:07.840
It is called Snowbowl C and so let's now install this package so we can you know copy this line paste

43
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:16.890
it here and in this quote here in the parenthesis when put snowball so it's spelled this way snowball

44
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.520
and then C..

45
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.940
All right.

46
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.930
So right now it's incomings But you know check in your package list.

47
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.350
If you already have this snow package we never know.

48
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.430
And if you don't have it well you can execute this line without the command to install the package.

49
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.410
All right.

50
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.120
And now of course as usual we'll import the package automatically thanks to this library function.

51
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:52.270
So we were all saying copy this line pasted below and replace T.M. by actually Snowbowl see all right

52
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:59.470
snowball see now the required package are installed and imported to be able to use the Stoppard's function.

53
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.200
So everything is all good.

54
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.870
And now let's try it on the first review because the first review contains some irrelevant words like

55
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.070
this here.

56
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.430
It might be the only word that is removed because you know wow might not be a word of this Stoppard's

57
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.240
list because you know the Stoppard's list is a list of common words like articles and prepositions common

58
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.220
words but irrelevant words.

59
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.960
And while it's not coming so it might not be removed.

60
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.950
But definitely this will be removed because this is a common and non-relevant word.

61
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.330
So let's check it out.

62
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.970
We will select this line and execute.

63
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:37.740
Here we go.

64
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.170
And now let's have a look at the first review by pressing the up arrow.

65
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.930
Here it is.

66
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.140
Let's press enter.

67
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.650
And as I just said this was removed.

68
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.480
So now the first review becomes Wow loved place.

69
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.970
And you know even if we really simplify the review no.

70
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.410
Now it doesn't look the same as the original review.

71
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.670
Well we can still understand that it's a positive review and especially our machinery model will understand

72
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.450
it very well and that will be things to this.

73
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:13.240
I loved word here which is a word that of course might be present in some other reviews which themselves

74
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.280
will be positive reviews as well.

75
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:22.570
So that's how our machine learning algorithm will understand that love indicates a positive review and

76
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.020
therefore that's all it needs to establish that kind of correlations.

77
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.930
And this is totally unuseful.

78
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.770
And we were right to remove it.

79
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.890
All right so that's done for the step.

80
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.240
That was another very important step but that's not all in the next tutorial toile we'll do.

81
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.340
Another very important step which is this stemming step.

82
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.520
And so I explain what it is and how we perform this new clean step in the next tutorial.

83
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.420
Until then enjoy machine learning.
