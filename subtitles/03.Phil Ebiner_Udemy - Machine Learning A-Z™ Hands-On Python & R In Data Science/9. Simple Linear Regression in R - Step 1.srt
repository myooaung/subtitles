00:00:00,240  -->  00:00:02,710
Hello and welcome to this art tutorial.

2

00:00:02,820  -->  00:00:07,830
So in the following tutorials we're going to implement a simple linear regression model on our.

3

00:00:07,980  -->  00:00:10,730
So it's going to be the same steps as in Bison.

4

00:00:10,830  -->  00:00:13,370
And let's start with the first step.

5

00:00:13,380  -->  00:00:17,380
So the first step is to actually set the working directory as you can see right now.

6

00:00:17,490  -->  00:00:25,230
I'm on my desktop so I'm going to go to my machine or an easy folder for two regression and then Section

7

00:00:25,230  -->  00:00:26,870
4 simple in the regression.

8

00:00:27,150  -->  00:00:27,990
And here we are.

9

00:00:27,990  -->  00:00:30,670
That's the folder we want to set as a working directory.

10

00:00:30,780  -->  00:00:32,960
Make sure that it contains your salary data.

11

00:00:33,150  -->  00:00:37,810
As we file that's the data on which we will build our simple regression model.

12

00:00:37,830  -->  00:00:42,930
So make sure it's here and now to set this folder as working directory just need to click on the small

13

00:00:42,930  -->  00:00:47,180
button here and then click on set as a working directory and that's it.

14

00:00:47,250  -->  00:00:48,010
That's done.

15

00:00:48,150  -->  00:00:49,460
Now we're ready to start.

16

00:00:49,550  -->  00:00:55,320
We're ready to start with the real first step of making a machine or any model which is the data pre-processing

17

00:00:55,320  -->  00:00:55,930
step.

18

00:00:56,250  -->  00:01:00,910
So we're going to use Of course the data pre-processing template that we made in part 1.

19

00:01:00,930  -->  00:01:09,300
So I'm just going to use a template here on this copy and then paste it here.

20

00:01:09,570  -->  00:01:10,590
All right.

21

00:01:10,590  -->  00:01:14,840
And now we just need to change a few things to adapt it to our dataset.

22

00:01:15,030  -->  00:01:17,820
So of course we will need to change the name of the data set here.

23

00:01:17,820  -->  00:01:23,150
It is not data dot csv but salary underscore data.

24

00:01:23,460  -->  00:01:24,130
OK.

25

00:01:24,240  -->  00:01:27,860
So then I'm going to select this to have a look at the dataset.

26

00:01:28,140  -->  00:01:30,150
Here we go let's have a look.

27

00:01:30,150  -->  00:01:31,290
Here's the dataset.

28

00:01:31,650  -->  00:01:37,560
OK so just to remind what this dataset is about this dataset contains some information of employees

29

00:01:37,650  -->  00:01:38,780
in a company.

30

00:01:39,030  -->  00:01:45,640
And these two informations are the number of years of experience the employee has and the salary.

31

00:01:45,960  -->  00:01:50,700
So we are trying to understand if there is a correlation between the salary and the number of years

32

00:01:50,700  -->  00:01:54,690
of experience and mostly we're trying to see if it's a linear correlation.

33

00:01:54,690  -->  00:01:55,890
That means it fits.

34

00:01:55,980  -->  00:01:59,880
That means that there is a linear dependency between these two variables.

35

00:01:59,940  -->  00:02:04,500
And so what we need to understand that the first reflex that we must have when we make a model is that

36

00:02:04,500  -->  00:02:09,370
we must understand which is the independent variable and which is the dependent variable.

37

00:02:09,390  -->  00:02:14,790
So the independent variable is the number of years of experience and the dependent variable is the salary

38

00:02:14,790  -->  00:02:15,230
.

39

00:02:15,270  -->  00:02:21,960
And so what happens is that we are trying to predict the dependent variable salary based on the informations

40

00:02:22,170  -->  00:02:24,170
of the independent variable.

41

00:02:24,360  -->  00:02:25,530
Years of experience.

42

00:02:25,750  -->  00:02:27,090
Okay so thats the data set.

43

00:02:27,100  -->  00:02:29,020
Now let's continue with our model.

44

00:02:29,130  -->  00:02:31,700
So let's go back to simple regression here.

45

00:02:32,010  -->  00:02:35,490
And we don't need to specify any column of interest we have.

46

00:02:35,490  -->  00:02:36,170
All we need.

47

00:02:36,300  -->  00:02:38,210
So we won't use this line here.

48

00:02:38,580  -->  00:02:43,220
Okay now we're ready to split the dataset into the training set and the is set.

49

00:02:43,320  -->  00:02:51,480
So we perhaps need to change the split ratio and see the data set contains 30 observations or what what

50

00:02:51,480  -->  00:02:52,980
would be a good split ratio.

51

00:02:52,980  -->  00:02:54,510
It's really as you prefer.

52

00:02:54,780  -->  00:02:58,640
I know that I told you that a good split ratio is 75 percent.

53

00:02:58,770  -->  00:03:04,500
But just for the sake of beauty let's take 20 observations in a training set and 10 observations in

54

00:03:04,500  -->  00:03:05,670
a test set.

55

00:03:05,670  -->  00:03:10,540
So that would be that the split ratio would be to surd.

56

00:03:10,870  -->  00:03:11,450
Okay.

57

00:03:11,460  -->  00:03:16,200
And of course let's not forget to change the name of the dependent variable because this was the name

58

00:03:16,200  -->  00:03:17,990
of the data in the template.

59

00:03:18,000  -->  00:03:20,620
And now it's what the name is the name is salary.

60

00:03:20,730  -->  00:03:23,460
So here you know that's the name of the dependent variable.

61

00:03:23,520  -->  00:03:26,960
So we need to change purchased into salary.

62

00:03:27,420  -->  00:03:32,220
And now I think it's ready we're ready to split the data sets into the training set in a set.

63

00:03:32,220  -->  00:03:35,710
So let's do it and let's see what happens.

64

00:03:36,000  -->  00:03:36,720
Here we go.

65

00:03:36,750  -->  00:03:38,520
It worked perfectly.

66

00:03:38,520  -->  00:03:42,340
So now let's have a look at the trainset and the test set.

67

00:03:42,990  -->  00:03:49,530
OK the training set contains the 20 observations generated from the splits and in the test set we have

68

00:03:49,530  -->  00:03:51,460
our 10 observations.

69

00:03:51,750  -->  00:03:56,120
So we are going to train our simple in the regression model on the training set.

70

00:03:56,160  -->  00:04:00,810
That means that our model is going to learn the correlations between the number of years of experience

71

00:04:00,900  -->  00:04:07,260
and the salary in the set here in the training set and then later we will test its performance its power

72

00:04:07,260  -->  00:04:09,810
of prediction on the test.

73

00:04:09,930  -->  00:04:16,240
So let's continue the last step of the data pre-processing is features scaling but the simple in their

74

00:04:16,240  -->  00:04:20,840
regression package they were going to use here and Our Takes care of this.

75

00:04:20,910  -->  00:04:25,920
So we won't need to apply features scanning manually so we will be fine with that.

76

00:04:25,920  -->  00:04:29,830
And actually the data preprocessing phase is ready.

77

00:04:30,120  -->  00:04:31,190
So awesome.

78

00:04:31,190  -->  00:04:34,850
We are ready to start building the linear regression model.

79

00:04:34,880  -->  00:04:38,260
We're going to do that in the next tutorial so I can't wait to see you there.

80

00:04:38,340  -->  00:04:40,380
And until then enjoy machine learning.
