00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:13.260
So, guys, now let us discuss the interview question right AC program, which determines whether your

2
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.410
machine is a big Indian or little Indian, right.

3
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.110
So the laptop currently on which you are listening to this lecture video, how to identify whether your

4
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.730
laptop or your PC is a little Indian or big Indian.

5
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.430
Right.

6
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:36.990
So given an unsigned, short integer, a this variable, a foot going to be stored in the big Indian

7
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:44.040
and this format, whereas the same integer will going to be stored on little machine in this format.

8
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.250
Remember, unsigned, short is of two bytes and therefore we have displayed only two bytes of memory

9
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.790
chunk.

10
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.830
So using this concept, can you write a program which can tell you whether your machine is a little

11
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.200
machine or being a machine, so such a piece of code is here.

12
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.920
This function return zero.

13
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.090
If your machine is a big Indian at this function returns one if your machine is a little Indian.

14
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.470
Now, I'll give it to you to read and understand this piece of code.

15
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.490
This is very, very simple piece of code.

16
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.580
And not that it is very often asked in interviews to write to see program, which could determine whether

17
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.940
your machine is a big Indian or little Indian.

18
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.330
So if you do not know the concept of big Indianness or little Indianness, then of course you cannot

19
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.580
write this piece of code.

20
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.620
So all you need to do is to take a variable and install one in this variable and analyze whether this

21
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.620
variable is stored in the computer's memory, in this format or in this format.

22
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.710
That's it.

23
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.440
So that's a very quick and small topic on big Indian and little Indian.
