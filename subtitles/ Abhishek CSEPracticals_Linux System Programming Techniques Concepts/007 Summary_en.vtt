00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.200
So, guys, now let us summarize what we have discussed in this section of the course, so I try to

2
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.850
make rules, make it easy and handy to iterate over data structures with complex data structures after

3
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:27.770
the macros becomes unnecessary, after the macros are just a wrapper or what a for loop or why loops.

4
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.940
You must ensure that all the parentheses are balanced for iterative macros, as you will end up with

5
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:44.750
compiler error, applied text substitution to see what C-code ideally mackerels translates to in finds

6
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:54.300
in C++ or Java, the equivalent to iterative macros are outrate or classes in industry.

7
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.420
You will see either the macros all over the code base.

8
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.180
You are not allowed to iterate over the structures using traditional ways in the industry.

9
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.890
Your library must provide delete iterative macros, right?

10
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.330
So now let us have some exercises and questions on writing iterative macros.

11
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.880
I have provided you an assignment on writing iterative macros.

12
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.430
Please do and finish up that assignment.

13
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.330
Thank you.
