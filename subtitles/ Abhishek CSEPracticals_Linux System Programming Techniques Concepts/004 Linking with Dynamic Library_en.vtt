00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.210
So, guys, going forward now, next, we will going to discuss that, how to create a executable by

2
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.010
linking your application with a dynamic library file.

3
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.870
Right.

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.890
So the problem statement is that how you will going to create an executable when you have a shared library

5
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.230
file that is stored as a file?

6
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.520
So you can see that in this case, your raw material consists of your shared library file, which is

7
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.260
called libidinal dot file.

8
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.650
And we already know how to create dot files and of course, your application source file, which represent

9
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.610
your application.

10
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.750
So our goal is to create a final executable so this can be done by following these four simple steps.

11
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.790
The first step is, of course, to compile the source file, which represents an application.

12
00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.250
So here we have created an object files for all the source file, which represents an application.

13
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.220
Now, we have already assumed that you have already created the shared library file.

14
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.620
So the next thing that you need to do is to copy this shared library file in different location, such

15
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.590
as slash user slash slip.

16
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.450
So check out your system and you will find the spot.

17
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.300
Now, this part is actually a default path where all the shared libraries are kept, right?

18
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.490
So what basically you are doing, you are copying your shared library into this default path.

19
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.900
And after copying just from the on and the config, this come on is used to tell the operating system

20
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.390
that we have just updated the shared library files, which is kept in this directory.

21
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.890
So operating system will take a note of that and it will update its relevant database to include the

22
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.550
new shared library file that you have just added in this directory.

23
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.650
So after done with the step to simply, you need to create the executable by linking with the shared

24
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.250
library.

25
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.090
Now, you can see that this command is similar to the previous one, except that that you don't have

26
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.730
to specify the part of the library, why you don't have to specify the part of the library using minus

27
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.490
Ellsworth's because you have already copied your shared library into this default part.

28
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.460
Right.

29
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.300
So when you trigger the come on number three, the operating system automatically search for your library

30
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.940
liberty.

31
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.780
So in this default location.

32
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.680
Right.

33
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.020
And hence, your executables will be created.

34
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.840
And finally, you can run the executable.

35
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.920
So these are the steps that you should follow in order to create an executable after linking with the

36
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.840
shared library.

37
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.820
Please note that maybe on your machine, if you don't find this difficult part that is less user slash

38
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:08.190
slip, then you might also copy the file in the path slash user slash local slash lip so you can copy

39
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.830
or shared library file in one of these parts.

40
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.700
So these steps are pretty simple, I leave it as an exercise for you to try out these commands and create

41
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.870
a final executable.
