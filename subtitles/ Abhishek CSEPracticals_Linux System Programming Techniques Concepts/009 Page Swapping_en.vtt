00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.040
So welcome back, guys.

2
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:15.320
Now let us discuss swapping so considered a snapshot of the main memory at some random time when it

3
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.400
has some physical pages in its frames.

4
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.110
Right.

5
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.270
So on the left hand side, you can see the snapshot of the physical memory.

6
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.520
And let us assume that this physical memory is fragmented into seven frames.

7
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.750
And each of these seven frames contains some physical pages.

8
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:41.630
So SWOP is the operation in which main memory serves the physical page in one of its frame to the secondary

9
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.870
storage and the other page from the secondary storage into the frame.

10
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.870
So you can see that in this diagram, one main memory do not left with a free frame.

11
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.680
It may choose to temporarily stored the physical page on a secondary storage.

12
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.640
So let us try to understand this point with the help of an example.

13
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:10.490
So, for example, main memory can save a page number three, that is three, which is present in frame

14
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.820
one to swap it with page.

15
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.660
Sorry, this is misspelled.

16
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.620
This is page P five.

17
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.160
So you can see that the physical page P five is present on a secondary storage and we wish to bring

18
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.260
physical page B five into the frame after one of this physical memory.

19
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.430
So what will happen that we will download on to the page B three on the secondary storage?

20
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.640
Right.

21
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:49.940
And we will copy the page B five into the frame F one of physical memory so that a snapshot of physical

22
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.480
memory would look something like this now.

23
00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:02.180
And some f one physical memory has physical page B five instead of page B3 and page three has been downloaded

24
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.640
or stored on secondary storage.

25
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.690
So this operation of speed swapping is called simply a swap.

26
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.490
So main memory uses various page replacement algorithm to choose which page to be chosen to be replaced

27
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.360
with new page from disk.

28
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.910
It's not random.

29
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.670
Such type of algorithms are fearful or least recently used algorithm, etc..

30
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.050
We will revisit these algorithms later and see how these algorithms are used by the operating system

31
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.220
to select a frame of the physical memory whose physical page needs to be scrapped with a new physical

32
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.860
page which is present on the secondary storage.
