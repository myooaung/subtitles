00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.410
So, guys, now let us quickly summarize that what we have learned in this module, so we have learned

2
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:18.670
how to create static and dynamic liberty, and we have also learned how to create executable from application

3
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.910
source file, which is turn dependent on external libraries.

4
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.060
This is tap is called linking.

5
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.600
Right.

6
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.770
And we have also understand the steps for compilation and linking.

7
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.790
Right.

8
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.320
But now there are certain questions which should pop up in your mind.

9
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.310
What exactly is static and dynamic libraries are?

10
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.890
How do they work?

11
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.080
Why do we need two flavors of different types of libraries?

12
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.350
So this is what we will going to discuss at some point of time later in discourse.
