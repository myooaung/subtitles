00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.900
So, guys, going forward now, let us discuss how does the president look like in a multiple process

2
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.400
scenario, so physical memory frames are actually shared between processes running on the system.

3
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:28.370
Remember, physical memory frames are not dedicated, are available to one single process running on

4
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.980
the system.

5
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.380
Physical memory frames are there for all the processes which are running on the system.

6
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.240
So let us suppose that in our example, we have to process which are running simultaneously on a system

7
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.570
so following the peace table of the two process.

8
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.500
So as per the peace table, the physical pages need not be contiguous in physical memory.

9
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.270
Right.

10
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.240
Why?

11
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.150
So let us see this with the help of an example.

12
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.590
You can see that pays a number of zero and pays no one off.

13
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.220
Process one are in frames F3 and F5 of physical memory respectively.

14
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:17.610
So you can see that in this physical memory you have no zero of process, one in frame number three

15
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:27.020
of physical memory and and you have no P1 of process, P1 in frame number five of physical memory.

16
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.620
So you can see that in physical memory, the frames which are in green color are actually the frames

17
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.200
which have molded the physical presence of process one.

18
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.900
Similarly, ordenes frames in this physical memory are those flames which have loaded the physical pages

19
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.950
of process too.

20
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.360
So you can see that different frames in a physical memory can load different pages, which belongs to

21
00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.560
different processes running on the system, and every frame of a physical memory can be allocated to

22
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.550
other processes.

23
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.500
Physical page.

24
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.380
Right.

25
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.220
And this allocation actually depends on the page replacement algorithm that is in use by the operating

26
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.720
system.

27
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.010
We will discuss this page replacement algorithm later that.

28
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.000
How does the operating system decide that in which frame it has to load a physical page of a process

29
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.020
in execution?
