00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.010
So welcome back, guys.

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.640
Now that we have learned the core concept of Beijing and its tables, it's a time for us to see what

3
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.850
are the challenges and problems we will come across with space tables and Beijing space tables.

4
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:28.830
And Beijing is not a 100 percent perfect solution for main memory management and operating systems based

5
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.990
tables and paging mechanism have their own problems.

6
00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:38.370
So in this section of the course, we're going to discuss, we will discuss what are the shortcomings

7
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:47.100
of peace tables and what are the solutions that we have to address those shortcomings and in turn,

8
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.080
what are the drawbacks of those solutions?

9
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.390
So there are basically three problems with peace tables.

10
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.150
First problem is the best table size matters.

11
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.780
The second problem is that in order to stir up a stable and mean memory, you need contiguous chunk

12
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.920
of main memory.

13
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.820
Right.

14
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.720
And the third problem is the page table hominess for the small processors here.

15
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.710
Small processors are those processors which are not much more intensive.

16
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.590
Are those processors whose memory requirement is very low.

17
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.590
So, guys, in the coming lectures, we will going to discuss each of these problems off base table

18
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.680
in detail and we will try to explore that.

19
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.280
What is the actual root cause of each of these problems?

20
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.090
Also, we will discuss the solution to each of these problems off base table.

21
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.180
In fact, each of these problems have a common solution, and that solution is called multilevel packaging.

22
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:59.400
So let us discuss each of these problems one by one and try to analyze that, how multi-level Beijing

23
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.700
addresses each of these problems in the coming lectures.
