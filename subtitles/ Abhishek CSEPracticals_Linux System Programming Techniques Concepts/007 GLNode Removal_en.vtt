Now we come to the snow removal from jail threads, now, not removal is pretty much simple and straightforward.

2
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.510
You'll simply have to write an epidural, try to remove and this EPA accepts an argument, the point

3
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.580
to the G.A., which needs to be removed from the GM thread.

4
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.350
So you can see that the following diagram shows a link list.

5
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.080
In fact, it's a traditional, doubly linked list.

6
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:38.150
And suppose if I give you a pointer which points to the middle load of this linked list, then simply

7
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:45.280
you can delete the middle node by simply adjusting the pointers of the left and right node of this linked

8
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.800
list.

9
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.750
Right.

10
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:56.070
Exact similar approach you have to do in case of removing a G.A. from G.L. thread, and of course,

11
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.730
we know that the time complexity for not removal from the list of jail threads is order of one.

12
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.390
So not removal from jail threads or traditional link list is exactly similar.

13
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.100
There is no reference.
