00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.820
So now let us discuss how many types of time outs are there.

2
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.600
So basically there are three types of tumors, the one short timers, the periodic timers and the exponential

3
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.660
backoff timers.

4
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.800
So now let me discuss briefly regarding each one of these.

5
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.110
So once your time outs are those which are fired are triggered only once.

6
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.230
For example, your application wants to delete some something acts after 10 seconds.

7
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.800
Right.

8
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.660
So your timer will trigger.

9
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.140
And after 10 seconds, your timer fires and it delete some data structure acts from the application.

10
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.830
Right.

11
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.160
Another example would be to send some terminate request after 10 seconds from now.

12
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.840
So these timers are called one short timers because they are triggered and fired only once.

13
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.560
Right.

14
00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.310
Once your time are used in the scenarios where your application needs to do some work only once in future.

15
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.020
Right.

16
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.720
Contrary to these periodic timers, are those where some even need to be triggered periodically in future?

17
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.380
Right.

18
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.300
For example, you want to write an application, would send out some hollow packets at an interval of

19
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.380
five seconds.

20
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.940
Right.

21
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.420
So, for example, you should call and start the time at a time.

22
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.040
Ts equal to zero then at time physical to file your application will send out a hello packet.

23
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.050
Then at time t is equal to turn your application will again send out another packet and so on.

24
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.970
So these type of timer switch files periodically at regular intervals of time are called periodic timers.

25
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.780
Exponential backoff time outs are a special case of periodic timers in which the time outs are triggered

26
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.670
at exponentially pleased.

27
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:55.260
Temporal Point's example would be that you want your application to send some Gretry event at time d

28
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.200
equal to one then had time to go to two.

29
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.590
Then at times these were two, four, eight, 16, 32, 64 and so on.

30
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.380
Right.

31
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:12.060
So instead of using regular intervals like periodic timers, exponential backoff timers use exponentially

32
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.000
pleased temporal points within time space to send out or to trigger events.

33
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.920
So TCAP is one well-known protocol which depends on which uses exponential backoff algorithm and it

34
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.600
uses exponential backoff timers to implement its backoff algorithm.

35
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.130
So we were going to use Linux and built APIs to create timers and use those to implement all three types

36
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.010
of timers as listed above.

37
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.590
Right.

38
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.510
These Linux enabled APIs will provide us the basic foundations regarding how to implement a timeline

39
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.360
and then we will build up from there to design the time a library which will give the developer the

40
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.300
full control over timer's.
