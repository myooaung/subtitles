00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.060
So, guys, welcome back.

2
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:14.170
Now we will going to discuss certain rules, which you should keep in mind while defining and using

3
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.160
the structures and functions.

4
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:23.590
So these are the rules which you should keep in mind when you define and structure and use it and when

5
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.870
you declare a function and use it.

6
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.800
Of course, if you don't follow these rules properly, you will end up with compilation errors.

7
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.490
So now let us discuss the rule for structures, for the structure.

8
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:45.430
There is a simple rule that always defined the structure and then use the structure that is always definition

9
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.690
first and then usage of structure.

10
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.120
So let us understand this with the help of an example.

11
00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.470
Suppose you have a high profile, a NorTech, and in this high you have defined two structures that

12
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.790
does imply structure and occupation structure.

13
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.770
Now, let us suppose that there is a source file which has to include this hydrofoil.

14
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.480
Now, we should understand the difference between defining the structure and using the structure.

15
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:26.920
So here in this example, you can see that object of type of occupation is being used as a member of

16
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.160
structure employee.

17
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.040
So it is a use of the structure occupation, whereas the definition of the structured occupation is

18
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.420
below the definition of structure implied.

19
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.300
Right.

20
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.720
So this is the definition of a structured occupation, whereas in the first case it is the use of a

21
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.980
structured occupation.

22
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.730
Now let us apply the text substitution on this aid or C source file.

23
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.370
The resultant source file that you will obtain is the following source file.

24
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:07.510
And in this source file you can see that IDOT each file is replaced by its content.

25
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.910
So now you can see that here.

26
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.900
Also, when Compiler will compile this source file from top to bottom, the compiler will encounter

27
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.740
the use of the structured occupation before actually the definition of this is structure and this is

28
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.000
a situation of problem.

29
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:32.410
The compiler will report compiler error and your and your program will not compile.

30
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.660
So the simple conclusion that you can make here is that that you should always make use of the structure

31
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.110
only after its definition in a source file.

32
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:53.110
So here you can see that in this header file, the implied structure is actually a dependent structure.

33
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.460
Why?

34
00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:01.180
It is called dependent because it is dependent on the structure occupation, whereas the structure definition

35
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.020
of occupation says that it is independent to structure.

36
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:13.260
Right, because it does not depend on any other structure, so in the high profile, always the independent

37
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.660
structure definition's comes before the dependent structure definitions.

38
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.640
So the compiler must see the structure definitions first and then its usage, and you can call it as

39
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.620
defined and use thumb rule that is first defined the structure and then use the structure.

40
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.150
So if you want to resolve this compilation error, what you need to do, you simply need to define the

41
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.580
occupation structure first in the file.

42
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.290
And the implied structure should be defined after the occupation.

43
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.920
The structure has been defined in the header file.

44
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.550
So you need to swap the position of definitions of these two structures in IDOT, etc. file.

45
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.660
Also remember that when the compiler compiles the source, while it always compiled the source file

46
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:12.420
from top to bottom, so the compiler must see the definition of the structures before its usage in the

47
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.260
source file.
