00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.460
So, guys, I have prepared this special lecture regarding setting up Linux development environment

2
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.480
on your local machine.

3
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.930
So for those who are familiar with the Linux and those who are already using Linux for some time now

4
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.980
can escape this lecture, I have prepared a special lecture only for those students who are not familiar

5
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.110
with the Linux, and they will be learning on the Linux operating system for the first time as a part

6
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.860
of this cause.

7
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:37.630
All the coding assignments that you will be doing and discourse will be done on Linux operating system.

8
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.470
So here I have given this checklist.

9
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.290
So make sure you have exercised all these points which are mentioned in this checklist.

10
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.110
So what are all the software that you need?

11
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.770
You need to install the software called Virtual Box and you need to have a Linux operating system in

12
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.250
this course.

13
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.540
I have used Ubuntu fourteen point zero four.

14
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.769
So if you are using Linux operating system for the first time, I would recommend that you use one to

15
00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.910
fourteen point zero for.

16
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:14.740
I recommend you to use the same Linux distribution as mine so that whatever changes or configuration

17
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.400
I do in my operating system are exactly the same changes you will also need to do in your operating

18
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.840
system.

19
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.120
So you would not have to break your head on the Internet trying to figure out how to do the same thing

20
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.430
in your Linux distribution.

21
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.040
So I would recommend you, if you are absolutely beginner of Linux operating system, then use the same

22
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.240
operating system as mine.

23
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.250
And we will be using the get for all your projects and assignments, so what is good that I will explain.

24
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.570
So all the steps of this checklist I have mentioned in this YouTube, I will share that you are allowed

25
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.180
to this YouTube in the resource section.

26
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.000
So don't worry.

27
00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.570
All the software to be used and all the installation and steps that is required to install those software

28
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.430
are actually explained in pretty much detail in this YouTube video.

29
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.370
So let us go through this checklist so you should have a working laptop and your host operating system

30
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.720
could be any operating system, but I assume that your operating system has windows.

31
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.230
So host operating system is the operating system, which comes with your laptop and you actually but

32
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.680
chairs the laptop from the shop.

33
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.110
Right now, you need to have a virtualization software that that virtualization software I would recommend

34
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.270
to use as virtual box because it is free.

35
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.690
Now, what is the use of this virtual box, this virtual box software will allow you to install another

36
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.530
operating system on the top of your host operating system, that you can install as many operating systems

37
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.250
as you want.

38
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.000
So as a part of this course, using what Shellback software you need to install the Linux operating

39
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.250
system, which is open to fourteen point zero four.

40
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.830
So you will have one to fourteen point zero four installed in your virtualization software, so that

41
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.400
012 operating system that is installed on your host operating system using virtualization software is

42
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.440
called virtual machine.

43
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.810
So test Internet connection from inside your virtual machine, which is actually able to operating system

44
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.160
by pinging to any public website www.youtube.com from terminal.

45
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.670
Right.

46
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.160
So if you are able to ping, it means you are virtual machine is connected to the Internet, then you

47
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.160
need to have certain software installed on a virtual machine such as women or so women's editor in which

48
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.680
you will do all your programming assignments, get you unit to install it on your virtual machine so

49
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.820
that you can access.

50
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.730
So that you can access all the good functionality through the command line or through the terminal,

51
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.660
Tennesee Scope is a small piece of software which helps you to navigate through a source code very easily

52
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.500
and fast.

53
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.910
And the screen is just another small software which allows you to open multiple screens on your terminal

54
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.310
window.

55
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.130
Right.

56
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.130
So it is advisable, but not necessary to have all the software installed on a virtual machine.

57
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.480
Then step six is very much optional.

58
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.149
Either you do it or don't do it, it's up to you.

59
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.480
It's just that if you practice the step six, then you can login into your virtual machine directly

60
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.770
from your Windows hostile operating system.

61
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.500
So for that, you need to have a mobile, extern, to be installed in your Windows operating system.

62
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.510
I have explained the steps of installing the mobile system and the settings that you need to do in order

63
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.190
to login and do your virtual machine from your Windows operating system.

64
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.790
And step seven is actually important these days.

65
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.460
You need to create a good account and you need to do all your coding assignments and upload all your

66
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.010
assignments on your account.

67
00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:04.300
So it is very important to have your GitHub identity because your GitHub account, when maintained properly

68
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:11.050
and when you have your projects and assignments regularly updated and uploaded on GitHub account, then

69
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.770
the employers will conclude that you actually work very regularly and you are good at coding or various

70
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.430
other stuff.

71
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:26.590
So basically your account speaks on your behalf and it showcases all your work that you have done to

72
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.510
the employers.

73
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.320
So please take this account very seriously.

74
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:39.180
And this YouTube will guide you through all of these seven steps that I mentioned in this checklist.

75
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:40.410
Thank you.
