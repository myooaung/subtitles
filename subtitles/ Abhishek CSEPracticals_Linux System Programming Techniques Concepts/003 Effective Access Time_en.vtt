00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:12.050
So now let us discuss the performance of the system under the influence of the Man Beijing speech,

2
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.410
fault is not a good thing to happen.

3
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.070
Page fold, increase the memory access time by the CPU.

4
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.910
Why?

5
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:26.680
It is because of obvious reason that the CPU has to access the disk in order to load or bring back the

6
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.130
required physical page of a process to the main memory.

7
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:38.390
So C.P.U has to perform, swap out and swap in of a physical page between the disc and the main memory.

8
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.300
So if is the probability of the peaceful occurrence where if P is equal to zero means that there is

9
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:55.510
no fault at all and if is equal to one means that every memory access attempt by the CPU result in a

10
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.290
page fault.

11
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.880
So there is something called ETTY, which is called effective access time for memory access.

12
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:10.580
So effective access, time for memory access by the CPU can be computed by the following formula.

13
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.680
Right.

14
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:22.590
So if P is the probability of default, then one minus P is the probability of not occurrence of a default,

15
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:31.980
therefore multiply one minus P into memory access time of a system, plus the probability of the fall

16
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:41.190
into the time taken to service apage fault, not the time taken to serve as a base for intown is an

17
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.920
addition of pitchforked overhead.

18
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.360
Plus swap it out plus swap it in plus restart overhead.

19
00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:01.170
Now restart overhead means that when pitchforked is fully solved and completed, then Sebou has to restart

20
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.030
the instruction which it was executing and resulted in page pitchforked.

21
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.110
So the time taken to restart that particular instruction is called Restart the WHAT so you can compute

22
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.810
effective access time for memory access.

23
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:24.120
Given P is the probability of default fault in a system by using the following formula, often it is

24
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.590
asked in some written exam to calculate it.

25
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.250
And of course you will be given values of various parameters such as memory, X's time pitchforked overhead

26
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.810
page time, space and time or restart or what.

27
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.280
So quite easy.
