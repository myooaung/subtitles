00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.220
So, guys, before actually we proceed further to learn how to write a true democracy.

2
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.660
It is important for us to understand that exactly how far looks.

3
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.640
So you can see in this slide that I have written the syntax of the for loop.

4
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:29.440
So you can see that the for loop has four parts, the initialization part condition part, next iteration

5
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.120
part and the body part.

6
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:39.310
Somehow let us discuss the sequence in which each of these parts are for loop execute the very first

7
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.420
part of the for loop which execute is the initialization part.

8
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.710
And note that for a loop the initialization part executes only once after that.

9
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.590
The next part that execute is the conditioned part.

10
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.790
Right.

11
00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:01.000
And only when this condition is true, then the next part that execute is the body part.

12
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.760
Right?

13
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.370
Once the execution of the body part has finished, then the next part of the for loop that executes

14
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.200
is that next iteration part.

15
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:20.550
Right, and then again, after the execution of next iteration, part of the follow, the condition,

16
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.700
part of the for loop executes again.

17
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.310
And when this condition is true, then again, the body part of the for loop execute.

18
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.850
So you can see that in the for loop here is a loop.

19
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.020
So the loop is between the step number three, step number four and step number five.

20
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.040
And this loop keeps on going as long as this condition is true.

21
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.280
So this is how for Loop actually works.

22
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.710
Things to note here is that that the initialization part executes only once.

23
00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.270
And the next important thing to notice about this for Loop is that that immediately after the conditioned

24
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.300
part is evaluated and if the condition is true, then the body part executes.

25
00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:15.510
It is only after the body part has completed its execution, then only the next iteration, part of

26
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.950
the for loop executes.

27
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:26.500
And then the cycle between the step three, step four and step five keeps on going as long as the condition

28
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.120
is evaluated to true.

29
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.650
So now, having learned the semantics of the for loop, we will write iterative macros, which will

30
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.350
be actually wrapper over for loops.

31
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.310
So now let us discuss how to write iterative macro to iterate over our linked list.

32
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:53.590
So now let us discuss our first example of writing my crew to outrage over our linked list in the next

33
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.130
slide.
