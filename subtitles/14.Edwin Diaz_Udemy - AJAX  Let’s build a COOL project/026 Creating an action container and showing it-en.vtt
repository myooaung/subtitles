00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.110

All right welcome back to the student.



2

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.730

So in this lecture here I'm going to start adding a lot more functionality to or a little application



3

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.050

here.



4

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.740

Basically what we're missing is the update in the lead at this point.



5

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.360

Now we could add some bunds here.



6

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.690

And you know do we.



7

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.550

That would be easy to do but I want to actually do it in another fashion that would help you you know



8

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.480

gain more knowledge and be more creative with your applications out there.



9

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.710

Basically learn more like little things you know in a different way on time.



10

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.330

So my students can learn as much as possible.



11

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.900

Right that's my goal as an instructor.



12

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.190

So anyway what I want to build here basically is that functionality that when we click on this link



13

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.760

you will have a box pop up here that will have an input type tetes with the information from the data



14

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.300

base for this title.



15

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.230

We have a bunch there that you can update it and another one there that you can delete it and maybe



16

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.900

a button there to close up shots right.



17

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.090

So there's a whole bunch of functionalities that we can add to this little application here.



18

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.220

And I just want to you know help you add that one there.



19

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.100

So anyway let's start.



20

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.540

All right.



21

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.520

So the first thing is the markup we need a market for this for the next batch here.



22

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.290

And the link and the functionality for Jake werie.



23

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.520

Now for those of you that you know don't know much Jake where we have a really good cores that can help



24

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.340

you even get a lot better than what you're learning in this course.



25

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.870

So let's build a markup let's go all the way to the bottom here.



26

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:35.270

And if you see I'm already putting a little comments here so I suggest you do the same for your cold



27

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.460

right here in this.



28

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:48.030

If we're in a class or wrong way to actually build a nother Kente table here and not a table but the



29

00:01:48.140 --> 00:02:02.720

container like this and this at action container or write like this then we go and we can put a little



30

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.580

comment here and we can say something like let's just do this one here.



31

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.650

Copy this one they're selected.



32

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:20.700

Whoops that took everything there.



33

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.320

All right.



34

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.070

So we need to actually put something here.



35

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.820

So that way we know it works.



36

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.960

And now we need to get the links.



37

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.470

All right.



38

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.100

So let's go to this play on the score cards and right here on the title let's actually create a link



39

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.190

here and let's close it



40

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.020

and then we go.



41

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.920

That should be good to go there.



42

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.070

So if you refresh.



43

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.500

Here you can see the little hello here and the links are working already.



44

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.000

All right perfect.



45

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.830

So what else.



46

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.470

Well we need some type of we need to hide.



47

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.850

First of all.



48

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:06.360

Mark up right here so we need this ID all the way to the top to right this right.



49

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.080

Your comments are not going to put it because I don't want to spend time on that right now.



50

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.150

Since your time is valuable right.



51

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.670

So we have this I.D. and we're going to target it and we're going to say I want you to just hide it



52

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.650

Jake where we save it.



53

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.920

We go back refresh.



54

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.080

He say it's hidden.



55

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.670

So it's working.



56

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.530

The functionality is the link when we click on this link here we want to be able to open something right.



57

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.720

So let's put a link there.



58

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.230

So let's say not a link an ID right an ID here for this link.



59

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.520

And it's called title link.



60

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.380

Now I'll show you what happens in a minute.



61

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.830

Already know what's wrong.



62

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.970

But I want to show you what's wrong just in case in the future you have that issue of yourself.



63

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.860

All right.



64

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.160

So let's go back to end it and let's write it functionality.



65

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:09.100

So let's target that and we're going to say on we're going to use a function called on click and then



66

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:18.870

write the function here parentheses and curly brackets and bring it down on the click of this ID.



67

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.400

I want you to just say alert.



68

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.110

Now if I say this this should work right.



69

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.910

I mean this is correct.



70

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.190

And you can verify that.



71

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.590

But if you go here you can see that if I click on it it doesn't work



72

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.700

and actually we need to put a hash on these play cards right here.



73

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.390

So that link doesn't submit



74

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.770

if I click on it nothing happens.



75

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.290

All right.



76

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.990

And the reason why is because this data here is being displayed dynamically.



77

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.470

All right.



78

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.380

So because it's been displayed dynamically basically it's not really available in the DOM yet.



79

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.790

Right.



80

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:12.330

When we are clicking on it we are trying to get that data in the DOM but it's not because it's being



81

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:22.750

displayed dynamically so we need to do is we need to go back to index and take this call that a year



82

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:32.720

included in that file where the dynamic code is so will come all the way to the bottom of the file.



83

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.520

And save it.



84

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.080

And now we go back to it and refresh.



85

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.400

I click on this and it works beautiful.



86

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.610

But look what happens if I click on the second one



87

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.450

I double click it triple click it and nothing works just the first one.



88

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.230

Why.



89

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:04.240

Well when you have dynamic contact like this in the loop All right you're only going to get the first



90

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.010

item from there because you're using an ID.



91

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.480

And I know that is weird.



92

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.090

And that's the way it is.



93

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.670

All right.



94

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.810

So let's go back to this link right here and make it a class.



95

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.270

All right.



96

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.100

Remember that.



97

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.810

That's super important that's going to make you a better developer.



98

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.320

I'm trying to give you you know my experiences my mistakes from the past.



99

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.800

And so that way you can be better.



100

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:36.570

So we have a class there let's make sure that this is a class save it refresh it.



101

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.190

Now you go to the second one.



102

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.980

It works right.



103

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:46.470

If you go to the last one it works beautiful so they are working all of them.



104

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.970

All right.



105

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.540

So beautiful.



106

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.670

All right.



107

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.570

So this is working now so what do we want to do when we click it.



108

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.750

Well we want to actually show the actual container.



109

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.990

All right so let's target this guy right here.



110

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.950

And that's the first thing we want to do want to show it.



111

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:11.660

Refresh.



112

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.410

Come here and we click it.



113

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.120

We save it.



114

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.060

But we are hiding it right away.



115

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:17.960

All right.



116

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.590

That's just because he's going around in the loop again.



117

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.330

So for now we're going to leave it like this.



118

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.730

I just wanted to show you that.



119

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:36.610

And later on we'll build the functionality of another buy in there that will actually be available here



120

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.270

to close.



121

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:38.880

Right.



122

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.900

So anyway thank you so much for watching on the next lecture.



123

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.430

We'll continue with this and we'll do it a little faster.



124

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.900

Rice will be ready.
