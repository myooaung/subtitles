00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.730

All right welcome back a student.



2

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.500

So in this lecture we're going to start playing around with bogs in our little application here.



3

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.490

I like to create these lectures here because we learn a lot right.



4

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.560

If we make a mistake we can go back and fix it so next time we make that mistake or a similar mistake



5

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.630

when we have an idea what's going on in our application.



6

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.620

So I'd like to leave lectures like this and come back and fix them up for you a little bit for us and



7

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.340

that way we can get to learn a little more.



8

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.980

But anyway so what is the problem here.



9

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.520

Well the problem is it's very simple if we click on Honda right let's say we click on this car and we



10

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.020

want to we want to lead it.



11

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.640

We get a confirmation but we click OK and it Tondo.



12

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.420

For some reason



13

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.270

right.



14

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.040

Let's go back to in and let's try it.



15

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.490

Toyota right now click on it and as you can see the lead at another record.



16

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.320

All right.



17

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.130

And if we click Nissan delete it to you and you see QCA leading the top record.



18

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:13.400

So for some reason my application was working good before and all of a sudden it just started working



19

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.050

now working right.



20

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.900

So let's go ahead and fix it up a little bit.



21

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:27.470

So what we're doing here very simple is on the delete functionality in the process that BHB file we



22

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.900

are targeting this title link.



23

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:39.680

All right we're getting the rail from title link and we should be getting the rail the rail from the



24

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.730

title link because if you go back to the splay cars these are display cars.



25

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.490

No it's back here in Prosser's I believe all the way on top.



26

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.200

There we go.



27

00:01:50.300 --> 00:02:02.910

If we go back here you can see that the rail right here is from this and put in with this input that



28

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.280

has a tidal input class.



29

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.710

All right so that's what we have decided that the correct ID.



30

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.710

So that's what we've got to get it from right.



31

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.970

So let's go back down and change it.



32

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.380

So we're going to target that specific class save it go back to it and then know some of you already



33

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.470

fix this but just in case you haven't that is fits right there.



34

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.370

So let's just add a couple more cars real quick and for Audi.



35

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.170

All right.



36

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.110

We're going to click on it and now Feraud is gone.



37

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.620

Click on this.



38

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.550

Now Toyota is gone and so on.



39

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.390

All right.



40

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.650

Pretty cool stuff.



41

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.520

I'm just going to Reisinger over stuff and stuff.



42

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.290

There we go.



43

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.410

Let's fix it up a little bit to make sure that it's working.



44

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.360

Nissan that will Toyota



45

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.370

and for.



46

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.470

I know that's a very different car but you get my point right.



47

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.190

Click on it and we can delete Farhadi from there.



48

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.330

All right so he's working now.



49

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.830

Right.



50

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.550

So I just think as you guys see any other bugs in there in the system let me know and I'll come back



51

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.940

to it and find a solution.



52

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.070

And you know create a video for it.



53

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.960

Thank you so much for watching this lecture and keeping up with me and being patient and I'll see you



54

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.800

in the next one.
