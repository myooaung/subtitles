1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,150
All right welcome back my students so in the last lecture we were getting some type of bug here.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,410
Well this is not actually a bug.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,080
This is actually the form Sending get requests.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,260
Right.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,820
Basically sending you are l parameters and we don't want it to do that.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,000
What we want to do is send post requests which are actually more secured post data.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,620
So we need to go back to our form.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,660
Right we don't have that much time on The Last Lecture out of anyone that lecture to be 20 minutes.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,510
So that's why I caught it off like that.

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,940
Sorry about that if you didn't like it.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,650
But I think short lectures actually better.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,090
So let's go to index the e-mail and let's make sure that our form data right here.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,660
This form has a method of post right and that's it.

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,840
That's all we need there.

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,270
Let's go to our cars here.

16
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:58,030
What we doing here is we're saying if set basic Luisa's this function from BHP saying if this PPO's

17
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,410
data is set then we'll you know execute this.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,520
And basically remember that this current name field is coming from the form.

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:09,910
Right.

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,070
Right here this name actually has its value and that's why we get in there that's it.

21
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:20,570
POST data that we are receiving these are going to turn into variables and it's going to be in the mental

22
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:21,260
of polls.

23
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:28,250
All right so once we save that we come back here we take these you're out parameter come back here and

24
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,160
add the car.

25
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:35,410
And as you can see it says data received.

26
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,990
So that's beautiful.

27
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,790
So we are we are actually executing data.

28
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,670
All right.

29
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,580
Beautiful.

30
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,130
Now we need to actually spell that a little bit better.

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,350
Data received.

32
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,990
All right.

33
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,930
So that's where this is going.

34
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:12,510
If we want to we can actually create ph P can convert this page in the the mailing to ended up fee and

35
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,010
receive the data right up here.

36
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:21,070
All right we don't have to send the data somewhere else if we don't want right that's up to us.

37
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,640
All right.

38
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,320
So

39
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:35,060
now now that we got that squared down to the point where everything is working good we're actually sending

40
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,020
these data and we are echoing that data right here.

41
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,520
We could return these data.

42
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:43,600
All right.

43
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,330
And then do something else with it.

44
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,620
But what we're going to be doing is inserting stuff in the database.

45
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,390
Right.

46
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,130
So let's go ahead and write a query down and we're going to say insert

47
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:10,800
into and this is how we put stuff in our database into cars which is a table right and we'll put the

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,550
parentheses this is going to we are writing actually you a statement and you should know that values

49
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:31,260
and we gonna to be actually writing values for the I believe the column name in ph P is actually

50
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,130
a color name is cars right.

51
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:47,410
And what we're getting here is this post we're going to convert into a very old variable.

52
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,170
So that way we can use it inside there.

53
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,090
So you're going to call his car name right.

54
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,190
And we just put it right here in between coult single quotes because we've got double codes outside.

55
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:07,490
We'll put a semicolon there and what we need here is my SU ally.

56
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,850
Actually I don't.

57
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,080
This needs to be Querrey car name.

58
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:24,290
We are scientists or variable mice here like Querrey All right we'll pass into a connection which is

59
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:31,640
included already in the on the top of this page and we pass and query.

60
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:32,860
All right.

61
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,390
And once that's done we should be actually seeing some stuff going on but before we do that let's make

62
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,290
sure that this

63
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,930
this is going through.

64
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,830
If it's not then we need to display an error right.

65
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:52,900
So you're going to put a quick die here and you're going to say where he failed.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,540
If we if we fail then we'll welcome cutting a heire function here and make sure like we did in the one

67
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,470
and make sure that we get we know exactly what's going on.

68
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,140
Right.

69
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,280
So let's check it out real quick.

70
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,340
Let's come back here and we can go back.

71
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:23,060
Once we do this we can redirect and I'll show you how to redirect back to we come here we redirect to

72
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,860
add to and it's actually in the mail.

73
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:28,990
All right.

74
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:36,760
But we also need to put a location here Paulin and space.

75
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,070
Make sure you do that location with a cup of oil.

76
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,910
That's best practice then location call in space.

77
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,310
And they say the amount.

78
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:45,980
All right.

79
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,080
Make sure that you are actually Kochie.

80
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,490
Debbie

81
00:05:52,730 --> 00:06:02,680
for some people you might not get this working unless you have let's go to our connection here and put

82
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,830
up the start.

83
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,620
This is just a turn on output buffering so we can do redirection.

84
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,520
All right.

85
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:22,950
And we don't get no errors so and save Let's type in something here is like a nice car and add bright.

86
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,500
You didn't see it but we got redirected back to this page here.

87
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,200
So let's go to our

88
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,510
database and our table cars.

89
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,560
We see that we don't have anything here.

90
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,810
Let's refresh this.

91
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,760
And now you can see that he says nice car.

92
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,560
All right.

93
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,390
And this is all using AJAX.

94
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,120
Beautiful right.

95
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,470
Beautiful beautiful beautiful.

96
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,680
So we can say another car like this just something else.

97
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,090
Where can we put it here.

98
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,650
Bad car.

99
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,290
All right.

100
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:01,650
Enter

101
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,650
this go and check it out right.

102
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,410
Fresh.

103
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,590
And now we can see who says bad car.

104
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,160
All right.

105
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:20,580
So in the next lecture will actually make it make this a little better.

106
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:28,770
All right we'll create an update we'll create delete and we actually want to even see our database information

107
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,210
down here so we'll create something to see that.

108
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,120
So it's going to be pretty awesome application you're going to like it.

109
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,130
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

110
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,010
Keep having fun in though and I'll show you some more stuff.

111
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,810
Take care.
