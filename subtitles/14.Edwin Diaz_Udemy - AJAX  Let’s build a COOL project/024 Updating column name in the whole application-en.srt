1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,300
All right welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:09,090
So hopefully you guys follow my advice on the last lecture you in which I told you that you needed to

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:16,940
change your column your BHB cold where we change the column title name.

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,470
All right.

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,420
If you did not let me just walk you right through it right because right now you can add cars or you

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,210
can search if you try to search you get this arrows here or if you try to add you can add because you

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,760
need to do that cold as well with a new

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,590
column name.

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:41,250
All right so in the search that BHB you can go ahead and say select from cars where title would go.

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,880
That's going to work now you save it.

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,960
And then as well as in the ad cars out BHB.

12
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,950
All right.

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,280
So you can go heading into

14
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:06,640
actually right there title and you could just leave that one now that way and it should work.

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,010
You can change everything if you like but I'm gonna leave it that way it is Honda defined in its cards.

16
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:23,630
On line 9:29 has checked out a quick line 29 which are doing quite We OK fetching and should be title

17
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,020
here.

18
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,300
All right let's go and check it out real quick.

19
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,450
I'm doing this with you so that way we get we are on the same page.

20
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,010
All right.

21
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,840
So now let's add another car here if I can come up with another one.

22
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,520
Maserati I think that's the name.

23
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,520
Actually that's true.

24
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:50,240
I don't even remember how to spell that name for that car just example car at and you can see that simple

25
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,190
car works right.

26
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,680
So we're good to go with that.

27
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,080
What else do we need here.

28
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,130
OK.

29
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,640
All right.

30
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,310
Hopefully you were able to do that.

31
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,330
And I just wanted to walk you right away just in case you had any issues.

32
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:08,920
All right.

33
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:15,930
So now that we can display we can search our database for cars right.

34
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:25,820
We can add cars now we need to find a way to delete right.

35
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,880
That would be nice.

36
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,640
They delete all that stuff.

37
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,450
All right so in the next lectures hopefully we ask some of those lectures after this one if by having

38
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,300
these please be patient.

39
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,280
I will Adams when I have some time.

40
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,890
I remember this a bonus lectures for the course.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,040
So thank you for watching this and I'll see you in the next one.

42
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,850
Thank you.
