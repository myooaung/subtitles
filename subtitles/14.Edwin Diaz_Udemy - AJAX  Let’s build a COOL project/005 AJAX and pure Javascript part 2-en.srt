00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,750
Hi welcome back on the last lecture we talked a little bit about object's properties methods many states

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:13,170
and statuses on this lecture you will going to see how everything is how we can put everything together.

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,950
So now that we have created this object is being held on this variable here we can access the methods

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,580
which are already predefined and the properties of it.

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,140
Right.

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,400
Those are pretty already they are ready made for us.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,170
We just got them using my right.

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,390
So the first one the first method that we are going to be using is the open method.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,780
So we grab the object and that is how you put it together.

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,890
This is how you use an object method of an object would it not.

11
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,790
Remember what I told you in the last lecture.

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,370
Okay.

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,530
And then basically this in this function you want to call it you can call it a function if you like

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,740
but since it's an object we call it method.

15
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,580
So the first parameter of this method takes is the data type.

16
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:59,610
In this case we were sending a get later on and want to show you how to send a post request but we use

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,100
GET request to get information from the database.

18
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,420
All right.

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,580
This is mainly the good reason to do that.

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,130
And then we use post to update the lead.

21
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,990
You know which is more secure then the second parameter is where we want these data from.

22
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,150
We want it from the right.

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,390
So we are sending this there to this file.

24
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,140
Right.

25
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,090
And then we want to send it in a synchronously way.

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,320
All right basically what that means is you do you want your page to refresh yes or no.

27
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:39,940
And if you don't want it to refresh you make sure that you said this here to asynchronous Knisley a

28
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:45,870
synchronous requests an array which is not going to refresh anyway that word was kind of hard for me.

29
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,090
But anyway the next thing once we opened the connection.

30
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:56,500
All right we need to track the ready States just like I told you on the last lecture.

31
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,670
All right there are five of them I think I said four before but they are actually five because that

32
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,810
0 count for one right.

33
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,260
Zero is the number right of their request.

34
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,230
So we can kind of take them with the numbers.

35
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:17,190
We are actually looking for number four so we can say something like If Let me just write it down real

36
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,390
quick here.

37
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,160
So that way you can see how it's done so.

38
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,230
All right we grab the object and we say on ready state change.

39
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,690
So we are tracking it now.

40
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,240
I want you to execute this function.

41
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,990
All right.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,470
So one wants is actually going through those stages to two those red states we can detect to see one

43
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,890
number it is.

44
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,170
So we can say if the range state equals to for

45
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,510
and we can also detect the object status.

46
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,510
So if it's equal to 200 We know he's OK right.

47
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,140
And then we can do something with information.

48
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:06,310
So we can get everything back in there are not a property called response.

49
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,910
Tests like this.

50
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:17,570
All right so we get them back in this attribute right from the object and then we can sort this wherever

51
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:22,520
we want if we want inserted with javascript we just say you know

52
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:35,180
let's create an element here let's say for example we had an element with an ID of container.

53
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,500
There you go.

54
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:36,990
All right.

55
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:45,710
So we grab an element within the container and we enter any l that's coming from here.

56
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,370
All right so basically we are signing the response to this container here using javascript.

57
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,720
Really cool stuff right.

58
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:59,400
And then we can come here and finish this next thing is to send this right.

59
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,260
And then here that's

60
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,390
it.

61
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:12,050
Now let's actually look for a way to activate javascript Ajax.

62
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,430
So I got some stuff that I can face here.

63
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,020
That way you don't have to see me writing it.

64
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,510
There we go.

65
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:24,730
So what I did is I have a button here with an enclave attached to it that is going to be calling a function

66
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:31,330
when we click it and then whatever response we get back from here he's going to insert it in this element

67
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,920
with an idea container which is right here.

68
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,660
So we're getting several information down here below.

69
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,280
All right.

70
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:48,330
So I'm going to actually pace all this.

71
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:55,740
So this ready from here I'm going to pace everything and I'm going to create a function here.

72
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,490
I just want to make sure that I'm not making any mistakes because I'm explaining how everything works

73
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:00,960
right.

74
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:06,950
But all right Burfoot.

75
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,490
All right.

76
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,780
So as you can see I've wrapped everything around in this in its function.

77
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,610
And then we are calling it right here.

78
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:13,930
All right.

79
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:21,390
Let's find out if it works let's make sure that we Sonthi and the javascript here and we can let's say

80
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:26,790
for example we are getting something from the database right.

81
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,500
And this is where we put our mice.

82
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,470
Q Well you know fetch all these data from this table.

83
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,080
But in this case we don't have that.

84
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,110
So we're just going to say yes it's working or something like that.

85
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,500
Save it.

86
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,960
That's opened his file on the browser and let's check it out real quick

87
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,900
hear this if it works then Imphal yes is working as you can see that was really fast.

88
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:55,910
All right.

89
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,340
And to send post requests is super simple.

90
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,880
All we got to do is two more things I believe here.

91
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,360
All right well we've got to use the object again.

92
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,650
Well first of all we need to change this from get to post right.

93
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:15,430
And then we can use the object again to set the request Hetter.

94
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:15,750
All right.

95
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,350
Is a header that's also sent to the server every time.

96
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:26,730
Next e-mail page is view the headers in the background there is already pre-define but we can change

97
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,310
it.

98
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:27,700
All right.

99
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,700
And basically here what we're going to be changing is the content type.

100
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,550
All right.

101
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,500
So we've got to change the content type to let the server know what kind of data is going to do and

102
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,970
going to copy them because I already have.

103
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,850
I don't want to write it down.

104
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,450
All right so we're going to change.

105
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,750
We've got a method that would change for us.

106
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:52,480
We passed it first parameter which is Content-Type and the second parameter is this application forwards

107
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:59,670
slash and you are in court right now that we are sending a post request

108
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,590
when I paste in my code you can see all the information here.

109
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,120
Well this is where all the posts would be.

110
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:17,560
So if I have a post request that I need to send I can put this and this would be the key of the post.

111
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,470
Super global.

112
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:26,850
And this would be the value the value in this case would be my name ampersand and say password here.

113
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,850
And that would be secret and something like that.

114
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,050
All right so now to access this information in the other side.

115
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,830
Super simple right we can go back.

116
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,320
Can I get my stuff back my.

117
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:42,790
Go

118
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:58,820
right now here we can say if a set post.

119
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,560
All right we can echo now

120
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,360
post I believe the key was name

121
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,360
and let's just write some text here.

122
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,340
And here would be maybe.

123
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:27,380
I think it was email or password your yelling password password.

124
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,230
All right.

125
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,760
So let's check this out real quick.

126
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:45,060
Because we are trying to echo this.

127
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,180
We are on the HP page of course is now going to be set.

128
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,290
We need to set it from here sent.

129
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,420
As you can see Edwyn and secret.

130
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,860
All right.

131
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,430
So the post requests we are getting from here.

132
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:04,540
Oh and by the way I'm from the future so if you see some files here on the left Cy don't worry about

133
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,780
it we haven't done those yet in the course.

134
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,570
All right.

135
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:14,000
So I just came to get some extra lecture here because I think you had to know about this stuff.

136
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,940
I think I've already told you that but just in case.

137
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:22,980
But anyway this is how we can communicate using javascript pure javascript and Ageod's and the server.

138
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,090
Right.

139
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,730
So hopefully this help you help you understand how everything works and you're happy.

140
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,960
That's what I care about.

141
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,990
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
