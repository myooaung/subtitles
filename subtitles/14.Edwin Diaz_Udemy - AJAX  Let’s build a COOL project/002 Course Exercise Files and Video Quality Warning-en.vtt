00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.870

Hi welcome back my students there are a couple of things that I want to discuss before we move on with



2

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.710

the course.



3

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.500

The first thing is video quality.



4

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.380

I want to make sure that whatever you are watching from my course is crispy clear high definition.



5

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.220

So we are going to make sure that our how our high definition feature is turned on.



6

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.510

All right so right here on the bottom on your video player there is an HD button right there and going



7

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.170

to expand it so you can see it.



8

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.260

As you can see right here if I click on to watch this ttes as you can see right now is a little blurry.



9

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.180

If I click on it right now it looks a lot better than what he did before he makes a world of difference.



10

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.620

Right.



11

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.940

So make sure that you HD features turn on these between your volume and your time maybe later on you



12

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:49.850

really would change this.



13

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.130

But right now you need to make sure that your HD is turned on.



14

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.850

Now the second thing that I want to discuss is how to download your exercise files.



15

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.020

Some of you already know this but some of you are new to you to me and do not know this.



16

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.200

So right on the right hand side.



17

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.790

These are your lectures here on top you got four tabs right now.



18

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.970

The first tab is for your lectures.



19

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.330

The second tab is for downloading any material that you short to once you to download right now.



20

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:24.070

I mean that down in instructor mode only but in your site you will see your link for you to download



21

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.940

your exercise files.



22

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.110

So click on that link and download your exercise files right now.



23

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.360

Right now the lecture that you are watching has your exercise files.



24

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.990

So go to this tab and download it.



25

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.710

Now I do expect you to follow from scratch on everything I do.



26

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.060

But if you do have a problem the exercise files are going to get you out of that problem.



27

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.380

And of course you can contact me anytime.



28

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.340

That third tap is just going to allow you to make a discussion about this specific course lecture and



29

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.500

then the last one you can take notes.



30

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.020

Now before you go there's one last thing that I want you did to actually make sure that you have on.



31

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.070

We're going to go to somebody else's course.



32

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.400

All right.



33

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.480

And I need to do this so that way I can show you because it doesn't show on my side since I'm logged



34

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.790

into their account.



35

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.230

So there is a gear symbol right here right.



36

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.950

If you click on it you're going to get this coarse e-mail settings you're probably going to have this



37

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:21.820

turn off.



38

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:28.300

Make sure that new lecture or emails is turned on because this is going to let you know every time I



39

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.240

make a new lecture about the course and this is super important.



40

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.040

Sometimes like you know I mean you lectures just to fix other lectures that I make mistakes on.



41

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.990

Or maybe I want to update my course or maybe I'm including extra features.



42

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.820

So make sure that that's on announcements are really good.



43

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.430

I send sometimes announcements for coupons or new courses for free.



44

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.590

So you know you guys can jump into those.



45

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.140

So new announced memos are really important to have on.



46

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.920

I'd say just keep this on all of it.



47

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.380

Now another thing that I really really ask you to do and it does it just a favor for me I've spent a



48

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.600

lot of time on these courses and I love what I do.



49

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.430

But you guys make a really awesome when you guys write reviews.



50

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.470

It takes only one minute to write a review and it makes a world difference because I make discourse



51

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:24.190

with a lot of love and sometimes I like to see my students you know sending a good review or letting



52

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.230

me know if something's wrong with the course for if you want to write a good review all you have to



53

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.200

do is just right click put a title here and put the stars.



54

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.580

Now if you if you do have something negative to say or for some reason you don't like something about



55

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.030

the course.



56

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.060

What I asked you to do before you write a review is contact me give me the opportunity to fix it.



57

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.560

If you see something wrong.



58

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.860

So we asked you to go here to the discussion and type in your problem and let me fix it.



59

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.660

Reviews are super important for us instructor.



60

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.010

Remember some of us do this for a living and this is our our money for a home for a family.



61

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.820

And this is our life.



62

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.830

So reviews either can damage the business or it can damage instructor.



63

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.600

All right.



64

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.370

So this is this is people's lives that you have in your hand when you're writing a review.



65

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.420

So I put a lot of love in my courses a lot of dedication.



66

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.750

I love what I do.



67

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:26.290

But if you have anything that you you want to recommend you can always Message me you king out of discussion.



68

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.090

But if you have a really good review and that you don't have a problem with the Course.



69

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.250

Write me a review and let me know that I'm doing well.



70

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.220

That gives me a lot of motivation.



71

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:42.880

Anyways thank you so much for really really watching this lecture and being in my course.



72

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.290

I'm looking forward to helping you finish this course and looking forward to see you empower the courses.



73

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.810

Thank you again and I'll see you in the next lectures.
