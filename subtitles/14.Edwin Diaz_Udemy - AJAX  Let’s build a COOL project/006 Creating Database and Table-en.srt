00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,330
Hi my dear students I hope you're having a great day.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,030
I'm having an awesome day because I have the chance of teaching you this matyr that I know will help

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,840
you get further in your professional career.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,980
Be grateful that you are learning this because a lot of people can't it out or people even have a computer

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,210
right now or a phone that they can watch this with as I said on this lecture.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,460
We're building a database.

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,850
We're building a database table and we are sending some data inside that table.

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,240
Right.

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:36,360
I'm assuming you already know BHB my you a lie and if you don't have the best scores in the planet to

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:43,100
teach you just check out my Ph.D. course for beginners where I teach all the fundamentals of PH BE O.P.

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:50,280
Ma Su ally and I even teach you how to build a CIMS just like Wordpress Drupal or Joomla.

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:50,790
All right.

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,700
Just make sure that you check all those courses if you don't know them because if you don't know BHB

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,830
this won't make much sense.

15
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,620
All right so just to let you know.

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,710
So what we're going to be doing is let's go and create that database right now.

17
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,830
So let's go to our local host.

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,770
And you should know how to do this already because if you know my ask you l or my ask you a lie you

19
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,450
know that we have a server right we have a local server in our computer.

20
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:29,410
So let's use the software ph be my admin just to create a simple database right where you can post his

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:38,880
video and create a database and the table is going to create a database called Ajax right there.

22
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:51,350
And Danny said that that database is going to create a table called cars are going to create two columns

23
00:01:51,350 --> 00:02:00,160
there and then click go here I'm going to create an ID and then are going to create a road called cars.

24
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,720
This is going to be an integer

25
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,790
primary and auto increment.

26
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,220
Right.

27
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,630
Cars is going to be Vark car and to 55 that's fine.

28
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,890
All right.

29
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,750
That is good.

30
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,740
Where are you Dick.

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,260
Perfect.

32
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,450
Right.

33
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:19,810
All right.

34
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,740
So now that we created a database in the table let's insert some data.

35
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:31,350
You are just going to insert a couple rows of data and you're going to create five more

36
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:42,190
so when you're going to create a card called Honda Civic here because I like the car is kind of nice

37
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,830
right.

38
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,500
Honda's are really good cars but I also like BMW.

39
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:46,870
Right.

40
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,610
So I'm just going to create another Honda here Honda sit and

41
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:03,310
I'm just going to make sure that you take these NORAD's checked checkbox on check them because if you

42
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,070
don't check them they will not show.

43
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,370
All right.

44
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:13,820
So Honda sedan Honda CRV and I think that's about it for Honda.

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,800
Let's go ahead and create some some more Actually let's create 10 of them at least.

46
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,880
We're going to need some data.

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,830
BMW and car I.

48
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:31,570
I actually have a BMW not to show off but it's not a really new car to this date but it's it's not that

49
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,220
old either.

50
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:32,790
Right.

51
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,430
But it's a really nice car.

52
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,510
I actually it was my dream car.

53
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:43,690
And finally I was able to get it with just knowing some of the knowledge on teaching you here.

54
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:52,800
All right so be it that 330 BMW and three BMW.

55
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,390
What is it.

56
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,320
Five

57
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,690
VW at sits B and W

58
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,750
What is the one that they have Emmets sits.

59
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,540
I might be making up some of this sense.

60
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,770
They have so many different models.

61
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,200
Right now we're going to create a Mercedes that's another nice car right.

62
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,000
Benz Right.

63
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:32,280
And then they have the three hundred in my city.

64
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,110
Right let's create another watchfully Oops that's too many rolls right.

65
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,630
Doesn't matter.

66
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,790
We're just going to keep going down a little bit.

67
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,130
That's it.

68
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:49,490
Mercedes which is Mercedes 320

69
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,260
you can go and grab a list somewhere on line.

70
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:56,360
That's fine.

71
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,260
All right we're almost done.

72
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,280
I promise.

73
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,100
And the next one would be maybe a nice Toyota.

74
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,940
That's a popular car right.

75
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,730
To your to Tacoma

76
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,150
your Corolla

77
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,380
or Camry.

78
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,850
All right that's fine.

79
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,490
OK.

80
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,220
I think that's enough just to show you show you some functionalities.

81
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,420
Let's do a couple more I like I like cars a lot.

82
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,920
And try.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,350
All right.

84
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,450
So this could go on any of these.

85
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,850
And we've got 16 rolls right.

86
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,960
So I think we were good with this lecture here.

87
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,120
I think this is long enough.

88
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,210
Let's just check our.

89
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,610
All right.

90
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,590
So we got some some data here going on right.

91
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,870
Perfect.

92
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:54,120
So in the next lecture we're going to continue with building our documents and connecting with this

93
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,840
database.

94
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,140
All right.

95
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,910
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and I'll see you on the next one.

96
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:00,470
All right.

97
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,150
Take care.
