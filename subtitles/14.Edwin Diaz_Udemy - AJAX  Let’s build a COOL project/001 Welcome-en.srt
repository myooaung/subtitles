1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,730
Have my students I want to give us some tips before you start this course.

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,650
The first thing that I want to tell you is you should make goals.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,050
Why.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:16,780
Because when you make goals you're telling yourself exactly how you're going to get there.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:24,770
You making a road map you're telling yourself you know what I want to get here by this specific day

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,980
and going to get there by doing this every single day.

7
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:36,980
Make goals for yourself sit down and put a check mark every time you finish do something every single

8
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,610
day towards that goal that you have.

9
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:45,560
Even if it's not this course you're doing all the courses do anything in your life make sure that you

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:52,370
do something every single day and you will get there sooner than you think you want to keep motivated.

11
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,840
Think about the results.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,170
Think about the things that you will be able to obtain once you finish.

13
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,870
For example a specific course once you finish a course.

14
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,090
One of the things that you can get.

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,960
You can get a better job right because you're going to have more knowledge and more knowledge equals

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,680
why more money with money.

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,710
Now I'm not going to say that money is everything but with money you can do a lot of things you can

18
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:24,640
help people with money you can help yourself you can make yourself very comfortable and you know eat

19
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,920
right exercise right.

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,220
Buy a new car buy a new house give poor people money.

21
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,830
Right.

22
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,630
So more knowledge equals more money.

23
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,110
Always remember that.

24
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:41,590
Leaving yourself if you don't believe in yourself nobody else will believe in you.

25
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,320
I learned the hard way.

26
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,540
If you put yourself down.

27
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,070
All right people are just going to put you more down and down you need to pull yourself up.

28
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:55,330
Believe in yourself you can do anything you set your mind to right now this is a proof right now that

29
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,540
you're watching this video right here.

30
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:57,940
All right.

31
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:03,070
If you were able to get in your computer and watch this video you can watch a hundred more videos and

32
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:07,210
get a hundred times more knowledge to get to where you want to go.

33
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,460
Make every minute of your life count.

34
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,670
Your day will leave.

35
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,310
It will be over in a couple hours and your day will be gone.

36
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,430
It will never come back to you again.

37
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,860
You will get older.

38
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:27,040
Make sure that every minute that you have in your life is doing something to get you to where you want

39
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,680
to go.

40
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:34,230
You have that specific goal in life whatever it is to make more money to be healthier.

41
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:40,830
Make sure that you do something every minute every hour every day towards that goal onto you accomplish

42
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,470
that goal.

43
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,150
And when you accomplish that goal make sure that you remember everything that you went through and celebrate

44
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,130
it because it feels wonderful to do.
