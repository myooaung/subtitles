1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,330
I will come back my students.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,750
I hope you have a great day.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:11,670
Now on this lecture here we're going to be start writing our markup for our male page here.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,160
Now we already tested that and saw that Jake where he's actually working right.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,450
So we don't have to worry about that any more.

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,360
So I'm just going to take that alert off and start writing our markup down here.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,150
So what I really want to do is create a div element and what we run to do right.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,250
This is what we want to do.

9
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,640
Because I know you want to do it.

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:40,830
I'm going to create a container here a different class of container and I just like creating IDs so

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,280
we might not even use this idea later on who knows.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:43,830
Right.

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:53,050
But anyways I'm going to also create an H-2 here called search database.

14
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,740
All right.

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,550
Another thing that we might want to do here is just going to what I'm going to do.

16
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,810
Very simple here.

17
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,300
I'm going to.

18
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:10,760
As a matter of fact I'm going to put it right here I'm going to put it in a class here and test center

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,150
there.

20
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,870
Now you might be wondering why in the way is he doing I'm going to show you right now let's go to the

21
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:20,140
left side right here and you can see that I already got into the center of the page.

22
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,620
This is used in that framework that I tell you about bootstrap right.

23
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:28,500
So if you don't know about it I get a great course that would teach you all than that would introduce

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,270
you to the framework and teach us some tricks.

25
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,390
So anyways

26
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,750
now the next thing for us to do is I'm going to also create another class here just to make this certain

27
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:45,700
size access and it's going to be sets.

28
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,480
That means it's going to have six columns.

29
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:58,750
For those of you that have made greats before you know how that works and call heads as set just copy

30
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,900
them on doing it like I said I'm not going to go into details about this because this is not a Bush

31
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:09,380
Shrub course this is just basically we'll just build and what we need it for our page.

32
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,210
Right.

33
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:15,180
So if I right click on it and I check it you can see that that's right there in the center.

34
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,410
Now bots.

35
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,280
All right.

36
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,920
Perfect.

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,550
All right so what is our next step.

38
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,970
Search our database.

39
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,060
Actually let's just say our database actually won.

40
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,590
There you go.

41
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:39,340
Our next step is to actually to create an input here and if I just leave the input like does

42
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:47,920
refresh digest looks like that would square the input to just one little simple input right.

43
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,870
Well I don't want to leave it like that.

44
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:55,880
I want to create is nice input that's why we've got this framework working for us right.

45
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,010
So I'm just going to make sure that this this class form control

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,590
right.

47
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:14,380
And so you see that form control makes it looks like that perfect that's looking a lot nicer than what

48
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,460
we had before.

49
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:24,520
And now let's also apply some attributes here and you're going to put this one is going to be called

50
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:24,950
name.

51
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:30,360
Let's just make sure that we are enclosed in raising apostrophe's the right way.

52
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:40,270
So this is going to be called search is going to have a search name their name also an ID of search

53
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,480
and as a matter of fact we're also going to be putting a placeholder there.

54
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:55,040
So let's do a placeholder this place holder is going to say search our inventory

55
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,500
right.

56
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:04,570
I think we are done with this and I'm just going to put some BE OUR TAX down here.

57
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:14,730
And we are also going to be creating a another day if you're actually engaged to element with a class

58
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,620
of Fiji set says

59
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:25,690
Id resorts result is fine.

60
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,540
All right.

61
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,820
All right so make sure you copy all of this down.

62
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,350
See that.

63
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,060
All right.

64
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,480
So there you go.

65
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:46,190
Daniel's going to refresh and I think a placeholder is not working let's just make sure that it is spelled

66
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:46,800
correctly.

67
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,840
And there we go.

68
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,020
All right so we have this castrato.

69
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,790
He is looking pretty pretty good in my opinion.

70
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,710
It's very simple.

71
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:00,070
You can put a bag around here if you want or you can you know it depends if you want to just put in.

72
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,000
Put this into your website.

73
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,130
That's fine.

74
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,090
And anyway I think we are done here right for this lecture here.

75
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,300
We don't want to make this too long so anyways.

76
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,530
Copy this down make sure you have it down packed correctly.

77
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:14,950
All right.

78
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,080
Thank you again for allowing me to teach you this.

79
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,800
And I'll see you the next lecture.

80
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,480
Keep it up.

81
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,000
Good job.
