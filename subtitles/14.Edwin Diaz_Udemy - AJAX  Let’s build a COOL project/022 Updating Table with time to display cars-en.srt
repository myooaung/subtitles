1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,220
Welcome back my students for those of you that have been where they have been waiting for me to do this

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:05,750
course.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,050
Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,910
You are awesome.

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,300
Really.

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,310
My students are really nice students anyway.

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,010
So they were going to be updating this up location.

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,800
And while we are going to be updating just a couple of things first of all first of all we are going

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,110
to be updating day displaying here of information from the database.

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,670
So for those of you that are adding stuff to your database and it's not explained for some reason is

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,130
because we are only sending one request to the server.

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,560
We're just telling the server right now listen I'm going to send you these values and update the database

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,400
one time of day this request.

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,410
Just send me back the response.

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,000
One time.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,560
Basically that's what we're saying to the server.

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,550
I'm going to show you what I mean right now.

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,550
So we've got this cold right here.

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:57,320
Yours yours might look a little different than mine and that's just because I move things around a lot

20
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,120
so.

21
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:05,430
But anyway go to this cold right here display where we are sending the information to display on the

22
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,700
score cards at BHB.

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,380
Right.

24
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,370
So get these age outs here.

25
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:15,840
All right and we are sending our request to the server and the server is bringing back the response

26
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,610
and we are displaying it in this section right here.

27
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,330
But we are sending only one.

28
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,260
All right this is only being executing one.

29
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:31,560
So we're saying listen sir I want you to select everything from cars and you know and I want you to

30
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,300
display it right.

31
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,920
So that's one request.

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,060
What we need to do is we need to set a functionality where we keep actually refreshing this updating

33
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,490
these requests sending requests every couple of seconds or every couple of minutes whatever we want.

34
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,510
So let's go back to index and let's do that.

35
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,570
So for that what we're going to be doing is we're going to be wrapping this cold here inside a function

36
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:56,900
like this.

37
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,660
And you can wrap all your cold inside functions if you like but we're going to wrap this inside a function

38
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,730
we're going to call this update cars.

39
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,830
All right.

40
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,020
And we're going to go down here like this.

41
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,630
Make sure that this function this one here

42
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,320
wrapped.

43
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,370
All right.

44
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,710
This code is wrapped in this function.

45
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,200
All right.

46
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,020
So we got this wrapped in a function is not going to work of course because you know we need to call

47
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,770
the function to work.

48
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:35,160
So if you save it and you go back here you won't be able to see anything.

49
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,140
All right we need to call it we need to use a function.

50
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,480
So what I'm going to do what I'm going to do is I'm going to use another function called set interval

51
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,890
in BHB which allows me to actually called a piece of code in my application every couple you know time

52
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,450
every couple of seconds every couple of minutes whatever I want.

53
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,950
So I'm going to show you how to use that.

54
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,160
You're going to be set interval.

55
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,500
And I think bracket's is helping me out right here.

56
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,850
Set interval right there.

57
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,850
So set with a capital I interval.

58
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,510
Right.

59
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,770
And is a function like this.

60
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,360
So we close it with a semi-colon right.

61
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,750
Any inside the function we're going to get that flushing is going to take a couple of parameters.

62
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:22,740
First it's going to take a function or an anonymous function like this and two curly brackets and we

63
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,730
bring it down like that.

64
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,180
All right so now what is going to be executed here.

65
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:38,410
Well we're going to be calling this function and we close with a semi-colon like this.

66
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,670
And the second parameter.

67
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:45,840
This is going to take well when we need to do is set the time that we want to call this function.

68
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:52,170
So right now we want 1000 1000 means one second.

69
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,950
So this function is going to be executing every couple of milliseconds.

70
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,600
So if you want more of course you keep bracing this Ciro's right.

71
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:09,000
Right now that is less than a second and that's too fast and it's going to slow down your application

72
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,650
so let's do one second thing one second is good.

73
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,510
Well even 500 is good.

74
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,960
All right ballista one second so you can see how it works.

75
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,510
All right.

76
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,560
So you can always make a comment here and so that will you know what's going on.

77
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,360
I'm not going to do that because I don't want to waste a lot of time and want to do a couple of more

78
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,590
things in this lecture.

79
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,710
So let's save it.

80
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,520
Maybe I'll do it in the next lectures.

81
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,990
Let's refresh it.

82
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,010
Right now you can see all the values here.

83
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:47,240
Again so now when we insert something here so let's say I want to insert a car we are going to be let's

84
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,590
say.

85
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,910
Wow I just went blank for a minute there.

86
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:51,640
I don't know what car.

87
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,830
OK Toyota.

88
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,250
Let's see.

89
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:01,570
Right click ADD and you can see that inserted Toyota there.

90
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,720
We've got to do a couple more things to this application like maybe MTA in this field one when I get

91
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:14,130
sent maybe requiring the tests just in case is blank you know things like that.

92
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,780
So let me do that again.

93
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,190
Let me see if I can minimize it so you can see it working better.

94
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,850
Let's do I don't know.

95
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,510
Ferrari

96
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,970
you can see it right here again.

97
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,030
And if that's.

98
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:38,370
Let me put this to three seconds so that you can see it when he really does it let's refresh that you

99
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,440
are takes once three seconds.

100
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,210
You see that.

101
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,630
So now let's say it's simple add.

102
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,800
Now I was going to take three seconds and you saw me there.

103
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:48,470
All right.

104
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,420
So that's how that works.

105
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,200
Beautiful.

106
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,670
So in the next lectures we are going to be improving this application a little more.

107
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,140
I hope you like it and I'll see you in the next one.

108
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,420
Take care and thanks for everything.
