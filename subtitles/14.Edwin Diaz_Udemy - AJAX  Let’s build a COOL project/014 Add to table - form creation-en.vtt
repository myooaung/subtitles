00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:07.140

All right welcome back my student in this lecture here I'm going to show you how to add data to our



2

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.630

database to our table inside cars.



3

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.940

Now we know how to search.



4

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.400

We know how to build this.



5

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.610

I'm going to show you another way of actually making a connection with our with Ajax and Jake wari to



6

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.950

our BHB.



7

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.720

And let's go ahead and do this.



8

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.740

First we need a form to add some information to our table.



9

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.430

So let's go to war in the mail right.



10

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.190

This is the forum right here that we're working with right now.



11

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.800

But actually this is not using a form right.



12

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.570

We're going to actually create a form.



13

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.680

So what I'm going to do is I'm going to put a day if you would a class roll.



14

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.010

I'm going to wrap this whole thing around.



15

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.550

This is a male Elliman with a classful roll that's just going to separate my content.



16

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.480

The one that I'm going to create right now.



17

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.840

Right right here I'm going to put another day would close a row and I'm going to create a form.



18

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.080

All right.



19

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.550

This form is going to have a name put to imports.



20

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.180

Actually one is ttes.



21

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:18.160

This is where we're going to have a car name actually you value.



22

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.800

All right on these name matchwood This is how we're going to send information with the name matching



23

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.660

which is how we do it with BHB we're revelent BHB we're going to show you another way of actually doing



24

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.390

this.



25

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.100

That is actually really cool.



26

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.620

But anyway And let's also have a summit.



27

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.390

All right.



28

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.210

Now this form I don't think it looks that great right now.



29

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.220

We come here looks like this.



30

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.600

Make it look a little bit nicer.



31

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.570

We bootstrapped right.



32

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:51.430

So let's actually create a class and beat and beat and primary two classes.



33

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.360

It's combat again.



34

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.200

And now we can see that the form has changed.



35

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.780

Now it looks nice right.



36

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:06.650

We're going to change the name of that value added Button right to the car.



37

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.470

All right that's what we're going to be doing in this



38

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.770

lectures at car.



39

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:25.970

Let's make that a little bit nicer also by putting a class of they see foreign control.



40

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:37.620

All right but first we need to wrap this around in another diff with a class of form group.



41

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.070

OK.



42

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.500

There we're going to do the same thing for the one in the bottom two.



43

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.120

Right.



44

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.580

So I'm going to copy this one.



45

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.790

This is just to make this input's look good OK.



46

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.740

Well I'm just going to close this one.



47

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:00.150

Go



48

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.730

organize it and make it look nicer.



49

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.780

Right.



50

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.790

There we go.



51

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.000

These are little bits of the way you see what I'm doing.



52

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.620

All right.



53

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.420

Perfect.



54

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.950

Let's go and check it out.



55

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.910

Enter now this form looks nicer now.



56

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.370

Right.



57

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:32.630

We can make it smaller also of course we'll just have to we can put a class right here of coal.



58

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:40.990

That's s cits that's going to make 50 percent of the screen size and are actually



59

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.880

backwards s s s.



60

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.210

And I said it correctly but I wrote to the hallway Antar.



61

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.600

All right.



62

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.800

Perfect.



63

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.270

Right.



64

00:03:53.570 --> 00:04:00.940

So now what we want to do is we run we want a rights and title of our car here for example Lamborghini.



65

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:01.330

Right.



66

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.780

And then when we take our ad is going to actually add it into our database.



67

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.260

All right.



68

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.180

So we're going to be basically doing that fraud which is an acronym for and I'll show you right now



69

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.650

cross means create read update and delete.



70

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.110

Right now here in our database we are selecting.



71

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:19.890

We are reading information.



72

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.510

So we need to create the update and delete.



73

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.770

And we want to do that we Ageod's and Jake where we I just want to show you how to do that.



74

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.230

All right.



75

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:34.250

So the next lecture we're going to start creating the code that is going to take all these values from



76

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.380

here and use AJAX to communicate we're a Ph.D. We are table.



77

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.910

All right.



78

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.990

So thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next election is going to be really exciting.



79

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.630

Take care.
