00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.710

All right we'll come back with your students.



2

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.460

So it's tough for us to keep working on the day part of our application.



3

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.150

All right so we don't need to actually do anything with that data coming back.



4

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.250

To be honest with you at this moment maybe later on we'll do it and we'll probably you know put some



5

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.180

type of notification saying something like OK your record is being updated or something like that.



6

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.900

You're welcome to do whatever you want with the data coming back.



7

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:31.070

But basically we are sending a POST request to for something to happen not to get it back but if we



8

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.550

do that's ok we can do something else with it.



9

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:41.860

But anyway let's actually create that functionality from BHB where we update our records.



10

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:42.790

All right.



11

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.190

So we have this here this boilerplate already.



12

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.340

So what do we want.



13

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.510

Well we want to pool couple request post requests right.



14

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:04.030

We want to pool the idea that's coming in right from the pool super global and we'll just say ID here.



15

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.460

And we want to pool the title



16

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.770

here.



17

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:30.380

So we wanted those two Their Let's actually make like this and we go.



18

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.980

All right so now let's create a query real quick and let's just say we want to update cars right.



19

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.670

That's our table and set the title equal to what the title that we got right here right.



20

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.770

Right.



21

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.140

Make sure that you put some single quotes around it because this is a string.



22

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.040

And and you see me doing this curly brackets sometimes and this is just to do.



23

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.720

This is personal habit.



24

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.370

This is just a do complex operation like if you want to put a tray or something like that.



25

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:16.280

And in double cords you can or variable's is just a personal reference and makes no difference.



26

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.010

In this case.



27

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.630

All right.



28

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:27.560

So title where ID equals the ID right and that's an integer.



29

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.280

So we don't need the Kools.



30

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.300

Sometimes this will create a problem but I think we are good to go now.



31

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.960

All right and remember this is coming from where Name Puts right remember what I told you about that



32

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.140

we need to.



33

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.450

It would be nice to clean in those fields.



34

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.960

We don't want our application to be hacked or something like that.



35

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.880

And Title



36

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.660

this and will we can do that with the search also as well when we are refactoring our application will



37

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.140

start you know making everything a little tighter.



38

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.370

Mortality right.



39

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.780

So right now we just send the update query and we can just call this resultset because that's what it



40

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.540

is.



41

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.020

All right.



42

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:29.720

And my ask you a lie where he was send in that connection and we'll send in the query.



43

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.030

All right.



44

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:41.290

Now we can of course test it so we can see if not and we can make a little function for that.



45

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.900

But this is not a Ph.D. course so you already know how to do that.



46

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.490

We just kill the whole thing there if it doesn't work



47

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.050

where we failed and we can attach a little error here.



48

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.830

My rescue



49

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.860

Eskew a lie.



50

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:02.310

Sarah



51

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.300

All right.



52

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.080

It's fine.



53

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.320

All right.



54

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.080

All right.



55

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.250

So in the next lecture we'll we'll go over this a little bit.



56

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.910

Find out we have any mistakes and we'll check it out.



57

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:30.620

All right.



58

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.770

So you're welcome to try it right now and I'll see you in the next lecture.



59

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.700

Take care.



60

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.310

See you then.
