00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.760

All right so now that we have the record that is going to be bringing out information communicating



2

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.550

with BHB and we need to create BHB page as well.



3

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.390

That's going to actually pull the data out.



4

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.990

Right.



5

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.090

So first what I want to do is I want to actually take this cold and put it all the way on top of that



6

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.030

page.



7

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.550

So I'm going to cut it out of there.



8

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.840

Then put it all the way up here.



9

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.500

All right.



10

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.540

Since this is going to be displaying information I wanted to do it before anything else.



11

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.250

All right.



12

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.210

So let's create that file.



13

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:48.370

I'm going to say new file am going to call this display cars that BHP Antar.



14

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:57.010

First thing is that we need to get this include in display cars face that make sure you put your HP



15

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.200

tags though.



16

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.330

Pasted in there.



17

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.380

All right.



18

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.570

So how are we going to do this.



19

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:19.300

First create a query and we're going to say select all from where from our table right Karsh.



20

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.150

All right.



21

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.780

Then we say you know what Querrey car.



22

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.100

And I'm just going to put a variable there to apply to my Eskew lie Querrey



23

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.950

connection.



24

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.600

All right then



25

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.610

not Querrey.



26

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.450

Car in full



27

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.960

we can display we can make sure that this displays an error here.



28

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.360

Di Querrey failed



29

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.630

going to concatenate some error Mattieu a lie error.



30

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.590

Just put a put the connection there is close.



31

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.330

All right.



32

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.680

Perfect.



33

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.090

So now the next thing to do would be to actually fetch the information from the database in the while



34

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.260

loop and display and return some information back.



35

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.710

So that way we can catch it with Agent.



36

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.240

Anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture on the next lecture.



37

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.040

We'll continue with this and we'll get it complete.



38

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.790

Take care.
