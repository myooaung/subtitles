1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,170
All right.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,370
So let's make some improvements to our application.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,090
One of the first things that I want to do is to be honest with you is change the name of the table that

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,680
we have now the table the table column cars right in the database.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:28,210
So I've got to go to ph from my admin and I hear oops I don't even know why my computer are-I So that's

6
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,160
just because I've got a huge monitor in my right hand side and left hand side.

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,350
That's why my window is huge.

8
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,030
But anyway I want to change this column name.

9
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,260
I think it's not descriptive.

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,890
This should be like Tide or something like that.

11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:45,520
All right.

12
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,670
So I'm going to go to a structure

13
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,820
right here structure and then change.

14
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,890
And we're going to change that's a title that we go save right.

15
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,830
And you need to change it everywhere you have BHB of course.

16
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:16,390
So that's go to display cars and right here instead of that it should be title saving.

17
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,720
Right.

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,970
Let's see if it works.

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,220
Refresh.

20
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:23,860
All right.

21
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:24,580
There we go.

22
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,940
So it's working.

23
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,000
All right perfect.

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,300
So we fix that now.

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,750
Let's go.

26
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:38,370
And I want to fix I want to make this feel require I don't one I don't one users or myself to be able

27
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,320
to add cars unless I put something in there.

28
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,080
So because right now we try to add a car.

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,950
I would do without putting anything in would send an empty space to the database.

30
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,920
I don't want to.

31
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:48,730
Right.

32
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,190
So let's do it the easy the easier way without using it be less useful.

33
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,600
H the m l 5.

34
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:01,610
So let's go to in that age the amount and what is a field at a car

35
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,500
right here.

36
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:12,830
All right.

37
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,560
Let's add something called the required.

38
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,610
I think this is the input right here.

39
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,410
Let's.

40
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,530
We should actually also put a label here on this input so that way we know.

41
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,550
All right.

42
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:37,260
So as a label here real quick to label for car name

43
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,980
car name and then add a car or something like that

44
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,590
safe.

45
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,070
Let's check it out real quick.

46
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:03,190
Refresh prices at a car and I need to make this one 500 millisecond because I think I got it where you

47
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,520
sense every three seconds that requests.

48
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,340
Yes.

49
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,110
So I'm going to make it 500

50
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,510
I'm back here.

51
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,840
Refresh.

52
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,490
There we go.

53
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:22,820
So out a car and now we try to send it like this without writing anything it would give us this year

54
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,830
so we can do it.

55
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,530
All right.

56
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,810
So we kill like two birds in one shot.

57
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,180
Right.

58
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,920
Actually three because we put a label we require this and we change the database column name to title.

59
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,060
All right so we're making good improvements.

60
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,380
And then next lecture we'll continue doing so.

61
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,010
All right hopefully I'll make some more lectures too.

62
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,610
To keep adding functionality to our little application so that way you can learn a little more.

63
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,170
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
