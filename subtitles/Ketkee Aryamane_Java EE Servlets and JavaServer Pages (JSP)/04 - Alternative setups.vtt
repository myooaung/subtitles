00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.010
- [Instructor] Let us now look at the alternatives

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.090
that you have for the setup of this application.

3
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.030
We created a very basic dynamic web project.

4
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.050
We generated a structure for as an eclipse.

5
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.060
However, you can actually choose Maven or Gradle,

6
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.070
which are built-in project management tools,

7
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.060
to set up the entire project structure

8
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.040
and then configure the build path

9
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.050
with all the libraries necessary.

10
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.030
So we added all the libraries manually.

11
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.090
For example, the servlet JSP APIs or the JDBC jar;

12
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.030
but the built-in project management tools can now

13
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.040
actually help you configure that build path automatically.

14
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.070
The second one is we chose StormCAD Server

15
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.020
as our software for deployment of the application;

16
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.030
but you can choose IBM JBoss, WebLogic, GlassFish,

17
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.000
or any other Java enterprise edition-compliant container

18
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
or server for hosting the application.

19
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Next, we can ask the build tool itself

20
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.030
to deploy and run the project on server.

21
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.080
As an inside eclipse IDE, we actually chose the option

22
00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.020
of run as run on server or we deployed the war external

23
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.070
to the eclipse; but you can ask Maven or Gradle

24
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.020
to actually run the project for you.

25
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.010
So there's a command present in Maven

26
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.080
which will automatically take your word file and put it

27
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.060
on the server and deploy it and show you the console view.

28
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.060
Next, instead of Eclipse IDE, you can actually go and use

29
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.070
NetBeans or IntelliJ IDE for the development purposes,

30
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.060
which is completely fine.

31
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.060
We are going to choose MySQL database server as our server

32
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.030
for the entire application, but you may opt for any other

33
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.040
relational database that you are comfortable with.

34
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.060
Let's understand this one point that in our course

35
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.010
we have picked up softwares which are open source

36
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.020
and freely available; but if you are ready

37
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.080
to pay a cost, it's absolutely fine

38
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.000
if you go with any of these alternatives.
