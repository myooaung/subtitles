00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.050
- [Instructor] Now let's take a look at

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.030
the declaration demo.

3
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.040
What we are going to do is when I click on the login

4
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.030
hyperlink on my landing page,

5
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.070
there's a section out here which is going to display

6
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.010
date and time for me.

7
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.090
Now this date and time is of course going to change

8
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.090
on a daily basis.

9
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.080
The time may be minute basis, second basis, etc.

10
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.050
So what we're going to do is we're going to display

11
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.020
this date and time dynamically

12
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.090
and all of this we're going to do with the

13
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.070
declaration element.

14
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.080
So let's go to the login jsp in our Eclipse.

15
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.040
This is the login jsp and line number 38 onwards

16
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.060
is the section which will allow me to display that

17
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.030
date and time.

18
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.080
Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go at the

19
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.080
end of this file, and after the footer on line number 82,

20
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.070
I'm going to open up a declaration element.

21
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.020
Please note that the code for declaration or scriplet

22
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.030
elements can be written anywhere on this jsp page.

23
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.070
It really doesn't matter with the order

24
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.000
that you're following.

25
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.020
So let me begin a declaration element which looks like this.

26
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.000
Yeah.

27
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.050
So now whatever code that I write inside the declaration

28
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.090
element, is going to go and sit inside the servlet file

29
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.040
of this translator jsp.

30
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.030
So on line number 83 I'm now going to introduce a method,

31
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.050
because declaration element allows you to do that.

32
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.010
It allows you to introduce new variables

33
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.060
or new methods in the translated file of your jsp.

34
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.070
So let's a method here.

35
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:26.010
Let's say public, string, display date.

36
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.040
So the job of this method is to basically display the date

37
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.010
for today.

38
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.010
Let's go ahead and give it a body.

39
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.030
Yeah.

40
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.000
Now what we're going to do is we're going to use the

41
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.060
simple date format of the java library,

42
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.080
and let's say instantiate the simple date formatter.

43
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.060
Let's define a format here in the form of a string.

44
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.010
So I'm going to say yyyy, mm, dd and with a space

45
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.070
for the hours and minutes.

46
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.020
That's the format I want.

47
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.020
Let's also go ahead and take today's date with the help of

48
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.020
java dot util dot date.

49
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.040
And I'm going to opt in the date using the calendar

50
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.020
instance, so I'm going to say calendar dot get instance

51
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.000
and on that I'll chain another API called get time.

52
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.030
Once I do this, I am going to take this date format,

53
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.050
and invoke the format API and pass on that today's date.

54
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.020
Right.

55
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.050
What I want to do is, this of course is going to return

56
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.070
me something of the kind string,

57
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.050
so I'm going to exactly take this.

58
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.070
Put up a return statement here and then push on this value.

59
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.010
So that, the display date is going to calculate today's

60
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.030
date, it's going to set a format in order for the

61
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.090
date to be displayed, and it's going to return that

62
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.080
formatted date back from this method.

63
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.060
Now what I want to do is, I want to invoke this method

64
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.020
on that section of the page which is going to display

65
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.030
the date and time.

66
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.080
So let's copy this method name.

67
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.000
Go back to that section which is going to display

68
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.090
the date and time which is on line number 40.

69
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.040
And which element will allow us to evaluate an expression?

70
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.030
An expression element.

71
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.080
So let's go ahead and embed that expression element there.

72
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.050
And paste the methods name and basically invoke it.

73
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.000
So now when I run these changes, it should call that method

74
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.030
and it should give me the date printed on my page.

75
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.080
So let's go ahead and run this and check the changes.

76
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.000
So now when I click on the login hyperlink,

77
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.010
there you go.

78
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.000
You have today's date along with the time

79
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.020
being displayed on that section.

80
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.060
So now this time can dynamically change whenever

81
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.010
you access this page.

82
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.060
So we've done that with the help of declaration

83
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.030
and expression elements.

84
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.030
So basically to summarize jsp elements give you a way

85
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.080
to dynamically generate code.

86
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.000
It can be a combination of scripted and expression

87
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.080
or expression and declaration,

88
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.000
or maybe even all the three of them together.
