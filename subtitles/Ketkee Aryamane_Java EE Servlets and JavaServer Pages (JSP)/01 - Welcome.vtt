- [Instructor] Hi, my name is Ketkee,

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.000
and I have been doing Java J2EE development

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.080
for the last 10 years.

4
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.020
I am going to walk you through

5
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.040
this JSP servlets API course.

6
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.080
Servlets or JPSs is the fundamental building block

7
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.040
of any web application.

8
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.040
If you look at frameworks that we have today

9
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.000
like Struts, Spring MVC, JSF,

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.010
all of them have been built on these basic APIs.

11
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.060
So in this course we are going to explore

12
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.010
a lot of important topics

13
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.080
like servlets, filters, listeners.

14
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.030
We will also see how do you do session management

15
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.050
for a website through these APIs.

16
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.040
After that we will take a deep dive

17
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.030
into some of the important JSP components.

18
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.050
Using servlets and JPS's components

19
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.030
we are going to build a web application

20
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.010
as a part of this course.

21
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.000
So let's get started.
