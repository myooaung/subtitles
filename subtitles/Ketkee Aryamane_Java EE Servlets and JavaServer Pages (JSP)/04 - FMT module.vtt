00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.070
- [Female Instructor] So now let's take a look at

2
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.070
the formatting module of JSTL.

3
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.030
For that I will require to

4
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.010
put on this taglib reference on my JSP page.

5
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.040
So I'm just going to copy this,

6
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.000
go to my Eclipse page of homejsp

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.090
and after that go to reference

8
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.090
and I'm going to give the fmt reference.

9
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.060
Alright, so we're going to see one formatting tab

10
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.030
and then we also want to see how to do localization

11
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.080
and internationalization with the fmt module.

12
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.010
So let's take a look at the localization

13
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.000
and internationalization first.

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.040
For that, I will be required to make a folder here.

15
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.020
Which is the resources folder.

16
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.070
So I'm going to make a folder

17
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.060
and let's say resources.

18
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.030
And this is of course another class part.

19
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.060
If you wish you can make this folder

20
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.050
directly on the projects structure,

21
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.040
but please remember that it should be a source folder.

22
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.030
Now why is this folder required?

23
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.040
When you talk about localization

24
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.060
and internationalization as I said,

25
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.030
the labels on your JSP page is like say,

26
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.090
for example, order number, product name,

27
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.050
or even this head line.

28
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.050
All of these right now are hard code values,

29
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.090
but we do not want to hard code them

30
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.070
because it leads to videos to maintainability.

31
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.070
So what we're going to do, we're going to do

32
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.010
store these labels in a central location in a file.

33
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.010
Which is a .properties file.

34
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.000
And we want to refer these labels from that file only.

35
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.010
We're not going to hard code any of the data,

36
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.070
so that if this label or if by chance this header

37
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.060
gets repeated any other page,

38
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.040
then we can refer it from that centralized file itself

39
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.020
rather than hardcoding again.

40
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.060
Because if you hard code the same redundant labels

41
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.070
in many screens and if it changes to modal

42
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.000
you may have to sit and change all of the JSP pages.

43
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.050
So we don't want to do that.

44
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.070
So for that I'm going to create a folder resources,

45
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.080
I have already done that.

46
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.030
And under that, I'm going to create a file,

47
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:08.020
which is called applicationresources.properties.

48
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.090
So this that I'm creating is a general

49
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.000
localization internationalization concept.

50
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.090
This file is called the ResourceBundle

51
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.050
and which will store all your labels,

52
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.050
your information messages, your error messages

53
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.030
so that you don't have to hard code them

54
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.010
inside your JSP page.

55
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.020
Okay, so how does the data go inside the properties file?

56
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.010
It is like this.

57
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.000
Let's say, label.header.orders.

58
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.020
You can follow any convention that your project decides,

59
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.030
but this is what I'm trying to do.

60
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.020
So I'm actually having orders labeled

61
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.000
that I have to display on the page

62
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.080
and it is the header for my table,

63
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.030
so that's how the convention has been decided.

64
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.040
And let me say this is Orders.

65
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.030
So once I do this, what I am also going to do is

66
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.070
I'm going to create the internationalization scenario.

67
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.070
So for that I'm going to create a copy of this file

68
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.090
and let's say right click file

69
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.000
or we can just copy this.

70
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So I'm just going to copy that;

71
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.070
however this time I'm going to reserve this file

72
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.020
for the French language.

73
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.030
So if it's for the French language,

74
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.040
you'll have to open the French locale and then say OK.

75
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.070
So what I've done effectively is

76
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.060
this is for the English language

77
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.030
and this file however is for the French language, okay?

78
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.090
But the key in both is of course going to be the same.

79
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.040
The value is going to be according to the language.

80
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.070
So let's say in English I called it, Orders.

81
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.060
In French, I'll have to give it another name,

82
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.040
which is something like that, let's see.

83
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.090
Okay, so this is French name

84
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.090
and this is an English name

85
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.000
and I have two separate files.

86
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.040
So let's say tomorrow you want to put

87
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.050
another language for your application,

88
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.010
you want to configure your application for another locale,

89
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.060
you would have to make another ResourceBundle file

90
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.010
and that will be up under with the German locale characters.

91
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.080
Alright, and there to the key will exactly be the same,

92
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.000
but the value will be in German.

93
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So that's how we can implement

94
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.050
localization and internationalization.

95
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.080
Yes, we are storing all the labels in a central location

96
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.000
and we are also making sure that the application runs

97
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.070
for a couple of languages.

98
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.010
In our case, English and French.

99
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.010
Alright, now let's go to homejsp

100
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.000
our fmt has been referenced right there at the top,

101
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.040
which is good.

102
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.000
Now let's go ahead and come down here.

103
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.010
And the first thing that we have to do is,

104
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.000
we have to make sure that that Bundle

105
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.040
that we have created, the ResourceBundle file,

106
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.030
is referred on this JSP.

107
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.060
So the way you do it is with that fmt task,

108
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.000
I'm going to say fmt setBundle, that's for that.

109
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.080
And the base name for it

110
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.070
is basically going to be the fully qualified

111
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.080
class name of that Resource file.

112
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.060
So I'm going to say

113
00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:06.000
com.test.resources.applicationProperties, there you go.

114
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Okay, and then, in order that we refer this file

115
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.020
in any of the other JSP code

116
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.080
that we've written down there.

117
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.080
We are going to also define

118
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.090
the rare attribute for this, alright?

119
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.030
I want to say,

120
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.060
var and I'm going to say message

121
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.000
let's say that's the variable that I want.

122
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
So basically if I want to refer to this file

123
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.070
anywhere in the rest of the JSP,

124
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.040
I need a variable for it and that's exactly

125
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.050
what I'm taking in the form of, message.

126
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.060
Alright, so now what we could do is

127
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.010
we could go to this head line,

128
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.000
this h2 element and instead of hard coding that

129
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.020
I'm now going to use the fmt message tag.

130
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.050
And what does it have,

131
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.050
it has the Bundle as an attribute

132
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.070
and it has the key as an attribute.

133
00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:00.010
So the Bundle will be referred to by this message value.

134
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:07.050
So I'm going to refer it via the expression like that.

135
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.040
And once I do this, I can go ahead and also define the key.

136
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.030
Now this key is basically the one that

137
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.000
you have defined in your Bundle files.

138
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.060
I'm just going to take this copy,

139
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.020
come to the home, and paste it here.

140
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.000
Right?

141
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.030
So what we're essentially doing

142
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.010
through this fmt message tag is

143
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.060
we're picking up the Bundle file

144
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.020
which is the ResourceBundle application.properties,

145
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.070
and then we're going ahead and mentioning

146
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.050
the key that we have to pick up from that file

147
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.070
and we're referring that file here.

148
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.010
So there's one mistake that we have done here

149
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.030
this is not applicationProperties,

150
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.050
this is applicationResources.

151
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.000
So I'm just going to quickly rename that.

152
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.040
Yes, that's correct.

153
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.070
You don't need to give the extension,

154
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.090
you just have to give the name of the file.

155
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.080
Right, so application resources,

156
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.040
it's going to be referred by in the message variable.

157
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.060
I'm using that message variable here

158
00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.000
and setting it to the Bundle attribute

159
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.020
and I am picking up this key from that file.

160
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.060
Likewise, all the other labels that you have

161
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.020
in your project in all your JSP pages

162
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.070
can be centralized and can be referred to

163
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:16.040
by the fmt:message tag.

164
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.040
Okay?

165
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.070
Let's also do one more thing

166
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.040
we were not very happy with the order date

167
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.010
that was displayed on the page.

168
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.090
So let's go ahead and format that page.

169
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.050
So I'm just going to cut that out

170
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.070
and on line number 61 I'm going to put one tag here.

171
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:36.000
Which is fmt formatDate, there you go.

172
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.010
Now the value is of course,

173
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.040
let's enter that expression

174
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.000
and the pattern that we want to follow

175
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:49.060
let's say YYYY and MM DD, okay.

176
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.060
Alright, so we have taken the fmt module

177
00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.050
line number three, referenced it.

178
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:54.060
We declared the Bundles,

179
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.060
so that we can implement

180
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.050
localization and internationalization.

181
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.030
And we have also referred the header now

182
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:04.050
through the fmt:message tag.

183
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.030
Please understand localization internationalization

184
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.030
is a very common concept across

185
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.080
all the web applications that we implement today.

186
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.050
So be it with Servlet JSP

187
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.090
or be with any other framework

188
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:19.000
like Stripes 2, Spring MVC, or JSF Java Server Faces.

189
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.030
Everywhere localization and internationalization

190
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.080
is a must.

191
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.060
Alright.

192
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.050
So now that we have used

193
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:27.040
a couple of tags from the fmt module,

194
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.010
let's go ahead deploy this project

195
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:33.060
and check the changes.

196
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:38.010
Let me Login and enter the credentials

197
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.060
and let me click on order history.

198
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.000
So now do you see?

199
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.010
Now I think we are happy with the date

200
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:45.090
that we have displayed.

201
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:48.030
Moreover, this label is actually coming from

202
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:52.020
the fmt message tag that we followed.

203
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.010
Let's do one more thing,

204
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.050
I'm going to change the language of this browser.

205
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.070
Let's go to settings

206
00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.060
and say language

207
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:05.090
and let's say our languages and add the French language.

208
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.080
That's the one.

209
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.080
Okay, let's say ADD and let me say that

210
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.080
do to Display Google Chrome in this language.

211
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.060
Good.

212
00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.050
Now let's go ahead, close this tab, this tab as well.

213
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:25.070
Maybe Logout, and access our application again.

214
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:30.050
And say Login.

215
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.030
And then when we click on order history, do you see?

216
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.000
The word has changed now.

217
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.070
So it is actually picking up the key now

218
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:42.040
from the applicationResources_fr.properties file.

219
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.050
Now this is what happens.

220
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.010
So whenever you set your browser language

221
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.080
to the language that you need

222
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.080
and if your application has got

223
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.060
the internationalization facility plugged in

224
00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.030
then all your labels and all your messages

225
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:59.000
are going to be displayed in the respective locale.

226
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.040
And that's what you can do with this fmt module.

227
00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.050
Right, so there we are in like this

228
00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.050
you can also create the properties files

229
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.060
for all the other languages

230
00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.060
that your application wants to support

231
00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.010
and whenever you changed the language

232
00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.000
through the browser

233
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.030
the keys are going to be picked up accordingly.

234
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.010
Right?

235
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:17.060
So basically the keys are the same

236
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.060
in every file, as you see.

237
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.040
But the values are going to be different

238
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.090
as for that language.

239
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.040
Right, so this is about it for the fmt module.

240
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.030
In the next video, we are going to see

241
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:31.000
how can we double up our own tag library.
