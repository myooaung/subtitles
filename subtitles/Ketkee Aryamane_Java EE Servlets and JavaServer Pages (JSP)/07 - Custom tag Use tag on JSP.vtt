00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.060
- [Instructor] Okay, so now, let's go ahead on,

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.010
we are on profile.jsp and what we're going to do is,

3
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.050
we are going to include our tag library

4
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.020
and only way to do it is using taglib directives,

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.030
so I'm going to say,

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.000
at the rate taglib...

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.050
and I will give it a URI first.

8
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.040
The URI can be picked up from the TLD file.

9
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.020
So, if you see on line number 11, you've defined the URI,

10
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.020
so you can just take that,

11
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.030
copy and paste it on profile.jsp.

12
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.030
And once we do that, we also give it a prefix.

13
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.080
You're free to give any prefix, so myTags, that's the one.

14
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.020
Right now that's on line number four that

15
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.030
we have included the custom tag library on our page.

16
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.000
Now, let's go ahead, take this prefix,

17
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.020
go down, and on line number 37

18
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.040
I'm just going to use this tag.

19
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.090
So I'll say an angle bracket, myTags,

20
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.030
and there you see you have that tag already now coming in

21
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.010
the form of the assist feature of Eclipse.

22
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.060
So, I'm going to just take that and then go ahead

23
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.020
and define those two attributes.

24
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.060
Do you see that? Date and format.

25
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.050
So let's say format, I want this one here,

26
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.080
and the date can be assigned through, let's say

27
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.090
an expression element, so I'm going to use

28
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.090
the expression element and just get that to this state

29
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.010
and feed it to that date attribute.

30
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.090
Right, so what is going to happen is that once

31
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.030
we specify the date and the format,

32
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.080
my tag handler class now is going to be in operation.

33
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.030
So anywhere this JSP is going to get translated

34
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.040
to the corresponding servlet class,

35
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.080
then it's actually going to handle with a control

36
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.060
to the tag handler's doTag meta.

37
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.030
So that's how this code is going to get executed,

38
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.060
and the output will be printed on the JSP.

39
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.070
Right, so we have done all of our changes.

40
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:07.050
Let's go ahead and run this project and check if it works.

41
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.080
Okay, so I'm going to log in.

42
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.010
Let's say admin, admin...

43
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.030
And go to the 'view my profile' page, and there you go!

44
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.000
So, it is 9th of November 2017,

45
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.020
so you see I have now formatted the date,

46
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.030
but it is all according to my own

47
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.040
tag library that I have developed.

48
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.080
So this is how, in brief, you develop a custom tag library.

49
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.080
Please know that you have a lot of the functionality

50
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.000
to do in this, but as a part of the demo we're going to

51
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.090
restrict ourselves to only this functionality

52
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.000
that we've implemented in the application.
