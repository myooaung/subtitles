00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] Now that we know the basic setup

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.070
of the project and the requisites, what we are going to do

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.010
is we are going to first look at the types

4
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.050
of HTTP requests that we have.

5
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.050
We know that HTTP is the communication protocol

6
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.020
between the client and the server, and every request

7
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.070
that is made from the client to the server is of a type.

8
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.030
The first one among them is the GET request,

9
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.030
which is simply used to get or retrieve

10
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.040
information from the server side.

11
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.010
The next one is POST, which is used to process

12
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.060
or manipulate information on the server side.

13
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.090
So if you make a post request,

14
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.050
you're going to change the data on the server side.

15
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.060
Next is PUT, which is going to upload

16
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.010
the definition of a resource on the server.

17
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.000
As for the DELETE, it is going to

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.080
delete a resource from the server.

19
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.030
HEAD is going to be the same as a get request;

20
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.090
but it is only going to return with the header

21
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.020
information, not the body of the response.

22
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.000
And when you talk about OPTIONS, options is basically

23
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.060
that kind of a request which will help you to trace

24
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.080
what HTTP methods work on the server,

25
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.030
as in what are the possible options

26
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.000
that you can run on the target resource.

27
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.050
Now, among all of these, we are going to focus more

28
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.000
on GET and POST because that is what

29
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.070
we use in all our industry projects.

30
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.040
Of course, you can implement PUT and DELETE as well;

31
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.010
but they're rarely used, and we're going to stick

32
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.000
and deep dive into GET and POST requests alone.
