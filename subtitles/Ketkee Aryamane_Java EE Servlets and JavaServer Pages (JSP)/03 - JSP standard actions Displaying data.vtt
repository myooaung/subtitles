00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.010
- [Instructor] So, this is a profile JSP.

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.070
Now, on line number 36, the first thing

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.070
that we are going to do is, we are going to fetch

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.010
that user object that we set in the request code.

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.030
So, that is object as available on the JSP

6
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.090
and then, we can start displaying the data out of it.

7
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.060
So, for that, the first standard action

8
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.090
that I'm going to use is JSP colon use bean.

9
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.090
It comes in with an ID attribute

10
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.080
and this ID, I'm going to fill in as user.

11
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.060
Why?

12
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.020
Let's go back to the ViewProfile servlet

13
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.050
and check the key that you have mentioned

14
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.040
for the user object.

15
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.020
That's the one.

16
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.060
So, this key is basically going to sit in the ID attribute.

17
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.070
More over, we also have to specify the scope it came from.

18
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.080
So, I'm going to say scope and it is going to set to request.

19
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.070
Another thing that we also have to mention is the type.

20
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.090
Type is the fully qualified class name of the user bean.

21
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.080
So, this object is of the user type.

22
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.070
So, we just need to go to the user bean,

23
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.070
take that package name, come right here

24
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.050
on line number 36 under the type attribute

25
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.070
along with the package name,

26
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.090
I'll put a dot operator and mention the class name.

27
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.040
So, now this means that we have retrieved the information

28
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.000
of that user from the request scope.

29
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.050
Had you not used JSP standard actions

30
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.060
and had you stuck to expressions and scriptlets

31
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.000
then, you would have to write down the code

32
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.030
of request dot get attribute in a scriptlet

33
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.030
to replace this line.

34
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.000
But, now do you see that we don't have the right code at all

35
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and we can stick to a simple tag

36
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.060
which will do the entire job

37
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.070
same as what was being done by the scriptlet.

38
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.070
So, now that we are ready

39
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.060
with the JSP use bean standard action tag,

40
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.030
let's go ahead and start displaying the data out of this.

41
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.000
So, for that I'm going to come to line number 44.

42
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.040
I want to display the username.

43
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.030
So, the username is a label out here

44
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.070
and on 44, I have to display the value.

45
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.030
How do you get that?

46
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.000
So, you have to use another JSP standard action

47
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.020
called JSP dot get property.

48
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.020
This one.

49
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.000
And, it comes with a couple of attributes.

50
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.060
The first one is the property

51
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.060
and the second one is the name.

52
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.080
So, the name is going to be exactly identical

53
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.020
as the ID here, so that it understands

54
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.090
that it has to pick up a property

55
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.030
from this particular object.

56
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.070
So, I'm going to copy this from line number 36

57
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.010
and paste it to 44 name attribute.

58
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.000
And then, you have to mention the property.

59
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.020
Now, how do you get to the property.

60
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.040
If you look at the user bean,

61
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.080
you have these instance variables declared.

62
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.040
Those are exactly are your properties.

63
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.080
So, this name that you see for username

64
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.020
is the one that you need to copy from line number six.

65
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.060
Go to profile dot JSP and copy it

66
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.090
under the property attribute.

67
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.000
So, this means that it is going to get the property

68
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.010
of the username from the user object.

69
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.010
Right.

70
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.090
Let's also do the remaining property displays.

71
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.080
So, let's go to number 48.

72
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.000
I'm just going to take this tag

73
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
which is going to remain the same.

74
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.090
Line number 44.

75
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.050
Just copy this and paste it on line number 48.

76
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.090
Now, what we have to only do is change this property name.

77
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.060
So, the property name for first name.

78
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.010
Let's go to user,

79
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.010
copy this from line number seven

80
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.080
and come back to profile JSP and paste it out here.

81
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.030
Now, this tag I will have to repeat

82
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.080
because I need to display the last name as well.

83
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.000
So, let me copy it on line number 52

84
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.080
and let me copy it on line number 56 as well.

85
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.080
And then again on line number 60.

86
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.020
So now, in all the three pasted lines,

87
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.010
we're just going to change this property name.

88
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.080
So, this is going to be last name

89
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.020
which is the instance variable from the user bean.

90
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.080
This is going to be age

91
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.060
and that's going to be activity.

92
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.000
Right, so this is how you use JSP standard actions.

93
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.080
You've used JSP use bean

94
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.050
and then you've used JSP get property.

95
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.020
We can also now do one thing.

96
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.090
Let's run this project first and check out the changes

97
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.070
and see whether everything works.

98
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.030
So, I'm going to login first in the application

99
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.040
and we're going to call the user information for admins.

100
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.060
I'm going to click on view my profile

101
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.040
and you see that now it displays all the profile information

102
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.040
for us on that view profile page.

103
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.030
Right, so those are the couple of JSP standard actions

104
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.030
that we are looking at.

105
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.070
Let's look at a couple of other, too.

106
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.090
Let's go to search results dot JSP.

107
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.090
So, this is our page that displays the search results

108
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.020
and if you remember on line number 16,

109
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.080
we had implemented the include directive

110
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.040
to include the header dot JSP file.

111
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.090
An alternative to this is the JSP include standard action.

112
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.070
So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just come into this.

113
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.060
We don't need this as of now.

114
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.020
And, I'm going to say JSP include.

115
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.080
So, instead of the include directive,

116
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.060
I'm trying to use JSP include standard action

117
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.030
on line number 17.

118
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.020
This will demand me the path of the file

119
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.000
that I want to include as a resource

120
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.010
on line number 17.

121
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:04.020
So, I'm going to just say header dot JSP.

122
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.080
So, that's how JSP includes standard action

123
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.050
and will allow you to include another resource

124
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.090
at exactly the point where you write that tag.

125
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.070
Now, this is an interesting thing to know.

126
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.010
A question may come to the mind.

127
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.060
What's the difference between the include directive

128
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.080
and the JSP include standard action.

129
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.030
So, the difference essentially is

130
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.040
that when you use the include directive

131
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.020
then the included resource and the current resource,

132
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.090
they're both going to be combined

133
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.070
and then, it is going to be translated into a servlet file.

134
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.090
However, when you use a JSP include standard action

135
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.050
then, the current JSP, which is search results JSP,

136
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.060
that will be translated separately

137
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.060
and this one, header JSP will

138
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.000
be translated again separately.

139
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.080
And then, at run time, those responses will be combined

140
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.080
and they'll be rendered to the user.

141
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.050
But, for the include directive,

142
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.090
the translation itself involves the combination

143
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.070
and then entirely that thing is going to be translated

144
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.030
to the servlet file.

145
00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.090
So, you are going to use JSP include in your projects.

146
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.020
If you think that you want to execute some code

147
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.000
in the included resource.

148
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Dynamic execution if it's required

149
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.060
in your included resource.

150
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.080
Stick to JSP include standard action.

151
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.010
However, if you're just trying to include static resources,

152
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.020
like for example header dot JSP in this case is static.

153
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.050
It doesn't change much.

154
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.020
In that case, you can stick to the include directive.

155
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.040
Another thing is on this JSP, let's say

156
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.050
if you want to include this resource,

157
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.060
under that you can also set parameters

158
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.070
to the header dot JSP by using

159
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.060
this JSP standard action of param.

160
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.000
So, every parameter, of course, comes

161
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.090
with a key and a value pair.

162
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.090
So, now when you go to header dot JSP

163
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.030
this parameter could be accessed on that resource.

164
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.050
So, that's another standard action

165
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.020
that you have at your disposal.

166
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.010
Yes, so those are the few of standard actions

167
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.070
that we had to see and the other ones are not so important

168
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.070
because we are going to go towards expression language

169
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.090
and Java, so it will be a stack library,

170
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.000
in our subsequent videos.
