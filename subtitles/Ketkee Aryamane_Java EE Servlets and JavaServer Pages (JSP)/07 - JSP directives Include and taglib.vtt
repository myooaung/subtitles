00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.040
- [Instructor] Now let's take a look

2
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.040
at the include directive of JSP.

3
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.080
This is basically used to include any JSP resources

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.010
in the current JSP, that's what this is for.

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.070
It looks like this, there's an angle bracket,

6
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.070
a percentage sign, an at rate symbol,

7
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.050
which denotes that it is a directive.

8
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.000
After that, the name of the directive, which is include.

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.030
Like the page directive,

10
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.000
if you want to pass any extra information to this directive,

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.080
it will be in the form of attributes.

12
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.080
Now why do we want do use this, where is this used?

13
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.090
In a typical web application,

14
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.040
your software's ticketed web pages

15
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.000
could pull out data from multiple sources.

16
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.060
You may have a lot of screens in your application.

17
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.010
Let's say your screen is this.

18
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.090
This screen can actually be divided into components.

19
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.020
The first one is the Header component,

20
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.060
which has the logo of the organization and its name.

21
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.080
Then you have the Menu, which gives you a lot of options

22
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.020
to traverse across the application.

23
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.060
Then you have one more part, which is the Footer,

24
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.030
which generally holds the copyright information.

25
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.020
Then you have the main body, which has got the content

26
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.020
that keeps on changing dynamically.

27
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.090
If you look at the Header, Menu, and Footer,

28
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.030
they're more or less the static parts of your pages.

29
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.040
Let's say if like this I have 10 other screens

30
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.040
in my application, it is not going to be advisable

31
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.070
to put on this Header, Menu, and Footer code

32
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.080
in each of those 10 screens.

33
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.040
Basically, it'll be like duplicating code,

34
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.070
it's redundancy, and it's non-maintainable.

35
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.090
Let's say tomorrow the logo of my organization changes,

36
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.000
I will have to make a change at all the 10 pages,

37
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.030
which is not a very good thing.

38
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.030
What we could do is,

39
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.080
we could actually break this page into atomic pieces.

40
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.070
One of them will be the Header piece,

41
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.050
the other one, Menu, and yet another one, Footer.

42
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.000
Then we separate these atomic pieces into their own pages.

43
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.030
Now when we construct a screen, what we could do is,

44
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.080
we could include the Header JSP, include the Menu JSP,

45
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.050
include the Footer JSP,

46
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.040
and then go on and write the code for the main content.

47
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.090
That's exactly what include directive does for us.

48
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.040
It helps you to include these atomic pieces together

49
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.020
and prepare a whole page.

50
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.050
This concept is very close

51
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.060
to the composite view design pattern that we generally have

52
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.060
in case of web application page development.

53
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.090
Let's see how to implement this.

54
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.070
Let's go to our code.

55
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.040
If you look at our application, this is the landing page.

56
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.080
Let's say home.

57
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.040
If you look at the hyperlinks here at the top right corner,

58
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.030
now let me click on Search, and let me search for a product.

59
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.050
When I click on the Search button,

60
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.060
do you see these hyperlinks?

61
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.070
They are actually the same.

62
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.000
What I could do is,

63
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.020
for the searchresults.jsp, and for my landing page,

64
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.050
I know that the Menu links are almost going to be the same.

65
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.040
I can do one thing.

66
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.040
Let's go to the code now,

67
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.040
and look at this Header part on searchresults.jsp

68
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.030
from lines number 15 through 37.

69
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.010
What I could do is,

70
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.000
I could extract this code out, let me cut this,

71
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.010
right, so what I'm going to do is,

72
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.020
I'm going to delete that place holder of header.jsp,

73
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.020
and recreate it for this demo purposes.

74
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.070
I have cut that Header code,

75
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.010
and now let me make a separate JSP file

76
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.060
under this folder by the name header.jsp,

77
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.030
and let me insert that entire header related code down here.

78
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.020
What I've done is I've pasted that code from line number 10

79
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.000
to line number 32.

80
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.040
The entire Header code is now in its own individual file,

81
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.010
header.jsp.

82
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.020
Now, what I could do is, I could go to searchresults.jsp,

83
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.030
and I could use the include directive here

84
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.090
to include that header.jsp file.

85
00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.000
Let's see how.

86
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.010
Let's write out that directive, add the rate, and include.

87
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.050
In order to include another file,

88
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.080
you will have to mention an attribute,

89
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.070
which is called file, and give the path of that JSP.

90
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.000
Basically, using this directive on line number 15,

91
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.040
I am trying to include header.jsp

92
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.020
on the searchresults.jsp at exactly this place.

93
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.010
Let me do one thing,

94
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.040
let me run this code and check the changes.

95
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.070
I want to click on Search,

96
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.060
and so refresh this, yeah, so nothing changed.

97
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.080
Now, it would one change, I will still get the Header,

98
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.070
but now, I have extracted this header completely

99
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.030
into a separate JSP

100
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.050
and included that using our include directive.

101
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.030
That's how you can use include directives for various

102
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.060
portions of your page, which are individual atomic pieces.

103
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.080
Let's say now tomorrow if there is any change

104
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.020
in the header.jsp,

105
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.090
I will just need to make the change at one place,

106
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.010
which is this code.

107
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.040
Since I have included this page in all the other screens,

108
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.080
the change will automatically get reflected there.

109
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.060
This include directive thereby

110
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.080
is going to help us do coding,

111
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.060
which will promote reusability

112
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.030
and definitely will have better maintainability.

113
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.060
As for the third directive, which is stack lib,

114
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.090
we can only see that

115
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.000
when we see Java server pages stack library.
