- [Instructor] Okay, thank you, guys,

2
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.030
for joining in for this course.

3
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.080
We have had a look at all the basic servlet JSP components.

4
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.040
We have seen how to write servlets,

5
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.060
how to configure listeners, filters, how to do

6
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.070
session management; and how do you write all the code

7
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.060
on a JSP page, and how do you make it maintainable.

8
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.050
After this, you should be in a position

9
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.090
to build a basic web application in any of the other

10
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.060
domains like healthcare, financial services, et cetera.

11
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.020
Moreover, if in your live industry project,

12
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.080
if you're working on any MVC framework like Struts,

13
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.090
Spring MVC, JSF, this course is definitely

14
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.060
going to be a lot more of help to you.

15
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.060
