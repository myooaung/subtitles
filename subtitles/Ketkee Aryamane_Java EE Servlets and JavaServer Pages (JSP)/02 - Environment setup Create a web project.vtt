00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] Now let us understand the steps

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.060
that we need to take in order to set up

3
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.090
this entire Servlet JSP application in Eclipse IDE.

4
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.060
There are a number of things that we need to do

5
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.050
and we're going to see them step by step.

6
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.060
The first one among them is configure

7
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.070
a dynamic web project in Eclipse IDE.

8
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.070
So that's the first step.

9
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.020
Let's go to Eclipse and configure a dynamic web project.

10
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.090
So this is how your Eclipse looks like

11
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.050
and those are the panes that you can work on with.

12
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.010
I'm going to go to the navigator pane,

13
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.020
right-click, and create a new dynamic web project.

14
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.080
That's the option you need to choose

15
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.020
in order to make a web application.

16
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.060
Let's give it a name.

17
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.020
Let's say sample project.

18
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.030
Now for the name should follow the naming conventions

19
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.000
that have been proposed by Java for the project name.

20
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.040
Then there's a target run time here

21
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.020
which is currently set to none.

22
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.040
Target run time is essentially the server

23
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.020
that the project is going to be hosted on.

24
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.030
Right now we don't have any servers inside Eclipse,

25
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.090
that's why it's set to none, which is fine,

26
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.070
and the dynamic web model version is 3.0.

27
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.000
You're going to stick to this version for this course

28
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
however if you want to leverage any other feature

29
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.030
of 3.1 version, you can choose that through this option.

30
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.050
Let's click on next.

31
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.010
We see the SRC folder here

32
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.060
which is going to have all your .java files

33
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.060
and when they get compiled they're going to be placed

34
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.030
under the build slash classes folder.

35
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.090
Now if you want to add any other source folder you can just

36
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.060
click on the add folder button here and do the rest.

37
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.000
Let's click on next.

38
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.040
It shows a couple of more options,

39
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.020
content root, which of course is the name of your project

40
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.090
and that is always the root folder of your app

41
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.050
and content directory, which is web content,

42
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.000
which basically contains all the HTML CSS's,

43
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.030
the JavaScript files, and even the XML's.

44
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.040
Now, the web model version number 3.0 allows you

45
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.090
to do all the configuration via the annotations approach.

46
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.070
However, in this course we are going to see

47
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.000
some of the XML configuration as well

48
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.050
for which I will need this web.xml deployment descriptor

49
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.040
so I'm going to check this option and then click on finish.

50
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.000
So when I do this my entire project structure

51
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.030
for the web application has generated here.

52
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.010
You have the SRC, you have the web content

53
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.080
under which you have meta INF, web INF.

54
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.070
Meta INF is just the meta of the application

55
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.030
that Eclipse takes care of

56
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.080
and web INF if web information under which

57
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.040
you further have a lib folder and a web.xml file.

58
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.080
The lib folder is going to contain all the jar files

59
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.000
that are necessary to be integrated with this application.

60
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
That really depends on the kind of API's

61
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.090
that you want to integrate with this app.

62
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.000
Sources, of course, the source folder

63
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.090
and let me also do one more thing.

64
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.010
Under this web content I'm going to make a folder

65
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.090
for all the HTML files

66
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.080
and another folder for all the CSS files.

67
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.040
Right, so those folders are ready.

68
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.050
So this is overall how

69
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.090
the web application project structure looks like.

70
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.020
Now, let's go to the next step.

71
00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.080
The next step would be to set up

72
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.090
an instance of Apache Tomcat server in Eclipse IDE.

73
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.070
So let's go to Eclipse.

74
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.070
This is the project that is ready with us,

75
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.090
but we need to host this application on our server.

76
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.090
Now for that we need a server.

77
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.060
We've already downloaded the server software

78
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.040
and extracted it to an appropriate folder on the machine.

79
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.000
So this is how it looks like.

80
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
The place where all these folders begin;

81
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.030
the bin, conf, lib, logs, et cetera,

82
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.010
that part is called Tomcat home.

83
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.060
So now we need to set up this server instance

84
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.050
inside our Eclipse IDE because Eclipse IDE is going to be

85
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.010
one single stop for our entire development activity.

86
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.050
So let's go there and set up the Tomcat server.

87
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.080
For that, you would need the servers view

88
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.000
which is already here.

89
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.020
If you're not able to see this view

90
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.030
you can just go to window, show view,

91
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.000
and then select the option of servers,

92
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.090
you'll be able to see this view.

93
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.040
Now let's click on this link to create a server.

94
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.070
It will show you all the possible options

95
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.050
that you have in order to choose server.

96
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.090
It has got a range of options

97
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.000
starting from Apache to IBM, et cetera.

98
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.090
You just have to choose

99
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.000
the appropriate version that you want.

100
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.040
I'm going to say Apache Tomcat 7.0 and click on next.

101
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.050
So once you click, you'll get this pop-up.

102
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.090
It's going to ask you for the Tomcat installation directory.

103
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.040
We already know that the Tomcat

104
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.000
has been installed at this spot.

105
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.020
We have to pick this Tomcat home part, copy,

106
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.040
and then paste it under the Tomcat installation directory,

107
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.040
and then click next.

108
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.010
Now, all it does is,

109
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.080
it actually shows you a couple of panes.

110
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.020
One is available and one is configured.

111
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.000
Available is going to show you all the projects

112
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.010
that you could possible deploy on this server.

113
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.070
Configured pane however shows you

114
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.040
all those kinds of projects

115
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.030
which are running on your server at this point in time.

116
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.070
We just have to click on finish

117
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.000
and your server instance is now ready inside of Eclipse IDE.

118
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.080
Let's look at the next step.

119
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.060
Next step, we need to set up the build path of the project,

120
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.060
add all the servlet and JSP API libraries.

121
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.040
So let's understand that what it means.

122
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.020
This is a Java enterprise edition project.

123
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.060
Whenever you make a normal core Java project

124
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.030
inside of Eclipse IDE,

125
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.090
the entire set of Java standard edition API's

126
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.030
are always integrated with it,

127
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.000
but now that this is an enterprise edition project

128
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.060
the servlet and the JSP specification API

129
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.050
is not in built into this.

130
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.030
We need to add it on to this project.

131
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.020
For that we will have to download the servlet

132
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.000
and JSP API jar files, java archives,

133
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.080
and add them to the build path of this project.

134
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.010
Fortunately we don't have to download them right now.

135
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.030
The Tomcat server already has all of the jar files inside

136
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.010
so let's understand that.

137
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.060
There's a lib folder inside the Tomcat server folder,

138
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.030
we just go to all jar files.

139
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.000
So do you see the servlet API jar here

140
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.070
and the JSP API jar there?

141
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.000
So those are the ones we need

142
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.080
in addition to all the other ones.

143
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.040
So what we're going to do is,

144
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.090
we're going to take all these jars through the server

145
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.070
and then add it on to the build path of our project.

146
00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.070
Let's understand how to do that.

147
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.000
Let's go back to Eclipse.

148
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
In order to do that setting,

149
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.070
you right-click on this project, go to properties,

150
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.090
and there are four tabs here under the option

151
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.060
of Java build path, that is what you have to choose.

152
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.020
Go under the libraries tab

153
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.030
and you just have to click on add library.

154
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.010
Now you have a lot of options to choose from

155
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.000
out of which I'm going to pick server run time

156
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.040
because I want to add the libraries

157
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.050
from the server software.

158
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.030
So let's click on next and now it is going to list out

159
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.010
all the servers that you have ever configured

160
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.040
on this workspace of Eclipse.

161
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.090
I'm just going to select that and click on finish.

162
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.080
So now if you see the entire set of jar files

163
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.030
from the server is available

164
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.090
on the build path of my project.

165
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.020
We just have to click on apply

166
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.000
and click on okay and we are done.
