00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.090
- [Narrator] To get the most out of this course

2
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.020
I recommend a few things to get you started.

3
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.040
It would be very good to have a hands on

4
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.070
with the fundaments of core Java APIs

5
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.080
as we call Java standard editions.

6
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.000
It would be very good to have a good hands-on

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.040
with the Java Database Connectivity API

8
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.040
which is used to transact against the database.

9
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.080
Then, any usage of IDE that is integrated

10
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.000
in a developing environment by Eclipse,

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.020
Netbeans, Intelligio, or any other would do.

12
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.020
A basic hands on of databases would be necessary

13
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.090
because we are going to build an application

14
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.030
which is going to converse with the database.

15
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.020
And lastly, we need to display pages on the browser,

16
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.060
which means there will be HTML and CSS code

17
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.070
in all those pages.

18
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.070
So an acquaintance of that is really going to be helpful.

19
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.050
There are a few terminologies that we may need

20
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.080
to use as a part of this course.

21
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.040
The first one is API,

22
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.030
which is application programming interface

23
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.080
so any class, any method that we refer

24
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.040
from the Java Standard Edition

25
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.090
or Java Enterprise Edition forms an API.

26
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.090
The next one is JAR, which is Java Archive,

27
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.030
which is basically a bundle of class files

28
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.080
that are external to your project.

29
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.000
You may need to include them

30
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.010
in the built part of your project.

31
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.000
Build path, on the other hand, or as we say class path,

32
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.050
is the location of all the user refined classes

33
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.060
that you have used in your web application

34
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.010
so that your compiler finds them

35
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.020
and appropriately uses them when it wants to run your app.

36
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.080
Now lets take a look at the software prerequisites

37
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.060
for this course.

38
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.070
We would need Java Development Kit,

39
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.090
JDK 1.6 version or higher.

40
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.050
There is a link has been shown on the website

41
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.070
through which you can download that EXC

42
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.070
and install it on your machine.

43
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.030
Then we would absolutely need an Eclipse IDE

44
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.020
which is the Integrated Development Environment,

45
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.050
the one-stop solution to do all our development activity.

46
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.060
We would be going for the Java Enterprise Eclipse IDE,

47
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.080
the Mars version.

48
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.070
However, you can choose any version

49
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.000
starting from Eclipse Kepler.

50
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The linked download Eclipse has been given on this slide.

51
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.060
Up next, we would need Apache Tomcat 7.0 server.

52
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.090
Now this is very critical.

53
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.010
This is a server software that is downloadable

54
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.000
from the link mentioned on this slide.

55
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.030
You have two options.

56
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.000
You can either download this software as a ZIP

57
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.070
and extract it to an appropriate folder on the machine

58
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.040
or you may install the EXE

59
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.040
so that it gets installed as a service

60
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.000
under your operating system.

61
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.050
We are going to deploy the application on the server

62
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.020
and test out the application on the browser

63
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.070
for which we would need a browser software.

64
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.020
So you can pick up Google Chrome or Firefox

65
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.090
or Microsoft Edge, the latest version.

66
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.070
Lastly, our application is going to talk to the database

67
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.000
so we would need a database server.

68
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.020
We have chosen MySQL database server.

69
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.040
However, you're free to choose any other

70
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.000
which you are comfortable with.
