00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Instructor] Now let us understand are the steps that

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.020
you need to take in order to setup the application

3
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.070
that we're going to build as a part of this course.

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.020
We are going to build and H+ Sport application,

5
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.060
which does a lot of sport facilities for the customer.

6
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.050
Let's take a look at the application inside the browser.

7
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.000
This is how it looks like, and there are a lot of

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.060
hyperlinks in the top right corner doing a lot of stuff

9
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.090
for the customer. If you look at the entire page

10
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.080
there's company history, and then their products,

11
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.010
and their guarantees, and their ideas, people working,

12
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.010
searching a product. All of this is the first landing

13
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.090
page of the application, and then you can actually go on

14
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.030
and look at the history, the products,

15
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.050
and the people of the organization.

16
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.080
You can also click on the login,

17
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.090
and you can enter your login credentials,

18
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.040
and then go ahead with the remaining flow.

19
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.090
You could also actually register yourself as a new user

20
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.000
while on the register user page.

21
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You can also go to LinkedIn, if you want,

22
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.040
from this web application, that's also possible.

23
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.030
Then we're going to explore each of these use cases

24
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.080
as we build in our application.

25
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.030
Now, in order to get started with this project,

26
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.010
what you need to do is, this is your sample project

27
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.070
that we created during the setup. Right?

28
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.070
Now, inside this there's a lot a basic code that you

29
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.000
have to take so that you're able to work on with the

30
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.010
Servlets and JSP code. What I mean by this is,

31
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.020
if you look at this application it has got

32
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.080
a lot of beautiful colors, images, and all

33
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.020
of the CSS styling. HTML and CSS code is not going to be

34
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.050
the focal point of the discussion of this course.

35
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.030
So, what we are going to do is, we are going to provide

36
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.020
the HTML, the CSS, and the image

37
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.060
files in the exercise folder. What you could do is,

38
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.010
you could just paste them onto your fresh project,

39
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.040
then you can get started with the development.

40
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.050
So, in order to paste those files lets come to the

41
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.060
exercise files. Chapter one or "01_05"

42
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.000
and under the resources folder I have the H+ application.

43
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.070
Now what we need to do is, we need to go to the web

44
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.040
content, take these three folders; CSS, HTML, and images.

45
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.010
Copy them, go to our workspace on Eclipse and just paste

46
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.070
them on to the web content directory of your fresh project.

47
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.000
Once you do that all your HTML and styling code is

48
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.060
now available to you as a part of these folders.

49
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.040
So, now whenever you start your development,

50
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.030
you can get started by just plugging these Sevlets

51
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.050
and the JSP code. So we have the HTML and CSS files

52
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.030
that we've pasted on to. Now lets understand what

53
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.050
we are going to implement as a part of this application.

54
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.070
The end eye application is going to be based on

55
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.060
an MVC architecture, which is model, view, and controller.

56
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.000
We are not going to have a scenario,

57
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.010
we are just going to write all the code in the Sevlet class,

58
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.040
because that reads reduce maintainability.

59
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.090
So, instead of that we are going to properly implement

60
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.040
an MVC architecture. We'll have three componence of view,

61
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.050
a controller, and a model. The view is going to be

62
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.030
the JSP or the HTML file, so initially when we start up

63
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.040
with this corse for the first few topics it will be HTMLs,

64
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.020
and then after that it'll just be JSP files.

65
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.090
The controller is that component of your application

66
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.060
which is going to intercept, request, and prepare

67
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.000
the response, and the Servlet class is the one in our

68
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.020
application which is going to do this for us.

69
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.010
So, Servlet is going to be the controller.

70
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.090
Then we have the model, the model that part of

71
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.030
your application which gently transacts,

72
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.060
converses with the database. So we are going to implement

73
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.010
a design pattern called data access object, which is

74
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.020
nothing but a class that you write in your project which

75
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.040
is going to hold all the methods to connect to the

76
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.090
database and do all the transactions against it.

77
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.040
So lets say if you're trying to implement any used case

78
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.020
in our application, what we are going to do is,

79
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.040
go from the view that is the JSP or the HTML to

80
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.020
the Servlet first. From the Servlet we will call DAO layer.

81
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.070
The DAO is then going to talk to the database.

82
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.060
It will get all the data then return to the Servlet.

83
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.000
Then, the Servlet will decide what is supposed to be done

84
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
with the data and what response has to be written back

85
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to the client. Then, the response will be carried to

86
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.090
the browser, and that's where we'll display it.

87
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.090
So, this is the cycle that we're going to follow for most

88
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.000
of the used cases we're implementing as a part of

89
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
the application for this course.

90
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.010
As for the database setup for this application,

91
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.060
we are going to use my security base server.

92
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.050
The schema name that you create for that particular

93
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.030
application is completely a name of your choice.

94
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.020
We are going with the name of H+ itself so the

95
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.000
schema name for this application is H+,

96
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.040
and the tables that you're going to use

97
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.050
in this application are users,

98
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.050
which is going to store all the user information,

99
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.030
then the products, which is going to store

100
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.050
all the product related information for the application,

101
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.090
and an orders table which is going to store an order history

102
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.010
of a particular user, as in what type of products did the

103
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.080
user deliver for himself or herself in the past history.

104
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.060
So those are the three tables that we're going to work

105
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.060
with, of course you have a completely body of expanding

106
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.000
the schema, and add on more tables for any further

107
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
development of the application.
