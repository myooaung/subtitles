00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.020
- Now let's take a look at what are the

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.090
implicit objects on a JSP page.

3
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.040
If you remember, in our search use case code,

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.000
on the search results JSP, on line number 42,

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.010
we had obtained the product's data

6
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.000
from the request code, and at that point in time,

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.050
I did mention that this is one of the implicit objects

8
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.000
that is available, by default, on this JSP page.

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.080
That's right.

10
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.060
So now we're going to talk about the JSP implicit objects.

11
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.050
There's a big list of the implicit objects that you have

12
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.070
in a JSP, let's go through them one by one.

13
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.090
First of all, what are implicit objects?

14
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.080
They're the ones that are already created on the JSP,

15
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.030
and they have pre-defined variable names.

16
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.060
So when you access them, you have to access them

17
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.020
with only that pre-defined name, and not any other name.

18
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.020
Let's start looking at the implicit objects one by one.

19
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.030
The first one is "out".

20
00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.050
This object is basically, of the JSPWriter class,

21
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.030
and, this is the one which will help you

22
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.010
to print or write an output to the JSP page.

23
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.040
If you remember, whenever we wrote a response through

24
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.060
the servlet class, it was through the PrintWriter object.

25
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.030
Whenever you want to write in a response through a JSP,

26
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.020
you will use the JSPWriter object.

27
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.020
So this object is already created, the name of this object

28
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.090
is out, and you could just use it for your purposes

29
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.050
on the JSP page.

30
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.030
Let's quickly look at how this works,

31
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.020
so let's say I am on line number 57,

32
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.090
and if I want to use the out object,

33
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.040
I would just say, "out.println", and then

34
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.020
whatever I want to print would go inside those round

35
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.080
pair of brackets as an argument.

36
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.040
So that's how this is going to work.

37
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.000
This name is unchangeable, as I said,

38
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
because it's already named variable inside the JSP.

39
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.020
Let's look at the next one: request.

40
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.060
This is basically going to be for HTTPServletRequest object,

41
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.060
so this for the entire request for the JSP page,

42
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.010
and it's denoted by the request name that we already used

43
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.070
before in one of the demos, on line number 42.

44
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.090
Next, is the response object.

45
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.030
So the way you have a request object,

46
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.010
similarly, you have a response object,

47
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.010
which belongs to this class, and you can use it quickly,

48
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.040
let's go ahead and try it out on line number 57,

49
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.040
I'm just going to say "response.sendRedirect"

50
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.090
or whatever you would want to do,

51
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.070
as a part of this code, right?

52
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.030
Let's look at the next one: session,

53
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.060
that's the session object, which represents HTTPSession.

54
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.030
Now we have not looked into session management

55
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.030
right now, we're going to look at it soon.

56
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.070
So this is the one which is exclusively reserved for

57
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.060
session management, you can do loads of stuff

58
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.050
with it, on the JSP page.

59
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.090
So if you want to access this object,

60
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.030
it will be as simple as accessing it like this:

61
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.060
on line number 57, I just have to say, "session",

62
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.070
and then you can do whatever you want to do with it.

63
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.000
Let's say "session.getAttribute", and you can get

64
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.070
an attribute on the JSP page from the session's scope.

65
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.050
Next is the config; if you remember

66
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.090
we have already discussed the ServletConfig API

67
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.050
in one of our previous videos,

68
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.050
so if you really want to fetch any information

69
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.060
from the ServletConfig object, then you can use

70
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.060
this named variable and access

71
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.060
this object directly on the JSP page.

72
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.000
Similar to that is the ServletContext,

73
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.070
which is used to share information across all the servlets,

74
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.030
so you can use this named variable

75
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.070
called "application" and fetch whatever you want

76
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.090
out of the ServletContext object.

77
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.070
Next one is exception.

78
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.010
Now, exception is basically going to belong

79
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.010
to the exception class of Java,

80
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.010
and it can be used to debug your errors on the error pages.

81
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.030
So if you remember, we had indeed made an error page

82
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.070
in our application, which is this.

83
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.030
So, yes, you do print a beautiful error message here,

84
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.010
but it is also possible to debug what the error was

85
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.010
by accessing the exception implicit object.

86
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.010
So I'm going to do that on line number 11, I'll just

87
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.000
open up an expression element, and I can

88
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.010
just access this exception object,

89
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.060
and take a look at what the exception is,

90
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.070
so that I get to know the cause of the problem.

91
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.050
Next is, pageContext.

92
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.030
Now this is the hero of all the

93
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.090
implicit objects that we have.

94
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.060
That's because, it contains a reference to all the other

95
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.080
implicit objects, and it can be used

96
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.060
to access information of the page.

97
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.010
What I mean by this is, let's go back to the code

98
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.020
on searchResults.JSP line number 57,

99
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.080
I have this pageContext object,

100
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.020
and, I can go ahead, and access any other implicit object.

101
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.050
So let's say I want to access the request object,

102
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.040
I just have to call "getRequest".

103
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.090
If I want to access the response objects,

104
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.030
I just have to call the "getResponse" API.

105
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.060
If I want to access the JSPWriter object,

106
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.010
I just have to say, "getOut", and I'll get the JSPWriter.

107
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.060
So basically, if I want to access any other implicit object,

108
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.020
I can do so through the pageContext implicit object.

109
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.060
In addition to this, you also have the page implicit object,

110
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.070
which corresponds to the current JSP page.

111
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.060
So those are the nine implicit objects that we have in JSP,

112
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.020
and in the subsequent part of the course,

113
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.060
somewhere or the other use case will definitely use

114
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.000
one of these implicit objects, for sure.
