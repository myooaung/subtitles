00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.295
Okay, So 20 and wise,

00:00:09.295 --> 00:00:12.010
there are three major checkpoints that I've come across in

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.085
my career as a user interface designers so far.

00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:17.335
The first was introduction of sketch,

00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:19.900
a fully dedicated proper user interfaces.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.840
I told the second was coming of Figma,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.985
another user interface design tool.

00:00:24.985 --> 00:00:28.990
And there's a whole different story about how I shifted from sketched Figma and y.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.840
But number three, the third checkpoint was introduction of auto-layout into Figma.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.240
I love Auto Layout not only because it's convenient,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.145
but because it's snips away a lot of

00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:43.050
extra baggage from the core craft of designing a user interface.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.755
And it makes so much room for experimentation.

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:47.045
When you use auto-layout,

00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:49.685
you don't have to worry about aligning and resizing.

00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:51.845
You don't have to worry about making space.

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:54.530
When you have to put in something in the middle of your design,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.330
you don't have to worry about stretching and

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.240
squashing elements each time you have to fit something,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.910
you don't have to worry about consistent spacing when you're

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.790
duplicating things like in a list or something,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.985
and a lot more that you will discover as you adopt

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:11.960
auto-layout into your workflow or a checkout my workflow later in the course.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.900
This course is for anyone who has either just

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.485
visited fake my.com and created a new free account or

00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:21.590
isn't seasoned professional and has been on the fence about

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.445
auto layout or tried it once and founded a little confusing,

00:01:25.445 --> 00:01:28.250
you know, just a little hard to wrap your head around it.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.885
A good user interfaces that,

00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:33.140
which abstracts complexity behind simplicity and

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.545
the auto layout panel in Figma is a great example of that.

00:01:36.545 --> 00:01:39.170
It's a thin strip about a 100 pixels high,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.630
and it stores absolute magic.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.070
In the first half of the course,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.335
you will watch me explain the need for

00:01:45.335 --> 00:01:49.160
auto-layout and showing you it's a very basic usage.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.770
Then we will move on to create incrementally, incrementally complex layout.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.195
And in the process, you will also learn about components,

00:01:59.195 --> 00:02:01.715
instances and a little bit about variance.

00:02:01.715 --> 00:02:05.795
Then having told you everything there is about auto layout,

00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:09.589
we will jump straight into habits, real-world projects,

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:11.540
and then together we will build

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.575
relatively complex user interface components using auto land,

00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:19.490
there's a chance that you might find the first two lessons in the course,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.660
which is about buttons,

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.070
a little too basic.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.790
And those lessons I talk about in-groups and frames and the difference between

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.480
them and how using auto layout is a big improvement over them.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.510
If groups, frames, and a little bit about the very basics

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.795
of auto layout is something that you are already familiar with.

00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:39.815
You can just skim over the first two lessons with all of that out of the way,

00:02:39.815 --> 00:02:43.190
the only things left to discuss is the project and the setup,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.500
which I'll be doing quickly in the next video.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.520
So see you then.
