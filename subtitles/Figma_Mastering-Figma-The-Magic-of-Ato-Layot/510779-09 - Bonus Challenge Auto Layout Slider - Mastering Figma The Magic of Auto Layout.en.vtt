00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.170
Alright, you're still around,

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.375
so I'm going to make it worth your while.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:13.260
You know what's magical about these tools like Fatma or any other tool,

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.820
is that you cannot anticipate the ways in which people are going to use the features,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.040
in what permutations they will apply the features

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.485
and what novel things that they will come up with.

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:24.390
Sometimes these novel things,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.755
these permutations of ways of using features are termed as hacks.

00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:32.100
And often these hacks become part of the core feature,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.655
set up a tool down the line once the task is what Rajit,

00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:37.345
a designer advocate at Figma,

00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:39.180
did with auto-layout and sliders,

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.370
inspired I decided to give it a shot and make this compound Feedback slider.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.775
Now this is a part of an actual real-world project that I'm working on.

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:51.140
And look at what I can do is I can adjust the amount the slider is filled using

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.840
logical layout and pull the prototype towards

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.960
being more than just plain low-fidelity mock-up.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.720
We will use the exact same techniques

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.660
that I use here with all of this to create this little thing,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.940
the slider in which the amount that the knob has been sled can be adjusted using

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.385
the space between items option in the auto-layout strip on the right, just like that.

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:15.800
Now, I've made this slider into a component.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.455
You can tell that by looking at the layers panel

00:01:18.455 --> 00:01:21.920
and this icon right over here it was denotes that it's a component.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.890
And all these on the right are instances of

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.660
that component and instances you can override a couple of things as we have seen,

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.255
but possession and dimension are not one of them.

00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:35.255
So if this wasn't for the hack,

00:01:35.255 --> 00:01:37.730
and I'm using hack in air quotes.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.240
If this wasn't using the HAC to position the knob,

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.335
will have to detach the instance like that.

00:01:44.335 --> 00:01:46.880
You can go ahead and detach instance,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.040
which means that this particular thing will no longer be connected to the main component,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.310
will have to detach the instance and then move things around,

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.275
which is messy and ugly.

00:01:57.275 --> 00:01:58.145
Don't do that.

00:01:58.145 --> 00:02:02.315
Instead, use auto-layout and see how even in the instance,

00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:07.130
each slider can have a unique position of the knob and thus and unique Phil,

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.440
I can adjust this slider to full.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.990
I can take this slider and just move it to the very left like that.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.475
And also one great thing about this particular component is that as you follow along,

00:02:19.475 --> 00:02:23.675
if you understand its architecture without getting confused at any point,

00:02:23.675 --> 00:02:28.025
it will be an indicator that you have understood auto-layout really, really well.

00:02:28.025 --> 00:02:31.865
All right, okay, let's get down to business and let's start building.

00:02:31.865 --> 00:02:34.370
Let's get to the starter file.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.325
Mastering Figma, the magic of auto-layout stutter.

00:02:37.325 --> 00:02:39.845
And inside the bonus slide or page,

00:02:39.845 --> 00:02:42.275
you'll find the finished version of the slider here.

00:02:42.275 --> 00:02:44.150
You can peek into the Layers panel,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.220
play around with it, do whatever you want.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.735
But as for me,

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:52.550
I'm more ready to start building a copy of this right over here.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.750
The first thing that we're going to need is a base which is simply a thin rectangle.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.570
This you see right here the gray rectangle, that's the base.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.695
So let's draw that,

00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:03.845
press R to get the rectangle tool drag out a rectangle,

00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:05.480
any shape, any size,

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.235
whatever we're going to adjust it in awhile.

00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:11.180
The first thing that we're gonna do is make it thin.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.715
And I mean, three pixels high.

00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:16.385
So right, three beside hide.

00:03:16.385 --> 00:03:17.615
And there you go.

00:03:17.615 --> 00:03:22.115
And the next thing that I wanna do is give it rounded caps, right?

00:03:22.115 --> 00:03:24.035
Totally around it.

00:03:24.035 --> 00:03:25.550
So I'm going to select the rectangle,

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.100
gold or hover over the rounded rectangle part,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.070
sorry, rounded corners part and just drag it all the way.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.355
And now you can see that it has a rounded caps on both ends.

00:03:34.355 --> 00:03:35.615
That's where this does it.

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:36.365
That's the base.

00:03:36.365 --> 00:03:40.115
So I'm going to select it, go to the Layers panel and call it BAC base.

00:03:40.115 --> 00:03:45.230
And also I'm going to change the color of it to gray, T2 and NMOS.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.450
It's subtle and hardly visible,

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.465
but I hope you can see it that it's right over there.

00:03:50.465 --> 00:03:53.885
The next thing that we're going to need is the filler rectangle.

00:03:53.885 --> 00:03:55.520
That's one right here, the one that fails.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.705
All right, So for that,

00:03:56.705 --> 00:04:00.515
I'm just gonna go ahead and hold option and drag a copy of the base out.

00:04:00.515 --> 00:04:05.420
And the thing that I'm going to do is change its background color to blue 0.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.475
And also for the filler,

00:04:07.475 --> 00:04:10.700
we don't want any roundness on the right-hand side.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.775
So I'm going to select this, go to the rounded corners part.

00:04:13.775 --> 00:04:17.765
It just individually and change top right. Top right.

00:04:17.765 --> 00:04:20.255
Yes. And bottom right to 0,

00:04:20.255 --> 00:04:23.030
this line down so that this n is like, Hey,

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.935
I have this n has a precise cut and the left end has rounded corners.

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:29.510
Okay, great. This is the filler.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.960
So I'm gonna go ahead and go into the Layers panel and type II LLC for the filler.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.115
And that's it.

00:04:37.115 --> 00:04:38.165
That's it for this.

00:04:38.165 --> 00:04:40.940
Then I saying we're going to need is this knob right over here,

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.960
which is just a circle of 16 by 16 pixels.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.665
So press O and get the oval tool or the circle tool,

00:04:48.665 --> 00:04:52.355
hold shift and drag out a circle 16 by 16,

00:04:52.355 --> 00:04:56.915
and the background color of blue for okay, cool.

00:04:56.915 --> 00:04:58.385
Go into the Layers panel,

00:04:58.385 --> 00:05:00.770
name it KNIME knob.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.065
And the next thing we want to do is to put the filler and the knob into one auto frame.

00:05:06.065 --> 00:05:07.415
And how do you do that again,

00:05:07.415 --> 00:05:09.965
you select both of them, press Shift a

00:05:09.965 --> 00:05:11.870
And now this is not actually what we want.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.645
We want its alignment to be in the center like that.

00:05:14.645 --> 00:05:17.375
And right now, you might feel like

00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:21.440
I'm going at a good speed and not explaining everything in detail.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.690
It's because we've been discussing auto-layout for over and are I know that,

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.180
you know, and so just let me cruise.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.840
Okay.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.275
Yes.

00:05:30.275 --> 00:05:34.895
So both of these are in an alkaline frame with 0 spacing between items.

00:05:34.895 --> 00:05:37.460
And the next thing that I wanted to make sure is that a knob has

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.550
resizing constraints of fixed width and a fixed height.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.855
And the filler rectangle has a horizontal resizing constraint of

00:05:44.855 --> 00:05:49.880
Phil container so that when this frame is adjusted, you see that?

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.060
Yeah, You say it kinda looks like the knob is

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.195
sliding and the rectangle is filling in the space.

00:05:56.195 --> 00:05:59.120
So makes her are you going to Layers panel?

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.175
And I always make sure to point this out.

00:06:01.175 --> 00:06:03.140
Reading from frame one should be,

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.420
let's just call it parts because just hold

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.825
the frame holds and important parts of the slider.

00:06:08.825 --> 00:06:10.610
Okay, now for the trach,

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.685
now I want you to pay close attention from here on out.

00:06:13.685 --> 00:06:16.820
The next thing that we'll need is we'll need a frame.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.440
All right, so I'm going to go ahead and select

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.854
the part so that I can see it's a dimension.

00:06:20.854 --> 00:06:23.480
I'm going to press F on my keyboard to get

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.660
the frame tool so that when I drag a frame is created.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.140
Okay?

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.885
And I'm going to go ahead and make sure that the frame is

00:06:29.885 --> 00:06:32.870
of the same height as the parts frame right here.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.580
This frame that we just created,

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.780
we'll just let it have a white background color for now.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.040
We'll make it disappear later,

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.315
but for now, you know,

00:06:41.315 --> 00:06:45.320
right over here, we'll make sure that they are the same height. Again there or not.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.630
I need to scale it up a bit.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.355
So now it's 16 pixel high,

00:06:49.355 --> 00:06:53.050
pixels high, and even the parts frame is 16 pixels high.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.565
I'm gonna go ahead and select this frame that we just created,

00:06:55.565 --> 00:06:56.705
and I'm going to call it,

00:06:56.705 --> 00:07:01.700
don't delete because this will be an important part of the entire contraption.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.930
All right.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.810
I'm just blanking say we have this point because I'm so excited

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.690
that this has something to figure it out on my own.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.430
Well, 60 percent on my own,

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.705
so I'm excited about it.

00:07:11.705 --> 00:07:14.840
Well, we're going to select the parts frame and the frame we just created.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.255
And we're gonna go ahead and put them in an auto layout frame.

00:07:17.255 --> 00:07:19.340
So select both of them, press Shift a,

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.520
and make sure that the spacing between items is 0.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.694
Now for the resizing constraints,

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:26.375
for the resizing constraints,

00:07:26.375 --> 00:07:28.130
I want the parts frame,

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.775
the parse auto-layout frame to have filled container constraint.

00:07:31.775 --> 00:07:35.105
And I want this frame right over here to have fixed width.

00:07:35.105 --> 00:07:35.765
Okay?

00:07:35.765 --> 00:07:37.835
Now look at this when I select the frame,

00:07:37.835 --> 00:07:41.345
the frame that we just created and adjust the spacing between them,

00:07:41.345 --> 00:07:44.780
you see that the spacing is increased and decreased.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.435
But since the parts frame has,

00:07:47.435 --> 00:07:49.550
the resizing constraints are filled container,

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.280
it fills the space that is left,

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.095
so this is fixed, so this one be affected.

00:07:54.095 --> 00:07:56.090
This space right here is flexible,

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.180
that's being adjusted and whatever, whatever.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.670
Okay. This space right here is being adjusted.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.800
So I selected the wrong frame and just so

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.800
that there's space right here in between these two things as being

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.230
adjusted and whatever space is left as being

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:13.250
filled by the parts frame because it has the resizing constraints.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.810
So fill a container, okay,

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:18.110
everything must have started falling together now

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.545
and I hope you are getting to that aha moment.

00:08:21.545 --> 00:08:24.770
Now the next thing that I wanted to do is to select this frame route over here.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.015
We don't really need it.

00:08:26.015 --> 00:08:28.235
We're going to make it as thin as possible.

00:08:28.235 --> 00:08:29.585
So go to the width,

00:08:29.585 --> 00:08:31.460
width adjustment right over here,

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.265
and I'm going to go ahead and give it a width of 0.05.

00:08:34.265 --> 00:08:36.155
Asked then as we can.

00:08:36.155 --> 00:08:38.900
And the next thing that we're gonna do to this to make it

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.320
disappear completely is get rid of any fill that it has.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.785
So now this frame right over here has just this,

00:08:45.785 --> 00:08:48.260
this particular parts frame.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.840
And if I adjust the spacing between items of this RAM,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.120
you see this slider adjusts, which is cool.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.545
And I'm gonna go ahead and select this frame ending this frame at just this.

00:08:57.545 --> 00:09:02.780
Alright, so we'll know in a wild why I call this frame adjust this.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.715
Now right here, right over here,

00:09:04.715 --> 00:09:06.200
we just have the slider,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.625
we don't have the base.

00:09:07.625 --> 00:09:08.345
Okay?

00:09:08.345 --> 00:09:11.030
Next thing that we want to do is take the adjust this,

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:15.650
this frame right over here and this base and put them together into a frame,

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.785
not an optimally own frame, just a frame.

00:09:18.785 --> 00:09:20.870
So what I'm going to do is first of all,

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:27.785
just drag the base and make sure that it is almost the same width as that justice.

00:09:27.785 --> 00:09:29.840
And then I'm gonna go ahead and move the slider

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.930
a little bag by increasing the space between items.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.390
Remember that there is a framed right over here

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.135
and we are adjusting this space right over here.

00:09:38.135 --> 00:09:41.165
So I'm gonna go ahead and adjust this and move it a little back.

00:09:41.165 --> 00:09:45.275
And then I'm gonna go ahead and select that and just this frame and shift and

00:09:45.275 --> 00:09:49.505
up arrow to actually adjust it, just its position.

00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:55.460
So I'm going to and keep pressing up till I almost align it with the,

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.115
with the base rectangle.

00:09:58.115 --> 00:10:01.610
The next thing that we'll do is we'll select both of them and press

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:07.295
the shortcut Option Command G or right-click and select frame selection.

00:10:07.295 --> 00:10:09.980
And now this is the entire frame.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.480
I'm going to go ahead and rename this from frame one to slider.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.720
So I'm gonna go ahead and make sure that everything is vertically centered.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.245
So if your selects anything inside a frame,

00:10:21.245 --> 00:10:25.070
inside a normal frame and click on this icon to vertically center it.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.550
It'll adjust it relative to that particular frame.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.470
So I'm gonna go ahead and make sure that everything

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.750
is properly centered and the vertical.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.490
So I guess they are.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.695
And now that said we have the slider,

00:10:36.695 --> 00:10:39.275
we have the slider right here, right here, C.

00:10:39.275 --> 00:10:40.400
And inside the slider,

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.210
if you've played around and looked around in the final file,

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:49.190
you know what that inside the slider frame we had that just this which we use to adjust,

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:53.585
which we use to adjust how much the slider has slit.

00:10:53.585 --> 00:10:56.510
And similarly in this frame right over here that would just created,

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:01.265
we have an adjust this frame with which we can adjust the position of the knob.

00:11:01.265 --> 00:11:02.135
And that's great.

00:11:02.135 --> 00:11:05.750
That's great. Slider is done as a final check.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.180
We want to make sure that it resizes properly.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.505
So right now if I stretch the frame, nothing happens.

00:11:10.505 --> 00:11:11.510
And why is that?

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.940
Well, I hope you can include it.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.070
It does that because the children of the frame,

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:17.495
the things inside it,

00:11:17.495 --> 00:11:19.850
don't have the proper resizing constraints.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:21.875
For example, the base has just left.

00:11:21.875 --> 00:11:24.710
We wanted to scale as it is resize horizontally.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:26.945
And similarly for the adjust this frame,

00:11:26.945 --> 00:11:28.940
we want it to scale at,

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.990
the whole entire frame is adjusted or resize horizontally.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.300
So right now you see how it works fine,

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.700
very responsive to size changes.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.250
And also I can go ahead and play around with it.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.635
Just this just like that you're saying.

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:44.900
And I know how it is.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.920
I know it is for me if I was watching on the other side,

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.895
you know, it'll be like knowing the trick of the magician.

00:11:52.895 --> 00:11:54.530
And I know it's not that exciting,

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:56.255
but More than anything,

00:11:56.255 --> 00:12:00.005
you'll learn how to exploit

00:12:00.005 --> 00:12:04.490
auto-layout capabilities to create something totally wacky and custom.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:05.810
And how great is that?

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:09.500
The next thing that you can do is probably turn into a component and use

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.535
it wherever you want in your project.

00:12:13.535 --> 00:12:15.360
Great.
