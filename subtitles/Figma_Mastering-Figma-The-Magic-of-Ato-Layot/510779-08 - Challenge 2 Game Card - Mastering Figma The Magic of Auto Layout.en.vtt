00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.850
Sarah Jones 1, you apply to a bunch of things that you

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.615
learned and ended up creating a proper user interface component.

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:14.550
We do some very traditional per say,

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.785
but that's what makes it special, it doesn't it?

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:18.570
And now it's time for a challenge too.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.540
And here's what we will be building and challenge number two.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.930
So go ahead and make sure that you're inside mastering Figma,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.715
the magic of bottle ale starter file and inside the challenge to gain card page.

00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:32.725
Now in this page you're going to find three different frames.

00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:34.010
What are we going to be focusing on?

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.735
First is the middle one,

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:37.630
which is the final component.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.480
Now this component is yanked out of a real-world project.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.430
So keeping that in mind that it's,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.200
that it's a part of a different,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.565
a whole different project.

00:00:46.565 --> 00:00:51.755
This component will not use the styles and colors we've been using so far in the course.

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:54.470
But that wouldn't be a problem in building and

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.395
rebuilding this component because every single part of it,

00:00:57.395 --> 00:00:59.165
all the textiles, buttons,

00:00:59.165 --> 00:01:03.110
and every other part of it as less dead right over here.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.760
So let's quickly go over the finished component and see how it functions, okay?

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.460
And it, nothing out of the ordinary is happening here.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.215
It's just that it's resizing the way that it's supposed to resize.

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:17.075
And also, and also what?

00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:18.920
Notice this stroke right over here,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.480
right, this line right over here.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.785
And notice how it stretches and contracts based on the current size.

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:26.345
I quite like that.

00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:29.690
Now there are a bunch of auto-layout frames that's making

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.380
up this card and making it behave like it is.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.105
And, you know, before you start,

00:01:35.105 --> 00:01:40.235
I want you to see this challenge as assembling a car together with just parts.

00:01:40.235 --> 00:01:42.680
All right, so here are the parts and we're putting everything

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.755
together into a finished component.

00:01:45.755 --> 00:01:50.000
So before we start, the one final thing I wanted to bring your attention to is

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.715
this Copy Properties option that is available inside Figma.

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:58.250
So notice this frame right over here.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.525
It has color, you know,

00:01:59.525 --> 00:02:05.045
some sort of Bagram color stroke on the sides and some,

00:02:05.045 --> 00:02:06.770
some also some drop shadow.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.435
Now replicating this is

00:02:08.435 --> 00:02:13.745
sort of grind work right now because we're dealing with auto-layout frames.

00:02:13.745 --> 00:02:15.260
So there is an option, you know,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.370
there's an option to directly copy the properties and paste it on a frame.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.510
So for example, this is a small little square with all the properties,

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.980
background colors, stroke, shadow,

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.750
and everything of this big frame.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.700
So when you have the final frame ready,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.880
all you can do is, let's say let's create a temporary frame here.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.560
So I'll press F and drag it out.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.440
And then I'll go ahead and click on this and go ahead and right-click,

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.320
Copy and paste and then Copy Properties.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.040
Then I can go into this frame and go ahead and click on Paste Properties.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.755
And just like that, you don't have to worry about

00:02:45.755 --> 00:02:48.745
what rounded corners should I get or what challenge and I get.

00:02:48.745 --> 00:02:51.230
It just can be copied and paste it like this.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.670
All right, so with this,

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.790
I'm pretty sure that I have covered everything that's needed.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.725
Now from here, you can work on it on your own if you wish to,

00:03:00.725 --> 00:03:05.765
or you can just watch me and follow along as I rebuild this and lest I forget,

00:03:05.765 --> 00:03:10.685
on the right side of the final component is also the anatomy of the component,

00:03:10.685 --> 00:03:12.410
the spacing between them,

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.775
the color then you're supposed to use in all the values that are going to need.

00:03:16.775 --> 00:03:18.935
So then adds me the parks,

00:03:18.935 --> 00:03:21.065
the final one in the middle.

00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:22.595
Let's go ahead and recreate this.

00:03:22.595 --> 00:03:25.385
And you start with the first thing that I'm going to do

00:03:25.385 --> 00:03:28.625
is make the canvas color a little lighter.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.940
So what I mean by that is the colors that are going to be working,

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.050
working with for this component of these like shades of blue do

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.890
not have a great contrast with the color of the canvas.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:40.700
So here's what I mean.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.165
So I'm gonna go ahead and create your little rectangle just to show you what I mean.

00:03:44.165 --> 00:03:46.910
And the color is D2, E, F, F.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.530
So let me go ahead and give it the color of D2, E, F, F.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.800
And you say it's not very visible on this canvas.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.855
So what I'm going to do is with Figma,

00:03:56.855 --> 00:03:59.330
when nothing is selected on the right panel,

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.030
you have the background color option and it will adjust

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.015
the entire the color of then towered Canvas.

00:04:05.015 --> 00:04:07.580
So yeah, I'm going to go ahead and make sure you

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.130
have HSL is selected and the color format,

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.869
and I'm going to increase the brightness.

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:13.295
So maybe some like this,

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:15.800
not entirely white but closer to white.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.980
Okay, So the color is F7, F7, F7.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.860
And you can always reset it to E5, E5.5,

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.000
which is the default color for Figma Canvas.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.140
Alright, so like I started,

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.950
the first thing that we will do is we will make this particular thing,

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.090
this row right here,

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.235
because it's repeated twice.

00:04:34.235 --> 00:04:37.340
And the only difference is of the text and the icon.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.960
So, yeah, let's start with this and then we'll build the rest of the elements around it.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.810
So to build this, the first thing that we need to do

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.960
is to drag out this icon rank firm over here.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.315
So I'm gonna go ahead and drag it out of the canvas.

00:04:50.315 --> 00:04:53.015
So also, since you're, you know,

00:04:53.015 --> 00:04:57.260
you're working with this and you might think that,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.200
oh what if I mess things up and

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.875
lose the elements and their default state and the parts, Well, no problem.

00:05:03.875 --> 00:05:06.710
I would suggest do this, click on parts hold option and

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.980
drag a copy of it out so that it stays there as a backup.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.975
Okay, So now again, back on track,

00:05:11.975 --> 00:05:14.555
the first thing we need to do is to drag this icon out.

00:05:14.555 --> 00:05:15.815
What else do we need?

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:18.245
We need two text fields,

00:05:18.245 --> 00:05:20.150
and I'm not really text fields with two tanks.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.070
This hit rate and attempt to advertise his correctly answered the subtext in one here.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.510
So total three things.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.340
Alright, so here we go.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.660
Here's the first text here,

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.980
the text that goes underneath it and the text that goes on side effects.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.130
So I'm just arranging these in space like this, okay?

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.195
Okay, Great.

00:05:38.195 --> 00:05:39.545
And to start with,

00:05:39.545 --> 00:05:43.040
let's go ahead and click on the percentile and where you stand these two texts

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.790
like them together and press Shift a to put them in an auto layout frame.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.470
And now there are inside a frame.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.990
And what we're going to do is name this frame,

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.925
let's say content. How about that?

00:05:52.925 --> 00:05:54.800
Let's call it content or you know,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.810
it was just called an info. Okay.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:57.470
There you go.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.020
This is the info frame and the next thing that we're

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.765
going to do is select all of these three things together.

00:06:02.765 --> 00:06:03.980
That top 20 percent,

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.185
percentile frame and this icon and put them together in an auto layout frame.

00:06:09.185 --> 00:06:10.850
So go ahead and select them,

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.590
Shift a and Figma automatically infer that since they are laid out horizontally,

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.715
it applies a horizontal direction layout to them,

00:06:19.715 --> 00:06:21.440
to the frame that there are inside.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.955
So I'm going to go ahead and name this frame, let's say content.

00:06:25.955 --> 00:06:27.530
Okay, great.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.290
So the content has the number,

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.705
which is this text right over here.

00:06:32.705 --> 00:06:34.715
Let me just change it to Stat.

00:06:34.715 --> 00:06:36.215
Again. I'll just call it stack.

00:06:36.215 --> 00:06:38.450
This is the info frame and this is the icon frame.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.575
Okay, cool.

00:06:39.575 --> 00:06:43.805
And the next thing that we're going to do is give this frame a background color again,

00:06:43.805 --> 00:06:47.090
the same background color that is listed right over here,

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.695
which is D2 E, F, F.

00:06:48.695 --> 00:06:50.300
And to give this frame of background color,

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.105
all you do is select it just like that.

00:06:53.105 --> 00:06:55.475
And look over here where it says Fill,

00:06:55.475 --> 00:06:59.450
click on this plus icon and give it an icon and give it the color v2,

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:00.755
e, 0, f, f.

00:07:00.755 --> 00:07:01.430
Alright, there we go.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.500
It has a, it has a background color now.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.480
And the next thing that we need to find out is, okay,

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.730
what is the padding on all sides?

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:12.620
So the padding on all sides of this particular row is 24.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.590
So let's give it a padding of 24 on all four sides.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.510
To do that again, like on the frame,

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.285
go right over here and write 24, okay?

00:07:20.285 --> 00:07:23.780
And also that it has a rounded corner radius of eight.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.420
So I'm gonna go ahead and write eight here and click Enter.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.230
I didn't, I didn't reference it from the Nazi maybe because I created it.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.435
I remember some of the values.

00:07:32.435 --> 00:07:35.180
Alright, so now inside this,

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.820
I'm gonna go ahead and select the info frame

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.655
again and make sure that the difference between them,

00:07:40.655 --> 00:07:44.810
the spacing between these two items is 0 so they are packed together better.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:45.935
Okay, Nice.

00:07:45.935 --> 00:07:48.830
And also the top 20 percent,

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.840
this text is floating on the top.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.385
They are not centrally aligned.

00:07:52.385 --> 00:07:54.110
So to make sure that they are centrally aligned,

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:58.310
click on this and choose this and now they are aligned in the middle.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.075
Okay?

00:07:59.075 --> 00:08:01.475
And now about resizing,

00:08:01.475 --> 00:08:05.419
let's check out how they function when this row is stretched horizontally.

00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:10.775
Really nothing happening because we have this setting of packing as packed.

00:08:10.775 --> 00:08:12.890
Let's go ahead and choose space between.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.484
And now if I resize, you say everything,

00:08:15.484 --> 00:08:18.290
resizes and stretches properly.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:22.100
But again, the problem is that we would want desk person, Thai list, info,

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:27.935
frame and icon to stick together and only this text to flow depart when stretched.

00:08:27.935 --> 00:08:29.045
So, so to do that,

00:08:29.045 --> 00:08:31.115
to make sure that these stay fixed,

00:08:31.115 --> 00:08:32.915
I'm going to go ahead and select both of them.

00:08:32.915 --> 00:08:36.260
And again, press Shift a to put them inside an auto layout frame.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.050
And I'm going to call this frame,

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:43.475
let's say stat plus icon about that.

00:08:43.475 --> 00:08:44.405
I'm going to call it that.

00:08:44.405 --> 00:08:47.870
And we'll go ahead and make sure that the difference between them,

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.390
the spacing between items is something smaller,

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.610
which is mentioned right over here.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.595
That is 16, 16,

00:08:55.595 --> 00:08:58.055
16, this spacing, so going back here,

00:08:58.055 --> 00:08:59.555
so I think this frame,

00:08:59.555 --> 00:09:01.640
changing the spacing between items,

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.500
do 16, it's raining,

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.590
so you might hear some running to the bathroom.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.750
Always refreshing. Great. Okay.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.040
Now, Yeah, coming back to this,

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.470
coming back to this and try and see how it works,

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:13.640
okay, it stretches properly.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:19.730
You say, this stays where it is and the StatPlus icon stays on the left.

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.475
And the stat, which is this number,

00:09:22.475 --> 00:09:24.770
stays on the right and stretch properly.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.860
We did it and we were going to need two of these.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.510
So you know what, I'm just gonna go ahead and drag it

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.820
here so that it's easier to pan again and again.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.140
So we're going to need two of these.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.270
The first is head trade and the second is percentile.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.360
So I'm gonna go ahead and hold option and drag a copy out of it.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.730
If you were working on a real-world project,

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.655
what do you would actually do is create a component out of it.

00:09:43.655 --> 00:09:46.400
But right now, we're just learning about auto-layout.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.410
So I'm going to let the past.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:53.630
So again, what we want is that this text right here is hit rate,

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.910
so catch IT RAT.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.610
And the texts right here is percentile, which is great,

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:02.150
and the subtext for hit rate is attempted versus correctly answered.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.530
So again, press T,

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.900
click here and go ahead and write it.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.325
Attempted.

00:10:07.325 --> 00:10:09.710
Verse says correctly.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.930
Answered, Okay, Nice.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.230
We have these two nice little things here.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.220
And again, you know what?

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.750
Since these are, these,

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.735
these are horizontal rows and to represent

00:10:20.735 --> 00:10:23.720
some sort of stat for the user who's playing the game.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.785
So I'm gonna go ahead and rename this to stamp row, okay?

00:10:27.785 --> 00:10:32.180
And I'm gonna go ahead and do the same for this one right over here, stamp row.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.480
All right, and now we need to replace this icon right over here.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.110
And to do that, I'm just gonna go ahead and select this icon and press Command C.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.400
Come back here.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.560
Select this frame phrase Command V and you know,

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.600
that's just arranges it right over here.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.295
So I'm going to drag it and put it there,

00:10:46.295 --> 00:10:47.510
select this icon, press,

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.625
Delete and bam, it's gone. So there you go.

00:10:49.625 --> 00:10:51.395
We have the stat Ref already.

00:10:51.395 --> 00:10:56.930
And now what we can do is go ahead and select both of them and put both of them together.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.340
And then auto-layout frame,

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.660
press Shift a and call this frame stamped rows.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:03.695
Okay?

00:11:03.695 --> 00:11:06.170
And the next thing that I want to check is that

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.870
it stretches properly on horizontal resize.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.365
So to test that I'm going to stretch this frame but nothing's happening.

00:11:12.365 --> 00:11:13.640
And again, to fix that,

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.960
select the contents inside and change their resizing constraint,

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.495
horizontal resizing constraints to fill a container.

00:11:20.495 --> 00:11:22.715
And now if I resize this whole frame,

00:11:22.715 --> 00:11:25.280
everything inside it resizes properly.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.890
Great, we're done with one part of this.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.894
And last thing to do with this is to know what's the difference between

00:11:31.894 --> 00:11:36.380
the y-values or was a spacing between them, which is H.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:40.760
So I'm going to go ahead and select the statues frame and change this,

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.145
the spacing between items to eight.

00:11:43.145 --> 00:11:44.840
All righty, cool.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:49.430
Next up, I'm gonna do something very simple is create this button,

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.025
these two buttons but them together in a single frame.

00:11:52.025 --> 00:11:54.335
Just gonna go ahead and see the difference between them.

00:11:54.335 --> 00:11:57.020
I keep saying the difference, but it means the separation,

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.700
the gap between them, which is eight.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.865
So what I'm gonna do is take these two buttons,

00:12:01.865 --> 00:12:05.690
shift click to select both of them and helps.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:09.305
Okay, I'm just going to drag them here like this, right?

00:12:09.305 --> 00:12:11.690
And we're going to put them together in a frame.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.540
So select them, press Shift a so that they're in a frame.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:19.910
Go ahead and name that frame CTAs or call to action buttons.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:23.540
And then I'm going to just position them over here.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.050
The next thing I'm gonna do is stretch this like that.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:33.020
But then again, you see the contents inside this frame is not responding to that stretch.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.770
So select both of them and go ahead and change their resizing constraint.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.935
I've done this over and over again to fill container.

00:12:39.935 --> 00:12:43.280
Now they showed resized properly. Okay.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.795
So that's done.

00:12:44.795 --> 00:12:47.720
So we're done with this and we're done with this.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.150
Now, let's go ahead and do this.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.505
This was a quiet and interesting part

00:12:52.505 --> 00:12:56.690
where this particular line or this stroke stretches dynamically.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:04.295
So for this part we need 12344 different things from the parts frame.

00:13:04.295 --> 00:13:05.735
So let's go ahead and grab them.

00:13:05.735 --> 00:13:09.139
So I'm gonna go ahead and need this eye icon.

00:13:09.139 --> 00:13:11.570
And then I'm gonna go ahead and need this text.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.055
So I'm going to put this there.

00:13:13.055 --> 00:13:17.270
And then I'm gonna go ahead and need this thing,

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.950
which I have called merit count.

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:21.575
So we're going to take these together and,

00:13:21.575 --> 00:13:24.320
you know, my bill, that little part.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.935
And one thing that I forgot to pull out of the frames,

00:13:27.935 --> 00:13:30.500
pull out of the parts panel if this little stroke where it over here.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:35.510
So I'm gonna go ahead and select it and pull it out and place it right over here.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:36.665
Okay, so there you go.

00:13:36.665 --> 00:13:38.615
So what now, once we have the parts,

00:13:38.615 --> 00:13:41.465
what now, what's the next step again to put them together.

00:13:41.465 --> 00:13:44.360
So I'm gonna go ahead and leave married count right over here.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.585
I'm gonna go ahead and leave this line right over here as it is.

00:13:47.585 --> 00:13:49.900
I'm gonna go ahead and put these two together in a,

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:50.960
in an auto layout frame.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:55.760
So I go to them and go ahead and press Shift a, just like that.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.365
And I'm gonna go ahead and again,

00:13:57.365 --> 00:14:00.185
call it let's call it merit info.

00:14:00.185 --> 00:14:01.505
I'm just naming the layers.

00:14:01.505 --> 00:14:03.680
It doesn't really matter because naming depends on

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.020
the context of the project that you're working on.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.135
So do not focus on the naming, what they mean.

00:14:08.135 --> 00:14:11.375
It's just so that layers are not named frame

00:14:11.375 --> 00:14:15.830
93 or shape 72 because I'm just grinds my gears.

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.990
So again, once they are in a frame,

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:21.365
Let's see the separation between them, which is eight.

00:14:21.365 --> 00:14:24.155
So it's made go ahead and make sure that is the case.

00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:26.270
So again, separation between items,

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:29.060
Let's change from five to eight and yeah,

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.850
let's go ahead and change the alignment to center or

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.715
metal because that's how it should be.

00:14:34.715 --> 00:14:38.060
All the way doesn't matter because we're not going to stretch this vertically.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:38.975
Okay, cool.

00:14:38.975 --> 00:14:40.925
And now when we have these three parts,

00:14:40.925 --> 00:14:44.060
we're gonna go ahead and drag and select them and

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.375
press Shift eight so that they are inside one frame.

00:14:47.375 --> 00:14:49.910
And again, I'm gonna go ahead and rename the frame.

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.185
Do something like marriage.

00:14:51.185 --> 00:14:52.625
Alright, cool.

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:58.550
And the next thing I'm gonna do is change its alignment to center on both axes,

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.000
x and y are even this works doesn't really matter because we're going to

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.585
go ahead and change this from packed to space between.

00:15:05.585 --> 00:15:07.190
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.640
Change that to space between and now when I drag and stretch this,

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.535
you can see that it works as it's supposed to,

00:15:13.535 --> 00:15:15.530
but this line is not changing,

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.770
its width, is staying as it is and just floating in the center.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.365
And to change that, to change that,

00:15:21.365 --> 00:15:23.630
you select the line or you select any element

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.120
that you'd want to behave like this line in any project

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:30.950
that you're working on and change its horizontal resizing constraint to fill container.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.675
And once that is filled container,

00:15:32.675 --> 00:15:35.990
the rest of these to have a fixed width and a fixed height or

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:39.305
hot contents or that data and stretch with the frame,

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:40.430
with the container frame.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.395
And if it's stretched and again,

00:15:42.395 --> 00:15:43.700
now if I resize it,

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.340
you see the line stretches as it's supposed to,

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.075
but there's this gap here and this gap here which we don't want.

00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:54.125
And this is because of the spacing between items value which is currently set at 31.

00:15:54.125 --> 00:15:57.260
What we can do is go ahead and write 0 and press Enter.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.120
And now look at this.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.755
This Pretty cool, right?

00:16:00.755 --> 00:16:02.150
All right, So, yeah.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.840
And again, we didn't actually want that to be 0,

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.760
if I remember correctly, we want it to be 16.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.410
So let's go ahead and make that 69.

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:10.490
Totally forgot that.

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.845
So, and so to 0 type and 16.

00:16:12.845 --> 00:16:15.410
And there we go. And we're again going to need two of these.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.810
So I'm going to hold Option and drag it out.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:22.250
And I'm going to, before I put them in a single frame,

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:27.125
I'm gonna go ahead and make the required changes which are in here and bet here.

00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:28.340
So BET.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.985
And the next thing that we're going to need is we need this or read,

00:16:31.985 --> 00:16:34.340
read element and now the blue elements.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.865
So select this frame Command V and put it right over there.

00:16:37.865 --> 00:16:39.815
And then I'm gonna go ahead and delete the blue one.

00:16:39.815 --> 00:16:41.465
So we have these two together.

00:16:41.465 --> 00:16:43.190
Again, going to go ahead and put them in

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:46.595
a single frame by selecting both of them and pressing Shift a,

00:16:46.595 --> 00:16:49.835
and I'll rename the frame 2 merits.

00:16:49.835 --> 00:16:53.555
Okay, and let's go ahead and see what's the difference again?

00:16:53.555 --> 00:16:54.860
What's the separation between them?

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.170
That's four. So let's go ahead and make sure

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.900
that the spacing between items is four for this frame.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.355
And yeah, there it is.

00:17:01.355 --> 00:17:04.070
We have one other part of the entire card

00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:07.400
ready and let's just make sure that it responds to stretches.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.890
I'm not going to read the steps again.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:14.570
You know, already know what to do to make sure that the contents respond to resizing.

00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:16.400
So there you go, We've done it.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.579
And the next thing that's remaining here is to put this icon,

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:22.730
this height on the left side of the merits of this frame.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:27.365
So again, I'm going to go ahead and drag this big icon from here,

00:17:27.365 --> 00:17:30.050
put it beside this frame,

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:33.260
and then I'm gonna go ahead and select both of them and

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.905
put them into a single auto-layout frame again by pressing Shift a.

00:17:36.905 --> 00:17:40.850
And I'm gonna go ahead and totally irrelevant what I named this for now,

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.955
but let's just name it to level detail.

00:17:43.955 --> 00:17:45.860
Okay, let's go ahead and see how it resizes.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.345
I'm going to go ahead and move it here.

00:17:47.345 --> 00:17:51.335
But then again, you see that this moves outward out of the frame,

00:17:51.335 --> 00:17:53.135
whereas this stays inside.

00:17:53.135 --> 00:17:54.710
But that's not something that we want.

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:58.865
We want this thing to fail the container and not be a fixed width.

00:17:58.865 --> 00:18:01.460
So this is a fixed width and this is a full container.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.885
So when the container frame,

00:18:02.885 --> 00:18:04.610
this whole, entire thing is resized,

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:09.620
you see only this part resizes where the icon stays as it is, and that is what we want.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.835
So just like that,

00:18:10.835 --> 00:18:14.375
we're done with 123 different parts of the car.

00:18:14.375 --> 00:18:16.475
The final part is right here,

00:18:16.475 --> 00:18:18.230
which is the beginner,

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:21.680
you know the title of the card and this little dots.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.420
So I'm gonna go ahead and select both of these from

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.655
here from the parts frame and drag it out.

00:18:25.655 --> 00:18:28.055
And the next thing that you want to do is again,

00:18:28.055 --> 00:18:30.710
put them together in an auto layout frame.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:31.985
How do we put them together?

00:18:31.985 --> 00:18:35.030
Select both of them and press Shift a.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:39.560
The first thing that I'm going to do is make sure that it is aligned in the middle

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:44.780
and the spacing is not packed but space between NY is that again, I'll iterate.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:49.370
If I, if it is packed and I stress the frame, it stays packed.

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:55.175
But if it is space between a stretches and fills the frame as a kid,

00:18:55.175 --> 00:19:00.470
I'm gonna go ahead and rename this frame from 81 to low-level.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:01.490
Cold.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.630
And just like that,

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.720
we have all the parts of the card ready.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.110
And before we go ahead and put all of this into a single unit,

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.605
let me go ahead and go back to the final component and look

00:19:12.605 --> 00:19:16.130
at the behavior of the card when it's stretched vertically.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:17.615
Okay, so see you again.

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:23.480
This entire part, the top part stays packed as it is ever, as the CDA is,

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.570
these two buttons actually follow the bottom of

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:30.590
the card and stretch and float at the end.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:34.580
So this should give a clear idea that the packing that we're

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:39.050
going to use on this entire card is a space between rather than packed.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:43.010
But before we're gonna go ahead and consolidate all these parts together,

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.205
the top parts together into one frame,

00:19:46.205 --> 00:19:50.570
and not just one frame because there is different spacing values between these.

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:57.680
For example, the spacing between this top level and this part is 24, this indeces 40.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.595
So again, we're going to put this and this into one frame and put that frame

00:20:01.595 --> 00:20:05.825
and this these statues frame into a single frame. Okay, here's what I mean.

00:20:05.825 --> 00:20:07.355
So let's go ahead and start with this.

00:20:07.355 --> 00:20:09.140
So I'm going to slide the level of frame and the level

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.940
of detail for impress shift day put

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.870
them into a single frame and change the spacing between items to 24.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:15.740
That's one frame.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:22.745
We're gonna go ahead and call it let's say level detail for these helpful.

00:20:22.745 --> 00:20:23.330
How about that?

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:24.005
Okay?

00:20:24.005 --> 00:20:26.450
And then I'm going to select this level of detail

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.705
full and staff writers and put these both together into a frame.

00:20:29.705 --> 00:20:31.175
Again, select both of them,

00:20:31.175 --> 00:20:34.355
press Shift a and change the spacing between them to 40,

00:20:34.355 --> 00:20:37.415
as it is mentioned in and not in the anatomy of the component.

00:20:37.415 --> 00:20:40.505
And this part, I'm gonna go ahead and just call it add top.

00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:41.165
Okay?

00:20:41.165 --> 00:20:44.360
And now I can go ahead and select top and

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.570
CTAs and put these two together in the final frame.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.760
So Shift a, and this is in the frame,

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.920
and I'm going to rename this from frame a T1,

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.365
T2, again card, right?

00:20:54.365 --> 00:20:56.645
This is the final last wrapper.

00:20:56.645 --> 00:21:01.010
And the last wrapper it has a padding of 32 on all sides.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:05.570
So I'm gonna select this and go to padding and make sure that it's 32.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:11.000
Okay, and let's go ahead and give it a background color and borders and all that stuff.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.400
So remember from the beginning of the video I talked

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.340
about copy styles or copy properties.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.690
That is president in fragments.

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.910
I go right-click, go to Copy Paste.

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:21.289
So I'd copy properties.

00:21:21.289 --> 00:21:23.750
I'm going to go ahead and go back to this frame

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:27.365
and go ahead and right-click again and select Paste Properties.

00:21:27.365 --> 00:21:30.500
And just like that, I have the entire style applied.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.555
Okay, Last thing to make sure,

00:21:32.555 --> 00:21:34.550
as I've iterated over and over again in

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.250
the course as to see how it behaves when it's resized.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:38.675
So when stretched horizontally,

00:21:38.675 --> 00:21:41.270
again, you can see that these don't respond.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:43.880
So I'm gonna go ahead and make sure that the frames and

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.915
all the nested frames have horizontal resizing constraints or fill container.

00:21:47.915 --> 00:21:50.000
Let's go ahead and make it fill the container.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.465
And then I'm gonna go ahead and go inside and make this filled container.

00:21:53.465 --> 00:21:57.665
So like this, make this filled container like this.

00:21:57.665 --> 00:21:58.895
Okay, That's me. Go ahead.

00:21:58.895 --> 00:22:01.430
You can keep double-clicking until you arrive at

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.670
a frame that has fixed to it and go ahead and set that to fill container,

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:07.070
select this and change that to fill container.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:08.570
And now if I resize it,

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:10.490
you say it resizes perfectly horizontally.

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:13.070
But then what about vertical resizing?

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:14.960
If I resize this word really it remains packed.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.980
We don't want that.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:16.640
We give IV.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.140
We're going to go ahead and change this spacing or packing to space between.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:21.890
There you go.

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:24.395
And let's go ahead and try resizing and vertically.

00:22:24.395 --> 00:22:26.285
And it behaves like it should.

00:22:26.285 --> 00:22:30.140
Okay, and I know that this video stressed over 20 minutes,

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:34.670
but I wanted to go over all the steps and explain all the steps that's involved in

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:39.350
creating a UI component out of auto-layout frames.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:42.560
And the point that I wanted to illustrate is that it's just not that

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.715
you have to limit yourself to make everything in one frame.

00:22:46.715 --> 00:22:49.835
You can see that the number of frames use here is,

00:22:49.835 --> 00:22:52.955
I think it's way beyond 10 and that's okay.

00:22:52.955 --> 00:22:53.540
That's okay.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.845
That's the whole thing functions.

00:22:54.845 --> 00:22:59.315
So, you know, try using all of the iframes as much as you can.

00:22:59.315 --> 00:23:02.420
Because when this card will be put into an actual,

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:07.100
let's say a page and the width of the page is not something like 587,

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.110
but I say 340, so, you know,

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:12.395
it resizes and if it's properly instead of resizing

00:23:12.395 --> 00:23:17.720
every single part of this and to fit into that particular space of the page.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.310
Or if the page is large,

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.400
then you can stretch it and it fit largely end of the previous chart.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.755
You can go ahead and fit something like this. So that's great.

00:23:24.755 --> 00:23:28.610
Use more frames and use as many frames as you want.

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:32.045
And I hope that you've learned a lot so far in the course.

00:23:32.045 --> 00:23:36.619
And at this point we are done with whom most of the examples and with most of challenges.

00:23:36.619 --> 00:23:38.810
The last one, which is bone a slider,

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:40.640
which will be discussing in the next video,

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.020
is not a requirement,

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:45.109
but it's a wacky use of auto-layout.

00:23:45.109 --> 00:23:47.900
And it's quite nifty if you're asking me any,

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.730
you know what, I'll tell you more about in the next video.
