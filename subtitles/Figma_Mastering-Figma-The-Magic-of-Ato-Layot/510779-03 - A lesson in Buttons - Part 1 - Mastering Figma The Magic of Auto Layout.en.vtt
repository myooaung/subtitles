00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.574
I have a thing for well-designed buttons.

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:10.345
You're not very easy to get right?

00:00:10.345 --> 00:00:14.665
But when you do get them right by adjusting the shadows and the outlines and whatnot.

00:00:14.665 --> 00:00:16.285
It's just beautiful.

00:00:16.285 --> 00:00:19.870
Buttons are also a very strong pillar of a brand's identity.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.150
Look at the buttons of Amazon or Facebook or

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.970
twitter and how instantly recognizable they are.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.140
Even out of context,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.090
it can look at a button and be like, Yes,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.220
this is Amazon and Facebook.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.400
The simplest button that we can make is just plain text.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.940
So either press T on your keyboard or click on the Text tool

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.035
to bring up the text tool and click anywhere on the canvas and you can then start typing.

00:00:41.035 --> 00:00:42.420
So let just right,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.585
BUT ON a button.

00:00:44.585 --> 00:00:47.345
Now, remember in the previous video I described

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:49.985
the different textiles that I have already defined.

00:00:49.985 --> 00:00:53.285
So we're not going to spend time choosing fonts and colors,

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:54.545
not in this course.

00:00:54.545 --> 00:00:57.140
I have already done all the hard work for you if you're

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.740
interested in learning how to choose colors and fonts.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.480
Well, to be honest, it's just practice.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.410
But if you still want me to teach it because you lack in my voice,

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.925
well, let me know.

00:01:07.925 --> 00:01:10.070
All right, so with this in place,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.635
you can go ahead and click on a textile,

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:15.950
which is the four little squares that you see right here.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.970
We can click on it and choose from all the styles that I've already defined for you.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.955
So let's for now go with label medium.

00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:24.725
All right, so this is the button style.

00:01:24.725 --> 00:01:26.240
Let's choose a color for the button.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.430
Again, you can either choose something from

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.550
here or use the colors that I've already defined.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.480
For you.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.580
I kinda had a slip of time there,

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.870
but you can choose the color styles and let's choose blue here.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.860
All right, so there it is.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.445
That's the simplest button that we can have.

00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:46.070
Let's drag a copy of this text out.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.355
You can either you can press Option and drag,

00:01:49.355 --> 00:01:52.520
see what happens when I press option that there are two errors now,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.565
which basically means that if you drag it out, it will create a copy,

00:01:55.565 --> 00:02:02.120
will make a copy of each step of the process just to see how we are evolving or button.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.840
Now, this text right here to look like a button, needs a base.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.640
So let's draw a base.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.715
Either click on the Rectangle tool from here,

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:12.350
or press R on the keyboard to get up

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.680
the rectangle tool and let me drag out a rectangle just like that.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.040
Now visually this rectangle is over the button texts.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.465
That's why its head and insight.

00:02:20.465 --> 00:02:24.290
Now what I can do is either just drag it down like this side of the bat or use

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.175
the keyboard shortcut command and square brackets to change its order.

00:02:28.175 --> 00:02:29.990
So let's put it at the very bottom.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.650
There you go.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.140
And the next thing that we're going to do is resize it

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.540
a bit so that it looks more like a button.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.100
So yeah, there we go.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.575
That looks a little like a like a button, doesn't it?

00:02:39.575 --> 00:02:41.030
All right, We're getting somewhere.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.830
That's a good starting point.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.425
Now we need to tweak the colors bit,

00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:46.880
the bun is a bit ugly.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.950
If you agree. I mean, objectively,

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.460
I've linked a blue text on a gray background that's like really ugly.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.510
So let's just start trying to make it look a little bit prettier.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.320
So the first thing that I'll do is make the button text white.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.485
And the way I'm going to do that is currently it's set to

00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:06.935
blue 0 and I can press on the drop-down, choose the wine style.

00:03:06.935 --> 00:03:07.550
There you go.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.690
And for the base, I'm gonna go ahead and make the base blue one.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.320
How about that?

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.850
That looks a little better, doesn't it?

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.790
And the next thing, one important thing that we're gonna

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.790
do is we're gonna give it a rounded corner of six.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.990
Alright? Okay.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.350
And as a final splash of paint,

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.300
you can go ahead and do Thanks.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.830
Click on the four squares here to choose a style and click on button shadows.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.860
This is the, this is the shadows that I have defined for you already

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.025
so that you can just click it and it's flat on the button just like that.

00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:37.925
And then I'll get it.

00:03:37.925 --> 00:03:39.080
That looks more like a button,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.970
something that you can probably use in production, but not quiet.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.805
There are a few concerns here that we need to address.

00:03:46.805 --> 00:03:48.050
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.090
And before we address the concerns,

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.240
Let's first of all make sure that the layer names or descriptive,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.100
alright, we generate is honest.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.120
Forget to do that and we don't want to be designers like that for E chaotic.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.510
All right, so I'll select this text here and I'll call this label,

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.610
so it's easier to understand that, okay,

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.175
as a label, and I'll select the base,

00:04:07.175 --> 00:04:10.235
the rectangular base, and I will rename if you guess it.

00:04:10.235 --> 00:04:10.760
Thanks.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.540
All right, great.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.510
Now let's get back to the concerns that I was talking about.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.520
Button and an user interface.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.825
Throughout the user interface,

00:04:17.825 --> 00:04:22.520
a button is used at multiple places, forms and cards,

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.289
and some sort of sign-up forms and pricing labels,

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:28.955
pricing pages and whatnot.

00:04:28.955 --> 00:04:31.835
That the point is that it's just not using a single place,

00:04:31.835 --> 00:04:33.395
it's used at multiple places.

00:04:33.395 --> 00:04:36.785
And the least we can expect from a button is to be a single unit,

00:04:36.785 --> 00:04:39.815
which is just one thing and not two different things,

00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:41.885
a label and a base.

00:04:41.885 --> 00:04:43.910
We don't want that. We want it to be a single unit.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.605
And how do we make that a single unit?

00:04:45.605 --> 00:04:46.700
And you guessed it right?

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.915
My grouping them together and how do we group them together in Figma is very simple.

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:55.145
We drag up selections like motored them and press either,

00:04:55.145 --> 00:04:59.315
either I was about to directly under the keyboard shortcut.

00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:05.495
You can either go ahead and right-click Group Selection or simply just press Command G.

00:05:05.495 --> 00:05:07.430
And now this is a single unit.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.885
How cool is that? Right?

00:05:08.885 --> 00:05:09.875
This is a single unit.

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:11.780
And when you look into the Layers panel,

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.810
there's this group one and these two recite under this.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.590
So what we can do now is rename this group and hate.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.795
We have created our second button.

00:05:20.795 --> 00:05:24.920
The first one was this text and this as a tax and obeys emigrating.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.645
Cool is that, but there's still a slightly better way to make this button Figma,

00:05:29.645 --> 00:05:32.510
which won't require a separate base rectangle,

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.310
and that is by using frames.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.990
All right, so let's go ahead and draw your copy of the button group that recreate it.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.775
So I'll just go ahead and press Option.

00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:42.830
I can hold Shift so that it doesn't go anywhere.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.975
It just stays in the line and I'll drag out a copy.

00:05:44.975 --> 00:05:47.030
Now I'll select the new copy that we just

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.610
dragged out and let go over here where it says Group.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.035
Now what I can do is click on the dropdown and choose frame, just like that.

00:05:54.035 --> 00:05:56.420
Okay, the contents are in a frame.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.470
Now, look at the difference.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.110
Look at the difference in the icons in the layers panel.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.500
Look how a group looks and leg how the button,

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.150
which is inside a frame that blogs.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.770
And now that's not the only difference.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.660
I'll tell you more about it, but yeah,

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.645
the the button, the contents are in a frame now.

00:06:11.645 --> 00:06:16.880
And just grouping things together and then selecting,

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.850
selecting frame from the dropdown isn't the only way to frame selection.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.390
What do you get rather do instead is when you have two things together,

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.180
you can press the keyboard shortcut, Command, Option G,

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.600
reframe them together or right-click and click on frame selection.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.810
Now I know at this point droop and frame the day sound and that

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.565
behave very similar to each other if you're not aware of the differences between them,

00:06:40.565 --> 00:06:41.690
but just hold on,

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.505
follow along and you'll know the difference.

00:06:43.505 --> 00:06:46.520
Now, to start with, we've got the contents of

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.135
this button inside a frame as opposed to a group.

00:06:50.135 --> 00:06:54.830
Now, for the benefits of using a frame instead of a group numero uno,

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.170
we don't need a base rectangle.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.060
Okay, so let's go ahead and delete that.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.605
Met What, What, What happened?

00:07:00.605 --> 00:07:03.545
We don't need that because we can apply all sorts of properties

00:07:03.545 --> 00:07:06.875
like rounded corners and colors and shadows for the frame itself.

00:07:06.875 --> 00:07:08.180
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.940
So remember the same exact effects in

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.525
the same exact styles that is applied to this rectangle base here,

00:07:14.525 --> 00:07:17.690
we're going to go ahead and do the same to the frame.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.040
So to do that, the first of all,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.605
let's go ahead and give it a fill of blue one.

00:07:21.605 --> 00:07:22.190
Cool.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.450
Let's go ahead and again,

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.834
give the rounded corners of six.

00:07:25.834 --> 00:07:28.475
Let's go to effects and add button shadows.

00:07:28.475 --> 00:07:29.450
How cool is that?

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.540
We don't even need a separate base because we

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.035
were able to add colors and effects to the frame itself,

00:07:36.035 --> 00:07:38.105
which you cannot do to a group.

00:07:38.105 --> 00:07:40.595
Okay, now, just as a last measure,

00:07:40.595 --> 00:07:45.020
I'm going to go ahead and make sure that this label is centered inside the frame.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.825
So if I select the label and I click on these aligned,

00:07:47.825 --> 00:07:51.230
you see all these align icons I can click on align vertically,

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.930
center or horizontal extent around, sorry.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.390
And then I'm clicking, then I'm going to click on align

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.970
vertically center, just like that.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:04.175
And the label will align itself properly inside the frame.

00:08:04.175 --> 00:08:07.700
Now these two buttons look the same and the one on the right,

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.670
the one which is created using frame is slightly better

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.210
than the one that is on the left which is created using groups.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.095
You also know the reason why this one is slightly better.

00:08:18.095 --> 00:08:21.725
All right, now let's go ahead and try and resize them and see what happens.

00:08:21.725 --> 00:08:24.035
Let's start by resizing the group button.

00:08:24.035 --> 00:08:25.565
You see when I do that, okay.

00:08:25.565 --> 00:08:28.700
It kinda resigned his properly but not so much.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.605
And that can be very easily fixed.

00:08:30.605 --> 00:08:33.725
So I'm gonna go ahead and select the label, alright,

00:08:33.725 --> 00:08:37.610
and then I'm gonna go ahead and stretch it to this corner and stressors to this corner.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:41.225
And I'll change the text alignment descender, okay,

00:08:41.225 --> 00:08:43.220
and now when I resize it, look at it,

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.815
it resizes properly, like a button should resize.

00:08:45.815 --> 00:08:47.000
Great, Good.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.030
Now let's get to the frame button and let me try to

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.240
resize it and you say nothing happens at all.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:58.624
Okay? Now, frames and Figma it come with the option to set resizing constraints.

00:08:58.624 --> 00:09:01.010
You can select anything inside a frame

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.295
and choose how they behave when the frame is resized.

00:09:04.295 --> 00:09:06.050
If I select the label like this,

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.075
notice that constraint panel,

00:09:08.075 --> 00:09:09.740
that constraints panel on,

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.360
sorry, that appears on the right.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.245
And it doesn't, when I select something that is inside the group, say it's not there.

00:09:15.245 --> 00:09:17.255
But when I select something inside the frame,

00:09:17.255 --> 00:09:19.880
there is a constraint panel that appears.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.685
Now this constraints panel is going to be really important.

00:09:22.685 --> 00:09:27.620
So let's go ahead and spend some time with this section of segments UI.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.310
Now by default, it says that when the frame is resized,

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.175
keep the label at the left and at the top.

00:09:34.175 --> 00:09:37.400
These two dotted lines here from the left and from the top.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.980
This means that when the frame is resized figma,

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:44.690
we'll maintain these distances from the left and from the top.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:48.410
Now, the behavior we want is that when the frame is resize,

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.335
that labels should stay in the center, okay,

00:09:51.335 --> 00:09:56.074
Now there's two directions in which you can re-size anything horizontally and vertically.

00:09:56.074 --> 00:09:58.460
And now that's what these icons here mean.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.380
Look at these, look at these right here.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.710
Now this is what means that when the frame is resized horizontally,

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.810
Very should the label stay?

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.730
And when the frame is resized vertically,

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.260
very showed the labels stay.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.790
Now in our case,

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.115
since this is a label inside the button,

00:10:13.115 --> 00:10:16.415
it should remain in the center of the button.

00:10:16.415 --> 00:10:22.220
So I'm gonna go ahead and resize this frame again to this normal button width.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.380
And I'm going to select the button label again.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.210
And for the horizontal stretching,

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.665
for the horizontal resizing,

00:10:27.665 --> 00:10:31.595
I'll tell Figma to keep the button label in center.

00:10:31.595 --> 00:10:34.070
Now look how the dotted lines changed.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.465
They are these little,

00:10:35.465 --> 00:10:37.850
they're very, very, very dim.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.020
Maybe you're not able to see that,

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.600
but there are these two lines with a little cross which indicates that

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.195
the button label will always stay in the center.

00:10:44.195 --> 00:10:46.115
So let's go ahead and check if it worked.

00:10:46.115 --> 00:10:49.985
I'll click on the button that is created using the frame, resize it.

00:10:49.985 --> 00:10:55.085
Any yes, it does obey the resizing constraints that we set.

00:10:55.085 --> 00:10:57.830
All right, great. Now there is no one in

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.280
their right mind who would vertically resize a button.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.785
But just for the sake of it,

00:11:03.785 --> 00:11:05.795
let's click on the label.

00:11:05.795 --> 00:11:09.005
And even when it is resized vertically right now it's top,

00:11:09.005 --> 00:11:10.670
look its top, which means that it will

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.680
maintain that as a sense, but that isn't what we want.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.870
We want it to be centered as well.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.250
So I'll select the center for

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.140
the both horizontal and vertical resizing

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.740
and look at what happens is that it stays in the center.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.135
Isn't that beautiful?

00:11:23.135 --> 00:11:25.430
If you're entirely new to figuring out these are the things

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.815
that you probably already knew about.

00:11:27.815 --> 00:11:31.265
But anyway, nothing wrong with a short refresher as there.

00:11:31.265 --> 00:11:33.410
Let's change the text and scientists button.

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:34.190
Let's change the label.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.760
Of course, no button, real life just has a button written over it.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.125
It could be something like,

00:11:39.125 --> 00:11:44.585
let's say click to buy or download this and play it it.

00:11:44.585 --> 00:11:52.685
They'll see the frame of the button has no respect for the content that's inside of it.

00:11:52.685 --> 00:11:53.360
Okay?

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.145
And what we can do is, you know,

00:11:55.145 --> 00:11:57.305
whenever we change the length,

00:11:57.305 --> 00:11:59.510
our recovery changed label and the length changes.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:02.210
We can go ahead and again you now just to maybe

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.975
pull the buttons stretched a little bit and then we can do this.

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:06.980
Then again.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.730
I'm sorry. Do oh, well, there yeah.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.430
Do this line the center and then resigns again.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.980
Are and if we go and make it too small, it disappears.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.350
You know, the thing is that we cannot

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:21.710
anticipate the text that is going to be inside the button,

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.300
the length of the label that is.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:27.260
So every time it's updated and we did to pull and push the buttons to make them fit.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.115
They do not.

00:12:28.115 --> 00:12:29.915
And listen to me carefully.

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:33.110
The buttons do not auto resize.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.045
Emphasis on ADL.

00:12:35.045 --> 00:12:39.080
This is exactly where auto-layout comes in.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.850
Alright, in the next video,

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.460
we're going to make the final button.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.845
Now we've made a normal text button,

00:12:45.845 --> 00:12:47.135
we have made a group button,

00:12:47.135 --> 00:12:48.470
we have made a frame button.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:51.095
And we know that how each of these is better than the other.

00:12:51.095 --> 00:12:54.155
And now we run into the problem where we cannot,

00:12:54.155 --> 00:12:58.250
we cannot expect the framed resize based on the content.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:01.790
We cannot expect it to auto resize based on the content.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:04.190
And now you already get the idea where I'm going with this.

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.710
So I'll see you in the next video where we will make

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:11.390
an auto resizing button using sigmas auto-layout feature.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.380
All right, I'll see you then.
