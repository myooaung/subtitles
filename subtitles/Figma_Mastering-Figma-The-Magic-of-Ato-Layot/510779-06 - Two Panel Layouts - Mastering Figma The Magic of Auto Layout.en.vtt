00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:10.455
In the last video, we made this little selector or drop-down UI element,

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:15.645
all using auto-layout and it resizes beautifully both horizontally and vertically.

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:18.090
We'll be reusing this in the next example,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.285
in example that we'll be going over in this video.

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:24.555
And it'll be simple because we have already created a component

00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:28.350
out of it and it was president in our assets panel.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.695
We can pull it out from assets panel wherever we want

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:35.495
and where we wanted to pull it out is in the two panels page,

00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:36.575
make sure first of all,

00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:37.670
if you're following along,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.035
which I really hope you are,

00:00:39.035 --> 00:00:44.660
you are in the magic of auto-layout starter file and in the two panels page,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.720
go into assets and pulled my drop-down just like that.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.815
Pretty cool.

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:54.305
The next thing that we want to do is add a bunch of text to this canvas.

00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:56.960
And to do that, I'm just going to click on the Text tool,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.075
drag out a rectangle like this,

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:02.210
and we can now start typing inside this box.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.500
First of all, let's grab some filler text I have figma has Wikipedia page opens.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.959
So I'm gonna go ahead and grab the first paragraph,

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:12.350
command C, come into my textbox, press Command V.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.180
All right, great, Let's get rid of

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.680
this little square bracket that we're not going to need are just,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.010
it's not important if it's there or not.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.310
So just for my pleasure, I removed it.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.090
Okay.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.350
So once we have the text,

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.775
the next thing that we will do is choose from one of the textiles that I've defined.

00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:34.595
And for this one we're going to choose body normal.

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:36.005
So yeah, great.

00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:37.475
Looks, looks pretty good, doesn't it?

00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:40.850
And let's change the color of this to grey 0.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.050
Okay, Great.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.000
And the last thing that we're going to do with a text

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.265
is to click on these three dots here,

00:01:46.265 --> 00:01:50.285
resizing and make sure that auto height as selected.

00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:51.845
When auto height is selected,

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.345
if I edit the text,

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:56.465
you see the height of this box and just automatically,

00:01:56.465 --> 00:01:59.030
and if I resize this or stretches

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.735
horizontally even then the height of the box is auto adjusts it,

00:02:02.735 --> 00:02:08.045
which is pretty great, and also makes sure that the text is aligned to the left.

00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:10.130
So far, so good.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.810
What do you wanna do now is put this text that we have written here and this drop-down

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.555
components together into a big component like this,

00:02:20.555 --> 00:02:23.360
like I have in the finished,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.620
finished the magic of auto-layout finished file under a two panels page, you know,

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.825
someone like this and to have them together into have them resize nicely like this.

00:02:32.825 --> 00:02:34.715
And if you resize them, it vertically,

00:02:34.715 --> 00:02:36.905
it resizes nicely again.

00:02:36.905 --> 00:02:38.855
And if I remove something from here,

00:02:38.855 --> 00:02:40.790
again, everything just, oops.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.320
I meant through an option,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.140
everything just adjusts properly.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.880
Okay, Now coming back to the starter file,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.040
again, we need to put them together into a frame.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.285
How do we do that?

00:02:50.285 --> 00:02:54.620
Again, we select both of them and press the shortcut Shift plus a.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.745
There you go.

00:02:55.745 --> 00:03:00.905
And both of them are inside a single frame now and look at the icon in the layers panel.

00:03:00.905 --> 00:03:02.975
Look on the rights to this auto-layout strip.

00:03:02.975 --> 00:03:06.260
It's present, which means auto-layout has been applied in both of

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.145
these things are nested inside an auto-layout frame.

00:03:10.145 --> 00:03:13.700
Now, before we go ahead and do more things with it and make

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.665
some changes and make this skeleton of a thing look like the finished thing.

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:20.510
There is something that we need to talk about.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.065
The one thing that we haven't quite discussed in depth yet,

00:03:24.065 --> 00:03:27.425
and that is the direction of auto-layout.

00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:32.165
Now let's move up a bit by holding space and dragging up on the canvas like this,

00:03:32.165 --> 00:03:36.290
come to a clear area and let me draw two squares on a canvas,

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.140
12, All right, great.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.155
And make sure that they are of the same dimensions.

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:43.070
Okay, Great.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.785
Now, let's put them together in an ongoing armed frame.

00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:46.625
How you do that?

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:48.740
You select both of them and press Shift a,

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.065
and now they are inside an awfully on frame.

00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:52.715
A bunch of options appear here.

00:03:52.715 --> 00:03:55.430
And even inside the layers panel,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.260
you see that the icon changes in both the rectangles are inside that frame.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.020
Now I suppose you might have already played around with this,

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.220
but it's not rocket science,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.765
it's quite simple actually,

00:04:05.765 --> 00:04:08.615
looking icons in the layers panel for this auto-layout frame,

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:12.575
look at how the rectangles in the icon are stacked vertically, right?

00:04:12.575 --> 00:04:17.345
This shows the direction in which auto-layout is arranging the elements in the frame.

00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:21.125
And the same is iterated with this arrow right here.

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:26.390
Look, vertical is selected if I change the stacking direction or arrangement of

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.375
this of the two rectangles inside this frame to horizontally by clicking the arrow here,

00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:34.190
look at everything that happens.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.560
I'm gonna go ahead and click on horizontal direction.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.280
Again.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.930
They are arranged horizontally now,

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.790
and even in the layers panel,

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.630
the icon changed to two rectangles stacked horizontally.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.160
Now, that is all there is to know the basics of all there is to know about directions.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.160
And this was the last thing that was required for

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.370
me to go over in terms of all the aspects of faraway out.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.555
So wherever you are,

00:04:56.555 --> 00:04:58.835
let's get back to our component now.

00:04:58.835 --> 00:05:01.850
Already that do things that we need to make

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.090
the component are inside and auto-layout frame.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.040
From here on, it's all about adjusting

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.935
the settings and playing around with the knobs a little bit.

00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:12.155
Okay, let's start by renaming this,

00:05:12.155 --> 00:05:14.615
this frame one to two panels.

00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:18.005
So not to move adults with just two panels.

00:05:18.005 --> 00:05:22.130
And let's give some padding on all the sides of

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.435
this frame and also give it a background color for the padding.

00:05:26.435 --> 00:05:29.270
Let's go with 24. So again, if I want to blame on the,

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.875
all the four sides at once,

00:05:30.875 --> 00:05:32.900
I'm going to click here and write 24.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.650
And a padding of 24 units or 24 pixels for

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.955
applying on all sides of this little component.

00:05:40.955 --> 00:05:42.305
So far, so good.

00:05:42.305 --> 00:05:46.715
Next, let's give it a fill of gray three like that,

00:05:46.715 --> 00:05:50.000
and let's give it a rounded corner radius of 12.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.570
Now remember that the two elements are horizontally

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.380
stacked side-by-side as it's represented in this icon here,

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.895
and as it is shown in this arrow icon right over here,

00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:03.485
if I make it vertical,

00:06:03.485 --> 00:06:05.915
it'll be, it'll look quite different like this.

00:06:05.915 --> 00:06:08.915
Okay, But let's go back to making it horizontal.

00:06:08.915 --> 00:06:12.710
Now let's adjust the spacing between these two things

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.865
that are inside right now the spacing between them is 103,

00:06:16.865 --> 00:06:17.915
which is quite large.

00:06:17.915 --> 00:06:21.290
And, you know, I can square up on them and the spacing will increase or decrease,

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.435
but Let's set that to a number,

00:06:23.435 --> 00:06:25.295
something like 32. Okay?

00:06:25.295 --> 00:06:26.480
All right, great.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.945
Now it looks nicely laid out here until,

00:06:29.945 --> 00:06:32.075
until we try it should resize it.

00:06:32.075 --> 00:06:34.835
Let's start by stretching it horizontally first,

00:06:34.835 --> 00:06:37.355
okay, and no, that's not what we want.

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:39.335
There are two things now we can do here.

00:06:39.335 --> 00:06:41.750
Number one, we can decide that the width of the

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.470
drop-down or this select her component or whatever name you want to call it,

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.705
stay the same while the texts width expands on resize.

00:06:50.705 --> 00:06:52.715
For that we will select the text,

00:06:52.715 --> 00:06:53.795
okay, you have end plate.

00:06:53.795 --> 00:06:55.130
Pay close attention here.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:01.805
We'll select the text and change its resizing from fixed width to fill the container.

00:07:01.805 --> 00:07:03.800
While this component, this one,

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.460
the select the drop-down stays fixed width.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.060
Okay?

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.825
And now let's look at how it behaves when you resize it horizontally.

00:07:11.825 --> 00:07:13.475
So, okay, Great.

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:15.545
See, see how beautifully three scientists.

00:07:15.545 --> 00:07:19.160
So all we said to Figma was to make sure that

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.704
whatever size there is remaining inside this frame,

00:07:23.704 --> 00:07:26.930
make the text fill it that is filled container.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.440
And whatever happens, whatever size of this as we told

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.845
Figma to keep this component fixed width.

00:07:33.845 --> 00:07:35.240
And that's what Figma it.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.875
And now that we resize it,

00:07:36.875 --> 00:07:43.400
the text flows while this one stays fixed and its dimensions.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.690
Now, conversely, we could want this component to change size and

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:52.400
expand on re-size while the text remains fixed width for that,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.680
but we'll switch the resizing constraints,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.425
make the text fixed width,

00:07:57.425 --> 00:08:01.010
and make this the drop-down component to fill

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:04.490
the container and look at what happens when I resize now.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.575
Okay, How cool is that, right?

00:08:06.575 --> 00:08:11.960
Moreover, we can want both of these to scale with the container or the outer frame,

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:17.000
in which case we will select both of these and change both of their resizing constraints,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.180
the horizontal resizing constraints to fill container.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.935
And now if you resize,

00:08:21.935 --> 00:08:24.365
both of them, adjust the width.

00:08:24.365 --> 00:08:24.995
Okay.

00:08:24.995 --> 00:08:25.655
All right.

00:08:25.655 --> 00:08:27.200
Seat CSAC.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.600
I think I will stick with this selector,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.430
this component, the drop-down,

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:35.390
I'm calling it select her again and again because I used to call it that,

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.055
but you know, the name doesn't matter here.

00:08:37.055 --> 00:08:38.975
I just want you to know that, Okay?

00:08:38.975 --> 00:08:44.255
So I wonder this component to be fixed width and I want this to be resizable,

00:08:44.255 --> 00:08:45.500
which is Phil container.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.320
And we're back at option one.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.430
Perfect.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.304
Now for vertical resizing,

00:08:51.304 --> 00:08:55.820
which currently is just nothing for vertical re-sizing,

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.910
we want that this drop-down component, this item right here,

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.600
to stretch and fill the container when resized vertically.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.955
So we're gonna go ahead and select this,

00:09:04.955 --> 00:09:10.640
go to vertical re-sizing constraint and change it from fixed height to fill a container.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.475
Now when it resizes it vertically like this,

00:09:13.475 --> 00:09:15.590
you say it resizes properly.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.300
Very grand indeed.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.010
We've got everything set up.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:20.555
Pretty much just one thing.

00:09:20.555 --> 00:09:21.185
Okay?

00:09:21.185 --> 00:09:23.330
What if we were to increase the content in

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.375
the text so that the overflow is that container.

00:09:26.375 --> 00:09:28.700
So instead of putting in a bunch of texts,

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.655
what I'm going to do is remove a couple of options from here.

00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:33.110
So I can do that.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.410
Delete, delete, let me remove a couple options.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.470
Or what I can do is simply go into the Layers panel and hide

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.755
a couple options and resize it like this.

00:09:42.755 --> 00:09:47.405
Now, if I go ahead and stretch it down,

00:09:47.405 --> 00:09:50.375
and I go ahead and do that vertically too.

00:09:50.375 --> 00:09:53.300
Okay, now you see that the text is overflowing.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.939
Now this is a very common scenario.

00:09:55.939 --> 00:09:58.534
This, this happens all the time with auto-layout,

00:09:58.534 --> 00:10:00.739
with what it is, it has been instructed.

00:10:00.739 --> 00:10:02.345
So I've noticed this every time.

00:10:02.345 --> 00:10:04.850
I'm, I'm gonna select the outermost panel,

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.305
the main component here,

00:10:06.305 --> 00:10:08.930
the single thing that we made and resize it.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:13.835
What happens is upon resizing whatever constraints that you have applied

00:10:13.835 --> 00:10:19.715
to this particular outer frame changes to fix both for width and for height.

00:10:19.715 --> 00:10:21.305
And every time that happens,

00:10:21.305 --> 00:10:23.855
you know, the things can overflow and come out.

00:10:23.855 --> 00:10:27.680
And to fix that, the simplest thing to do is find out, okay,

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.540
if this is overflowing vertically,

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.370
the only thing that I'm going to do is go to

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:35.045
the vertical resizing constraint and change it to hug contents.

00:10:35.045 --> 00:10:37.820
And every time you do that, it'll automatically resize.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:45.155
And B, just high or tall or wide enough to fit the content that's in it.

00:10:45.155 --> 00:10:48.170
Now, as long as hug contents is selected.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:49.340
Now, now look at this.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.770
I'll come back to the previous point which I made,

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:56.780
which is up on re-sizing what Figma does is change the constraint to fix.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.420
So right now look at the vertical one says how contents,

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.250
but as soon as I go ahead and resize it,

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:02.690
it goes back to fixed height,

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.580
which is very understandable.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.630
Okay, now, as long as this says that as long

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:12.755
as I'm resizing constraint for the entire frame is a HUD contents.

00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:14.105
Even if I do this,

00:11:14.105 --> 00:11:16.805
you see the frame resizes properly, okay?

00:11:16.805 --> 00:11:20.555
And if I go ahead and remove a bunch of texts from here,

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:26.000
like this, you say everything just resizes perfectly.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.185
Now with this, we are done with the UI element that we're making.

00:11:30.185 --> 00:11:35.060
And look how clean it is and how well it resizes and everything it out.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.954
Now, so far, in this entire course,

00:11:37.954 --> 00:11:40.895
we have covered almost everything regarding auto-layout,

00:11:40.895 --> 00:11:44.450
but getting use to auto-layout requires some practice.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:45.860
So in the next set of videos,

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.410
I'm going to introduce you to the components,

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:52.985
new components that I'm actually using in my real Lord projects.

00:11:52.985 --> 00:11:54.905
And I'm going to challenge you to make them.

00:11:54.905 --> 00:11:58.850
I'm going to give you everything all the assets who require and then you

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:03.065
can shoot your shot or if you please just watch me do it.

00:12:03.065 --> 00:12:03.560
Okay.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.880
I'll see you in the next one.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.980
I've got a pretty awesome challenge rating.
