00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.615
Welcome back to the second part of designing buttons.

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:11.490
Everything is as you left it,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.660
we have the same amount of buttons on the screen and add their same possessions.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.330
It just that the previous leader got a little long and anything

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.150
longer than ten minutes is not something that I really like so much.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.195
So I decided to split this lesson into two parts.

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:26.550
The first part, we created a bunch of buttons.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.890
We saw all the different ways that there are.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.055
We saw the trade-offs and we saw the upsides of using a frame over, over, over group.

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:39.125
Okay, now, Let's go ahead and get started with this lesson.

00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:41.945
I cannot wait now like we have done so far,

00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:45.980
let's grab a copy of this frame button right now I'm gonna go ahead and rename

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.015
this label back to button just for just to,

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:51.380
just to keep everything gets us.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.915
And because we have button, button, button limb written over here,

00:00:53.915 --> 00:01:00.290
and later in the course we'll have something like wherever you can put whatever text,

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.135
whatever Texans, how the label that you want.

00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:04.010
But for now let's leave it at the button.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.530
All right, so I'm just going to grow it and drag it

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.110
beside it so that they look nice and arranged.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.065
And the next thing that I'm going to do is go ahead and press

00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:15.740
Option and drag a copy out like we do.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.475
Now.

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:19.340
When I click on this button right here,

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.185
the one that I just dragged out,

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:24.920
notice this little section here called onto land.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.240
Do you see that? Yeah.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.320
Yeah. Right.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.370
That's it.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.495
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:01:29.495 --> 00:01:34.460
I get a little I get a little taken away.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.020
This, this tiny little thing just a couple of pixels high is pure magic.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.400
Okay, Now, are you ready?

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.220
I'm going to drag this just this signed the autoplay I'm section.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.150
Are you ready?

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.785
I'm gonna go ahead and just click on the Plus and boom, that's it.

00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:49.445
That's it.

00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:53.435
This button frame is now inside auto-layout. How do I know that?

00:01:53.435 --> 00:01:55.205
That is different? We'll look at,

00:01:55.205 --> 00:01:56.735
look at the icon in the layers.

00:01:56.735 --> 00:01:59.105
All right, this is for group sort of frame,

00:01:59.105 --> 00:02:00.875
and this is for auto-layout.

00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:02.645
And not only that,

00:02:02.645 --> 00:02:06.995
not only that look at this and when I press T and I get inside it.

00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:09.800
And let's change the content of label.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.815
Let's call it download now.

00:02:12.815 --> 00:02:14.915
And wow, what just happened?

00:02:14.915 --> 00:02:16.925
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:02:16.925 --> 00:02:20.870
Hold on and click, oh my God.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.105
You say the button,

00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:25.370
the frame of the button, the button overall,

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.335
this automatically resizes based on the content that's inside the label.

00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:32.495
And now, isn't that cool?

00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:35.030
Now all the excitement aside,

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.270
I know if this is the first time that you've seen this happening,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.660
you don't want to listen to me, just want to play around with it and see how this works.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.715
But but hold on, hold on for a second.

00:02:43.715 --> 00:02:46.250
What I wanted to say is that you don't have to go

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.680
through all the steps that I had to go through.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.240
You end up creating a button and make an in-group,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.340
making a framed right now and then I'll bring out a layout.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.975
You don't have to go through all these tabs to create an auto layout frame.

00:02:56.975 --> 00:02:59.960
I will show you in the next video and we will talk about drop-downs.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.570
I'll show you how to directly go to

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.945
the auto-layout and I will show you the shortcuts that,

00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:07.485
I mean, there are not many shortcuts.

00:03:07.485 --> 00:03:09.440
It's just one chore to get to our auto-layout,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.465
and I'll show you that in the next video.

00:03:11.465 --> 00:03:14.915
But before that, let's understand all the different options that are

00:03:14.915 --> 00:03:19.670
presented here when auto-layout is added to a frame.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.940
Now these two arrows right here represent directions.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.995
We're not going to need that in this video.

00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:27.590
So, all right, we'll move on to the next one.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.190
Okay.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.510
Now talking about things that we're not going to talk about or need in this video.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.585
But the next is spacing between items.

00:03:35.585 --> 00:03:38.480
Now, this is padding around items.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.060
We are going to talk about this in a bit.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.015
And this last one is alignment and padding.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:47.030
We are going to talk about some parts of it in this video.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.714
All right, let's start with padding.

00:03:49.714 --> 00:03:50.570
Now.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.820
What exactly is panning?

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.120
Imagine shipping something, a parcel or you know what?

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.240
More relatable, imagine receiving a parcel from

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.190
Amazon or whatever online e-commerce website to use.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.020
This is not a sponsored video.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.755
Okay.

00:04:06.755 --> 00:04:09.290
So imagine receiving a parcel, something fragile,

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.945
like a glass or a vase or my heart,

00:04:11.945 --> 00:04:13.670
if you're not liking the course,

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.450
It's just not directly that the thing that is that you receive,

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.450
it's just not directly put it into a cardboard box, is it?

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.525
There are some padding added around the actual item,

00:04:23.525 --> 00:04:27.305
bubble wraps or those air pillows or newspaper, you know what I mean?

00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:27.695
Right?

00:04:27.695 --> 00:04:31.595
So in UI padding is whitespace around an element.

00:04:31.595 --> 00:04:35.990
That element can be text or any user-interface element at all,

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.465
as we'll see later in the example of button.

00:04:38.465 --> 00:04:40.265
I have a closer look at this.

00:04:40.265 --> 00:04:43.160
Now this button here is basically made up of the texts,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.330
that is the label,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.470
the blue background and the empty space that is present around this label.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.630
And how much space is on each side of this label is decided by the padding.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.315
When I click on the label and hold option on my keyboard,

00:04:56.315 --> 00:04:58.820
I can see the amount of space on each of the four science.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.070
So top, right, bottom,

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.815
left, and the order top,

00:05:03.815 --> 00:05:08.960
then right, then bottom left is unimportant important so you can use them.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.835
I'm on it. Troubled room or Lauder.

00:05:10.835 --> 00:05:14.195
I'll tell you in a second why this order matters.

00:05:14.195 --> 00:05:19.415
Now let's play around with the padding values and see how it affects the button.

00:05:19.415 --> 00:05:20.735
Okay, so.

00:05:20.735 --> 00:05:23.075
If you go right here where it says auto lamp,

00:05:23.075 --> 00:05:25.415
you can go into where it says mixed.

00:05:25.415 --> 00:05:29.360
And let's just enter 12 to just around a number that's under 12.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.885
And this, and now what happens is when I set 12, the padding,

00:05:32.885 --> 00:05:35.390
the space around label, the space we're in,

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.710
the label on each sides,

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.905
top right, bottom left is set to 12.

00:05:39.905 --> 00:05:41.645
Alright, now let's try something different.

00:05:41.645 --> 00:05:42.875
Instead of writing 12,

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:45.380
I'm going to write a comma separated values.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.400
All right, so let me write 12, 13, 14, 15.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.590
And this is where the order,

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.095
the top right, bottom left order comes into play.

00:05:54.095 --> 00:05:56.750
Now overdone, 12, 13, 14, 15.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.895
I'm going to press Enter and now look at this.

00:05:58.895 --> 00:06:00.875
The top is 12, Ryan is 30,

00:06:00.875 --> 00:06:03.470
boredom, this bottom is 14.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.490
Alright, let's see.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.990
And on the left it's 15.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.000
So this is all what are top right, bottom left.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.060
And you can write a comma separated value to adjust

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.510
the padding or the space that is on each side.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.725
Okay, now, this isn't a realistic padding values have,

00:06:18.725 --> 00:06:20.615
Let's go ahead and enter some good,

00:06:20.615 --> 00:06:22.595
realistic button values that you know,

00:06:22.595 --> 00:06:24.860
that balances the debt,

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.410
creates a sort of a visual balance and the button,

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.780
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to select

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.330
the button in the frame again and go in here where it

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.250
stays and mixed and mixed basically means

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.760
that it doesn't have the same value on the four sides.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.760
So let's go ahead and put 15,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.020
four top 32 for ranked 15 for Boston comma 0.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.595
Don't forget to add the commas.

00:06:46.595 --> 00:06:48.590
And 32 for laughed.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.350
I'm going to go ahead and press Enter and look at this now.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.380
All right, I can also go ahead and change the text that is

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.490
inside this button to, let's say download.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.195
Download seems like a reasonable button label.

00:07:02.195 --> 00:07:04.300
So then again, look at the values,

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.535
1532, 1532, top ranked, bottom left.

00:07:07.535 --> 00:07:08.270
All right, great.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.945
And that's it.

00:07:08.945 --> 00:07:13.115
Whatever you write is HIV is inside the button as label,

00:07:13.115 --> 00:07:18.065
it will respect the padding values and the button,

00:07:18.065 --> 00:07:20.015
the frame, the resize accordingly.

00:07:20.015 --> 00:07:21.425
Now isn't that great?

00:07:21.425 --> 00:07:24.410
Now I know that writing a comma separated list of

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.485
padding values is not something everybody would like to do.

00:07:27.485 --> 00:07:32.015
I mean, I like having my hands on the keyboard and I can touch type.

00:07:32.015 --> 00:07:34.985
But if you're more of a visual person,

00:07:34.985 --> 00:07:40.355
you can click here on this little, that last square.

00:07:40.355 --> 00:07:41.630
You can click here,

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.445
go inside and update the padding values on each side manually.

00:07:46.445 --> 00:07:47.195
Like that.

00:07:47.195 --> 00:07:49.085
This is how it look like.

00:07:49.085 --> 00:07:51.740
Here's, here's the thing. This is how you're actually

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.920
Figma once you to do like normal people do.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.920
But the thing that I explained earlier,

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.820
the comma separated values would just up a superuser thing.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.400
So yeah, yeah, you do whatever you want.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.155
You can go inside and adjust the padding values from here.

00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:10.580
All right, Okay, cool.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:15.110
Now with that, we're done with the most meaty part of the lesson here,

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.630
I'll do a little bit of housekeeping now and make

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.510
different size button if you want to hang around for that.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.830
Hey, you're welcome.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.550
Now, this button that we have is a medium-sized button, okay?

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.640
And remember that we selected labels slash medium, which means,

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.570
which meant medium size font for the label.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.690
So overall, this button is a medium-size button,

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:36.830
but in a user interface,

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.620
you don't have buttons of just one size.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.704
Generally speaking, there will be a large,

00:08:41.704 --> 00:08:43.880
a medium, and a small button.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.245
So let's go ahead and make them.

00:08:45.245 --> 00:08:48.905
And also you'll see how easy it is to do that with auto layout.

00:08:48.905 --> 00:08:54.275
Okay, now we'll drag a copy of this out by holding option just like that.

00:08:54.275 --> 00:08:57.425
The next thing that we'll do is we'll select the label,

00:08:57.425 --> 00:09:01.235
alright, this text right here and change the style to label launch.

00:09:01.235 --> 00:09:02.720
Now we're making a large button here.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.060
Okay, this is medium for making a large button.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.245
How about we just write,

00:09:06.245 --> 00:09:08.810
write down medium for this one.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.990
Okay, and I'm gonna just go ahead and drag it here, right here.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.195
So again, coming back to this button,

00:09:14.195 --> 00:09:17.300
I'm going to select here and change the font size,

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.865
which basically means that font-size for medium is 20,

00:09:19.865 --> 00:09:22.580
for largest 24 that I've already defined for you.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.945
So I'm gonna go ahead and select label arch and you see the button just grew in size.

00:09:26.945 --> 00:09:28.535
Let's do that one more time, okay,

00:09:28.535 --> 00:09:32.495
without adjusting anything, I'm gonna go ahead and select Li, build, launch and name.

00:09:32.495 --> 00:09:35.330
The button grew in size a little bit.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:40.250
Now, just changing the font size or the label,

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:41.540
it doesn't make a button large.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:46.205
You have to also adjust the padding a bit so that it looks visually,

00:09:46.205 --> 00:09:49.430
it looks bigger than the medium or the small button.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.100
So we're gonna go ahead and adjust the padding values.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.485
Now, I'm going to go ahead and go inside here.

00:09:54.485 --> 00:09:56.870
Two edges, the padding values and not try to Comma

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.105
Separated Values because I've already done that.

00:09:59.105 --> 00:10:02.180
And you know, just to show you that how it works.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.074
So I'm going to go ahead and give it a 20

00:10:05.074 --> 00:10:09.095
on top and bottom like that and you can see it changing.

00:10:09.095 --> 00:10:10.085
It changes.

00:10:10.085 --> 00:10:15.500
And then we're gonna go ahead and give it a 48 on left and right, like that.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:20.360
Alright, so I'm gonna go ahead and put it here and call this button large.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.980
How does that look? Does it a little bigger?

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.360
Of course it looks bigger.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.280
Okay, Now, next one, next up,

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.275
we need to make this small button.

00:10:27.275 --> 00:10:30.920
All right, so again, I'm going to go ahead and drag a copy up like this.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.970
Okay, cool.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:33.995
And I'm gonna go ahead and select the label.

00:10:33.995 --> 00:10:36.365
Select label a small.

00:10:36.365 --> 00:10:37.790
All right, Now again,

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:42.020
see just making the labels small doesn't make the button look visually small.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.390
You also have to adjust the padding.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.015
So I'm gonna go ahead and select this frame again,

00:10:47.015 --> 00:10:51.500
going to write over here where it says alignment and padding, you know that.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:56.269
And I'm gonna go ahead and set 10 for top and bottom.

00:10:56.269 --> 00:11:00.695
And I'm gonna go ahead and set 16 for left and right.

00:11:00.695 --> 00:11:03.575
And this button is now small.

00:11:03.575 --> 00:11:11.120
All right, Okay, now let's just change them back to buttons so that it's easier to see.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:16.880
And i'm, I'm gonna put them side-by-side so that you came contrast the shape.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.215
All right, there we go.

00:11:18.215 --> 00:11:23.945
We've got three very pretty looking buttons and all in different sizes.

00:11:23.945 --> 00:11:27.050
How about that? Can I get a high-five or 80?

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:31.940
Ok. Now, now, once we have the final goal that we were after,

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.050
we can go ahead and get rid of

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.440
these these things because of course we're not going to use them.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.475
They're not important. They're not as sophisticated as the auto-layout mountains.

00:11:40.475 --> 00:11:41.765
Okay, Now the last step,

00:11:41.765 --> 00:11:45.080
we're going to go ahead and turn these buttons into components.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.215
Components are a very useful part of Figma.

00:11:48.215 --> 00:11:50.180
Components are reusable.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.310
You can use them in several different place

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:54.845
has and you can read more about them and learn more about them.

00:11:54.845 --> 00:11:56.735
And if you've never heard about IT, components,

00:11:56.735 --> 00:12:00.125
what I'm going to do now we'll give you a pretty solid idea.

00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:04.565
And also throughout this course you'll get a pretty solid idea of what components are.

00:12:04.565 --> 00:12:06.890
So okay, let's go ahead and turn them into components.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:11.915
Return an element in a component or something layer into component.

00:12:11.915 --> 00:12:14.360
What do you do is you select it and you click

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.195
on this icon right at the top which says Create Component.

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:20.375
I'm gonna go ahead and click that and watch this turn blue.

00:12:20.375 --> 00:12:23.585
There will be this icon added on the left and right over here too.

00:12:23.585 --> 00:12:26.645
So just be on the lookout for that.

00:12:26.645 --> 00:12:27.800
I'm going to click I'm going to play.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.910
Do you see, do you see the difference?

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:29.840
All right, There you go.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.260
Now this basically means that this thing is now a component.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:33.815
Alright?

00:12:33.815 --> 00:12:35.195
So I'm gonna go ahead and do that.

00:12:35.195 --> 00:12:37.790
Do the same to the rest of these two buttons.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.005
So I'm gonna go in and click here.

00:12:39.005 --> 00:12:40.820
Like they're click here, click there.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.710
Okay, Now these are components,

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:43.925
but that's not it.

00:12:43.925 --> 00:12:48.740
What I'm gonna do now is select and drag and click on this,

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:49.895
this, this, this, this,

00:12:49.895 --> 00:12:55.385
this little thing this is saying is this is also a magical strip if you ask me,

00:12:55.385 --> 00:12:57.980
but all right, let's go ahead and click on combined as variance

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.470
and you will see a blue border really created around it.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.830
So I'm gonna go ahead and click on combined as variance 1, 2, 3.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.485
There you go. All right, great, beautiful.

00:13:06.485 --> 00:13:09.140
This means that this whole thing.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.505
You know what?

00:13:10.505 --> 00:13:11.885
Let me just show you.

00:13:11.885 --> 00:13:14.330
Let, let me just go through a few more steps and

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.865
then you will understand variance and components better. Okay?

00:13:16.865 --> 00:13:21.545
Now, I'm not going to jump ahead of myself and tried to explain something abstract,

00:13:21.545 --> 00:13:24.410
which is abstract until you've seen it.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:28.880
So I'm gonna go ahead and you see there's this drop-down so I can select each of them.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.035
Now the, each layer,

00:13:30.035 --> 00:13:31.820
it says default, okay?

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:36.295
And, and you can double-click on this layer and change the name.

00:13:36.295 --> 00:13:39.110
So what we're going to do is when this is selected,

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.525
you see the Launch button and select it so we can,

00:13:41.525 --> 00:13:46.145
we can create our own values here are only key value pair here.

00:13:46.145 --> 00:13:48.875
So I can write this button times x large.

00:13:48.875 --> 00:13:50.660
I can give it a size of large,

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.010
and this is completely arbitrary.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:55.865
That is something that I am choosing the name of the property,

00:13:55.865 --> 00:13:58.040
which is size and I'm calling it large.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.930
And I'll do the same for this one right here,

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.040
which is the medium buttons.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.830
So I can go ahead and double-click and right sides.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.825
Medium. Okay, cool.

00:14:05.825 --> 00:14:08.300
Now I can go ahead and for the small one, do the same.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:08.750
I can, right?

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:10.955
Size equals small.

00:14:10.955 --> 00:14:13.235
All right, now if you're totally done,

00:14:13.235 --> 00:14:17.285
the only thing left to look at is how,

00:14:17.285 --> 00:14:20.450
why we did this and how components and variance behave.

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:20.975
Okay?

00:14:20.975 --> 00:14:23.705
Now, if you look on the top,

00:14:23.705 --> 00:14:25.490
this little thin strip right here,

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.640
it says layers behind that there is this thing called assets.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:33.665
So I'm going to click on it and you'll see local component and this button is added.

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:36.140
Now before I created the component,

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.235
you might have not seen it.

00:14:37.235 --> 00:14:39.650
I mean, because there isn't a components,

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.105
we have not seen a local component.

00:14:41.105 --> 00:14:46.670
Now, this means that a component can be pulled out

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:52.400
a year and put any vector on the user interface as many instances as we want.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.545
Alright, and they're all connected to this.

00:14:54.545 --> 00:14:54.890
Okay?

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:55.505
Now look at this.

00:14:55.505 --> 00:14:57.740
Now look at, look at what creating size

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.845
equals medium-size and cold storage and size equals small,

00:15:00.845 --> 00:15:04.280
which is ritual basically called the variant Feature and Figma does.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.085
I can select any of the instance, okay?

00:15:07.085 --> 00:15:09.485
You see right here where it says size large,

00:15:09.485 --> 00:15:11.420
I can go ahead and pick, let's say medium.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.025
All right, so the button is now medium,

00:15:13.025 --> 00:15:14.675
and I can go ahead and select small,

00:15:14.675 --> 00:15:16.055
and the button is now small.

00:15:16.055 --> 00:15:19.400
Now this means that in anywhere in my user interface,

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.340
if I was creating a card and I wanted the button,

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.745
I could just drag it out and let's save the day.

00:15:25.745 --> 00:15:27.920
It was a sign of form that I was creating.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.095
The card was about science, so I can just write,

00:15:30.095 --> 00:15:32.285
sign up and then, you know,

00:15:32.285 --> 00:15:33.890
then I decided, Okay, no, no,

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:35.840
I want a medium-sized button there.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.035
So all I can do is just click on it and choose medium,

00:15:39.035 --> 00:15:41.405
and that's it and everything works.

00:15:41.405 --> 00:15:45.290
So great and harmony isn't that beautiful.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.730
And more than that,

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.125
since all these buttons,

00:15:48.125 --> 00:15:49.775
all of these pull-down buttons,

00:15:49.775 --> 00:15:52.675
our instances of this right here,

00:15:52.675 --> 00:15:54.890
this whole center of truth.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.110
If I make any change here,

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.645
it will be reflected in all the instances.

00:15:59.645 --> 00:16:00.860
Let's say for example,

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:07.340
I didn't want the button just a few days down the line and decide, okay, blue buttons.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:11.720
I want the buttons to look gray so I can select Grey 0 and bam,

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.315
it's reflected every where.

00:16:14.315 --> 00:16:16.205
How cool is that?

00:16:16.205 --> 00:16:19.010
Now, just for the sake of this course,

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.845
of course I like blue, so I'm gonna go ahead and switch back to blue.

00:16:21.845 --> 00:16:24.560
So I'll select all of these. Go to this grid.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.590
It says Grey 0 and slight blue and just like that and everything.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:31.085
So beta and I'll get rid of all of this because I don't like that.

00:16:31.085 --> 00:16:32.210
Okay, So that was it.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.540
In this lesson, we learned so much just as part two,

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.610
and we're already over 10 minutes,

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.050
but there's so much,

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.295
there was so much learned.

00:16:40.295 --> 00:16:43.295
We started out by creating texts buttons,

00:16:43.295 --> 00:16:46.340
and we moved on to create auto-layout buttons.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.880
And then we moved on to create different sizes of them and then recombine

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.720
them in the variance so they can be used at different places in the user interface.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.415
We did so much,

00:16:55.415 --> 00:16:56.885
you did so much,

00:16:56.885 --> 00:16:59.975
and we're also proud and you can take a break now.

00:16:59.975 --> 00:17:02.990
And I'll see you again in the next video where we'll be stepping up

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:07.085
our auto-layout game and creating a little more complex component.

00:17:07.085 --> 00:17:09.420
Okay, I'll see you then.
