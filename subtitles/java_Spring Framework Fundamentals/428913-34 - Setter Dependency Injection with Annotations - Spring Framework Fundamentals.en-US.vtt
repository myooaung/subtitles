00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
and not is as well that now we're actually spacing this on the field.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.310
So whereas before,

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.660
with a set of dependency injection that we saw,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.670
we had to have a set of method with the annotation best approach.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.670
We don't need to have that.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.350
We don't need to have a set of method that is,

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.590
this is still doing setter injection behind the scenes.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.200
It's using job,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.620
a reflection to find a field of type repository and to assign to being it finds in its

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.040
context,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.670
which has that type onto that field.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.420
So,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.570
yeah,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.980
this is still set or injection,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.460
but without the boiler plates of actually having to have the set of method itself.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.090
Which is nice,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.240
because when you live with a few things that are injected in a few different dependence

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.750
injected into the same class,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.230
that if you have all those set of methods,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.050
you can get a bit unwieldy as you can imagine,
