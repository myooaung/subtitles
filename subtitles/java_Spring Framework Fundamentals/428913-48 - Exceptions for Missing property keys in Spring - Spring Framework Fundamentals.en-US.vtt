00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
if you didn't have the defaulting.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:09.470
So if you go back to my service and we didn't have any defaulting there and we also didn't

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.290
even have the key,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.720
I don't know what happened.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.060
What it would say count myself placeholder my not name in value,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.500
my dot name and it's kind of correct as well.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.110
If you think about it that it's during a runtime exception and illegal argument exception

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.940
to effectively crash the application or at least make some noise in the log file because

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.310
it's trying to access the property that hasn't been specified,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.740
it's that kind of makes sense.
