00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
so very briefly.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:03.940
Just before we start,

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.050
we'll just go through some key spring resources.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.420
A really useful preacher now,

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.210
just so you know where to go to be able to read about things or get further information.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.100
So first off,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.630
if you type in spring user guide into your browser,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.120
if you ever forget the URL,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.430
obviously the Spring Framework documentation is located at Doc's dot Spring Die are so we

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.030
click this link Here we see the men documentation for the current release offspring so they

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.560
can't release.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.940
As of this,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.650
recording his version 5 to 7 release and you'll notice that in the well,

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.060
we have this current power here.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.900
So as long as you have current in the euro,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.050
which you should do by default,

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.110
then it will always show you the latest and greatest version off the documentation.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.780
Also,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.510
a little trick if you ever have a very specific version which you want to look at instead

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.640
of just the current version,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.690
which is probably if you're working on a project already,

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.610
that if you just basically delete this part.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.280
So delete current Spring Framework reference that you'll see all of the different versions

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.030
off the spring framework docks.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.360
So,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.760
for example,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.420
if you want to look up,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.130
I don't know one of the four versions last fall.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.850
Version 43 down,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.540
nine release.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.220
You could just click this think like this,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.540
and then you can choose which for what you want to look at.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.320
So I like to have its hitched email single.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.500
If you hitched a male single that it'll basically lord the entire document into the browser

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.120
in one girl,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.160
which is nice because even that takes the browser longer to do that.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.220
It's nice because you can then just do command f and,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.910
for example,

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.650
typing whatever you might be interested in.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.490
So supposing images in how the Bill of Materials works spring you to do this bill of

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.200
materials.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.110
I mean,

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.870
you can just find everywhere it's mentioned in the manual on.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.670
You normally end up stumbling upon the exact section which you're interested in,

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.820
which is a really quick way of being able to hone in on those bits of the user guide that

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.830
you're actually interested in because it's a massive guide.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.210
To be honest,

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.250
it's a huge document.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.820
In fact,

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.200
for spring,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.520
for everything was put into the same guide on what have been now from spring five and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.080
onwards.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.350
If we go back,

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.350
is there kind of split it up now into different technology stacks?

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.440
So what we're concentrating on this course is the core off the spring framework.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.210
So as it says here,

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.170
that's pretty much just going into dependency.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.860
Injection the IOC container that's the spring contain and we're gonna use and basically,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.400
how all of that stuff hangs together.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.940
But we're only going to cover in this course the aspects of it,

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.010
which will actually use 90% of the time because the only says a lot of stuff in spring

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.890
which you can use,

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.470
but most of the time you don't need to use it.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.420
Most of the time things work out of the box,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.410
and it was the question of wiring components together,

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.430
setting properties correctly on making sure that the beans come into being and do what they

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.110
need to do at the right time and with the right configuration.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.560
So,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.700
yes,

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.250
that's the first place to look at its docks that spring die are but the version you using

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.050
in the spring core section if we to leave this again go back from current.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.860
Then you can also go from there to get to the job.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.200
It okay,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.890
p i again,

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.120
The reason I'm showing you this way of modifying the girl is so they can always get the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.810
exact version that you want to work with.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.790
So you can see this is the job,

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.890
Doc for the current spring framework release.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.370
So all the packages listed here or the classes only to do just,

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.510
like,

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.710
click on the class and then you can see the job of Nokia.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.510
So a description of what's going on in the class and then the usual job a dark stuff

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.620
underneath detailing the methods arguments taken return values on any exceptions.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.380
That's run as well.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.420
Deafness.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.390
Very good documents also referred to on finally,

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.480
if you go to spring,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.270
doyou slash guides.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.660
I also recommend this as well,

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.780
so this is really good.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.620
Whereas the other two resources that pretty much the definitive reference,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.920
if you will,

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.170
for the entire framework.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.250
So the entire user guide and the entire job adopt for every single class in the framework.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.290
What's nice about spring that I are such guides is the fact that it will just break things

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.610
down into different topic areas for you.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.000
So,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.500
for example,

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.780
if we scroll down and you wanted to see about how to do messaging with James,

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.450
for example,

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.610
you could just click on that and then you'll see there's a nice tutorial on.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.470
They also give you as well,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.270
which is really useful sample code.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.470
So I definitely encourage you to install get on your local machine diversion control system

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.550
and to run through these tutorials give you extra experience and you can see him code

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.250
samples.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.230
It told you what to rights.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.160
Told you what's going on describes the interfaces,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.120
and the class is being used and annotations in that kind of stuff.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.440
So,

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.880
yeah,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.970
really recommend that as well.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.190
So the three resources then we've got the Spring Framework User guide for the whole thing.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.730
We've got the Spring Framework Java dock with all the classes interfaces,

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.300
annotations listed on.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.860
We've got the spring guides as well,

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.320
which are here.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.730
Yes,

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:20.050
sir.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.200
Feel free to have a dig through those on any points which you want to get extra explanation

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.470
on,

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.220
or maybe different technologies or given aspects of spring that using in the workplace and

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.050
whatever you recommend having a look for those.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.440
In fact,

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.210
what I do is set three bookmarks up in your browser to point of these free resources,

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.500
and you've always got in there at your fingertips anyway.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.980
That said,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.300
Let's jump in now and look at the spring framework together.
