00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040
So now we've created the being configuration in the external file in a position where we

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.610
can actually use the application context and get spring to create our spring manage bean

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.490
and then programmatically retrieve it on excusing method on it.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.470
So let's do that now.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:20.330
So let's go into the app on Let's just run this now control shift.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.310
I will run this just to make sure it runs.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.660
There's nothing bad happening,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.350
which is fine.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.120
Process.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.950
Mention things that cut zero means everything is okay.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.750
That means at least now it's loaded this application context XML file,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.640
and we know we're not getting the errors that we had before,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.750
so it's a valid file.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.810
The next thing to do is just do ctx Don't get Bean.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.030
As I said before,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.830
we just passing the type of the being that we want to get on the type is a being of type my

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:58.370
service stock class just passing the cross reference now and it's a sign it and also then,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.080
once we've got it,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.050
we should be able to cold to do something method.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.860
So let's put a break point here and d book the debug with control shift in D.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.780
That's his debug,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.790
and we can step through it line by line.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.950
So first off we create the context.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.550
So F eight steps over that.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.250
And now we can see we've got this file system external application context,

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.790
which is our hook into the spring framework.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.420
It's basically the spring runtime,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.680
which holds all of the beans and is the instance of the Consider itself.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.170
The application is gonna uses its backbone on inside here.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.840
We can see it's got a few things.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.680
It's got the conflict location application context XML,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.400
from which it's initialized.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.800
That's the XML file we just created.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.650
So there will click that to go back.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.320
I mean,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.450
just come up step.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.710
And now if we do f eight,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.950
we should actually have the being itself so that we're calling into the context,

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.850
saying,

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.600
Get the bean,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.690
which isn't that type.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.990
There's only one being of that type,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.850
so that should work.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.790
So f eight to step over,

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.760
that on here we can see we've got a bean.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.340
So my service at 16.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.750
51 there's no fields on the being,

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.480
which is fair enough.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.850
But if the war you'd see all of the instant state there.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.790
So any of the members you'd see there looking good so far?

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:23.370
I think finally,

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.120
if we do f eight again,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.150
we should see that that message is emitted.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.580
So we have to jump up into the console for this.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.910
But here we can see,

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.250
is put out that message.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.040
It's put on that message doing something important.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.440
So we've made an indication on that being on F nine to just finished playing that,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.250
and it's finished.
