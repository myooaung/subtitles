00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
Now you're making great progress.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.140
You know about dependency injection and how spring injects dependence is into the beans it

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.610
manages on know about the different styles of dependency.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.870
Injection to structure and settle injection.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:11.580
Fantastic.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.110
Let's dig in now and take a close look at how spring applies is to give us auto wiring.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.060
This is better than what spring does the dependence injection for us automatically.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.490
It's great when frameworks do things like this that severs time.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.250
But in order to get the most out of it,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.620
we need to understand what's happening and how it works on.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.190
That's exactly what this section is all about.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.250
So let's look now,

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.060
then how Springer's auto wiring.
