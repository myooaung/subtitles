00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
now instead of the XML configuration for the center injection.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.410
Let's just take that.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.640
Everything works out now by testing in the d bugger,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.880
so it looks good to me.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.390
So now if we deep of that,

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.300
we should work in exactly the same way.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.290
So control shifty.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.080
We got the service and now under the service,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.090
we have the repository again and they play that if nine it's fine.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:39.440
But we just invoke the method on the to so service do business logic for good measure will

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.480
just do repository,

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.970
not do query just to show that we can use the being outside of the service as well.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.300
And now,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.790
when that and you will see everything is working fine.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.730
We've got doing business logic doing DB Query,

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.900
which corresponds to the service doing this on in delegating to the repository to do this.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.850
And then we've got the second doing DB query,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.820
which corresponds to this here.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.730
Do query.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.420
So there it is.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.760
That's a basic introduction to dependency injection on its two different types

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.400
Constructivist dependence injection on set of best dependency injection,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.220
and armed with that knowledge,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.650
you can't should get quite far using the spring framework.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.450
There's more to London as we'll discover we're going to looking at how to configure things

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.580
using annotations,

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.470
which will do next.
