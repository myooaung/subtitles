00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.140
having managed beans Independence injection on auto wiring in an IRC container like spring

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:05.750
is great.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.450
It makes our applications cleaner,

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.990
which in turn makes the more adaptable,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.850
more testable and easier and therefore more fun to work with.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.750
But of course,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.530
a real application doesn't just stop there.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.170
Real applications are usually configuration driven.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.250
I need to have properties pastor them to be able to run.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.620
So in this section will look at how spring handles properties on also see how spring gives

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.620
us the ability to have environment specific property sets with its profiles mechanism.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.000
Right enough said,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.950
Let's jump in.
