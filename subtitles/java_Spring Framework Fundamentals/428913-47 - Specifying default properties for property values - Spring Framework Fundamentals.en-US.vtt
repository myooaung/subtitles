00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.990
now the value annotation also allows us to specify default.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.390
So,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.150
for example,

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.550
if we don't have a volume in here and then if we rerun,

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.150
you will see that it's just just blank.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.660
But we can specify default there.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.950
So going into my service by putting in a colon afterwards.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.550
So you separate basically the key in the properties file,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.630
and then afterwards you put a colon and then the default value.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.810
So,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.390
for example,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.470
Joe blocks And if we rerun now,

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.490
But no,

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:48.830
it only actually does the defaulting if the key isn't present.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:49.220
So,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.730
for example,

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:49.900
here,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.040
when we go to application properties,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.250
if we completely remove this and then when they will see Joe.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.900
However,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.380
if the key exists as it is here,

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.020
then Springers and want to interfere with that she might be specifically blanking out

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.550
property,

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.950
so just correctly replaces it with blank.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.730
See a default.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.750
Robert isn't spring very useful to have
