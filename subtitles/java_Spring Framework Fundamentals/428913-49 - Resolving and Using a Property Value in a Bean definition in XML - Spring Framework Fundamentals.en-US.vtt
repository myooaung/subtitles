00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
obviously in application context.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.550
XML.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:10.020
We have this context components can if we didn't have that and we just sell beans like we

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.570
did from before.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.050
And now if I try and run and now we run,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.970
but we still haven't injected the property,

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.010
let's go back to that.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.060
It's an application.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.170
Concepts like smell.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.710
Here are the two beans,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.730
the service with the repository injected in and then just the repository itself.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.470
So that's supposing you want to populate this name here again.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.150
The same thing we put a set around for the name So settle name.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:50.250
And then inside here we can just do the same kind of things that property name equals.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:01:01.260
It's called name on the value equals might on them.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.480
And this is where we using again the property place older expression to take the value of

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.860
the properties file and push it into the And if we just double checking application

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.470
properties,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.450
it's just resurrect that again.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:21.810
So that and then go back to app and then rerun and then you can see again.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.010
We've got Matt again as a property.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.920
We know now how to also use and result properties when we're employing the external base

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.880
configuration in spring
