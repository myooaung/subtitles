00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.050
in this section,

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.660
we're going to get up and running with spring.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.410
First,

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.520
we're going to point out some key resources that you need to know about so that you can

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.450
read upon the things or if they're just some more card examples and you go on them,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.570
then we're going to give an overview of spring.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.550
What is what it does on what advantages it gives the job of projects which use it,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.430
which will tell us why it's become the number one framework used in modern enterprise Java

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.040
projects today on.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.780
Then we'll get set up to use spring in our projects by seeing how to add it and check.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.480
It's up and running,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.350
and then we're good to go.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.110
So without further ado,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.100
let's start learning all about spring together.
