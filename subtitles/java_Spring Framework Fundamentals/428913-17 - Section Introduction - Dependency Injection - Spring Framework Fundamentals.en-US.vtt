00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.130
things are hotting up.

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.330
Now we have our beans hosted in the spring container on know the basics of how to set that

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.730
up on how to get them from the application context.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:08.460
That's great.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.540
But if that's all there was to it women's water,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.240
shoes and map,

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.750
well,

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:12.360
there's more,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:12.850
much more.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:13.400
In fact,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.310
on the most exciting aspect of this passing the responsibility of object creation and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.550
management to the container,

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.490
otherwise known as inversion of control.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.510
IOC for short.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.190
That's where.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.760
Inverting or flipping who's in front of our objects by having IRC available to us,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.470
this leaders into the world of dependency.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.750
Injection dependency injection,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.440
in a nutshell,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.070
is a nice,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.810
clean and modern way to ensure that our beings have access to the other beings that they

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.360
themselves require in other words,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.210
their dependencies.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.890
So,

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.850
just like Nevin manages,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.540
our dependence is for us in the job a build world spring manages injecting.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.550
That means setting our dependencies on our container manage means in the spring world.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.970
This is exciting stuff and very powerful when she get used to it,

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.910
although it might seem complex at first,

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.180
so just hang in there,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.720
take your time to absorb it all on.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.160
It's totally okay if you don't get on the first time and you have to re watch this section

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.050
for it to sink in.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.750
So that's gonna hands dirty now and then all about dependency injection together.
