00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
So now that we've seen how we can retrieve the active profiles programmatically,

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.860
let's see how we can set one up.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.280
So there are a few ways to set one up.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.780
We could set one up in the run configuration.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.450
So in other words,

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.620
when the JV EMS launched,

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.460
we could pass,

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.910
for example,

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:24.960
minus D spring dot profiles active and then se past the actual name of the profile so we

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.550
could do that.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.130
Also,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.100
we could use an environment variable that we've seen before,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.750
so we'll do it programmatically there to Justin indifferent.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.700
And we'll do this with a system daughter set property,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.150
which is effectively the same as a minus D switch that's passed into the JBM.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.130
It's just doing inside the running program as opposed to passing in from the outside when

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.000
the problem is launched.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.220
So I said in his property of spring,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.350
the proposed active two local Okay,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.620
so let's just make sure that is picked up by running it.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.650
We want to see that this says local them.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.050
So control shift are to run.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.950
Yep,

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.790
and you can see that now it's picked up this local profile,

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.500
which is good.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.580
So so you pass it in and specify esperan profile
