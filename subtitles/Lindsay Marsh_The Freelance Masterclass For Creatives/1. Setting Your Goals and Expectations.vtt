00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.930
Are you ready to go freelance.

2
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.760
What are your expectations and goals for going freelance.

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.520
This lesson will help you explore to create those goals and understand the positives and negatives of

4
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.650
freelancing.

5
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.440
The pros easily match the cons in a freelance situation and knowing the negatives along with the positives

6
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.380
can help you prepare for a successful freelance career.

7
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.500
Walking down the street in my neighborhood I see large empty front porches and empty Sunny yards and

8
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.450
I wonder how much more time people spend away from home than actually enjoying it.

9
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.830
What if I didn't have to put on that suit and make that long commute to work in the morning.

10
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.080
What if he could take as many coffee or tea breaks as you'd like and still be productive.

11
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.130
How would you like to pick up your kids from school and not send them to aftercare.

12
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.360
There are many reasons why we want to pursue a freelance career and those are just some of the main

13
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.730
reasons.

14
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.410
There are drawbacks though.

15
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.180
One of the most unexpected drawbacks in my 15 year freelance career is the isolation working at home

16
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.040
and not having other colleagues to bounce ideas back and forth to each other.

17
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.400
There's also the issue of cashflow which will study a little bit later in the course.

18
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.770
Cash flow can be a bit unpredictable in the beginning few years and having to budget more diligently

19
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.340
to make it work for your family can be stressful.

20
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.100
Even with its drawbacks the biggest benefit to freelancing is being able to take charge of how you craft

21
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.800
your work.

22
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.350
The type of clients you work with and having total control over your own business freelancing is the

23
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.460
same as being a small business owner.

24
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.620
You take on the responsibilities of small business owners like paying monthly or quarterly taxes.

25
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.870
Keeping track of all your accounting and landing new clients it's all on your own.

26
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.020
But this can be freeing to those wanting and needing creative space to feel like they're adding something

27
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.530
of value to the world on their terms.

28
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.730
Freelancing does get easier with time and that means your first year is the hardest.

29
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.040
With many people dropping out finding clients one of the more frustrating freelancing tasks can be arduous.

30
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.540
But I can tell you it doesn't last forever.

31
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.640
There are moments when you have enough steady work and client referrals were constantly finding new

32
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.880
work is no longer your main task.

33
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.910
You need to start to focus on being creative instead.

34
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.650
The key here is to have reasonable expectations for your freelance career will you replace your current

35
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.000
salary or job.

36
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.220
I sure hope so and I hope to craft this course in a way to give you the best step forward.

37
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.740
But nothing is a guarantee.

38
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.220
Will you be able to work less.

39
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.130
Perhaps.

40
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.160
And the key to a great freelancer is maximizing productivity.

41
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.380
This comes easier for us once we work at home with less distractions and can set up systems that work

42
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:53.740
best for us and not those four systems we have to use in a larger company for example there's also new

43
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.220
management of our jobs.

44
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.650
There's nobody checking in to see for OK.

45
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.380
And this could be harder for used to having your performance reviewed and getting a good steady raise

46
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.190
each year.

47
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.140
This can be a huge plus though if you're a self starter who always prefer taking charge on their own

48
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.040
with less boss supervision insurance and benefits are something you have to work hard for as a freelancer.

49
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.420
Health insurance is something you need to purchase on your own with your own freelancing income.

50
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.460
If your spouse or partner does not have a plan at least that's the case for me in the United States

51
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.110
even if you have provided health coverage in your country.

52
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.710
You have to think about having your own retirement account and contributing money into that account

53
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:33.630
monthly.

54
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.730
There is no for a 1 K here.

55
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.510
You have to set it up all on your own as a freelancer you need to be ready for days full of tasks that

56
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.560
might not include your paid client work.

57
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.240
There are tasks like creating invoices proposals drafts emails and other forms of communications like

58
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:58.500
bookkeeping that may remain unpaid hours at a salary job you're paid for all the work you do as a freelancer

59
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.670
there's things that can't be billed to the client.

60
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.740
When we talk about pricing or services a little later on in the course we'll see why the average freelancers

61
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.400
hourly rate is generally much higher than a salaried workers hourly rate.

62
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.070
After you break it down you have notices when looking at freelancer Web sites and wonder how they're

63
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.590
able to charge such higher rates than workers who work for a company full time in the same industry.

64
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.000
First things first let's set up some goals for your freelance business that are both realistic and grounded.

65
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.910
I want to work through the goals worksheet to write down some of the goals you have for going freelance.

66
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.660
Also we want to explore questions like Do you want to pursue freelancing full time or keep it part time.

67
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.290
How much money do I want to make.

68
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.170
How many hours do I want to work each day and do I work on the weekends.

69
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.700
Download the worksheet and please as you work through these worksheets and exercises.

70
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.640
Feel free to share with the student Facebook group or post in the community section.

71
00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.000
If you're willing or wanting to share others your goals as isolating as freelancing to be the best way

72
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.980
to prevent the negative side of that is constantly staying community with each other and with others

73
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.850
in your industry not only to share your work and find new clients but to share our dreams and frustrations.
