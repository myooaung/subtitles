00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.160
Like with any small business setting your target market is imperative in helping you find and locate

2
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.870
the right clients for your services that you offer.

3
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.290
Now that we developed our goals and we really worked on detailing the services will offer as a freelancer

4
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:24.270
let's figure out what types of clients and what industries we'll need to market to if I'm a web developer

5
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.680
and I create mostly custom coded solutions and coding for custom apps.

6
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.700
I may want to think about focusing in on larger companies are medium sized regional businesses.

7
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.300
As the demand for custom coded solutions are higher and those with larger budgets small businesses and

8
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.900
clients may not be able to afford a custom coded solution or app another example if you're an illustrator

9
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.480
who specializes in specific watercolor illustrations I may want to target clients without a business

10
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.500
and maybe target individuals who desire to have an illustration created or made.

11
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.200
Same thing goes for photographers for example.

12
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.030
Think about what type of photography you like doing best and find your target market based on the demand

13
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.730
for that type of photography wedding photography will most likely be an end consumer or individuals

14
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.630
and families.

15
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:19.490
Product photography will most likely be hired by ad agencies or larger corporations knowing your target

16
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.890
market early on will help us when crafting our portfolios and Web sites and will help guide our design

17
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.560
and layout decisions even how we write our sales language on our landing page and how we write our social

18
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.720
media accounts.

19
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.520
This can also affect how we do our paid marketing.

20
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.470
If you decide to go that route as well.

21
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.580
First of all let's figure out what your target market will be.

22
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.370
Mom and Pop businesses a large company or anything in between.

23
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.260
Let's say you're a graphic designer who has logo design and branding and their services list can have

24
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.750
the potential of both smaller or larger size clients businesses or even individuals wanting logo work

25
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.500
done.

26
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.050
When first starting your target market it could be larger and as you find your client base you'll slowly

27
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.140
be able to hone in more on your target market there's a few questions you can ask yourself that'll help

28
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.450
you narrow this down further.

29
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.980
What type of client would need my particular creative style.

30
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.300
If I have a high end clean flat design style or illustration style or photography style perhaps targeting

31
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:30.620
clients in a luxury retail high end real estate space might be helpful ask yourself where is their demand

32
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.700
for my services.

33
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.010
Are there particular industries needing my service more than others retail shops are always needing

34
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.480
logo and branding work.

35
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.520
Also freelancers as well perhaps as a way to fine tune my target market by exploring demand.

36
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.030
And this is where a little detective work pays off.

37
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.730
You could check out trending photography stock photo sites to see if you can pick up more popular styles

38
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.040
and demands from people interested in needing photography or stock photos.

39
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.030
Depends on your industry and what services you offer what types of Web sites you think you can go to

40
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.800
do that detective work what type of budget do you need to hire me for a project or service if I'm a

41
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.550
web developer.

42
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.590
Perhaps you'll need a minimum of two thousand dollars to even start a project with me that could help

43
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.360
you narrow down your target audience simply because some types of clients may not be able to afford

44
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.330
a Web site of that pricing so small mom and pop local businesses for example may not be your target

45
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.600
market.

46
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.060
There are several ways to break down a target market or demographic.

47
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.840
I'm going to go over some of them right now.

48
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.320
Demographics can be broken down by age.

49
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.260
Perhaps I'll want to target 20 to 40 somethings if I offer wedding photography services.

50
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.390
If I offer custom T-shirt illustrations I may want to target the younger ages.

51
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.340
There is a breakdown by income.

52
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.200
Once again budget plays a factor in this demographic.

53
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.590
Some individuals clients or companies may have smaller budgets or income levels and others and we'll

54
00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.320
touch on this a bit more when we get to the pricing section of this course there's a breakdown by location.

55
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.120
Some of the guys want to have a worldwide client base while others like those in the painting world

56
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.440
find it hard to ship larger finished products to clients who are overseas.

57
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.510
Also working with clients in other countries can be more challenging in some industries than others.

58
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.690
Web design is one of those services that seem to be more immune to this challenge.

59
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.250
You also want to figure out if you want to target local clients at first or national sometime starting

60
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.270
with a local target market can make marketing and networking a lot easier.

61
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.520
Some local markets may not support your services though because of income or budgets in your nearby

62
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.200
town.

63
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.750
Demographics can talk about client size and figuring out the size of your clients companies or businesses

64
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.770
could be a big help in crafting your target market.

65
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:55.620
Your client may be individuals families small local businesses regional businesses or even larger national

66
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.310
corporations.

67
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.530
Finding out the size of your desired client will also help you personally.

68
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.870
Individuals and smaller companies are more compassionate with deadlines and larger corporations can

69
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.090
pay a lot more.

70
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.160
But be a little less forgiving of schedule changes.

71
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.180
This can also be helpful to know if you decide to do paid targeted marketing campaigns and we'll talk

72
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.520
about that a lot a bit later in the course when we get to marketing.

73
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.000
You can also break up your target market by interests likes and dislikes.

74
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.080
This goes back to matching with an industry that may demand your style.

75
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.920
We all offer certain styles and are creative services and try to find ways to find target demographics

76
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.860
that may desire or have a demand for unique your unique style or have a demand for the style you want

77
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.890
to have a particular skill set in.

78
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.410
There there's a break down by gender with your potential clients most likely be male female.

79
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.720
Certain industries and styles may be overwhelmingly targeting one over the other so you can check out

80
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.120
your competition.

81
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.290
Another way to fine tune your target market is to study that competition and you may notice their client

82
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.810
list on their portfolio seems to be targeting a particular industry.

83
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.980
Also add them to your social media feeds they can constantly see what they're up to and how they're

84
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.890
crafting their marketing pay campaigns for their clients.

85
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:24.230
So you get some great ideas for profits are nonprofits finding out whether your target market will focus

86
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.130
on nonprofits or for profit companies.

87
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.030
Helpful.

88
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.360
Certain services favor one over the other.

89
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.790
For example illustrations or mural or maybe more demand for nonprofits in the area.

90
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.820
Feel free to download the target market worksheet and see if you can come up with your basic target

91
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.740
market for your freelance business.

92
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.330
This of course can shift and change as you find new clients and slowly build up our business.
