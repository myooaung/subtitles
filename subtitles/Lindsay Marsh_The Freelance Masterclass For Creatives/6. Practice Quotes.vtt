00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.620
Now that we use three different methods to help us develop our hourly and fixed pricing scales let's

2
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.870
do some additional practice quotes you can use the sheet in the downloadable resource for this lesson

3
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.510
if you want to use it to help you with your own practice.

4
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.230
Quotes are to follow along.

5
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.130
The first client quote example dear Lillian I've heard great things about you and needed a quote for

6
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.190
some simple graphic design services.

7
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.370
We're a new business and needed to have a logo and some brand items developed.

8
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.320
How much do you charge for those services.

9
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.980
I have a tight budget but want to pay fairly good for good work.

10
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.710
Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you.

11
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.840
Let's break down this email.

12
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.180
First of all I gather from the email already that there might be a smaller tier 1 client based on already

13
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.930
admitting to a tight budget.

14
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.260
There are also a new company.

15
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.110
So no income is coming in yet to help boost their budget.

16
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.640
They do mention that they want to pay a fair price which gives me a little bit of pricing power to the

17
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.600
upside but not a whole lot.

18
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.210
There are many things we have yet to find out about the client.

19
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.520
So I almost always follow up with an additional question or two before I create a proper quote.

20
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.010
Since this project is small I'm already thinking about a fixed rate price and it might work out better

21
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.980
for both me and the client because of its simplicity so I write back in an email to your client.

22
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.560
I'd be happy to provide you with the quote for these services.

23
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.450
I wanted to clarify a few things before we get started.

24
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.710
First of all out of curiosity what type of business or industry are you in.

25
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.360
Secondly it sounds like you need a logo design but what other specific branded items would you like

26
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.200
to have with it.

27
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.970
Business cards letterhead social media ads.

28
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.340
I want to be able to come up with an accurate quote.

29
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.890
So just getting some quick clarification on items you know I'll need during this time.

30
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.030
I look forward to working together with you to come up with a solution that will work best for your

31
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.050
blooming business.

32
00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.320
We need to find out what industry they're in to help us size up the client a little bit further.

33
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.060
If they're in a profitable industry law for example we may have more upside pricing power.

34
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.650
Nonprofits may have a little less pricing power but not always Next we need to find out an exact list

35
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.070
of services they need as they were not totally clear on that.

36
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.280
A lot of clients are not clear on the services they need.

37
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.610
So it's our job to educate them on the different items or services they're going to be looking for the

38
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.920
client emails back.

39
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.350
Lillian I got so excited I forgot to tell you a bit about my business.

40
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.360
We're in the financial industry and our goal is to manage money for local businesses.

41
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.910
We're awaiting a logo that best represents our hiring clientele and looks very professional and polished.

42
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.290
We also like to have all of our stationery is designed as well as e-mail signatures for employees.

43
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.950
We do not need anything beyond that.

44
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.240
At this time but perhaps in the future we'll need additional items.

45
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.370
So now we have a list of everything they need a quote for.

46
00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.850
We also know a bit about their industry and know that they'll eventually be a fairly profitable business.

47
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.060
So more time is needed to craft that logo to look polished and professional.

48
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.050
I might put them somewhere between Tier 1 into your 2 because of this.

49
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:15.800
If they were a less profitable business I might have to put them closer to B being in tier 1.

50
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.110
As you can see none of this is an exact science but all of this is a rough guide to help us come up

51
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.660
with all these different calculations to help us find that right quote project scope will be average

52
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.380
as well.

53
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.400
I don't know much about their marketing but I do know they're going to want to start to do some internal

54
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.580
emails and personal meetings to try to land those local business accounts project exposure in this case

55
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.710
will not be quite as helpful here.

56
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:46.140
And that's ok it's just one of those many factors we have to help us quote Lillian's experience level

57
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.120
is beginner level at freelancing but she has some intermediate experience working at a previous company

58
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.040
full time as a designer.

59
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.750
She will fall some more here on the scale for you this is a personal rating of yourself based on how

60
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.400
you feel your experience level falls and based on the descriptions and the previous lessons.

61
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.850
Now we have some basis of pricing our fixed rate project we could quote hourly and assume this project

62
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.160
will take 10 to 12 hours and make three hundred twenty dollars for the projects or we can quote a little

63
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.290
bit of a higher fixed price and hope the client approves.

64
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.920
This is why all that extra information we asked for will be helpful in pushing our fixed price as high

65
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.260
as possible without making them nervous or them wanting to seek other freelancers because our quote

66
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.030
was just too high.

67
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:38.050
Remember our little pricing balance chart and remember we can always bring our pricing down if the client

68
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.260
pushes back but we can never raise our prices once we present a quote a typical logo design based on

69
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.970
research goes from one hundred dollars to 1000 dollars for this sized company.

70
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.040
Let's push for a five hundred dollar quote for the logo design and add an additional 200 dollars as

71
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.820
a separate line item for the other services requested.

72
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.340
Now we're ready to present our quote and there's several ways we can present it simply in an email communication

73
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.410
which breaks it down and gives the total are better yet let's really impress our client and showing

74
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.440
we deserve that higher fixed price even though is a smaller company we can present it in a polished

75
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.280
letterhead document in a proposal format.

76
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.700
We already developed a letterhead and an invoice design and the personal branding section of the class.

77
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.370
There are several invoicing software that you can use to send out proposals or estimates.

78
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:34.960
One of those is zip books which is free and quick books which is a paid monthly service.

79
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.140
Either one of those can work and there's many more as well.

80
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.660
When you send out invoices and proposals it keeps track of all the numbers and it makes it easy to find

81
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.450
your income when it comes to report it for tax purposes at the end of the year.

82
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:55.000
You can even create one of these using Word or Canada or Adobe Illustrator with some nicely crafted

83
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.580
images if you prefer not to use invoicing software for this.

84
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.320
Now we have a professionally crafted proposal.

85
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.630
We want to include some necessary notes on our proposal or estimate especially one that quotes that

86
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.870
this is not an invoice but it's merely a guesstimate or estimate.

87
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.880
A final project cost.

88
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:20.290
Also in our email we can explain the basis for our pricing to further clarify the numbers we proposed.

89
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.030
Dear client thank you for providing this extra information it was helpful in formulating a quote for

90
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.420
you.

91
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.160
See the attached PDA for a detailed proposal and breakdown of each items costs.

92
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.380
If you have any questions feel free to ask.

93
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.650
I'll be happy to clarify.

94
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.240
Of course you hope the email back with the I accept.

95
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.680
Let's begin work email.

96
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:44.010
But they could reply back with it's a little bit out of my price range email.

97
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.610
This is when you have to decide of taking this client will pay dividends beyond the payment you will

98
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.010
get for the project.

99
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.990
If I think this will be worth dropping my quote I will start by dropping it by 10 percent.

100
00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.960
If that fails I'll need to reassess it pursuing the client is worth that steep price cut in some cases

101
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.180
it is and I will pursue a 20 percent rate cut after that.

102
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:13.400
But once that 20 percent rate cut is declined I'll usually politely decline the project now that we're

103
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.830
getting a good idea of how this back and forth communication and coding with the client goes.

104
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.310
Let's try another quote.
