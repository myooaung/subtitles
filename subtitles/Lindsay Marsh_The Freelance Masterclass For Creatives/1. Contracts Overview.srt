1
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:11,290
Now that you have a client work project lined up it's time to start thinking about contracts.

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,760
Contracts can protect both you and the client and what you include or exclude from the contract can

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,820
make or break your client relationships.

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,340
First of all a quick disclaimer I am not a legal expert.

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,620
The information given out in this section of this course is for educational purposes only and not official

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,740
legal counsel.

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:35,170
Please seek legal counsel for any questions regarding the legal validity of your contract.

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,140
There also might be certain legal requirements for contracts in the country where you live or in the

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,930
industry you work in the following example contract and clauses are just a rough guide or outline and

10
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:53,020
may not include all necessary legal requirements for your particular client or project type when to

11
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,030
use a written contract.

12
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:00,000
It's nice to have a written contract for each client project but that's not always a reality.

13
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,770
There are some smaller projects where a verbal contract can suffice.

14
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,430
How do I know when that is.

15
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,390
This is very personal and up to you in your current relationship with your client.

16
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:16,240
A family member or a store owner you have known for years could enter into a verbal contract without

17
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,780
a written contract and be just fine.

18
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,000
Usually that price limit is a dollar amount or a projected total profit for that project.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,140
This would be an amount I would not be willing to part with if the project fails a web design project

20
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,600
that exceeds two thousand dollars will almost certainly need a contract.

21
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,210
That's a lot of money to risk losing if something goes wrong with the client relationship.

22
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,490
One hundred dollar quick I can design someone needs that already knows you well that may not require

23
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,560
a contract.

24
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:52,100
It's up to you my personal limit has moved up over the years as client projects get bigger and bigger

25
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,340
and now rests at about 1000 dollars.

26
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,710
Anything below that price for the total project.

27
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,580
I try not to worry about contracts of course as your instructor.

28
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:07,580
I would encourage you to always have a written formal contract for every project you do but in reality

29
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,770
it's just not always necessary.

30
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:16,280
There is the exception when it comes to owning the copyright of certain graphics photos and illustrations.

31
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,570
You're creating an illustration.

32
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,900
It's nice to have that written in your contract.

33
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:25,220
Whether you still have the rights to use that graphic or resource or if the client will have 100 percent

34
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:30,910
rights to use it or if the client is allowed to let you use it in future projects are not.

35
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,300
Now let's dive into the details of the basic anatomy of a freelancers contract.

36
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:42,410
There are four main parts of a functioning client freelancer contract the contract needs to include

37
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,740
a service that the freelancer will perform.

38
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,120
This will be a full list of items or the description of services that will be provided or performed

39
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,990
there needs to be an exchange for that said service.

40
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:59,640
It could be cash or an exchange of services there needs to be set milestones.

41
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,930
If the project is longer and if and when payment will be distributed to the freelancer when certain

42
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:10,420
milestones are reached there also needs to be a stated timeline in which the written services will be

43
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:16,760
performed there needs to be a written agreement signed by both parties that binds the contract and where

44
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:24,310
both parties agree to all that's written in the contract agreeing to all terms and conditions your contracts

45
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,620
need to have clear sections that divide those four main items.

46
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,170
There are several other items that a freelancer should think about including in their contract and those

47
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,540
are contact information for both you and the client.

48
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:41,230
Perhaps a phone number and an address started in times for the project.

49
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,760
If there is a continuously hourly rate contract how long will that contract last.

50
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,390
Or when does the contract expire interest or any late fees do.

51
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,910
If the client does not pay on time breach of contract terms and those defined the actions that would

52
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,010
nullify or avoid the contract.

53
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:06,760
For example if the 50 percent deposit was returned upfront disclosure on any upfront deposit is required

54
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:13,680
to start work any other special situations that apply to just your project or your situation.

55
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:20,300
Contracts can protect freelancers of a client does not want to end up paying for client work or paying

56
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,140
for milestones that are reached in the court of law.

57
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,040
Written contracts hold up better than verbal ones.

58
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:32,420
I suggest keeping a record of email exchanges as well that mentions prices or agreements or the sending

59
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,850
of estimates or invoices just in case those need to be referenced along with a written contract in the

60
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,350
future.

61
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:44,360
Jessica Swartz is a blogger over at medium and has graciously shared her freelancing contract with the

62
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,130
world.

63
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,970
I'm providing you with that file for this section as a downloadable resource and writing a contract

64
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,550
from scratch that fully protects herself is almost impossible without a ton of legal knowledge.

65
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,050
So it's nice to have a basic template to customize to your needs.

66
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,610
Of course this does not include everything and is not customized for your project or your country and

67
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,930
needs quite yet.

68
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,600
We're going to work through this entire project and customize it to our sample quote we did in the previous

69
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,210
section and the previous section we landed a client to do a single illustration for a national campaign

70
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,170
for a big coffee chain.

71
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,540
Our quote was for twenty one hundred dollars for a single full color illustration.

72
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,550
Let's get started.
