1
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:11,680
So here we are we're an Adobe InDesign and we're gonna create our layout or our plan for our portfolio.

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,560
You can see I've already kind of started sketching this out a little bit.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,640
You're going to want to have to figure out how many total projects you want to have in your portfolio.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,710
I've decided to have three that Lillian Hernandez is going to feature and we're gonna do a little bit

5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,810
more of a detailed overview of each project so that's why I'm only sticking to three.

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,030
I'm thinking overall I might commit three total pages to each project although not every project is

7
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,050
going to need all three and some may need four.

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:42,640
So as long as I keep it within 10 pages or less I'm going to feel pretty happy if I go over to 12 pages

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,310
to see to make sure this two extra pages I added are worth it.

10
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,790
Is it really needed to have those two pages.

11
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:55,300
If so you can go beyond 10 but only if you feel like it really really adds to the descriptions and extra

12
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,150
images you're able to have for your projects.

13
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,350
So first things first.

14
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,030
We can layout all these different things once we get an idea and we gather all of our project images

15
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,870
together.

16
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,520
I went ahead and did this.

17
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:11,050
I have all of our projects have the three projects and different folders for each one and I need to

18
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,440
figure out I have way more photos than I need to presented.

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,010
5 percent and all of these photos I think it would overwhelm the client.

20
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:24,910
So a lot of times you need to write your project descriptions to know what photos you need to incorporate

21
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,400
and how many you need to go corporate.

22
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,420
So we're going to do that we're going gonna write our project descriptions and once we have our project

23
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,430
descriptions we can do our basic layout and then start popping in those photos and really figuring out

24
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,330
the design and lay outside of things.

25
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,520
We're going to switch gears a little bit away from InDesign.

26
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,300
I'm just going to go to word and I'm creating a little bit of a plan and you can download this as a

27
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:52,150
downloadable resource so you can be able to read these bios and read the the project description so

28
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:57,190
you can get an idea of how I've written mine for Lilian but it can be very different depending on what

29
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,250
kind of work you do if you're an illustrator.

30
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,560
Your descriptions might be a lot shorter if you're a UX UI designer you might have very very long descriptions.

31
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,390
So for Lilian and she's a graphic designer so that's kind of the example I'm using.

32
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:16,390
So this is project one we have of course you need a title and you want to go ahead and just instead

33
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,470
of saying what the project name is.

34
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,380
Go ahead and be a little more descriptive.

35
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,380
So for this it's a branding projects.

36
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,550
So for this case it's elemental logo development brand creation and extension.

37
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,570
So I'm pretty much saying what the company name is and all the major things that I did for them.

38
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,810
And so the headline.

39
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:40,030
So the headline can be anything you feel I can further describe the project in this case I'm using a

40
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:45,460
client test demo testimonial is I feel like that's going to have a little bit of a higher impact when

41
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,770
viewed on that first page that we're going to develop.

42
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,940
So in this case it's working with win.

43
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,790
Lillian it's been a pure joy I thought that was a really great testimonial to use.

44
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,760
So you can see this is the total description.

45
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,100
It's not super long it's not super short either.

46
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:06,430
And so instead of putting the description all on the front page we are going to dole this out and little

47
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,050
small snippets throughout the three pages I'm dedicating to this project.

48
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:17,440
So I have to put the first couple of lines on maybe the first page as an introduction and then as I

49
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,450
describe the project I have different project images I'll go to another page and put a little bit of

50
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:28,990
explanation for each photo so you don't have one big block of text you're kind of slowly letting them

51
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:33,130
read the description as they move through your project.

52
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,900
So after you've spent some time writing your descriptions for each project go ahead do the first project

53
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,780
first so we can see what that looks like so we can start to work on the other projects.

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,160
So this is kind of the first page is obviously going to be your front cover.

55
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,100
It's going to be your splash page it's going to be your hero image.

56
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,220
It may be one image that is your favorite that you feel like really captures your skill set haven't

57
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,860
on the front to sell or could be a collage of just maybe a couple of hand selected images.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,640
We're going to do that after we do the first project.

59
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,420
We're just going to kind of put some place holders are going to put that they are also gonna put a logo

60
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,310
as we start to develop our other project layouts going to be thinking of what that hero image is going

61
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,720
to be for the front what is going to be that big image that feel like it's going to capture the client's

62
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,600
attention to move on and so after we do a couple of pages I think we might start to get ideas for that.

63
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,860
So we're going to come and visit that front page but I have it already planned out already have the

64
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:30,500
first page dedicated to that already have the next three pages dedicated to our client project.

65
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,530
So right now I'm going to continually take a look at some of these layout ideas.

66
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,030
This is a downloadable resource from the last lesson.

67
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,460
There's lots of different ideas here for different ways you can present images.

68
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,720
And so I'm going to take a look at this and see if there's any I feel like we'd be really good for this

69
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,800
particular project.

70
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,250
I'm also going to take a look at my images to see kind of where I can get a little bit of inspiration.

71
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,670
So what I'm thinking for at first I don't I'm not going to put a huge long description in the front

72
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,820
so I don't need a lot of text but I do think kind of having one big hero image to kick off the project

73
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,280
might be good for this particular project because I have a lot of great images.

74
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,210
So perhaps this magazine feature layout might be really good or if I wanted to feature two I can do

75
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,640
this headline feature split or I can have a headline and it and I put our testimonial there but I can

76
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:23,490
also have two images so I can be able to have more control over cropping those images because they're

77
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,210
not taken up the whole page.

78
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,270
So let's take a look at that layout and see if it's going to work.

79
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:34,200
Go to our first one and I already have this layout right here I'm going to switch these pages right

80
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,450
in InDesign.

81
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,990
You can use whatever software you're using but I'm just switching those pages out.

82
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,370
I feel like this might be a really good headline.

83
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:47,340
So just going into word and just copying and pasting my title the headline and I'll be right back

84
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,560
so here's our first page of our first project I decided to feature the logo of the company or the project

85
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,390
instead of just having it in regular type just can add a little bit to the project presentation.

86
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,980
We're going to fine tune graphics and everything later we're just figuring out the basic layout.

87
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:10,690
So we have the ability to do different to different photos or one big photo.

88
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,940
Just depends on which photo we choose for this particular header cover.

89
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:21,210
So for project beginning pages I like to have this Wow photos that really capture the project in its

90
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,170
entirety.

91
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:26,230
You can have multiple photos if you feel like it works just try not to use too many.

92
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:32,400
We also have this quotation for a client testimonial that will want to also incorporate in there as

93
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:32,730
well.

94
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,010
So we need to figure out a place for that.

95
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,960
We can also start to work in some of our project description maybe the first couple of lines but let's

96
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,250
see how the front page looks as we start to put it together.

97
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,770
We still have two other pages or even a fourth one.

98
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,220
If we wanted to dedicate four pages to this project project.

99
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,690
So we need to create it the best way possible.

100
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:58,000
So we just need to be flexible with different layout options and ideas as we start to put this together.

101
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,490
So I'm going to go ahead and open up my project we have several different project images we can use

102
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:08,610
kind of as a well first page image and I already have a few in my mind that I want to kind of pick out.

103
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,000
This is kind of a branding project where the whole idea is to create a package design and a logo design.

104
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,590
So what best to feature an image that has both of those on here.

105
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,710
So that would be this one right here.

106
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,580
It's going to go and drag this in here of course you're gonna have a lot of different projects that

107
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,940
you're going to want to feature.

108
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:29,940
You may be a photographer web designer you're going to be presenting is a little bit differently but

109
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:37,040
the overall idea of creating a layout plan is the same no matter what type of work you do.

110
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,840
So this is when layouts need to be flexible not all the layouts I have in the downloadable resource

111
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,830
so the ones who come up with it first are going to work perfectly so feel free to manipulate and change

112
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,880
everything is needed so throughout this portfolio building process I'm looking at her branding standards

113
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,650
and the brand that she developed for her personal business or her personal freelance business trying

114
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:04,230
to find ways to incorporate the color palette the iconography the background the colors all this can

115
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:09,960
somehow be incorporated into the look of her portfolio so you can see I adapted some of that that blue

116
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,100
light blue greenish color to the portfolio as well.

117
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:20,510
So I'm just thinking about that as I develop these pages so continuing to figure out what looks best

118
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,330
for this first page in terms of our layout plan.

119
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:29,270
And I'm also realizing that I if I want have a description and a title in the name of the project it's

120
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:34,640
starting to get pretty heavy and there's a lot of things going on so there's some things we can do to

121
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,810
improve that.

122
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,970
I can shift this away and kind of start off with the logo design and kind of have that be a little bit

123
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,150
better of a complement.

124
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,930
We don't need the divider bar anymore.

125
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,240
I'm I can also do the quote so right now I'm starting with a description and so maybe since there's

126
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,760
a lot already going on I may decide to not do the description and wait till the second page can move

127
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,400
that off to the side also of work or working quote If this is a real project you could do quotes.

128
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,320
Obviously if it's a personal project you want to start off with a description or maybe a title and make

129
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,780
sure you have personal work somewhere on that first page so clients are not misled and thinking it was

130
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,830
a real client project.

131
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:20,010
You need to be upfront about that doesn't have to be really big it can be a little small text below

132
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,890
the first image that just lets them know it's a personal project.

133
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,630
But for this case we're going to make it a real project just kind of show that example.

134
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,870
So we have the quote and we'll just start a description on the next page.

135
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,930
You got three or four pages to do this.

136
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,340
Lots of room to slowly tell your story so don't feel you have to like it to cram everything on the front

137
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:38,930
page.

138
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,740
You're really just trying to grab their attention.

139
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,660
The product project and then you're ready for that second page.

140
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:50,060
So now we're onto the second page already and we need to figure out a layout plan for this one as well.

141
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,680
Once we have a couple more pages left.

142
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,810
And since we've already written our description we know exactly what images we're going to want to show.

143
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,600
And with the description as well.

144
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,410
So the first thing I talk about is kind of how I sit down and plan with them.

145
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:09,000
So if I have a great brainstorming sitting down at a meeting kind of images kind of like the examples

146
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,150
I'm showing where you kind of showing that process thinking preparing meeting discussing if you can

147
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,990
kind of have an image that really goes well with that description then great.

148
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,130
Let's go ahead find that.
