1
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.830
Client issues happen.

2
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.680
I've had my fair share of client relationship failures and it's not always your fault.

3
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.400
I wanted to spend this lesson being open and honest about working with clients in a freelancing environment.

4
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.130
I wanted you to know that client issues will arise and knowing the best way to handle them can help

5
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.630
prevent the pitfalls.

6
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:31.040
I ran into in my 14 years of freelancing client situation one dear freelancer there's been a couple

7
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.050
of revision round so far and I'm not happy with how things are going.

8
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.820
You're not executing the project in the manner I was hoping and I was wanting a refund.

9
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.370
I'm sorry this isn't working out and I wish you the best.

10
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.550
Man bomber an unhappy client and they don't like my work but hey it happens.

11
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.260
First of all don't panic just because the client did not like your work.

12
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.640
It does not mean you are not right for freelancing in this area.

13
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.640
People are different and sometimes expectations can be mismatched one thing you could do to prevent

14
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.820
mismatched expectations is to be clear in the concept and brainstorming stages of your project so that

15
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.680
clients are never surprised later with a project with creative outcomes.

16
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.880
So how do we handle the situation now that it's already happened.

17
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.220
First of all on our contract did we have a 25 to 50 percent non-refundable deposit.

18
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.670
If so we get to keep that money even if the client's unhappy.

19
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.040
This is why we have contracts that protect ourselves from the situation.

20
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.280
The client knew when they signed the contract that the deposit was non-refundable and we need to kindly

21
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.840
remind the client of this by providing a highlighted statement in the contract.

22
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.060
Of course we can feel we did not live up to expectations and agree with the client.

23
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.620
In that case you can always refund a portion of the money in good faith and this is up to you and I've

24
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.140
done this a few times before.

25
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.620
Unlucky client situation number two.

26
00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.810
Dear freelancer I had a stock photo company email me and say one of their photos used on my website

27
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.480
you made for me is in violation of their copyrights and I need to provide proof that I purchased the

28
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.560
stock photo.

29
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.040
They're asking for twelve hundred dollars if I cannot come with a receipt of purchase oh boy I've been

30
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.170
there and done that.

31
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.520
And this does happen from time to time.

32
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.970
If you're in a creative industry that requires you to purchase photos fonts graphics or resources make

33
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.150
sure you keep track of all your purchases for that client.

34
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.490
In some cases if you charge the client for those resources it's nice to send them a receipt of the purchase

35
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.870
for their records or keep those for yourself in a nice organized folder.

36
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.170
This can go one of two ways either you did legally purchase that photo when creating their Web site

37
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.280
and you have a receipt and before that to the client or you somehow forgot to purchase that photo or

38
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.610
assumed it was already free to use and it wasn't for that second scenario.

39
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.440
And yes this happened to me once I did the right thing and paid the twelve hundred dollars for illegal

40
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.310
use of that photo to that stock photo company.

41
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.910
Ouch.

42
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.860
It sucked big time but it was a big lesson and double checking everything I use for my projects even

43
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.260
if I'm kind of sure it was free to use.

44
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.150
You're not obligated to pay as the client is the one who is on the hook for this problem.

45
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.150
But since it's your fault or issue you're the one who created the website and used the photo.

46
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.270
It's really the right thing to do.

47
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.480
You can prevent all this from happening by understanding the basics of licensing for farms photos and

48
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.310
resources and I have lessons later on in the section that goes over just that.

49
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.910
Another unlucky client situation dear freelancer I'm Bob from the box dudes dot com.

50
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.440
A new online Web site that sells boxes for shipping to larger companies.

51
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.680
We're seeking out freelancers to create a brand for us that will include a logo and all items needed.

52
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.600
We will exchange the work you do for us for exposure with a credit on our Web site.

53
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.200
We may even provide you with a testimonial if the work goes well.

54
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.890
I look forward to hearing from you.

55
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.690
We contacted several freelancers and I hope you're the lucky one who gets this job.

56
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.500
First of all get lost.

57
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.910
Second of all that's a lot of work requested just to get a little line of credit somewhere.

58
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.460
This is called spec work or speculative work and this will be totally unpaid.

59
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.970
And it is not even worth emailing back.

60
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.500
If this was a nonprofit company maybe things will be different.

61
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.720
But since this is a potentially profitable business it's just a company trying to get free services

62
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.500
from desperate freelancers and do not feed into this client situation number four for our next client

63
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.160
situation.

64
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.150
Let's say there's been a client who has requested too many revisions.

65
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.590
They never seem to be able to approve or finalize the project.

66
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.240
You're frustrated and you don't have a formal contract that states have any revision rounds they receive.

67
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.590
So you cannot refer the client to a contract about revision limitations.

68
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.070
Now you have to deal with a situation first of all this is very common.

69
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.670
Clients are people and people are imperfect.

70
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.230
Picky clients can be dealt with but they only know they're a problem if you politely let them know as

71
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.500
early as possible.

72
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:13.280
Dragging the situation on can cause pain and resentment toward the client especially if they're paying

73
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.310
you good money.

74
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.600
It can make you feel trapped.

75
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.210
Do your client I've got your latest round of edits this morning and I wanted to make sure we're on the

76
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.450
same page creatively as there seems to be revisions that can be avoided with some proper discussion.

77
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.890
Let's schedule a phone call so we can reduce the amount of future revisions to this project.

78
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.540
I want to be able to deliver this project in a timely manner so making sure we talk through this will

79
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.980
be imperative to helping me create something for you that you're happy with.

80
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.960
In the end do not try to be a hero and think you can handle this with just email alone.

81
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:53.000
Sometimes it's necessary to have a phone call with a client to clear up any confusion or issues come

82
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.420
to the phone call with a list of questions that can help them clarify their visions or ideas and be

83
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.820
ready to let them know if the ideas are not possible given certain deadlines.

84
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:10.430
Being upfront about what you can deliver is imperative to building that trusting client freelancer relationship

85
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:17.600
client situation number 5 a client ghosts you ghosting or just plain disappearing can happen in some

86
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.890
client situations.

87
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:25.530
It's happened to me once when I did not sign a contract and two it was earlier on in the process.

88
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.200
There could be many reasons why they're not returning your emails or your phone calls.

89
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.300
Some are legitimate.

90
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:37.150
They lost a family member and they drop all work involved without contacting anyone or two they could

91
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:42.070
be unhappy with the situation and decide instead of doing the right thing and communicating this with

92
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.610
you they decide to just disappear hoping you just go away.

93
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:52.390
Are three their business runs out of money and they need to close down operations and quickly cut costs

94
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.730
and they decide to not share this with you.

95
00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.860
It is surprising how often number three happens a lot of clients do not contact you back because they

96
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.540
no longer need your services in the middle of a project and they have no money to pay you for your work

97
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:12.770
so far so ghosting you are disappearing is their way of solving the issue number two and three are just

98
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:13.580
not right.

99
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.800
And I found this out by trying to hunt down clients who have not paid before and realize those were

100
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.230
the situations they were in.

101
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:26.840
First of all this is another reason why having a contract with an upfront non-refundable deposit is

102
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.740
helpful.

103
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:33.920
At least you get to keep some money before they disappeared secondly if you did not have a contract

104
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.520
or it was the project was too small to need one.

105
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.620
You have to admit something to yourself you cannot help the situation.

106
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.550
It happens.

107
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:47.130
You could spend hours tracking these clients down and sending them spiteful emails until they pay.

108
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.060
But there's a good chance they never will at this point.

109
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:56.580
And it's better for you to focus your energy on a new client I have wasted many hours trying to reclaim

110
00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.580
lost money.

111
00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:02.640
If the project is large enough and you've already completed thousands of dollars of work you could hire

112
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.180
a debt collector or sue them in small claims court.

113
00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:11.730
But even those activities end up costing you so much money and time it would only be worth pursuing

114
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.420
for super large contracts.

115
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.560
Are you currently in an awkward client situation and you don't know how to proceed.

116
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.580
Want to share past experiences with other freelancers.

117
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:26.800
Feel free to share these situations in the Facebook group as we walk through this issue together.

118
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:32.450
There is no one client situation that's the same and sometimes we need a little extra advice or encouragement

119
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.500
along the way.

120
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:34.950
So I'll see you there.
