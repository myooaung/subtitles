00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.220
Let's first talk about finding clients online.

2
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.000
There's several popular large freelancer Web sites you can create profiles for and start getting your

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.440
portfolio out there as well as actively bid for client work.

4
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.590
The more well-known of the bunch is up work.

5
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.620
It's a great reputable site for seeking freelance work.

6
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.380
Simply build a profile which we'll do together in the section of the course.

7
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.890
And once you're approved you'll be searchable by thousands of potential clients.

8
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.450
You can also apply to freelancing jobs by submitting proposals which will include specific things the

9
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:44.280
client requests like certain portfolio types and pieces a written cover letter or other types of requests.

10
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.240
This platform like many others listed here are oversaturated with current freelancers.

11
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.840
So just be aware it's still worth the effort.

12
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.170
Building a profile here.

13
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.690
But there's heavy competition and all make finding those first few clients a bit tough.

14
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.150
Sometimes lowering your hourly rate for the first two project is necessary to start building that social

15
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.710
proof which we'll talk about when we build that profile together here shortly.

16
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.590
People per hour is similar to upper.

17
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.630
And the fact that you create a profile and you're able to not only seek out jobs by sending proposals

18
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.030
but clients can find your profile listed on the Web site too.

19
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.870
Three things that make people per hour a bit different than up work.

20
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.150
First of all there's less competition on people per hour as it's a newer platform.

21
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.150
Second they offer the ability to have a portfolio type profile which contains more photos than the upward

22
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.040
profiles.

23
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.340
And lastly they have something called offers offers give you the ability to post an offer that will

24
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.230
be seen on the Web site for potential clients to see.

25
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.680
This can be anything from I can build a five page WordPress Web site to I can create a social media

26
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.640
post in less than 24 hours.

27
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.300
If you're familiar with fiber it's a very similar concept.

28
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.620
And speaking of fiber freelancers either hate our love fiber but most freelancers have not found huge

29
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.880
success on fiber.

30
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.570
Although a small percentage still do this site with an insane amount of competition gives you the ability

31
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.780
to post a gig on their Web site allowing others to purchase your offer and add add ons these add ons

32
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.850
can increase the total price you receive as a freelancer and these add ons can be things like decreasing

33
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.920
the time and delivering the project.

34
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.890
Or it could be sending extra file types not all projects are priced at five dollars although that is

35
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.740
the standard rate.

36
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.270
There is something called fiber pro that requires you to apply to get accepted as a vendor.

37
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.850
If you have a great portfolio and some experience there might be a good chance of being accepted there.

38
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.350
Fiber pro gives freelancers the ability to charge much higher prices and have access to different networks

39
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.210
of people.

40
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.220
Some gigs can exceed 2000 dollars.

41
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.460
The key hurdle here is getting accepted into their program.

42
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.760
But since you have a great portfolio and personal brand it's worth a try the next thing I want to talk

43
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.060
about is trying free are spec work spec work or speculative work is working on a project before getting

44
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.620
paid if at all.

45
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.480
And it's one way to improve and fill your portfolio with real client projects.

46
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.030
I highly encourage you to seek out spec work that is non-profit based so you can help others in need

47
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.670
but also build your portfolio spec work should only be done for fun and for practice.

48
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.640
I encourage my students to pursue spec work only if the project will be enjoyable and fulfilling and

49
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.400
could be added to your portfolio in a positive way.

50
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:45.240
Are open up new connections for you spec work on online Web sites like the examples here don't encourage

51
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.120
building client relationships.

52
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:56.040
So I would proceed with caution unless once again this is a purely fun exercise for you pro bono work.

53
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.000
Who says working for free has to be unfulfilling.

54
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.670
There's several places to volunteer your services to clients in the nonprofit space.

55
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.810
There's even a Web site called Catch a Fire dot org that lists nonprofit companies needing work in a

56
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.520
wide variety of fields.

57
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.820
This is great for getting your foot in the door at several smaller or even larger nonprofit companies.

58
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.490
There's also the possibility that your free services you offer them could turn into paid if they really

59
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.900
enjoyed your project work.

60
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.290
Are they possibly get funding for more projects.

61
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.150
It's a gamble but also a great way for a client testimonials.

62
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.770
Social proof reviews and getting experience working on projects that you would normally not get the

63
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.530
chance to and now it's time to talk about social media and networking.

64
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.850
A big part of finding clients online is networking and it's just as valuable as networking off line.

65
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.190
There are several professional networking sites who want to be on as a freelancer who's wanting to expand

66
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.590
those connections.

67
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.870
The obvious first choice is LinkedIn scum connect with anyone in your current network.

68
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.970
The great thing about LinkedIn is being able to see and connect with your connections connections.

69
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.190
There's also the ability to private message connections as well for a more knocking on the door approach

70
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.640
to selling yourself.

71
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.120
Not everyone feels comfortable doing that but with a common connection and might seem a bit easier and

72
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.060
a more natural way to introduce yourself.

73
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.530
Do not underestimate the power of networking and Facebook groups.

74
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.450
The key here is finding the right group to connect with.

75
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.840
If you're a wedding photographer it's great to connect with other wedding photographers in a group.

76
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.850
But for finding client work perhaps going where your target audience hangs out in this case a wedding

77
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:46.260
planning group or a group for wedding planners might be a good choice graphic.

78
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.600
Are Web designers might want to hang out in a small business group full of small business owners naming

79
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.720
branding or marketing web site design work.

80
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.170
A tip here is to make sure not to post a generic post when first joining the group.

81
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:04.900
You need to spend some time investing in the group in the community helping others out before even thinking

82
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.930
about telling others about your services.

83
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:14.440
I personally run a large Facebook group myself and those who post their services right away when joining

84
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.670
raise a big red flag with me.

85
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.290
But after they participate in the group for a little while I start to allow them to mention their services

86
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.610
every once in a while.

87
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.710
As long as it doesn't seem a little spammy share your expertise.

88
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.890
There are several social media sites where you can start to share your knowledge and expertise with

89
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:32.880
the world.

90
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.420
You can live stream on YouTube or post helpful videos.

91
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:42.360
You can live stream on Facebook and even start your own Facebook group that will attract those who seek

92
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.680
your skill set.

93
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.730
Remember when posting on social media to include those relevant hashtags.

94
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:53.100
Those hashtags are searchable on platforms and make it easier for your target audience to locate you.

95
00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:00.450
For example if you're a calligrapher who does custom stationery designs why not host a calligraphy style

96
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:06.630
livestream that shows off different calligraphy lettering styles or if you're a UX UI designer and you

97
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:12.590
host a free webinar to small business owners looking for tips and tricks to building that great e-commerce

98
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.640
Web site.

99
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:20.010
There are so many ways to put yourself out there through the use of helpful posts videos live streams

100
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:27.160
and articles this naturally leads to the next idea become an online guru in your skill set.

101
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.940
A lot of creative freelancers are scared to put themselves out there mostly because they feel like they're

102
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.630
not top talent.

103
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.840
I still think there's a lot of opportunities with those with just intermediate skills especially in

104
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.780
those top demand skill sets like web design.

105
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:47.240
Not only can this help you find client work through speaking and networking opportunities but will also

106
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.760
help you land clients by having some of those helpful videos articles that you've written on your blog

107
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.380
and on your portfolio Web site.
