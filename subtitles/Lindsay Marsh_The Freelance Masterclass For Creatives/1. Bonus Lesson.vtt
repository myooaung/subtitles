00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.200
take next, I get this question a lot from students, and I wanted to write you a quick guide, an overview

3
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.100
of the other great classes I offer at any time.

7
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.070

8
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.320
First of all, I offer a few different categories of classes and some at different skill levels.

9
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.040
If you're interested in beginner level courses, the graphic design master class learn great design

10
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.550
is a great, well-rounded course for reviewing graphic design, including graphic design theory, practical

11
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.420
projects and beginner level software training.

12
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.040
This teaches the Adobe Design software.

13
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.330
There is a second intermediate level part to the graphic design master class series called the Graphic

14
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
Design Master Class Intermediate the next level.

15
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.660
And the next level, it truly is, as we talk more about intermediate design topics and projects not

16
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.300
covered in the first master class, like infographics, advertising and poster design, and includes

17
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.660

18
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.240
isometric grids and so much more.

19
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.330
And taking the first beginner level master class is not required to enjoy this intermediate level course.

20
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.120
Just having a basic prior working knowledge of the Adobe Design software is suggested.

21
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.480
Not interested in learning the Adobe Design software, I also teach a design class that teaches all

22
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.330
