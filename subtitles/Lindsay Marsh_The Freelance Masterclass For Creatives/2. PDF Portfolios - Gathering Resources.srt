00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,440
There are many ways to present your projects and having the right photos can make or break your portfolio.

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,710
We'll be creating our PDL version of our portfolio using Adobe InDesign but you can use any program

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,730
where you can work with multiple page documents Believe it or not you can even build a strong portfolio

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:25,230
with Microsoft Word The first step in creating our PDA portfolio or any type of portfolio is organizing

5
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,090
and creating our project images and writing your project descriptions.

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,600
This may differ depending on what industry or type of freelance services you will offer.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,170
We went super polished high resolution photos that can best represent our various projects to show off

8
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,150
to our potential clients.

9
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:47,190
If you're a photographer then making sure each photo is presented in its final edited format has the

10
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,600
right color correction in his cropped for high impact viewing let's say you're a UX UI designer.

11
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,070
Perhaps taking some great screenshots of your final Web site layouts or designs or mockups you can start

12
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,250
to think about best ways to display or tell your uniques our UI design process through a series of photos

13
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,560
that document your whole process.

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,750
You also want to think about writing your process in a short easy to digest paragraphs that pair well

15
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,670
with a particular photos you choose let's say you're a graphic designer.

16
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,830
You can apply your final designs onto polished mockups.

17
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,050
You can find plenty of great Photoshop mockups and graphic Burger dot com.

18
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:32,390
You can even create your own custom mockups using a program called Adobe dimensions using stock 3D models

19
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,330
or importing your own also.

20
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,140
Think about writing up brief statements about your projects who the client was so you can give client

21
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,590
proper credits and make sure you note which projects are personal projects if their personal projects

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,390
make sure you include a small line underneath the main project title that says personal work so clients

23
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,920
know it's not paid work.

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,320
We never want to mislead anyone illustrators.

25
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,140
You can start to take photos of your work if it's not currently in digital format.

26
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,540
You also apply your patterns to mockups as well to make simple pattern projects come to life.

27
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,430
You can include stills of your process at work.

28
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,780
You can even stage the creation of an illustration to take snapshots of your drawing process.

29
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:21,050
If you're a digital illustrator for example these little shots add a little value to your static projects.

30
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:28,680
They also add a little bit of character and makes the project feel more real relevant and professional.

31
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,110
All photos should be high resolution.

32
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,060
If they're not then try to obtain photos of your projects that are nothing should be blurry when printed

33
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,620
or viewed as a digital PDA.

34
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,740
On your final portfolio written copy should be written in your style somewhere in some of the things

35
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,250
you've developed in the goal section of the course.

36
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,900
Also get that bio you have written ready we'll be placing your bio in a bit about yourself in the first

37
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,310
three pages of the portfolio doesn't have to always be on the first page.

38
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,570
Lastly grab a great professional headshot of yourself.

39
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,560
We'll be needing this for our online Web site and when we build profiles on other freelancing Web sites

40
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:12,250
your headshot should be crisp clean with great lighting and also have nice background settings headshots

41
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,840
need to be properly cropped with your face being the main focal point.

42
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,780
Some profile photos can include computers or other equipment necessary for your craft.

43
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,970
This is a great way to add a little authenticity to your photos.

44
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,350
If you know of an affordable professional photographer it would not be a bad idea to have them do a

45
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:33,160
small photo shoot to gather some of these professional personal photos and headshots.

46
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,410
Now that we gathered everything together let's talk about strong PDA.

47
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,380
Portfolio building basics.

48
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,740
You can download this downloadable resource to read along as I go through this lesson.

49
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,700
Try to keep your portfolio short and manageable.

50
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,580
Keep it between three to 10 pages of possible.

51
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,030
You have to continue to capture the viewer as portfolios that are too long will cause viewer fatigue

52
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,870
create a cover page that wows feature your favorite project on the front cover along with your name

53
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:09,680
logo title contact information and create a highlight gallery to highlight multiple projects.

54
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,630
If you feel like that can tell a better story to the viewer.

55
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:19,130
CRAFT AND TELL YOUR STORY Well you want to show more than just static portfolio project photos.

56
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:25,350
You'll want to dedicate at least a half of a page to including a short bio photo if desired and maybe

57
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,570
a mission statement headline or sentence that explains your unique approach process style visions or

58
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,790
goals you can present this in the first three pages of your portfolio.

59
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:41,380
Or you can sprinkle a bit about yourself throughout the entire PDA and small snippets between projects

60
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,840
so do I do horizontal or vertical presentations.

61
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:52,820
Well either way works for PDX that are printed off by your clients or you portrait or vertical orientation

62
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:59,070
tends to work a little bit better do not overwhelm with too many photos or text.

63
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,830
This is easier said than done.

64
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,960
Sometimes the effectiveness of one to three well-chosen photos can outweigh the effect of a big gallery

65
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,510
page that may contain over 10 photos.

66
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,820
Remember to balance out your photos project descriptions and testimonials.

67
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,690
You will have several pages to display all this information.

68
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,120
Feel free to adopt that storytelling narrative approach and show bits and pieces and very planned ways.

69
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,700
Create a rough layout for your entire portfolio before adding final photos and text is really helps

70
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,810
if you create a plan for your portfolio.

71
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:36,030
Once you sketch this out you'll know how many photos you may need or need to create for each project.

72
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,950
You'll also know the amount of text base you're dedicating to a particular project or space and how

73
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:47,020
many client testimonials you may need to capture switch up your page layouts.

74
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,390
This leads to the next tip as the viewer moves through your pages.

75
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:54,170
Sometimes it's nice to switch up the layout to keep things interesting.

76
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:58,230
Try not to use the same presentation or layout for each one of your projects.

77
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,520
Doing this may start to make your portfolio look stale.

78
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,260
Each project will have its own layout that will work best for its style and the photos that you have

79
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,590
would do this all the time when building Web sites.

80
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,720
Why not have a layout plan for our PDA portfolios.

81
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,480
We're gonna do that right now.

82
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:21,990
Together in adobe in design and design is a great multiple page layout program perfect for magazine

83
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:28,320
layout design and of course creating that PDA portfolio you can use any multiple page layout project

84
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:35,460
or program you would like Adobe Illustrator has the arbor tool which allows you to create multiple pages

85
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,100
and export them as one PDA file.

86
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,980
If you feel more comfortable using Adobe Illustrator even Champa That online cloud based design tool

87
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:49,800
I've talked about prior has the ability to build documents with multiple pages including our online

88
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:56,650
or print PDA portfolio we're going to first focus on creating our rough page layouts.

89
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,400
There are many different layout options and ideas.

90
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,850
I included a handful in that downloadable resource for you to take a look.

91
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:08,740
As we start to sketch out our rough layout or our PDA portfolio I'm going to use this as a guide in

92
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,280
the next lesson to make some of these page layouts a reality with our chosen project photos for our

93
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,320
graphic designer.

94
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,130
Example Lillian Hernandez.
