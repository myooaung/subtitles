00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.840
We're going to be doing that and Canada which is something I've already kind of introduced you to a

2
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.780
little bit earlier in the classes just easy to kind of whip things together very quickly.

3
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.050
So I uploaded all my assets into a folder on camera and I'm going to go ahead and dive right in and

4
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.730
we're going to create our business card.

5
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.750
So Canada has some really great potential templates you can use.

6
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.480
I am a fan of using templates whatever it gives you a headstart on your design or layout.

7
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.960
I'm not afraid of taking a template and making it my own.

8
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.870
So I'm going to scroll through these and there's a lot of different ways to do an effective letterhead

9
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.400
it depends on how you're going to use the letterhead.

10
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.000
There's a lot of ways freelancers use letterhead.

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.280
Some of them put their proposals on them.

12
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.170
Some of them write personal thank you letters to clients.

13
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.840
You may think a letterhead might not be super important to you right now but it's really nice to have

14
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.110
one on hand especially when you do legal stuff and tax stuff.

15
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.920
Sometimes if you send an official letterhead to a business or to a government agency to do something

16
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.860
it looks a lot better and sometimes for certain official documents they require you to send letters

17
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.230
with some kind of official business letterhead.

18
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.400
So that's important to do.

19
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.330
Don't write these off.

20
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.760
Same thing with business cards.

21
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.270
I don't think they're too old school.

22
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.430
Not everything has to be digital.

23
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.400
And so go ahead and dive in here.

24
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.320
There's a lot of different letterheads like let's say this template.

25
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.780
This looks like it's got all sorts of stuff on it which might be interesting but it depends on the length

26
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.610
of your letter.

27
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.790
And you never know how much letter you're going to need to write.

28
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.880
So I like to focus more on space for the actual letter and a little a little bit less on all the graphics.

29
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.860
I'd like to have my logo and my name and contact information and you can have a little element in the

30
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.200
background but nothing may be quite as big as this one maybe something more along the lines of this

31
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.090
over here.

32
00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:00.150
So I got to scroll through here and find one that I think will work.

33
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.540
I did find one I'm already starting to modify this a little bit.

34
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.710
What I like to do is make sure I can put a long letter there.

35
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.730
So if I can scroll this down and fit even more.

36
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.560
That would be lovely and it looks like I'll be able to say I'm going to fill that in with my own contact

37
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.540
information.

38
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.690
I'm just trying to think what would be a brand consistency because we're really talking about branding

39
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.460
here a little bit less about design.

40
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.940
How can we kind of brand this to make it look consistent and we can do our little tagline if we want

41
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.820
to take our tagline from our business card that we just created we could do the tag line somewhere in

42
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.050
there but the focus really is on your name and contact information and Web site.

43
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.980
This is not always a marketing piece.

44
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.690
This is sometimes more of an official business document piece and we want to keep it very very simple

45
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.100
very very clean.

46
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.910
So maybe less of that extra stuff that we've put on the business card.

47
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.420
So I'm going to continue to work on this layout a little bit the same way we did with the business cards

48
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.270
trying to find ways to incorporate that brand a little bit more in here.

49
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.990
Remember the colors that we developed a little bit earlier in our branding standards manual.

50
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.060
This is where those hex codes are really to come in handy if I want to bring that into any kind of online

51
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.250
editing program.

52
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:21.380
I can go ahead and pop or paste those hex codes in and we can go in and bring in those exact colors

53
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.840
she's always very helpful to get the right grades the right secondary colors

54
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.660
and this is where having multiple versions of your logo really comes in handy because there might be

55
00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.380
a situation where a different color might work a little bit better than what we have as a default.

56
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.950
And she can always have those to test them out.

57
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.340
I'm a big fan of watermarks.

58
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.280
I think they look really good on letterheads and they don't interfere with the text too much.

59
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.630
So I'm just going to be creating that right now.

60
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.240
Of course you want to make sure you reduce the transparency or the color to a very light gray.

61
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.250
You don't want it to interfere with any text.

62
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.870
It'll ruin the whole efficiency of the letterhead.

63
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.640
So just kind of reduce it where you think would be a good level.

64
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.820
You can always do a test print in your home printer or an office printer and find out what you think

65
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.270
what level would look good and also doesn't have to be in the center could be on the left or right.

66
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.040
Get a little pop a name there.

67
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.810
That's entirely up to you.

68
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.460
So there we go.

69
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.830
A very very very very simple letterhead nothing that's going to win any design awards but I think it

70
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.190
is effective and definitely consistent with our brand.

71
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.780
We have a finished logo a branding manual brand assets a rough layout for an ad or business card letterhead.

72
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.140
We also have some several ideas for other items we can create.

73
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.890
We are ready for the next critical step into the Going freelance process.

74
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.420
This is probably one of the most important things we're going to cover.

75
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.360
And that's to craft your portfolio to land clients.
