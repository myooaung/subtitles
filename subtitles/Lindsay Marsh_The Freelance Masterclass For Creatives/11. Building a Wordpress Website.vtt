00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.970
So let's talk about WordPress.

2
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.400
Probably the most powerful flexible option you have in terms of building your own freelance Web site.

3
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.130
So there's a lot of different templates you can use that are free that are already installed.

4
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.960
When you have WordPress WordPress does require a hosting plan and then need to install Wordpress on

5
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.590
your hosting plan and it can link up your domain name on your hosting plan to have a formal domain name.

6
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.190
So after you have installed WordPress as is kind of the basic dashboard I'm not going to be going through

7
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.650
how to use WordPress which is kind of showing you through the template process to try to find a layout

8
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.230
or a template that would work best for your freelancer Web site.

9
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.190
So first of all let's talk about the free default themes.

10
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.500
Search is going to go to appearance and themes and check those out.

11
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.450
It's amazing what you can do with what they already have for you for free.

12
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.880
And it's going to depend on what you want to focus on first and what industry you're in where they want

13
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.400
to lead with a photo where they want to lead with a video or whether you want to lead with type or a

14
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.720
headline.

15
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.600
You can preview these at anytime and go ahead and do a live preview to see how it works or if you can

16
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.650
customize these pretty heavily if you know coding or CSX.

17
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:24.400
But even out of the box these things are pretty customizable could even change the menu system very

18
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.740
easily they've just recently updated Wordpress and they've continuing to change the desktop.

19
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.500
So are the dashboard so you might see a lot of some differences for when you're looking at it but it's

20
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.710
overall pretty much the same you can go ahead does activate that theme and then you can customize.

21
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.950
So let's say we won't go ahead and activate this when go down to customize and that's how you can go

22
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.040
in and do some of the theme options edit the menus

23
00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.280
and then you can go down to the editor which is going to be a little bit more advanced.

24
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.180
So if you know any kind of coding or if this is what you do for a living this is where you're going

25
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.390
to be going to edit all sorts of template files and CSX files and BHP files.

26
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.620
So if you're kind of the advance user and go to theme editor editor and really have a little bit of

27
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.530
fun with this but if not you go to customize and then you can do your themes that way.

28
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.920
So these are all default themes you know they're not going to be for everybody not going to be nice.

29
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.500
This one's not necessarily great for a portfolio it's great for a regular business that may have products.

30
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.580
So let's see if we can't find a few free or premium WordPress templates that I think would work really

31
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.560
good with the type of layouts you want.

32
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.500
So I'm going to take my layout guide here I have the has some different Web site layout ideas I can

33
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.180
find a theme that I think matches really well for each one of those layouts and I'm going to have that

34
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.570
as a another downloadable resource in this lesson.

35
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.730
So you can get some ideas of what wordpress themes would match really good with those layouts.

36
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.390
Of course you can add in what's called plugins.

37
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.660
These are extra little plugins you can add to a wordpress site.

38
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.110
It could be social media that you're adding onto your Web site.

39
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.460
It could be SEO or adding some search stuff onto your Web site.

40
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.500
You can actually search free plug ins on a lot of different places and you can download those to add

41
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.830
additional functionality to your Web site.

42
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.850
And this is the big power and benefit to WordPress is it takes there's a learning curve and learning

43
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.010
or what's a plug in and what the theme and how do I get started with all that.

44
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.780
But once you understand plug ins and themes you've really understood all a big part of WordPress and

45
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.110
how it works.

46
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.920
So there's a great SEO plugin that you can download to be able to add SEO and be able to be searchable.

47
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.700
These are things that are may not always be in square space of course they have some of that built in.

48
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.400
But the great thing about WordPress is you have complete control over this.

49
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.760
You can have 30 plug ins that all help drive your Web site and drive customers to a Web site or clients.

50
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.750
So you don't have maximum customer ability there.

51
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.270
So we're gonna look for some website templates or WordPress templates.

52
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.170
We're gonna go to one of my favorite places to go which is the creative market dot.com.

53
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.020
And they have a lot of great not only photos and graphics but they also have wordpress themes right

54
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:22.060
here you can also get plugins as well of their specific plugins you're looking for which is basically

55
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.620
additional functionalities you're adding to Web site is what a plugin is.

56
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.450
So let's go ahead and find these are different ideas so there's a business blog commerce non-profit

57
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.100
minimal.

58
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.060
We want to do portfolio for our particular ones are going to click on the portfolio ones where you can

59
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.630
order these by popularity.

60
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.530
But I'd like to order them on hand-picked is pretty good because they're curated.

61
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.450
Let's go go through these and I have already make sure you download that resource I have already picked

62
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.210
out several.

63
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.140
I've done a couple of hours of research on templates I've used several of these for client projects

64
00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.880
when I did web design for client work and they're really flexible and pretty solid options and they're

65
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.380
pretty affordable some of them are early twenty five dollars some are about 60 some of the high end

66
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.020
ones could be a couple hundred dollars but I don't think you need to really spend all that much to get

67
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.640
a really good solid template.

68
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.920
I mean if you have one that's five dollars right here and it's got kind of a lot of functionality built

69
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.910
in there you go ahead and preview this five dollars that's not much for a Web site is it.

70
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.440
So let's go ahead and click on it and see what this looks like.

71
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.960
This is great for portfolio if this is the style that you want to could change your background image

72
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:40.490
you can have a full screen video when they go on the web page always look at the reviews I like I don't

73
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:46.610
buy anything under four stars doesn't matter how cheap it is if it's under four stars I'm very weary

74
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.440
of it.

75
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.910
So this looks like a really nice modern clean design at sixty dollars so let's go ahead and look at

76
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.560
the live preview.

77
00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.110
This is very simplistic I even liked a little touches that it has that my arrow icon has turned into

78
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.860
a little icon there it's really nice really nice touch

79
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:14.790
this is be great for a photographer very very simple and some of the simple ones are great because they're

80
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.120
gonna be really easy to edit.

81
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:21.210
Some of these more complex template sites they're overwhelming when you're still learning how to do

82
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.850
WordPress if you're new to WordPress.

83
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:28.290
So sometimes it's more simplistic ones work really well because they don't have a lot of working parts

84
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.600
to them and they're not confusing to edit.

85
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.190
So let's take a look at this one this one's a little more affordable at twenty four dollars.

86
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:41.620
Let's take a look at this very simplistic clean.

87
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.310
I'm sure you can change that column width and the photo size for those.

88
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.570
These are all pop up videos.

89
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:58.420
They're very simple but I would almost be willing to work with a free template if it's going to be quite

90
00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.640
this basic.

91
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:06.220
So let's try to find some free templates just so I can show you how to find those to the best place

92
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.710
to go for that as WordPress dot org.

93
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.540
It's the non-profit organization that covers WordPress.

94
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.990
So anything with a dot org is non-profit.

95
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:20.260
They're not trying to make money they're non-profit open source company so you can trust anything that

96
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.750
WordPress dot org puts out.

97
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.850
These are all free.

98
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:25.540
Let's take a look.

99
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.990
Of course the quality goes down a little bit when you're looking at free.

100
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:34.060
But if you've kind of spent some time adding a plug in or working with the layout a little bit you could

101
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:40.010
probably get this to where you needed to be in this Neptune looks pretty good.

102
00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:49.270
So you can just download it and you would just go and install it you would go to appearance themes once

103
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:54.940
you download that zip file and you click up here to add new and you'll be able to upload your theme

104
00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000
right here and then you'll be able to select it on the bottom so please check out those recommendations

105
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.400
of course you can look on your own to find what you think would work best for your portfolio.

106
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:12.620
But just wanted to take a 10 minutes or so to talk about WordPress as it's the most flexible option

107
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:18.740
takes a little bit more time to get set up and learn but it's the most flexible option you have available.
