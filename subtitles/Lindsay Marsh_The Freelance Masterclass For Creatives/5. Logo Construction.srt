00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:12,620
Mean Adobe Illustrator right now and I'm going to vector rises asset and this is for those who are designers

2
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,330
who are already comfortable with Adobe Illustrator and you want to be able to vector rise your idea

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,500
or your rough sketch to go ahead and start to begin.

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,820
And I'm not going to get into too many details because then I'll start to be teaching a design class

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,420
I'm not a freelance class thing to show you a little time lapse of all the steps it took to kind of

6
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:35,300
make this a reality and make it our finished logo of course we haven't applied our color palette yet

7
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:43,110
we're gonna be doing that next a little trick when you vector ize your sketch or you make it kind of

8
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,840
a real vector logo object.

9
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,650
I'd like to bring in my rough sketch it could be a j peg PMG you can export it from anything you can

10
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,960
take a picture with your phone if you sketch it on a traditional paper or pen and paper and you can

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,090
bring it in and I'd like to put it on its own layer and I also like to reduce the transparency a little

12
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,640
bit so that when I do start to sketch with it or sketch on top of it it doesn't try to get in the way

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,920
when I sketch on top so I'm going to reduce the transparency to go and lock that layer so I don't accidentally

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,930
move it I'm creating a new layer to go ahead and victories everything so I get to recreate everything

15
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,760
you circles shapes the pen tool to draw and put the type on here as well

16
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:38,120
fonts are typefaces can make or break your logo for example notice these two logos using different typefaces

17
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:44,660
one is a boulder sans serif while the other one has lighter strokes and thinner lines and has syrups

18
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:51,620
there's little details at the ends of the letters it's amazing how just a small font change and a logo

19
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:58,250
changes its mood and style the serif typeface looks more high end and elegant why the boulder type choice

20
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:04,730
is more approachable and modern I have included a downloadable resource called the font styles guide

21
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:10,970
and I'll go over some great font type or font choices for certain styles you want to set for example

22
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:16,610
if you're looking for an approachable typeface that cater caters to a younger clientele perhaps a few

23
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:23,220
of these font choices my work just some small suggestions out there as there are thousands upon thousands

24
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,940
of fans to choose from Google fans is a great place to find free open source fonts.

25
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,900
We'll talk about photo and font licensing a little bit later in the course but just make sure you have

26
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,390
the proper license for font usage which will be for commercial use as you're using it for a personal

27
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,380
small business as another quick reminder.

28
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,700
All of the links software and external resources I mentioned in the class will be listed in the resource

29
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:54,700
guide that is accessible in the beginning of the Course as a downloadable Word doc and PD F so some

30
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,930
suggestions for you with the font styles guide.

31
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,730
But you'll know when you come across the right font for your personal brand.

32
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:06,650
Some personal brands with taglines will want or need to use two different types of fonts.

33
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,090
How do you know which two fonts pair well together.

34
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:15,580
I've included another resource called the font pairing guide which gives you some debt general direction

35
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:23,530
on pairing two different typefaces or fonts together in one logo and a few tips while you create your

36
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:30,580
personal brand and make sure that your font choice is very readable and it's very easy for small text

37
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,720
to get lost.

38
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,680
And remember your logo may have to be seen at small sizes on invoices.

39
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,320
So make sure everything is readable at those small sizes.

40
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,530
Try not to use too many font types.

41
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,800
Try to keep it to two to three font choices at a maximum.

42
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,750
Too many will overwhelm and it could look a little unprofessional in some cases.

43
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,060
Back when you're sketching out your logo make sure you plan out your logo layout.

44
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,920
Do you want to include an established date.

45
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,450
Do you have a tag line.

46
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,380
If so what's it going to be.

47
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,140
Do you want your title listed your full name including your middle name or just your first and last

48
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,800
name.

49
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,780
The more you include the more other logo types might work best for you.

50
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:16,070
For example a seal logo might work best for a freelancer for example whose including three different

51
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,900
phrases in your main logo.

52
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:24,720
Like our example of Lilian Hernandez you need to think about the logos flexibility can it be seen very

53
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,130
small but cannot look good and just one color.

54
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,900
How does it look printed out now that you have a good bases of your basic logo design.

55
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:41,110
Now we're to do some brand extension and take that logo design and put it on all sorts of items and

56
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,840
really create an amazing brand presentation.
