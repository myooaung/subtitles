00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,010
Finding clients online is not for everyone but my personal freelance story started with a few clients

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,190
I found through networking offline.

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,850
Some of these suggested avenues for finding clients offline take a bit of entrepreneurial spirit and

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,660
perhaps a boost of confidence being around others and talking about your skill sets.

5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,700
We've already crafted a business card a Web site or personal portfolio.

6
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,620
We defined our target audience and we've written our bios and stories and we have everything we need

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:38,680
to pursue clients and network off line making local connections at last.

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,860
My favorite and most recommended step in finding clients is connecting with local small or medium sized

9
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,030
business owners.

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,640
You could do this online by finding local Facebook business groups you can do this in person by connecting

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,920
with your Chamber of Commerce our local small business body group or gathering serving on the board

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,560
of directors and volunteering for a local nonprofit to make connections as well.

13
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:07,380
Asking to speak or teach at a local small business seminar or workshop etc. about marketing branding

14
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:14,790
design is another way to get your foot in the door it may sound a little old school but visiting local

15
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,040
businesses with a business card in hand can help land you those first few clients great clients tend

16
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,230
to refer you to other clients and local ones tend to do that a little bit more because of that personal

17
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,210
relationship.

18
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,450
You tend to build with them one thing you could do is volunteering your services.

19
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,740
Consider the list below for possible local entities that you could use your services at either a low

20
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,050
cost are free to get your foot in the door clearly communicate with them.

21
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:47,720
If you do volunteer your services what you may require in exchange for your free work or low cost work.

22
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:54,100
It could be either a testimonial a client referral or possibly to half future paid work.

23
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:59,840
This does not have to be free services sometimes contacting a local school for example and letting them

24
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,300
know you're giving them a nonprofit discount by cutting your rates by a third can help also motivate

25
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,090
them to contact you.

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,590
You can find phone numbers and emails to administrators of the following below by visiting their Web

27
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:19,220
sites preferably email someone who would be making those marketing decisions like a marketing coordinator

28
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,470
a principal or a manager in the finding clients guide.

29
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:29,750
I have a little sample of an email you can write to an administrator or a marketing coordinator of one

30
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,250
of those local groups.

31
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,020
It might help you get started in that course customize it to your needs.

32
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:43,340
Connecting with other freelancers so connecting with other freelancers is a great idea but not for the

33
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,690
reason you might think.

34
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,310
Being with other freelancers is a healthy thing to do to network and get out of the House and to share

35
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,600
your experiences.

36
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:57,100
But a big benefit to connecting with certain freelancers is to share and swap clients let's say you're

37
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,000
a visual designer who specializes in web design and graphic design.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,360
You're not very comfortable coding but can turn any rough idea into something pretty good looking.

39
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,230
One thing you can do is seek out freelancers who have excellent coding and web development background

40
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,510
but they don't have a strong visual design background with the two of you now connected.

41
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:22,330
You can share client work and give the client not only the visual side but that back inside as well

42
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,330
and solid coding ideas.

43
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:30,760
Early on I was able to find through a client's connection a local programmer who sent me several clients

44
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,110
of his clients.

45
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:38,410
I did the web design and they did the back end coding and adapted it to a a or a content management

46
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:44,110
system like WordPress another example of this in action is if you're an illustrator.

47
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,880
How about finding and teaming up with the t shirt designer.

48
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,980
They're bound to need more custom hand drawn illustrations for their T-shirts.

49
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,360
And if you're a photographer teaming up with another event planner can help you land feature wedding

50
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,890
photography gigs if that's your style.

51
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:04,070
If you're a copywriter and editor there are many freelancers that need your skills like editorial designers

52
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:12,510
web designers and anyone who works with written type or copy you can find people off line or online.

53
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:17,830
The great thing about connecting with someone locally is finding and serving local clients together

54
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,470
and being able to meet face to face to discuss plans and start building that long term relationship

55
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,970
that leads to referrals.
