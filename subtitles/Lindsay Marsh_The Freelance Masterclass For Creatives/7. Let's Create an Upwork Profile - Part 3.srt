1
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,310
So let's take a look at another person here in this industry.

2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,800
Let's take a look at Jack El.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,590
He's also top rated so has a similar profile to the ones that we've written for Lillian.

4
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,590
And our first person that we studied so hi my name is Jack Larson.

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,310
I'm a web designer and front end developer based in Salt Lake City Utah.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,820
So right away he's saying what he does.

7
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,770
I have been creating unique web sites for clients for over four years now.

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,990
I already know a lot about him.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,750
He's has four years of experience creating Web sites.

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,000
Each of the Web sites I design and build are designed to capture a specific audience attention and keep

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,740
them engaged.

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,680
So he's talking about his unique style.

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,170
He designs Web sites that capture audiences attention and keeps them engaged.

14
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,780
So I already know so much about him in that first paragraph.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:56,500
So this is what he can do I could build your Web site and custom HDR e-mails CSX and javascript if needed

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,250
I'm happy to build your web site using any content management system or web builder.

17
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,290
So he's really getting specific about certain technologies that clients might be looking for.

18
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:05,980
So that's it.

19
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,220
It's not super long.

20
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:11,080
And here's his kind of call to action let me know if you have any questions I'm happy to help.

21
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:17,260
So it's kind of a giving asking the person who's viewing it to contact them or reach out.

22
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,280
It's that natural call to action.

23
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,690
So they'd learn earn quite a bit on the platform.

24
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,180
So this profile has served them very well.

25
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,620
So let's study one more because I really want to make sure our profiles perfect since those are one

26
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,480
of the few things that can land us jobs at this point is our headshot our title and our profile we don't

27
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,280
have any prior work experience on the platform so we're going to have to have a really stellar profile

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,780
that impresses.

29
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,590
So one hundred and fifteen dollars now.

30
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,030
Wow.

31
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,500
That's the highest I've seen so far.

32
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,060
Let's see how she's done.

33
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:51,580
She's made over eighty thousand she's able to charge that rate and still get jobs so she must be a really

34
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,930
really successful really really talented.

35
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,390
So she has a little bit of a larger background since she charges so much per hour.

36
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,400
I think she has to go in a little bit more detail about why she charges so much per hour what makes

37
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,630
her so special.

38
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,880
So she's a web designer and front end web developer skilled in h t AML.

39
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:14,530
And she goes into everything that she does as well as template platforms including square space Shopify

40
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,580
and WordPress.

41
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,740
So in that first sentence I know what she does her title the software she has experience in and what

42
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:26,650
she can do all in the first line well done my extensive experience and background and graphic design

43
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,660
allow me to bridge the gap between design and development to create the most beautiful and highly functional

44
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,170
Web site.

45
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:38,470
So she's really talking about how she's unique her style and how she's able to take graphic design and

46
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:43,900
web design and make something that works well in the back end but also looks really good in the front

47
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,010
end so well well done well written profile so far.

48
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,220
So this is kind of where she talks about how she's different.

49
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:57,040
She draws inspiration from her background and 3d design principles and instills this awareness of physical

50
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,360
space and interactivity into all my.

51
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,280
So she's really saying kind of her unique perspective of how she works.

52
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,200
So she's worked with a free diverse clientele talking about her prior work experience.

53
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,150
So in addition to decaf digital I'm the owner and designer so continuing she's done a lot she's charging

54
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,360
one hundred fifteen dollars now or she has to go into a little bit more detail

55
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,730
so she doesn't necessarily have a call to action at the end of her.

56
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,790
Her last line is after studying architecture for two years.

57
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:30,180
I asked a little bit more of a resume major of an end what I would do to make this even better is have

58
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,880
kind of a I'd love to work with you to engage your customers some some kind of line that drives the

59
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,690
user to make a response to her.

60
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,630
So I think we've done a lot of steady work here.

61
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,490
I think I'm happy with our profile.

62
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,580
I think the length matches kind of more successful people.

63
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:52,070
I think kind of how we broke it down and to having we're explaining what we do or explaining the software

64
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:59,390
experience and work explaining our unique skill sets and how we're can apply our skill sets to what

65
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,060
we do and then we have the call to action at the end.

66
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,020
And I think I'm feeling pretty happy with this.

67
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,170
So let's go to employment.

68
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:13,760
So we're going to list past employment so they did work for a company before I'm going to list my company

69
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,600
so we're gonna go ahead and put the link that we were at this company.

70
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:24,070
So you guys may not have this experience to put yet it's not a big deal if you don't.

71
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,860
Do not worry about it.

72
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,310
Not everybody has prior work experience

73
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,720
so here we are we just finished our profile we go and get this published so we could start to get out

74
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,040
there for jobs would also start to submit proposals that we think we would connect and want to do.

75
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,320
We're just double checking our entire profile here.

76
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,980
We're going to go and click publish profile.

77
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,150
Congrats you're now part of the upward network.

78
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,520
Woo hoo.

79
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,690
So let's go ahead and look in our feed and kind of see it's go click on recommended kind of see what

80
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,960
we think would work really well.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,500
So here's a creative designer monthly let's check it out.

82
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,220
I've got a reading write Arabic.

83
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,130
Don't think that's going to work out.

84
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,080
So you're not gonna be able to apply to every job you're going to be able to apply to a select few.

85
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,130
And people can also find you and search as well so they may ask you to submit a proposal.

86
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,110
And that's when we'll get into proposal writing.

87
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,260
And another note if you get your profile denied sometimes your profile can be denied.

88
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,600
I've had a couple students contact me and say Up work sent me this generic message saying they're not

89
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,500
accepting their skills sets at the time.

90
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,950
So sometimes up work will deny or profile for a couple of reasons.

91
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,780
And there's several tips on getting.

92
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:46,380
If your profile was not approved there's several kind of tips I got to supply several article linked

93
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:52,450
to articles that go into how to get your profile up and running and maybe resubmit for approval because

94
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:57,850
I've had some students change the profile five times and they finally got it approved.

95
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:03,130
So some of that's just based on the skill sets they put maybe that up work has too many freelancers

96
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,230
and those skill sets and you just have to adjust that a little bit.

97
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,690
I've known some students who change their skill sets and then change it back to the ones that they want

98
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,240
to do after they had their profile accepted.

99
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,110
There's all sorts of things you can do I'm going to post a couple of articles that I think would be

100
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:22,450
helpful in those kind of situations where you do find yourself where it didn't approve it like mine

101
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,730
was approved right away.

102
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:28,000
But hopefully if you went through the process like I did you write a really good profile and you're

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,690
in high demand skill sets you would.

104
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,470
You're not going to have any problem getting approved.

105
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:40,390
Here's a good one looking for a graphic designer ninja to work with the best team ever and it can be

106
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,110
full time or part time.

107
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,750
Let's kind of look at this a little bit more.

108
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,530
Let's look at a more detail.

109
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:50,830
So they're looking for three freelancers so this is we're having an amazing portfolio and profile are

110
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,090
really going to help you stand above the crowd.

111
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,910
You already have that we talked about how to build a killer portfolio that's clean and gets right to

112
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,360
the point with your projects.

113
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,330
We've already talked about how to write a really great profile or bio so we already have that already

114
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:10,870
given you a lot of things to hopefully get you above the stack on the top of the stack when you apply

115
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,590
to these types of jobs.

116
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,050
Let's go ahead and read through this.

117
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,170
See if we like it.

118
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,060
We're searching for talented designer to help us bring our next branding campaigns to life.

119
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,740
And hey I'm a logo design brand are Lillian as a logo design branding expert.

120
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,920
So our title will stand right out to them.

121
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,000
We're looking for someone to design a number of different categories food restaurant medical.

122
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,810
So we need to have advance knowledge of sketch and vision studio figure.

123
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:40,270
We already have the Adobe Creative Cloud other software says in your proposal and a lot of times people

124
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,970
will ask you for specific things in their proposal.

125
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:48,490
So make sure you read the entire item in your proposal please provide one or two paragraph summary of

126
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,320
your design experience and why you'd be a great fit for this work.

127
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:58,090
So we already have that also include two relevant samples that show your best design work and creativity.

128
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,460
So we already have that and have those first two projects.

129
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:07,030
Guess what I can probably even submit those pages of my PDA portfolio that we created as well or at

130
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,000
least take snapshots or get those images we used.

131
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,110
So we already did this.

132
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,330
We don't have to do any extra work we've already done this.

133
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,640
We have two projects that we can show and we already have some summary and a bio of what we have done

134
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,420
and experience in the past.

135
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:28,550
OK so when you find a project that you think will fit go ahead and submit a proposal course you might

136
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,040
have to do some verification of your I.D. and my I.D..

137
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:37,790
So I went through that process where I had to submit a driver's license to be able to apply to jobs

138
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,370
in the U.S..

139
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,670
So you'll be in a different country.

140
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,300
You may have different requirements so I did that and to be able to submit proposals I wanted to talk

141
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,980
about Connex for a little bit.

142
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,380
You'll have to have 20 connects.

143
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:53,240
So this is when you're able to spend those to be able to submit proposals or reach out to clients.

144
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,140
Course they can always reach out to you anytime.

145
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,410
This is for you applying and reaching out to jobs.

146
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:04,100
So you get 20 when you start and you can always buy additional ones or you get the plus plan which you

147
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,740
get 70 each month or the free after you spend the 20 they're going to cost a little bit.

148
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,570
And so that's kind of how up how up work makes money they make a little bit of money from the people

149
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,050
who are seeking out jobs and they like make a little money from freelancers like you.

150
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,940
This is how they stay in business.

151
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,480
This is part of the how it works.

152
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:28,080
But fourteen ninety nine is not bad if you start getting a lot of client work that can help pay for

153
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,740
that but you don't need to pay for anything right up front you still get 20 to use a guy to use and

154
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:39,180
very wisely you know really pick those ones that you want to to be able to send the proposals.

155
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:43,830
So let's say we want to submit a proposal on a project where we were last time that so this particular

156
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,180
one requires four of our connects and we have 20.

157
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,270
So we have to really make sure if it's a really high connect requirement.

158
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:56,460
So this case for a basically is the same as coins or currency if it's a very high.

159
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:01,230
So for it we got to really make sure we won it because then after that after we run out of 20 we have

160
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:07,310
to pay 15 cents for each one or get some kind of monthly subscription to be able to get 70 each month.

161
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,050
Was go ahead and submit a proposal so we need to figure out how we're going to be paid.

162
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,880
It could be paid by milestone.

163
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,980
So that's dividing the project in smaller segments called Milestones when you complete a milestone let's

164
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,360
say you develop a logo and you're done with that logo concept and it gets approved.

165
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,740
That's a milestone and you get a little bit of payment.

166
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,080
And then when you submit the final files you get the remainder of the payment or you could do it by

167
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,410
project get paid at the very end.

168
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,530
So I like to do by by Project is a little bit more simple.

169
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,440
But if you have longer projects I I would suggest the milestone.

170
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,550
So we're doing a web design project that's going to take a month or two definitely milestone because

171
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,820
you don't want to wait till the very end to get paid.

172
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:51,870
We're going to use the knowledge that we learned about pricing projects and to fill this out.

173
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,860
So bid how much do we want to bid for this.

174
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,930
We kind of read a little bit about the project this is a different project than the one I was on just

175
00:10:58,930 --> 00:10:59,790
a few minutes ago.

176
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,450
So we're going to do two hundred and so this is going to be the up work service fee.

177
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,920
So these are kind of things that another way that up work makes money.

178
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,050
This is how these platforms work.

179
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:14,200
You've got to get paid to be able to connect to clients you've got to understand that's part of the

180
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,070
business.

181
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,750
So I'll end up receiving after fees one hundred and sixty dollars for this I think this is just a simple

182
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,030
logo needed in vector files needed.

183
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:27,880
So this is a really low low price this is lower than what Lillian or I would ever be happy with.

184
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,290
But I don't have any social proof on the platform I'm hoping if I do really good and I get this job

185
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:37,990
I get paid a little less than I would charge if I ran into a client or found a client locally I would

186
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:43,270
charge four hundred dollars but since I'm trying to build up my social proof and reviews this is part

187
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,670
of what I have to do.

188
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,960
So timeline so you need to be realistic with this.

189
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,800
If you could do it in a week do it in a week of it's going to take three to six months.

190
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,500
You just need to be very realistic here.

191
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,430
So going to second do this in a week is a very quick job cover letter.

192
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,490
We're going to kind of write adapt our bio a little bit to this or we're just going to put our bio in

193
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:07,500
here and we're going to attach it sometimes they required like that one job was requiring our two projects.

194
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:13,210
So this is where your PDA portfolio you may think that was old school or who needs a PDA portfolio we

195
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,290
need it all online.

196
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:19,840
This is where having the PDA portfolio really helps because you can attach that you can export only

197
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,060
certain pages or certain projects out of your PDA portfolio if you want to show off of certain certain

198
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,080
projects so let's utilize what we did already earlier in the class.

199
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,870
Let's go to go ahead and attach that PDA if all right.

200
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,710
We're going to submit our proposal yays.

201
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,700
We're gonna go ahead and submit it and kind of see what happens.

202
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:45,210
We're going to go apply for a couple more jobs so I can spend all of the connects that I have spent

203
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:49,320
all 20 and cannot hopefully maybe one of those will contact me.

204
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,990
And for the jobs that can be accepted for the job also with up work they can contact you by looking

205
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,390
at your profile and finding you on the search.

206
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:03,660
So there's ways that they can require you to submit a proposal without you having to submit one but

207
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,600
do a combination always use your connects if you have any for free use them all.

208
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:13,980
Go ahead to apply to the top jobs you think you have the best if you're the best candidate for don't

209
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:19,140
apply to jobs that are out of your skill range apply to ones that are maybe under your skill range.

210
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:24,520
So have a higher probability of getting those first couple jobs to get some social proof on the platform.

211
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,060
So we created an up work profile and we already applied to a couple of jobs.

212
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,090
So now we just wait and hope that we get connected.

213
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,820
But this is just one Web site.

214
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,440
There's so many other ones to explore.

215
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:42,600
So I created an excellent resource full of all sorts of great quality freelancer Web sites for you to

216
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,180
also create profiles on just so you can increase your chances of landing a job.
