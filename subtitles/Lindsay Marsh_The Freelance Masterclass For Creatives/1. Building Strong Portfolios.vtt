00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.090
Strong personal branding is critical to your freelance success.

2
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.700
But having and building a strong stellar portfolio is even more important in landing those first few

3
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.510
portfolios come in a few different flavors and it's nice to have options for your clients.

4
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.540
First of all I can either be a PDA style portfolio an online digital portfolio which functions like

5
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.210
a personal Web site or a portfolio that exists on a third party Web site similar to having a social

6
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.280
media account having at least two out of the three portfolio options and styles is very important.

7
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.980
Many larger clients will sometimes prefer you submit a portfolio in a PDA format while others prefer

8
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.460
a simple link to an online portfolio.

9
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:53.230
It's nice to be able to have that print or digital PDA option just in case that situation arises.

10
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.510
Also don't ignore that third option of having your portfolio on a third party Web site like Bea Hanscom

11
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.060
where you can build and add your projects.

12
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.920
You have less control over this option but it's great for those who may not want to build an independent

13
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.690
Web site that requires a hosting plan or a domain name no matter which of the formats you choose.

14
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.200
There there's some basic portfolio building basics you should be aware of.

15
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.190
First of all they don't feature too many projects.

16
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.950
You may have a detailed work history or tons of great personal projects that can fill up hundreds of

17
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.980
pages but that doesn't mean you should display every one of them strong portfolios feature a few projects

18
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.230
and present them well with beautifully crafted images and smaller descriptions.

19
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:44.910
Try featuring three to six strong projects and leave the rest to another link page or blog area.

20
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.270
They have an attention grabbing element.

21
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.450
This can be a strong quote or a previous client testimonial.

22
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.580
This can be a beautifully crafted client project or personal project.

23
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.030
There has to be something that makes your portfolio interesting.

24
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.600
Recently I found the use of video appealing in this situation even for those who are not in motion graphics.

25
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.110
You can craft motion videos easily using free software like I movie are Adobe spark that features and

26
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.490
highlights your work.

27
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.800
We will craft one of these a little bit later in the section.

28
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.350
I know your name and the first five seconds of hearing your portfolio I need to know who you are before

29
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.600
I look at your work.

30
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.610
This could be done by having a strong personal logo or name nearby toward the top of the first page

31
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.790
or home page.

32
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.040
I need to remember your name.

33
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.460
So displaying it in a clever or unique way also helps.

34
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.820
I may view hundreds of portfolios and I need a way to remember you and connect you back to your work.

35
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.480
They feature your personal work not all freelancers have large previous client work in their portfolios

36
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.360
especially when they're first starting out.

37
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.680
Like many of you guys I do enjoy seeing at least one personal work as personal work tends to better

38
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.390
display your passions and your talents than client work does as client work can be limiting they use

39
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.000
simple and clean design elements.

40
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.710
They are less focused on the extra junk and more interested in showing you what matters their work.

41
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.100
They use less photos but make them a little bit larger and easier to see the work they take on and More

42
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.660
magazine design layout style featuring important items that are larger and easy to view.

43
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.800
They show their process.

44
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.530
I love seeing sketches and viewing photos of their raw creative process.

45
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.760
I love viewing behind the scenes photos of them at work.

46
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.460
It just brings a nice personal touch and richness to their work.

47
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.990
There is a man or woman behind your work and it's nice to take a quick peek at that.

48
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.340
This can also be showing your brainstorming process as well with authentic sketches so they can see

49
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.290
that final finished project.

50
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.300
Once again a story driven narrative works really well.

51
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.560
I've had the chance to hire many freelancers in my fourteen year work history.

52
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.600
I've had to survey many portfolios and have come to understand what potential clients are businesses

53
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.320
are looking for and what makes them quickly turn away.

54
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.360
Are some things that turn me off when looking at freelancers portfolios.

55
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.880
First of all they feature projects from several different disciplines.

56
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.150
You arrive on their portfolio to be greeted by projects that seem disjointed such as photography over

57
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.460
here and then an illustration project right next to it.

58
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.670
It's not bad showing off your varied skills but if I'm looking for a photographer I want to see photographer

59
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.930
projects.

60
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.170
It goes back to giving your viewer what they want to see first.

61
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.850
This may mean you feature your other skills elsewhere on your portfolio perhaps in the footer of your

62
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.400
Web site or have two separate portfolios.

63
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.050
One for illustration and one for photography.

64
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.300
I see graphic designers do this all the time.

65
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.000
They'll feature personal photography projects and I'm trying to find a logo designer not someone to

66
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.330
take my photos.

67
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.390
There's always the option of applying a graphic design technique to your own photography making it relevant

68
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.610
to the other pieces in your portfolio.

69
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.610
Some skills connect very well and connect directly.

70
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.490
What other skills are a little less connected.

71
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.650
Also they overwhelm me with Project photos.

72
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:18.310
Sometimes I arrive on a portfolio and find 10 images on the first screen above the fold when building

73
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.970
a portfolio.

74
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:25.030
It's best to have a storytelling narrative approach guiding viewers slowly through a well crafted curated

75
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.070
project images or text.

76
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.980
Once again the theme here is less is more try to feature less than five images on the first home page

77
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.040
or viewable portion of the screen.

78
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.450
Obviously there are creative ways to include more and it's project dependent but a rule of thumb is

79
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.250
if you want to feature more than five.

80
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.070
Make sure they're all connected to the same project and not part of different projects.

81
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.460
These are just general guidelines.

82
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.840
They're not hard rules.

83
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.690
I've seen so many portfolios that can break this rule or use multiple photos very well.

84
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.890
Some portfolios are just too long.

85
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.660
I find this mostly with PDL based portfolios.

86
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.420
They're just too long and feature too many projects.

87
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.000
It gets very tiring viewing many many many one projects one after the other.

88
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.830
Another reason to select just three to six strong projects and keeping it at just that.

89
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.940
Another thing I notice on weak portfolios is they do not properly introduce or explain their projects

90
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:20.900
or work.

91
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.240
I've had to research and hunt down an explanation of what the project is even worse.

92
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.030
A may not even know what they personally contributed to the project.

93
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.070
Did they do the photos and the design.

94
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:38.270
What role did they play I find having a small narrative or story driving sentences helped to explain

95
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.910
the project.

96
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.330
As I scroll through the project photos nothing too long unless it's imperative to explaining your role

97
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:50.720
in the project such as a UX UI designer or text and project descriptions sometimes play an even bigger

98
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.450
role than project photos.

99
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.280
And lastly it is try to sell themselves way too hard.

100
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:02.690
Yes it's a very common thing and they have these strong statements about how they're the only solution

101
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:09.170
or the best way to go but they just feel like empty statements try to avoid cliché and common phrases

102
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:14.660
in your headlines or text you want to create unique headlines that are custom to you and echo your unique

103
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.720
approach and your craft.

104
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:23.160
Remember when we crafted your bio earlier in this class there's several ways to incorporate your bio

105
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.480
in your portfolio.

106
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.070
You can have a separate page or you can sprinkle a little bit about yourself between project photos

107
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.010
on the home page as a creative freelancer.

108
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:36.700
You have more freedom to express yourself and talk more about your personal goals and passions.

109
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:42.620
Make sure you show this throughout to drive a sense of authenticity with your portfolio.

110
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:48.230
I have a great downloadable resource that sums up the last lesson and gives you a few layout tips when

111
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.880
we start to build our online portfolio in later lessons.

112
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:56.840
We had a chance to review some positive portfolio building qualities we talked about a few of the negative

113
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.620
ones.

114
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.710
Let's start crafting our first portfolio type together.

115
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.660
We're going to go over how to present work in the best way possible highlighting your skills and talents

116
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.180
are going to be doing the PBF style portfolio first so see you in the next lesson.
