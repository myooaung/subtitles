00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.260
As you probably heard cash flow is king cash flow in this case as defined by the amount of total income

2
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.810
received in a given month when you received one hundred percent of your cash flow from freelance services

3
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.750
you find huge peaks and valleys in your cash flow.

4
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.730
This all depends on how many clients you have how often they pay you and if they're regular clients

5
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.660
or regular clients are fantastic and provide stability in your cash flow and income.

6
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.410
A few of my clients were this way and I'd prefer them over the higher paying one time jobs because of

7
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.960
the stability if I have three clients that give me around 500 to 1000 dollars of work per month I can

8
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.250
count on at least one thousand two thousand dollars per month of income that's on top of the extra one

9
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.520
time projects or client work I do.

10
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.520
This provides a nice cash flow stability I can at least pay basic bills and be more available to take

11
00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.860
extra risk and pitch myself for those larger high pay client work there is one time higher paying client

12
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.900
jobs always have the potential to convert to a regular paying client so constantly searching for those

13
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.820
onetime high paying freelance opportunities is essential for growing both sides of your business both

14
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.710
short term and long term clients

15
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.770
these higher paying onetime clients adds a nice boost to cash flow and maybe a web development project

16
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.420
that lasts for weeks and you receive a one time payout of five thousand dollars for that given month

17
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.420
as it to your regular clients.

18
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.200
You are also working for you can have a nice six thousand seven thousand dollars cash flow for that

19
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.260
month or higher balance is what we truly strive for in freelancing.

20
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.820
Having a balance between those two client types is essential for evening out your cash flow.

21
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.670
The last thing you need is a super low paying month let's say 1000 dollars but twenty two hundred dollars

22
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.280
in expenses for your family.

23
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.390
There are times where this will happen that five thousand dollar one time project will not help you

24
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.930
here.

25
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.760
If you will not get paid for that project until you invoiced and they've sent the money there's always

26
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.350
a delay in getting paid.

27
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.860
If those are not time perfectly a cash flow problem will happen.

28
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.690
That is why one of those higher paying months any money that is above your average monthly income is

29
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.850
stashed away for those months where invoices are not paid on your desired timing.

30
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.870
I can guarantee after 12 years of studying my cash flow even now after having five staple clients and

31
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.740
lots of extra work there are months that could be on the lower side.

32
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.210
That is why with my regular stable clients I sent out my invoice monthly and on the same date.

33
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.830
You could pick any date whatever works out best for you and your client.

34
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.930
But after a few months or years of this regular clockwork invoicing pattern they tend to pick quicker

35
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.840
as they know when they're going to receive that invoice.

36
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.460
It becomes a regular bill to them and you no longer have to fight for the invoice to be paid on time

37
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.350
or within that 30 day period.

38
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.590
We will go over this in more detail later in the class but charging an outfront fee for new or higher

39
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.510
paying clients is essential if you want to protect yourself from slow or no paying clients.

40
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.740
Contracts are key here too but asking a 25 to 50 percent upfront fee for that first project guarantees

41
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.780
you will receive prompt payment and helps that new client take you more seriously as they have some

42
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.470
money invested into you already.

43
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.660
I have made this mistake many times when I first started out I thought that charging 50 percent upfront

44
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.730
fee for my first project would intimidate them too much and they would move on in some cases.

45
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.370
It's true but having a phone call or personal connection with them can help make this process feel less

46
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.080
intimidating for the client.

47
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.410
But I would highly recommend this method.

48
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.830
There are too many people out there wanting to take advantage of new freelancers and not pay them on

49
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.980
time or not even pay them at all.

50
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.180
This is very important.

51
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.380
It is better to scare off potential clients by protecting yourself with this upfront fee than it is

52
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.120
to get clients that are low quality and not willing to take a risk.

53
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.950
Like I said before having that personal phone call with the client goes a long way in establishing a

54
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.350
good first communication and reducing the possibility that requesting an upfront fee will intimidate

55
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.070
or scare them off.
