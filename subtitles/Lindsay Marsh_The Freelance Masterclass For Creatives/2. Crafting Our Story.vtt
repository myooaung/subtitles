00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.750
Each freelancer will have their own unique story to tell.

2
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:14.350
Showing off your style but also what has made you who you are as a creative and it could be helpful

3
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.910
in selling yourself to potential clients.

4
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.960
Finding clients is like dating and showing your true authentic self goes a long way in finding clients

5
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.610
with a foundation rooted in trust.

6
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.530
We want to craft our story with our skillset in mind.

7
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.030
What inspired us to become creative artists designers photographers web designers.

8
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.930
Was there someone who inspired you to make you who you are today.

9
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.320
Is there someone who motivates you to go out on your own and make it as your own boss be thinking about

10
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.100
those questions.

11
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.740
So we begin to craft our stories together in this downloadable worksheet.

12
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.020
First of all let's get the tough part out of the way.

13
00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.120
Let's develop a mission statement a mission statement is a small one to three cents description of what

14
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.950
you do and you're freelancing goals as an online instructor an example for mine is to teach the world

15
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.890
design and interesting and passionate ways by use of video student challenges and engagement with my

16
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.860
students as you could see it's one longer compound sentence.

17
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.070
Some of the best mission statements are quick one line phrases because being able to reduce your business

18
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.130
model until one sentence is a true test of having a simple viable service or product.

19
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.900
Here are some examples of mission statements of larger corporations that are simple unifying and they

20
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.220
explain their entire business model in such a short time.

21
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:47.720
Effectively Life is good to spread the power of optimism.

22
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.060
They sell motivational T-shirts and apparel of varying kinds but yet they don't mention apparel.

23
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.030
They mostly mention their main goals to spread the power of optimism.

24
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.760
This leaves their company mission statement over open for change as they add new products and services.

25
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.610
Their mission statement never has to adopt or change its evergreen as they say.

26
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.770
Another example for the company Uber we ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion.

27
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.400
You'll notice a theme here about not focusing so much on the services but the feelings emotions and

28
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.790
goals of the company.

29
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.600
They use the word opportunity and not once is the word car mentioned it's a car ride sharing company.

30
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.720
You think this would be critical in their mission statement but as they add new modes of transportation

31
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.950
their mission statement never needs to shift or change with it.

32
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:46.000
For Adobe only Adobe gives everyone from emerging artists to global brands everything they need to design

33
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:53.050
and deliver exceptional digital experiences Adobe's mission statement takes another direction and talks

34
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.280
about the unique advantage over its competitors.

35
00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.160
They mentioned how they are the only ones who give artists everything they need to deliver digital experiences.

36
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.600
They do not go on to list how they do it but just that they do offer such a wide variety of products

37
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.450
and they do it very well.

38
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.220
So maybe after all this mission statement research I should revisit my own mission statement and I can

39
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:23.820
simplify it even more perhaps I can revise this to focus more on my main goal and motivation and less

40
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.730
on exactly how I do that.

41
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.040
How about to teach the world design an interesting and passionate ways by providing unique engaging

42
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.150
student experiences.

43
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.390
This leaves my business open to change without ever having to change the core values or mission statement

44
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:40.920
I can use video.

45
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.060
Expand into workshops and not once will I have to change my statement.

46
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.050
Let's head on over to the downloadable worksheet and see if you can craft your own mission statement.

47
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.650
Then we can move on to creating and writing our bio and story where we can go deeper into the type and

48
00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:02.930
style and methods we use try writing your mission statement using little words as possible.

49
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.470
Keep it no longer than three total sentences and constantly find ways to reduce the length to say more

50
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:16.230
with less so now that you've written a small concise mission statement we get more detailed information

51
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:25.070
about your services are yourself and a story in bio bios can be boring or an incredible read.

52
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.000
You're the key qualities I see in great entertaining and rich bios.

53
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.040
They are honest and authentic.

54
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.380
This is taken from one of my favorite online design instructors Aaron Drapkin.

55
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:44.250
He's raw and authentic and its approach feels like a real person that matches his brash spunk and realistic

56
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.700
approach to design.

57
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.740
They're never too long and difficult to read.

58
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.350
I have seen some long freelancer bios in my day and if it's longer than two paragraphs I generally do

59
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.980
not read the last half.

60
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.600
It's the realism of trying to grab people.

61
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.730
Some people are more gravitated toward motion pictures photos and less of text and that's why crafting

62
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.180
and writing a bio that is short and manageable is critical.

63
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.860
I try to keep my less than a three minute read that leads into the next one.

64
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.180
They get to the point quickly by the end of the third sentence.

65
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:25.130
A great bio already communicate several things your name your main goals and your motivations and what

66
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.680
you do.

67
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.830
Not everyone list their services on their portfolio.

68
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.910
Sometimes the bio is the first time a viewer will see exactly what you do and have it listed.

69
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.650
Make sure you communicate that quickly.

70
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.260
If you're photographer communicate that in the second or third sentence at the very minimum.

71
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.410
Also if you're a jack of all trades and participate in multiple disciplines try focusing first on the

72
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.250
one that you're looking for clients in.

73
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.300
So if you're a photographer designer web designer extraordinaire.

74
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.050
Try focusing on web design.

75
00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.530
Those are the type of clients who are seeking first and foremost.

76
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.210
Once your bio is written we've already written the bulk of what you will have on your portfolio and

77
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.180
web page.

78
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.940
It seems kind of tough at first working through these first few lessons of the course but once we get

79
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:17.720
to creating real tangible items and marketing products for a freelance business the core hard work will

80
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.010
already be done.

81
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.830
Lastly we need to write our copy and headlines for marketing.

82
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.530
These can be one or two liners that can make great Facebook ad post headlines.

83
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.700
Great poster headlines basically copy that can be written to grab people's attentions toward our services

84
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:43.050
that exist on a broad wide variety of platforms all the above mission statements bios and attention

85
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.750
grabbing headlines and even your services list can also be used in your portfolio or on freelancers

86
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.080
Web sites like up worked com to grab clients attention.

87
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:58.410
We'll be crafting an upward portfolio together and we'll go into even more detail on how to piece all

88
00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:07.750
of this together on the site as well as many other sites so establishing your values and your culture.

89
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.170
This last section will establish our values and culture.

90
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.770
Is there something special or unique you stand for.

91
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.440
Do you use sustainable paints.

92
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:21.280
As an illustrator do you donate any proceeds to a charity as a photographer.

93
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.590
Do you value hard work and honesty.

94
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.900
All of these things play important parts in crafting that brand story because it's not just about who

95
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:36.370
you are but what we stand for and also the type of work culture we want to represent work culture is

96
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.020
for more than just larger companies.

97
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.590
It can be for a single employee business like you as a freelancer.

98
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.650
Also freelancers rarely work alone in the long term.

99
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.560
There's usually collaborations that happen when you start to take on larger clients.

100
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:53.410
How you work with those and other individuals and clients can set the tone for your company for years

101
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:59.520
to come once again working through this worksheet can get a lot of the hard work out of the way now.

102
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:04.770
So when it comes to creating those many promo items will create together in this class it will go much

103
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:05.430
much quicker.

104
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:12.530
Now that we have process through all of this now that we run down our story bio and other necessary

105
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:19.190
text now it's time to focus on my favorite things about branding the visual side of things and the inspirations

106
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:19.750
behind it.
