1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,470
Licensing for graphic resources function in a similar way to photos.

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,820
There are several Web sites where you can download free vector resources for example.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,320
Picard is one of those Web sites.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,940
So for example I found the social media icon vector pack that are really need for a client project.

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,560
It was better than me having to find PND of each social media icon.

6
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:33,000
Plus these being in vector would be nice in terms of resolution for my project I look around the page

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,960
before I download any resource and I try to find the type of license this graphic has.

8
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,260
It looks like it's available for promotional use.

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,010
Great.

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,810
I can use this for my client.

11
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,520
It does look like I need to give a credit to the original author somehow.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,370
There are two ways I can do this.

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,770
Be a Web site link if it's for online use or small print.

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,150
If it's for a printed project I could place the small line at the very bottom of my client's print project

15
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:04,380
would have my client or I do not like having the little line at the bottom of the project.

16
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,770
I can always purchase a premium graphic to use and I no longer have to credit the author or I can find

17
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:16,320
one that does not require an attribution by simply reading the license of that particular graphic it

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,270
just takes a little time noodling around to find the licensing and understand how they work and what

19
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,950
they are going to require me to do I'm on the creative market dot com.

20
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,810
A great place to find and purchase lots of premium assets for graphic designs.

21
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,720
I just happened to be on this Watercolor Collection.

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,330
I love these different images offered and I wanted to go ahead and purchase this for quite project.

23
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,820
And you'll notice that there's two different price points.

24
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:48,400
There's a standard license and an extended license just like for photography so if I want to figure

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,650
out what comes with the standard license I could scroll down on it a little bit and go down the license

26
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,480
offered.

27
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,510
I click on standard.

28
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:00,730
I can see if I can't satisfy what I need for my project because it is more affordable so for personal

29
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:06,310
use I have unlimited projects extended license and limited projects so great commercial use.

30
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:12,110
One project extend its license one project so if I'm using this for a client I need to purchase it again.

31
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:18,040
If I'm going to use it for another client and user product per sale I could do one project up to 500

32
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:23,200
sales but if I plan to have more than 500 sales on a particular graphic I'm going to want to buy the

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,420
extended license because of limited client budgets.

34
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,530
I've learned to use as many open source totally free resources as possible.

35
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,660
I've also learned to modify vector resources or graphics beyond recognition to make up my own artwork

36
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,510
that's unique.

37
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,000
And of course now usable for my clients my own personal work.

38
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,530
Of course I give credit to the original author and purchase any assets that I need.

39
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,820
This is where the lines really start to blur and get complicated.

40
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,690
Seek out the opinion of a legal professional for any serious inquiries.

41
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,160
You should always protect yourself.

42
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:02,780
If you have a serious legal question about licensing and copyrights of creative work but when does a

43
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,820
modified or derivative work start to become yours.

44
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,880
At no longer the original creators work this is always a hot topic up for debate.

45
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,940
Someone can easily take my design I made and modify it significantly beyond recognition and in some

46
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:22,850
cases I may no longer have protective rights on my work because that darn design was modified and changed

47
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,970
so much that I cannot retain any legal copyrights to it.

48
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:33,160
It becomes the new creator's work even though I created the basis for the design.

49
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,530
This is where it gets tricky.

50
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:40,240
If they stole my idea and that idea still shines through on their work even though they modified it

51
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,360
significantly I could still retain a legal case against them.

52
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,150
Does that mean you could take a vector graphic and modify it significantly and no longer need to give

53
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,980
credit to the original author.

54
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,090
That's a big fat.

55
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,220
Maybe it's up to you to cross that line.

56
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,370
This is once again a hot topic for discussion in the creative world and one that should we should continue

57
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,020
to talk about what is original art.

58
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,520
Can it combined with unoriginal works.

59
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,500
A big question you need to ask yourself before walking down that road.

60
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,680
Something I encourage you guys to do is to be as original as possible creating your own unique works

61
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,390
or to give credit to the artist work you use in your projects.

62
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,000
Looking for inspiration and other artist works that's a great idea.

63
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,570
Go remember their ideas theirs and your ideas are yours.
