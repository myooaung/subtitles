00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.900
Finding clients through online paid ads.

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.420
This gets a little bit into marketing your freelance business but I wanted to talk about the options

3
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:20.070
when it comes to paying for exposure through boosted post or paid online ads sometimes to get a business

4
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.790
started.

5
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.530
There needs to be a little bit of financial investment in terms of marketing but not everyone will need

6
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.570
to pay for ads.

7
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.920
Some of the other free networking and finding client activities mentioned in this course can land you

8
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.210
some of those first few vital clients.

9
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.780
For those who struggle even after trying out all the free avenues it might be time to consider a small

10
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.720
investment and test out some paid ads to see how they convert.

11
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.970
There are several types of online paid ads.

12
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.190
First off there are display ads which can be purchased from online news Web sites and other local Web

13
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.110
sites for a monthly fee.

14
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.130
I find these more effective for larger companies and less so for freelancers.

15
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.800
But I prefer doing display ads in local networks in your nearby town as display ads for national or

16
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.970
international Web sites can be just too costly for a new freelancer next there are paid Facebook ads.

17
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.620
You can set up a Facebook ad account and just a few minutes and craft your first AD.

18
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.650
You can do either a Facebook post ad which shows up and your targeted users news feed or you can do

19
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.220
boosted posts which expose one of your normal Facebook business page posts to a broader target audience

20
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.210
Facebook change their search algorithm worked.

21
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.500
Back in 2016 the favor paid and boosted business post over organic posts so it's hard to grow organically

22
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.710
on Facebook now without trying to bring in users through other sources as a freelance owner and small

23
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.580
business owner.

24
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.460
I prefer boosted posts because they can feel more natural for a freelance business.

25
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.380
The key to creating a great Facebook boosted post are paid ad is to define your target audience well

26
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.030
we've already worked on that a bit earlier in the class and there is a good reason why it's good to

27
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.150
really help you here.

28
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.140
I would start off with a very small budget for your first boosted poster ad so you can see if small

29
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.990
changes in your campaign whether it be the image you use the headline are tweaking your audience has

30
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.040
any changes in the conversions you get are the new clients in your case.

31
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.160
Rarely you can create the perfect ad right away.

32
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.720
This is because it takes a few ads running first to find out which ones are more effective as you're

33
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.840
still getting to know your target audience.

34
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.650
Instagram is another option for boosting your post.

35
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.330
First of all you'll need to convert your Instagram account into a business profile by going to the account

36
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.520
settings and ticking the switchover to business profile option.

37
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.780
Once that's complete you'll notice a new promote buttons on all of your posted posts.

38
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.120
Once you sign up for a business account which is totally free by the way and I recommend everybody do

39
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.150
it even if you don't even run ads because it'll give you access to more stats about each post including

40
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.260
profile visits your reach where each view came from like if views came from hashtags home page or from

41
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.300
your followers.

42
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.710
This extra detailed information about each post is so vital in helping you define your target audience

43
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:24.310
but also helps you find out what content tends to lead to a bigger response from your following I find

44
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.710
the use of video driven posts much more engaging with my audience than a single photo post.

45
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:35.350
I also found that posting helpful guides for my target audience worked better than promotional style

46
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.420
posts where I show off my work.

47
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.670
For example if you're a web developer you can do a series of posts that gives advice to small business

48
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.570
owners about proper web site layout and structure.

49
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.580
Now that we talked about ways to find clients online let's talk about one of my personal favorite ways

50
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.100
to find clients and how I found my first few clients and that's where and how to find them off line.
