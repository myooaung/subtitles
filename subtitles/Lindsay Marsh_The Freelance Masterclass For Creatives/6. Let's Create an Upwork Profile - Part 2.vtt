1
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.110
So if I'm happy with a photo let's go ahead and go to review.

2
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.150
We're going to review everything make sure everything is how we like it.

3
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.480
Looking at our skills

4
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.010
expertise level Web site so save it.

5
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.140
And we're gonna see jobs we're gonna click on my fee.

6
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.120
This is when we can start to apply to jobs is a big part of us work is finding and submitting job requests.

7
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.410
So now that we're here in this fine work area we're going to want to says our profiles only sixty five

8
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.580
percent complete.

9
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.660
Let's get a little bit more further completion.

10
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.770
It only helps when it comes to being searchable.

11
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.750
Let's go and complete our profile.

12
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.290
So we want to set our title so this is when we need to be very specific.

13
00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:01.630
So a lot of people do what's called keyword stuffing which they add a bunch of kind of random qualities

14
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.110
they have.

15
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.960
So they do logo design graphic design yada yada yada.

16
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.250
But it's not a formal title I don't think it looks professional if you just list all the all of your

17
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.590
abilities and services in your title because that's already listed already.

18
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.290
So you want to have a formal title if you want to Google this and kind of help see what's the best title

19
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.970
to use for your industry.

20
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:31.150
And this case senior graphic designer logo design and branding specialist.

21
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.500
So this is being very specific which is good because when people search for you they're going to see

22
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.910
that you do logo design and branding if you want to do graphic design as a whole.

23
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.790
You can say senior graphic designer art director and graphic designer and make sure you have formal

24
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.630
real titles.

25
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.000
If someone says what what do you do.

26
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.010
Who are you.

27
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.570
That's more like a title it's not going to be listing everything you do graphic design logo design business

28
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.040
car design that's not really what this is for.

29
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.870
This is to look professional and to have a formal title.

30
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.890
So if you're an art director say you're an art director are you a senior art director you know make

31
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.810
sure you kind of put that in there.

32
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.780
If you're an illustrator and artist say I'm a watercolor illustrator and artist you know something along

33
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.040
the lines of what you do in a formal title so and a professional overview.

34
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.130
So we are already way ahead of the game on this because we already written our bio for this in our previous

35
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.480
lessons of course.

36
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.130
So we're going to take our bio we can actually do a first person bio we take our first person bio and

37
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.640
go ahead and load it in here.

38
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:41.530
This is when we can describe ourselves and a little bit more less of a personal way and a little bit

39
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.540
more of a professional way.

40
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.240
So the first paragraph is going to be fine.

41
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.590
Hi my name is Lillian HERNANDEZ I love to create brands that resonate and connect with their target

42
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.700
audiences.

43
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.200
So in the first line I'm already saying my name and the second and the second part of that first line

44
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.730
I'm saying what I do.

45
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.800
And I was always dabbling in creative things from sketching portraits in high school to diving headfirst

46
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.130
into photoshop before photoshop is even a thing.

47
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.630
And this is kind of one of those things that looks really good in a portfolio website or looks really

48
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:17.510
good on a PDA portfolio or something online like this in terms of our freelancer Web site.

49
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.160
We need to get right to the point a little bit quicker.

50
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.730
So this might be a little bit of a personal fun thing that we might need to go ahead and remove and

51
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.620
get a little bit more to what we do and focus on what we accomplish a little bit less about us personally.

52
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.540
This is not where we share what our favorite colors are what our favorite food is.

53
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.950
This is where it's a little less about personality and a little bit more.

54
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.490
This is what I can do for you.

55
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.430
And this is what I've done in the past.

56
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.470
So as much as you can say what you've done in the past like I've won an award I've accomplished this

57
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.520
I've accomplished that the more that you could say that you've accomplished or the courses you've taken

58
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.480
the better it sounds.

59
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.330
So this is just like applying for a job interview this is exactly what you'd put on a resume.

60
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.420
So right here during my time at Johnson Institute of Design in New York City so I'm talking about something

61
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.390
I've done I managed to snag several Top Design Award awards including one for best branding project

62
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.320
and Top Team Award for our final product design competition.

63
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.450
So I'm already saying what I've done.

64
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:23.950
I've already talked about my education already in the first two paragraphs or sentences from Adobe Photoshop

65
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.710
Illustrator and design and now even new programs like Adobe dimensions and next D Lillian is already

66
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.290
talking about the software that she's experiencing but also newer software she's trying to learn so

67
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.730
I'm constantly working at developing new skills in the latest software and this is another good one

68
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.370
to help clients achieve a modern sophisticated look and both digital and print realms.

69
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.640
So I'm seeing a lot with short sentences and packing a lot in there and making sure I talk about what

70
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.310
I do whatever accomplish and the software experience I have as well.

71
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.860
So in the first two paragraphs you already know a lot about Lillian as a previous career in software

72
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.770
engineering I led a team of 20 other software engineers and developing a new tool that speeds up workflow

73
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.490
in the automobile manufacturing space.

74
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.230
So already talking about my prior experience I feel my experience leading large teams is invaluable

75
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.830
to managing larger brand and design projects so pretty much saying I can do well no matter what size

76
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.860
your business is I can be able to handle teams work with teams I'm a team player so that kind of says

77
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:30.550
that as well.

78
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.040
So what we're going to do is before we complete this we're going to go ahead and save this but we're

79
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.210
going to go back and we're going to add maybe a little bit more to this.

80
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:47.920
So we're going to study what do the most successful freelancers on up work those who have a lot of prior

81
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.830
experience and have a lot of money earned on the platform.

82
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.560
What do their profiles look like.

83
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.610
Because the profiles and your headshot and your title are everything.

84
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.430
That's all they see when they search for you are those three things.

85
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.110
So to make sure those are excellent beyond comparison is as a good idea.

86
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:10.110
So let's study I'm to go find the most successful freelancers on up work and study what they've done

87
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.590
he could do the same thing on your own.

88
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.570
I'll be right back.

89
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:19.120
So I'm on the upward main page and I'm going to look in my own field which would be designs they can

90
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.680
look in whatever field that you can offer freelance services and let's do design.

91
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.020
Let's find some top earners so they're automatically going to display those that have a lot of social

92
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.510
proof.

93
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.670
A lot of reviews a lot of prior client experience.

94
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.930
They're only highlighting the best here and this little rotating carousel in the front.

95
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.350
So we're going to look at those who kind of charge a little bit of a higher rate but also have a lot

96
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.670
of jobs and prove that they they were able to get that higher rate approved.

97
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.800
So let's do this.

98
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.320
Ninety four dollars for a motion graphic designer.

99
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.520
Let's take a look at his.

100
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.440
So this is motion graphics is could be a little bit different than what she does but still in the same

101
00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.780
category they've earned over one hundred thousand dollars on the platform that's very rare.

102
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.460
So that's that's only you know maybe the top two or three percent can make that kind of money but it's

103
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.670
definitely possible.

104
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:13.430
So that they've done 40 jobs so to make one hundred thousand dollars and just 40 jobs is not bad.

105
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.600
The mouth they're getting per project is really good and they have a lot of work hours in.

106
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.330
So let's take a look at what they do for their profile.

107
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.670
You can look the length is pretty much the same as ours.

108
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.130
So I'm a top rated motion graphic designer.

109
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.470
So they're saying they're top rated with over 12 years of experience.

110
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.130
So right in the first line I know already a lot about their history.

111
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.210
I specialize in logo intro videos and explainer videos.

112
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.530
So that's exactly what he does it's his specialty.

113
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.400
He's bringing that right up to the front of the table.

114
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.620
I enjoy it so much.

115
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.550
That's all I do all day and all night.

116
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.450
So that's a little bit of a personal fun thing that he's putting in there but it does take up a lot

117
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.760
of room to say that little short line.

118
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.470
I worked with Adobe Photoshop after effects so you notice how he's listing all the software just like

119
00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:57.460
we did for Lillian.

120
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.710
I can complete a project on my own from research style development storyboarding who's listening all

121
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.360
the things that he has done.

122
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:11.270
Can do internal training videos and pretty much anything motion graphic related is my line of expertise.

123
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:16.330
So whether you have a rockstar budget or a normal one like everyone else talk to me and you'll be glad

124
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.760
to have me working on your next project.

125
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.000
So we want to have a line at the end that has a call to action.

126
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.760
So it looks like here he's having a call to action which is basically a contact me kind of call to action.

127
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:36.910
So what we can do is write one for Lillian which says contact me to see how I can make your logo designs

128
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:42.220
top notch or you know I can't wait to work on your brand or your project no matter what your budget

129
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:49.600
is some kind of little line that asks the client to contact you somehow without saying please contact

130
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:57.820
me kind of write it in a way that's a little bit more elegant and a little bit more like this.

131
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.550
I look forward to creating new and exciting brand experiences that engage your customers and spark new

132
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.220
growth for your company.

133
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.610
So I wrote this at the end of Lillian's bio I'm back on her page.

134
00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:14.530
I feel like that ends the profile really well based on studying what I think are successful freelancers

135
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.390
on up work.

136
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.870
Let's take a look at one other person we just don't want to study one person.

137
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:24.220
We want to kind of study several to kind of get an idea of what they're putting what kind of keywords

138
00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.650
are they're doing they're successful for a reason and we need to study that.

139
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:35.350
So let's study someone who has a lower price per hour but they're top rated so they do their profile

140
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.220
a little bit different.

141
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.940
Welcome to my profile here are all the jobs I like to design solutions for.

142
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:46.280
So they're doing this huge list which is a little off putting because I don't know much about Steven.

143
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:52.780
I just kind of know that they do a lot but I think what would make a stronger profile for him is to

144
00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:57.700
put some of these top rated stuff first top rated freelancer member of six enterprise talent.

145
00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.900
So that's huge.

146
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.230
All these are really fantastic things.

147
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.080
They even went to the school of visual arts which is an excellent school in New York City.

148
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:10.210
I would almost even put that first because I think those are so strong and so good that that deserves

149
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:15.040
to be read first instead of this big long list of what they do because what they do is already going

150
00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.000
to be listed down here.

151
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.760
So so their hourly hourly rate so enthusiasm is common.

152
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:21.760
Endurance is rare.

153
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:24.790
They have a quote if you have any other questions please contact me.

154
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.660
So I'd kind of prefer a little bit more about them you know what's their history how long have they

155
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.480
been working in the industry.

156
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.780
Do they have prior work experience this kind of stuff that I wanted to find a little bit more about

157
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:35.310
Steven.

158
00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:43.210
But he's done very well with three hundred and sixty one jobs to almost two thousand hours worked already.

159
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:47.930
So this is where on the profile you see experience so work history and feedbacks.

160
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:52.990
So this is we're having some prior work is really good and that's why we lowered our hourly rate just

161
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:54.940
a little bit so we could start to get some of these.

162
00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.180
This is called social proof or prior reviews.

163
00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:02.700
This is critical because a client's going on there and they don't see you have any reviews.

164
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.530
They don't know how good you are.

165
00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:05.310
They have no clue.

166
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:10.220
They're taking a big risk by hiring you not having any prior reviews.

167
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:16.840
So lowering that hourly rate is one of the only ways you can really exchange a lower rate an exchange

168
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:22.540
for them giving a little more trust in you by not having any reviews it's kind of a necessary evil when

169
00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.740
working online on these big Web sites.

170
00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:29.990
That's kind of one of the reasons why I like local networking better than some of these online Web sites.

171
00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:35.410
But not everyone is going to be in a big city and get to be able to do that kind of local networking.
