1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:09,890
We're one step closer to creating our visual brand and logo inspiration boards or mood boards is another

2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:10,510
name.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:17,000
Our ways of gathering photos colors textures to put together a tapestry of what we think best represents

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,280
us as a creative freelancer.

5
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,440
These photos can make up ones you can download for free online like from pixels dot com.

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,530
These images can also be your own artwork.

7
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,420
If you're an artist or an illustrator or even a graphic designer they could be your favorite typefaces

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,280
or fonts.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:40,130
They can even be textures or metallic colors you think best represents your style for the demonstration.

10
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:45,320
I'm going to happen to a program called canvas they currently offer a free basic account but a fine

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,430
canvas great way to put together quick inspiration boards.

12
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,880
But you can use about any photo editing program you choose.

13
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:57,890
This course will focus less on teaching the actual software and more on crafting the ideas behind creating

14
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:04,430
our personal brands so I'm here on pixels dot com and there's tons of free photo websites you can check

15
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:04,600
out.

16
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:09,770
An A-list set and the resource guides you can find out all sorts of places you can source your photos

17
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,860
for your brand board inspiration.

18
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,780
So I'm here right now in pixels and I'm just kind of flipping through the generic photos.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,240
Of course I can always search and fine tune the kind of photos I'm looking for and what I'm trying to

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,580
do is I'm trying to find what I think would resonate with my own personal style my own personal brand

21
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,160
and my target audience.

22
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,520
So I'm thinking about a few things as I'm going through here and I'm looking at colors as well because

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,940
we're really going to derive our color palette and our brand color inspirations from some of these photos.

24
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,570
So I've got to think about that as well.

25
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:43,070
So I'm just going to scroll through here already have a couple downloaded that I wanted to check out

26
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:49,760
and we could also do textures as well textures colors people anything that you think would resonate

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,720
with your brand it doesn't just have to be a photo can be all sorts of different things.

28
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,120
I'm so going to scroll down here when I had downloaded that the white brick cutout that kind of resonated

29
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,400
with the style I wanted to kind of an urban style I wanted to go with and just kind of going round if

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,060
you like gold if you like.

31
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,880
You know this is really a personal journey for you figuring out what you think would resonate.

32
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,090
I also downloaded several leaf or dark nature photos because I really loved the Greens and I want to

33
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:22,310
see if I can pull out some of those greens in my brand and also purples just anything that I personally

34
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,320
like and this is different than branding for a company.

35
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,570
Because when you brand for a company you're thinking about the consumer.

36
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,370
And in this case we are thinking about our target market we are thinking about our client but we're

37
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:40,100
also thinking about our own personal style that we get to portray in our brand.

38
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,930
So I'm going to be over here in Canada dot com I'll see you there in a minute.

39
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,410
So the great thing about Canada is their ability to have all these premade photo templates you can make

40
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:57,190
a pretty good brand board quickly by kind of dragging those photos over and they have a free Canada.

41
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,210
It's not the Canada for work it's the paid monthly subscription to Canada which you get a lot of extra

42
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:07,020
things but there's also a free version of Canada that you can sign up for and do this step.

43
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,290
You don't have to use Canada just recommending this as a great tool for freelancers because it's free

44
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,780
and easy to use and it can also create social media graphics posters flyers.

45
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,120
There's a lot of great reasons to kind of have a Canada account so I recommend you check it out.

46
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,170
Well you can also use Photoshop Illustrator any old program to kind of put their put together your brand

47
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:27,830
board.

48
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,330
So I'm going to go ahead and find what I think would be enough photos to properly represent a brand

49
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,310
and pull some colors out.

50
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,250
I'm thinking anywhere from six to 10 photos.

51
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,630
Of course this is really personal to you if you have 50 photos you really want to pull from but I'd

52
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,140
like to simplify and make this choice a lot easier.

53
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:50,420
So I'm just going to flip through this and try to find what I think would be a really good layout for

54
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:56,510
my brand board so I found one I thought that would work really well.

55
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,780
And I went ahead and uploaded several the photos that I've found that I thought really resonated with

56
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,980
Lily and Hernandez's kind of personal brand that we're starting to build for her.

57
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:10,140
So she's trying to appeal to she's just getting started so she's trying to appeal to a broad audience.

58
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,600
So not really a specific target yet because she's still trying to develop that.

59
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,780
I know she really loves those tills and blue colors so that's something she really wanted to have in

60
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,700
her brand.

61
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,870
Got to go and drag a few of these I think would really work well and this is kind of she likes to brainstorm

62
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,450
and sketch out her logos and as a graphic designer so I thought this would really be helpful.

63
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,160
I'm going to go ahead and find a few others here really loves this kind of texture here I'm going to

64
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,640
go ahead and zoom in on this so you can really see that texture and she really really prefers this orange

65
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,270
color.

66
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,500
So we're gonna go ahead and focus that because that could be a chance for us to pull out some secondary

67
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,930
brand colors in that particular texture so you notice how he zoomed in on that because we have it zoomed

68
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,400
out it gets too detailed and you start to lose the essence of what you're really trying to focus on

69
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,900
and that's going to be the texture.

70
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,540
So let's go ahead focus on what's the most important because that's how we're deriving our inspiration

71
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,420
from our brand board.

72
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,540
And another thing was these dark green nature leaves.

73
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:15,140
That was something that really resonated well so we can kind of keep that as as is this Robin blue.

74
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,210
There's a lot of blues and steels that we want to maybe derive some colors off of.

75
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:26,700
So I'm going to zoom in on this egg so we can maybe get kind of some of that color out there also this

76
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,260
blue door was a huge inspiration especially because of the Teal.

77
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,890
And that really nice creamy color.

78
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:39,240
So that's something we can have in there as a part of the brand theme and also featuring previous artwork

79
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,970
or design work or illustrative work or web design work whatever freelance activity you do kind of putting

80
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:50,070
some previous client work in their personal work and also help your brand board because you have a particular

81
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,120
style or you have a style you want to have going forward with your clients.

82
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,070
So it's always nice to incorporate some of your prior work so that can be a part of your brand board.

83
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,560
If you already have some personal work or even some paid work you can go ahead incorporate that and

84
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,410
remember it could be textures it could be colors it could be anything that you find or derive a brand

85
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,680
inspiration from.

86
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,230
So in this case that little bit of silver could be something that we're inspired by.

87
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,810
Feel free to incorporate certain typography or font usage that you really appreciate if there's a certain

88
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,520
way that typography is done or a certain font choice.

89
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,270
You can also incorporate that into your brand board as well.

90
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,890
Are you catering to individuals or companies.

91
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,250
All these factors play a part and the colors we choose.

92
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:42,330
I'm including a color psychology chart to give you a rough idea of some of the emotions and reactions

93
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:49,050
we can evoke with color certain colors are stronger like reds and warm colors while other colors are

94
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,750
naturally more calming and relaxing.

95
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:58,990
And I go over a lot of this in detail in my logo design a mastery course so we have our little brand

96
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,760
board that we're going to get started with.

97
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,100
I'm going to go ahead and bring this into a color dot Adobe dot com which is another great resource

98
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,320
and also could include that into their resource list.

99
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,500
So feel free to check that out for all sorts of great resources.

100
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:16,810
This is great because I'm able to really pick the colors that I need and source that from the photos

101
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,640
I've done this and other classes if you take in some of my other design classes I do this a lot when

102
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:28,090
it comes to trying to find and derive colors from inspirational photos as opposed to trying to drive

103
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,930
and pick colors out of nowhere.

104
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,510
That really is kind of a helpful starting guide.

105
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,800
So I'm on color dot Adobe dot com.

106
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,790
I get to go to extract from image.

107
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,720
I believe this is free to use as long as you don't need to download anything.

108
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,190
But I don't think we need to do that

109
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,800
so once you load your photo in it will automatically populate with a color palette that they think are

110
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,710
the strongest colors but you can mainly manipulate these anyway you want to go and drag these around

111
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,690
and try to find and source the color that way.

112
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:05,750
So I find this a really helpful tool to kind of customizing your color palettes and let's say they focus

113
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,310
heavily on this image and you want to drag one over and focus on this door which was a really important

114
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,930
image for Lillian.

115
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:17,090
So going to drag that over to the door you'd also find off white subtle colors so if you want to have

116
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:23,120
some whites and creams you can also maybe drag this over and he could source a color that way so kind

117
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,700
of get a can like light gray can help you kind of choose those colors as well.

118
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,660
Just a really helpful tool.

119
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:34,830
There's kind of the color palette we have so far and of course you can extract using a color mood so

120
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,010
you can do colorful.

121
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,400
So this would be your colorful colors on your brights muted

122
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,310
darks and of course none.

123
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:51,370
You could do your own custom so you can go over to color will appear on that bore left.

124
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,750
They just recently redesigned this whole thing so it's a little bit different a little bit more efficient.

125
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,420
This is the standard color wheel so this is the color palette that we've brought in.

126
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:05,290
If you scroll down it will give you all the hex codes and different items that you'll need.

127
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,220
So these are hex codes hex goes will be important when you build your online portfolio.

128
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,810
These are the codes we need to do to do a digital representation on your website of that particular

129
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:14,880
color.

130
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:20,470
So anytime you see a hex code input this is where you can find those hex codes you can also do RG B

131
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:26,230
modes and also go ahead and click on some of these and you go ahead and give you all of the CNY K and

132
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:32,740
RG be colorful should be helpful if you're going to be really doing print and digital items and doing

133
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,810
more of the design work with a lot of your stuff so that's very helpful way to find colors.

134
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,680
So when I'm going to do is I going to go ahead and start with hex codes and bring in all my hats has

135
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,110
hex codes in the program of my choice which would be Adobe Illustrator and I'm just going to really

136
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,900
put together and finish up my brand board.

137
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,850
It looks a lot like this and it's kind of when I finally came up with the terms of color selection and

138
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:01,690
it's kind of has some circles there with put I input it in the hex code from colored out Adobe and I

139
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,570
was able to find the perfect shade and perfect match for these.

140
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:11,070
So now we have our brand board mood board which source some color ideas course.

141
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:16,210
Now these colors are final until we get a final brand together because as we test out some of these

142
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:21,370
