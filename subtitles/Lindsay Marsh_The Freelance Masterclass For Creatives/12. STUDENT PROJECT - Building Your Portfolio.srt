00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:11,530
Already for a student challenge your task is to create a portfolio or revamp a current portfolio.

2
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:17,800
Your portfolio can be one of several different types first of all you can try your hand at a traditional

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,390
PDA portfolio.

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,400
You could be more creative with how you lay out your projects and PDA portfolios are helpful in sending

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,820
proposals are featuring certain selected works.

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,450
You can also create a Web site based portfolio.

7
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,400
I find the best web portfolios.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,840
Keep it simple and clean.

9
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:40,180
Featuring six or less total projects and a more detailed case study are two with it.

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,900
Portfolio Web sites exude personality.

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,570
Do not be afraid to show off your unique style.

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,690
Another option is you can create a portfolio on a Web site like bee Hanscom or another third party Web

13
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,870
site where you can post your projects.

14
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,970
Lastly we cannot forget Instagram.

15
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,720
Do you feel like turning your Instagram account into a portfolio display.

16
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,510
I'd love to review it.

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,700
Feel free to post it in the student Facebook group for feedback and I really look forward to seeing

18
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,740
your portfolio.
