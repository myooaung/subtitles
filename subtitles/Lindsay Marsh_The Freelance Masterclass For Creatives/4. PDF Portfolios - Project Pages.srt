1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:11,200
So when looking at our project description I decided a story driven narrative might work better for

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,270
the next page as we have lots of little descriptions we can slowly work in and find the perfect photo

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,000
that pairs with the proper description on the right or the left.

4
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,480
So this is a layout that I found in the layout downloadable resource out that would be really helpful

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,640
so I'm just kind of applying it forced you can adjust it to how rethink would work best with your particular

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,380
photos.

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,580
But I want to really maximize the photos.

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,600
So this is when you may not have a particular photo for this so brainstorming.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,480
Do I have a brainstorming photo of this project.

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,860
Maybe Lillian didn't have that when she created this project.

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,660
So that's where you need to maybe find one you can get a stock photo it's best to think about this when

12
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,100
you're doing your next project work to capture some of those beginning stages so that when you do your

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:01,210
portfolio you can show some of these more authentic brainstorming type actions where you're showing

14
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:07,150
sketches you can kind of think about that the next time you do a personal work or a paid client work.

15
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,020
Keep track of all those take photos of that process because it can really come in handy when putting

16
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,170
together your portfolio or your Web site to kind of have this really cool images.

17
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,730
So I found this one but I think it can work for what we have.

18
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:24,310
We can find something a little bit more fitting we can create our own if we have a little bit of time

19
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:32,290
so continuing to find photos that I think pair well with the descriptions you could do if you feel like

20
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,820
you need to put all three steps here.

21
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,850
That's great if you feel like you really want to make the images bigger and show more of the details

22
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,850
you can only do two per page or you can really focus on one per page.

23
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:48,730
If you don't have a lot of total projects in your portfolio can spend more time really focusing in on

24
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,790
detailed photos.

25
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,250
So we could do that for the next one.

26
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:57,550
This one's pretty description heavy so for the next page we're going to focus a lot on just one or two

27
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,610
photos to have more of a focus page where they can stop and see a lot more details especially when it

28
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,960
comes to the product or package design that we designed for them we really want to show that often a

29
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,410
nice big image they're going to do that for our next page so when thinking about the layout for this

30
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:20,200
one we're going to really display the product package design I really wanted to use this photo but we

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,050
already use that as our hero image in the first page introduction of the project and this is why it's

32
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,960
great to do a layout plan ahead of time you can figure out what photos are going to go where.

33
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:37,150
So what I decided to do is go back to the front page and use this one as kind of our hero image because

34
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,260
I feel like it has lots of different things going on.

35
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:45,280
We're using multiple images but it's really one well put together branded image that I think can really

36
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:52,030
capture the branding side of the project so that also leave us available for the the package design

37
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,180
page to have that image displayed.

38
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,100
This probably goes pairs better with a description here.

39
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,280
We want to make sure our descriptions pair well together.

40
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:06,100
You're probably noticing how each page is presented just a little bit differently.

41
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,470
Yet there's still a connecting theme.

42
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,840
I think this is nice to break it up.

43
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,820
So this one has quite a bit of photos it tells the story.

44
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:19,120
This one's more about showing off your design or your skill set so you kind of see kind of the different

45
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,940
arrangements I'm having on each page just to shake it up and to keep the viewer on their toes and to

46
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,670
kind of make a more rich experience.

47
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,670
So this is the next page kind of doing two photos that are trying not to compete with each other but

48
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,980
really highlight the logo and then going down to a another page.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,930
We're already kind of going past what I planned.

50
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:45,640
That's OK sometimes you have to go past it if you have a pretty large project that you want to present.

51
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:51,790
And so here's the social media I thought I kind of maybe show one as a larger image and to a smaller

52
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:56,740
images because if you were to show all of them at the same time they can't really get a good idea what

53
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,370
it looks like.

54
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,380
So having kind of one that zoomed in a little bit bigger helps when you have the kind of projects that

55
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:07,690
have a lot of detail or you maybe have eight different versions or variations sometimes it's nice to

56
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:13,360
have a little hierarchy and have one be a little bit bigger so they can really see the details because

57
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,630
it was all small.

58
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,540
This is a PDA if they have to zoom in to really really look at the details you don't want them to have

59
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,620
to do any work.

60
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,090
You don't want them to have to zoom in to see anything.

61
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,130
They should be able to see everything right here at this.

62
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:33,230
This view super Project Number two we don't have a really big project which is good because our first

63
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:38,210
one took up a lot of pages so this going to only take up to pages only have a few images but I really

64
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,950
wanted to include it in the portfolio because I think it'd be a nice complement to the last project

65
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:47,120
it's a little bit different but it's still in the branding design side of things.

66
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,500
So this is a personal project for a school project that Lillian had.

67
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,000
So we want to make sure somewhere there's personal project labeled and we'll find it maybe a clever

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,350
way to do that in a very short description so we're going to be a little less wordy.

69
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,370
We're going to be a little bit more visual with our photos.

70
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,280
So let's go ahead and get started and get a happened in design.

71
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:12,130
Just kind of a basic layout I borrowed from our layout ideas guide that I have is the downloadable resource.

72
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,810
Let's look at our photos first and our project.

73
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,870
This will be project number two.

74
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,710
So we have several different photos not quite as many as the last one but we need to find one for kind

75
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:27,170
of our hero image that's going to grab people's attention this one already has kind of a label or designed

76
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,500
to it that we can go ahead and put in here.

77
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:36,230
Now we have to kind of fight myself when I have a couple of good photos to use to only choose the one

78
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,670
I think is the most effective because there's four or five I want to throw in there because I really

79
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,920
want to describe my project but there's always ways you could do that on the next page.

80
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,780
So less is more I always have to fight myself on that because when I put together my portfolio I feel

81
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,190
like every image is good.

82
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,600
But you really want to choose the images that are going to be the most effective at showing the details

83
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,390
so I'm really practicing the less is more approach with this project.

84
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:30,000
I found one image I think could really display both the products or package designs that I developed

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,920
for this project instead of showing lots of different ones I feel like showing the one worked a lot

86
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,280
better.

87
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,850
I also took a more editorial design layout approach to this.

88
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:45,120
And don't worry about being too matchy matchy so with our first theme we kind of had our branded colors

89
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,310
in this block of copy.

90
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,590
We're still using the same type or not changing our font or type style that's part of our brand but

91
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:59,160
it's OK to do maybe a white on black if I feel like it matches a little bit better with the project.

92
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,500
You don't have to keep the same white bar because it may not look as good with the next project as long

93
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:10,020
as you keep with the same fonts and type choices you could be a little bit more creative with how you

94
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:16,130
present another project so for this particular layout I had this little circle here why I wanted to

95
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:21,960
kind of zoom in and show little details of a project or illustration or a photo.

96
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,210
And so if you have a particular illustration where there's a lot of detailed work having a little circle

97
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:32,000
that zooms in on that really helps because as a PDA if it's only one size it's not like a Web site we

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,610
can download the photo and zoom in so kind of have that opportunity if you want to bring out details

99
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,490
of a particular project.

100
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,970
So there is our second project there's a lot quicker to put together and we have our first project done

101
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,200
as already.

102
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,840
I think we're going to be ready to create this cover photo.

103
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,640
This is going to be kind of the best page that we need to design we needed to really make this attention

104
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,670
grabbing as much as possible.

105
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,310
I'm going to go ahead drag in some of the elements that we're going to have to have on here like the

106
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,460
logo and maybe some of her branded colors.

107
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,420
And then we can figure out what photos will best represent our portfolio.

108
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,880
This is where we need to spend the most time.
