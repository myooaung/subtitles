1
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:10,100
Let's do another practice quote Before we move into developing our client contracts.

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,470
Hi my name is Dave and I'm a Marketing Manager from the big coffee place Inc.

3
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,730
And I was sent your contact information from a trusted colleague.

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:24,380
I was telling him that we needed a custom one time illustration for an upcoming ad we wanted to place

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,730
in a national campaign this fall to promote our new pumpkin spice cappuccino.

6
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,360
We are contacting two other illustrators but wanted to see if you did not mind sending us a quote for

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,310
this project.

8
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,270
I've attached a sample of the scope of the illustration we will need for the ad if you have any questions

9
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,060
feel free to reach out to me personally.

10
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,860
There is a lot to break down here.

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,870
First of all the client is large.

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,220
This is a national chain similar to maybe a Starbucks.

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,720
This would be a huge thing for our portfolio.

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:00,590
When a client is large the danger of pricing too low is the idea of perceived value when we price too

15
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,190
low.

16
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:06,710
They may assume we are more amateur than anticipated are new to the business because we did not know

17
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,180
how to properly value or price ourselves.

18
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:14,060
If we over price we could risk losing this job to the other two freelancers.

19
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,280
There is a fine line here and we're going to do our best to read between the lines and to find the right

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,330
pricing so let's review our scales here to help us find out where this project might land.

21
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,970
It's a large client with one single project.

22
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,750
Let's once again try for fixed pricing model just because of its simplicity but also because the fact

23
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,390
that the client is expecting a fixed price quote based on the project type and how that is standard

24
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,520
in the illustration arena the client size they're huge national chain.

25
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,250
They would fit squarely into the Tier 3 client box.

26
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:54,910
So we're going to have way more pricing power to the upside secondly project exposure is high.

27
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,210
It will be a national campaign and several magazines and maybe even digital ads.

28
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,560
We can always ask follow up questions about whether will be outside of the print medium to get a better

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,550
sense of the project exposure or scope.

30
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:14,420
Lastly experience level let's say I am an intermediate level illustrator and I've done illustrations

31
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,830
for three to five years.

32
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,160
I have a little pricing power but it's not unlimited.

33
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,160
Let's put all this together with the research we gathered about similar projects in the industry by

34
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,060
looking at community posts from Google and other sources.

35
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,790
This is the fix project scale I have price projects on before.

36
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:38,420
Based on those three factors I feel comfortable pricing above what I've ever priced before but not a

37
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:44,570
huge jump but a modest jump considering I've never worked with a national client before two thousand

38
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,820
dollars seems a bit too rounded.

39
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,530
Let's tweak that and say twenty one hundred dollars.

40
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,890
That number feels a little bit more customized to the client.

41
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:59,210
Let's place this quote on a formal proposal and maybe even customize this proposal with some illustrative

42
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:05,990
work just to impress them when they need to be impressed the most we heard back from the client and

43
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,850
we got the job yay.

44
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,740
Two things.

45
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,490
Now we need to think about first of all client contracts with larger clients.

46
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:19,820
They usually have one ready to go just to make sure it protects you as a freelancer as well as them.

47
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,470
We'll focus a little bit more on contracts and the next section of this course.

48
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,990
Secondly we need to adjust our pricing scale.

49
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,320
There was no hesitation on the client's end.

50
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,420
They accepted it without any issues or pushback.

51
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,250
That means there's a good chance we could have gotten away with charging more.

52
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,600
Let's readjust our scale a little higher so that next time we have a client and a similar range we can

53
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,580
go for a little bit of a higher pricing.

54
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,560
This is exactly how pricing gets easier the more projects he complete.

55
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,290
It's important to assess client reactions to each project quote to gauge whether your pricing too high

56
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,630
to low or just right.

57
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,970
Rarely you will nail it on the first few quotes but at least you now have a few ways to help you feel

58
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,390
more confident and pricing those projects.

59
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,480
We can also use the same scale for our hourly rate.

60
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,000
We know we'd like to have 32 dollars per hour to maintain or desired annual income but we could take

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,270
our hourly rate and put it on the same scales to find out if we need to charge prices lower higher depending

62
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:24,370
on client size budget and project exposure.

63
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,170
So you've landed a client congratulations.

64
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,990
Now what.

65
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,580
How do we handle client projects timelines and even contracts.

66
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,440
We'll talk about that in the next section.

67
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,100
See there.
