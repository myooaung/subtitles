1
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,920
So what hourly rate do you charge when you're first starting out.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,990
What if you already have intermediate or advanced skills and experience before going freelance.

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:19,630
This lesson will review ways to help you figure out that perfect pricing for hourly rates.

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,090
First of all you have to do the research.

5
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:27,010
Each one of you will be in a different industry and finding that rate will largely depend on the current

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,260
average rate for someone of your same skill level.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,270
You can research what other freelancers charge in a variety of places.

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,940
First of all scouring websites like upward AECOM and finding profiles with similar work experience and

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,230
studying what they are charging.

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:47,410
I would look at more successful freelancers with higher earnings as those with lower earnings might

11
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,020
find out they are charging too much.

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,500
You can also ask other freelancers and Facebook freelancer groups communities and forms.

13
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,840
It's a hot topic question where you can really find open people just trying to gather some data to make

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,810
their own hourly rate determinations.

15
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:09,460
There are also Web sites like zip recruiter which gather data from people with your job title and location.

16
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:15,270
When researching hourly pricing and salary information online most of these Web sites will gather information

17
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:22,660
from salaried in-house workers and not from freelancers freelancers will almost always charge a higher

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:28,300
rate per hour than their salaried counterparts simply because salaried workers are most often offered

19
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,970
benefits like health insurance retirement.

20
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,600
That's also a part of compensation that's not in their hourly rate.

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,960
As a freelancer you're responsible for all of your benefits and that only comes from your hourly rate.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,720
Hence why you notice freelancers charging 20 to 30 percent more than those salaried counterparts after

23
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,770
getting a good general range for what seems to be the going rate for other freelancers in your industry.

24
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,260
Let's start to get a little more personal.

25
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,920
The next step is to create a target annual income for yourself.

26
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:06,250
Make sure you download the worksheet for this lesson to work alongside me in these calculations let's

27
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:11,460
first define our goal annual salary by figuring out our monthly income requirements.

28
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,010
This would be what you'd like to make working full time in our field.

29
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,050
It's has to be based on realistic expectations.

30
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:24,790
Industry averages but also what you will need to make going freelance possible for you and your family.

31
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:30,280
For some of you only going part time this will be your goals for how much extra added income you'd like

32
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,980
to add now that we figured out our monthly income that we'd like or need.

33
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,470
Let's figure out what we need to make to equal the benefits from our old job or the amount of benefits

34
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,110
we'd like to have added to our salary.

35
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,720
Just like our full time job.

36
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,500
So let's say I need a thousand dollars for health insurance for my family of five.

37
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,920
This would be monthly.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,140
I would then add that to my monthly income figures.

39
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,410
But I'd also like to start or match my current month retirement.

40
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,210
I get from my full time job so that would be five hundred dollars lastly we need to factor in taxes

41
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,650
into the calculations.

42
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,920
Every country will be different with taxes in the United States.

43
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,430
The salary would most likely fall in the 10 percent tax bracket.

44
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,070
So multiplying my salary not including benefits as they're sometimes not taxed.

45
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,110
If you set up a retirement account and I'm going to multiply that figure by point 0 1 I get something

46
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,180
close to about 400 dollars.

47
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,920
So in my case I round my number up just to be extra cautious and to make sure I'm factoring in enough

48
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,720
for taxes.

49
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:41,130
You always want to factor taxes in once we tally up our total benefits plus monthly salary we need we

50
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:49,920
subtract our taxes let's multiply that total figure by twelve to get our annual income goal will want

51
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,520
to find an hourly rate that can get us our annual income goals.

52
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,140
Let's Next figure out how many hours we'd like to work each month.

53
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,700
Let's say I want a typical 40 hour workweek in the world of freelance you can expect at least one hour

54
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,340
each day to be non paid activities.

55
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,340
So instead of your standard eight hours a day for the calculation let's use only seven hours a day to

56
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,390
make up for that one hour of anticipated unpaid work.

57
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:23,250
Accounting finding clients etc. we would expect in freelancing so seven hours daily and we want to work

58
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,270
five days a week.

59
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:31,740
That is 35 billable work hours per week and we want to multiply that by 52 weeks to find our total work

60
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,960
hours for the year.

61
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:39,510
But we want to factor in a few weeks of vacation and sick days since freelancing can take its toll.

62
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,060
We should give us more than what a standard job in our field would give.

63
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:49,940
If the standard in the United States for vacation is two weeks let's give ourselves three so instead

64
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:56,000
of multiplying our hours by that 52 week number let's multiply our thirty five hours per week by forty

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,750
nine weeks which equals one thousand seven hundred and fifteen hours.

66
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,990
That's how many billable work hours we have this year.

67
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,050
This is a fairly realistic figure.

68
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,000
Our number of hours we have worked to produce money.

69
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,050
We have our desired annual salary figured out as well.

70
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,930
So let's take our total desired annual salary of fifty five thousand and divide it by our total available

71
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,190
work hours for the year which is one thousand seven hundred fourteen.

72
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:27,260
Once again those seeking part time freelance will still do this but with less hours and a little bit

73
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,230
lower numbers.

74
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:34,340
But it all works out the same and the hourly rate we came up with is thirty two dollars.

75
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:39,050
This happens to line up with some research I was doing for beginner to intermediate level designers

76
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,240
and Lillian's local area.

77
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,550
This may not be the only rate we use when quoting clients but it gives us a general idea or range of

78
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:52,160
pricing that would help us reach our income goals instead of staying strict with a thirty two dollar

79
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,830
number.

80
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,640
We can create a save range we can move up and down on the scale depending on the client size scope of

81
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,520
the project.

82
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:06,830
Project exposure and project type later on will determine exactly what our hourly range will be based

83
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:12,930
on the scale and learn how to factor in everything to pick that exact hourly pricing.

84
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,980
So let's talk about our other pricing model first and figure out fixed project pricing.
