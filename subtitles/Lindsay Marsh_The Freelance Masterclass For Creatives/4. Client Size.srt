1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,180
The higher and more advanced your skill level the more power you have with pushing for higher pricing.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,290
But now we have another element we need to seriously take a look at.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,670
That's your ability for your client to afford your pricing.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,920
What good is a quote for a project if they may not afford or even worse you're under charging so much

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,040
that they do not take you seriously.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,040
I signed clients into three main tiers the first tier is going to be your non-profits your small local

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,630
companies or startups.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:34,620
This may be a small cleaning company a small coffeehouse with one or two locations or a local newspaper.

9
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,120
You're not going to have as much pricing power with his clients simply because they don't have the budget

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,070
to afford an expensive freelancer.

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,380
They're also not looking to spend a lot of money here and they're okay with the quality of the project

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,860
not being at agency level quality as long as it's done well and done on time.

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,790
A Tier 2 client is going to be a bit larger.

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,350
Perhaps they have around 10 to 100 employees maybe even up to 200 employees.

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,700
They have a couple thousand likes on their social media page and he may know them already from some

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,270
marketing they do regionally.

17
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,450
They're looking to grow and they've also looking to invest some more money so they have a little bit

18
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,170
of a larger budget to work with.

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,800
These guys also have a little bit more flexibility with pricing and they may even have a marketing person

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,930
that contacted you instead of a founder or CEO that would indicate a larger marketing budget.

21
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,500
I start to get a little bit more aggressive with my pricing when it comes to Tier 2 clients.

22
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,720
I'm also looking at my exposure which will get into the next lesson.

23
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,850
It could be that a social media graphic I'm designing for them may receive over 2000 likes and 50 shares.

24
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,510
They may even do a paid Facebook campaign and my work is out there getting even more exposure.

25
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,560
Remember when we mentioned how higher exposure of your project equals higher pricing on my part.

26
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,940
Tier 3 clients are dream clients.

27
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,830
Sometimes they're big ad agencies.

28
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,190
Sometimes they're smaller ad agencies that landed a large client and they need your help.

29
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,620
They may have a hundred plus employees work they've done that you'll be coding for may end up being

30
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,830
in national magazines or large ad campaigns.

31
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:12,080
A local design that you do may end up being printed on over 10000 different letterheads at some point

32
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,920
they may send out annual reports to 5000 plus donors.

33
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,940
They may even be a publicly traded company they may even have user impressions on content they post

34
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,530
and the tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands and maybe even millions.

35
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,630
I have incredibly high flexibility when pricing for these clients of course they still me to afford

36
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:37,150
me and there's no point in pricing so sky high that they simply move on to the next person because they're

37
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,160
more on point with budget.

38
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,960
So even though this is the highest I would price it's still not unreasonable.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,010
Remember when pricing for these sized clients you're most likely not the only one they're seeking a

40
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:48,960
quote from.

41
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,280
Sometimes it's required by the company policy to gather at least three quotes on any given contract

42
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,490
now that we're able to size up our client into one of these three tiers one two or three.

43
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,230
This is where does start to get a little complicated.

44
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,590
We're going to explore one other aspect of pricing which is project exposure and then we'll have our

45
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:15,200
three main ingredients to start formulating our perfect quote Let's do some examples.

46
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,830
Let's say I'm an intermediate level graphic designer.

47
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,770
I have about four years of experience and I'm starting to feel comfortable doing a wide variety of different

48
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:28,490
design projects and have a little pricing power based on an intermediate level experience.

49
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,240
I have a new potential client that approached me for a project quote They're a local nonprofit and they

50
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,080
just don't have a large budget.

51
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,120
I care a lot about their costs I'm going to be a little flexible with my pricing.

52
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,100
Plus they have a lot of donors that need design work and if I do a great job this may lead to more Tier

53
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:51,360
2 or even Tier 3 clients they're going to need some event design work including posters invites name

54
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,150
tags and advertising designed for the event since they're a tier one.

55
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:00,140
And even though I'm an intermediate level designer I'm going to still need to be careful with my pricing

56
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,560
and not price too high.

57
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,350
I've already established my hourly pricing according to my skill level and basis pricing line based

58
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:14,090
on research I've done with other designers and from up works com and other freelancing Web sites.

59
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:20,700
I fall right about here in this area for this example at least now I need to look at the client tier

60
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,900
they're Tier 1.

61
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,500
So that means I need to possibly price lower on my experience level range scale.

62
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,530
If I did not size up the client and assign them to a tier category I would not really know where on

63
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,180
that range I should price.

64
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,700
So gauging your skill and experience level with the client here helps to slowly narrow it down to a

65
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:46,130
proper and reasonable price on the scale same goes for fixed project quotes as opposes hourly quotes

66
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,010
for fixed project quotes.

67
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:53,020
I would come up with a scale for each type of project to create quotes for each one of my projects.

68
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:58,310
If there's multiple projects involved that would eventually end up being line items and my final quote

69
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,340
it does not deviate a drastic bout from my desired average but just enough to make me affordable to

70
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:13,150
this client let's do one more example a client approaches me about creating an ad campaign this ad campaign

71
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,910
will contain four full page magazine ads and a paid Instagram and Facebook at the campaign will have

72
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:24,340
the same theme throughout which I will also assist in creating the look and feel and the design of the

73
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,210
graphic.

74
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,960
How do I quote such a project.

75
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,230
First of all what is my experience level.

76
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:35,140
Let's say I fall right about here and this experience level two years as a freelancer and I've done

77
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,770
10 or so separate client projects paid.

78
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:43,770
There are three main skill or experience levels involved here but fortunately it exists on a scale I'd

79
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,870
fall right about here with what I describe so far.

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,580
So how do I come up with hourly or fixed project costs that exist on this experience scale.

81
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,500
I have source them from other freelancers with different experience levels and I've also done some research

82
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:05,770
to figure out the value range of a graphic designer in my country I have found top hourly prices and

83
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:10,420
I've also saw some lower prices too but I also have designed these to be in a range.

84
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,730
I feel most comfortable with personally.

85
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:18,250
So in this case anything under 20 dollars an hour does not even exist because I do not feel comfortable

86
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,740
charging less than this.

87
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,700
Also anything over 80 dollars is not included because I do not feel comfortable charging that at this

88
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,430
time.

89
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,710
This can be a very personal thing for you.

90
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:33,690
I also went over to help WorldCom to find graphic designers with these skill levels to find out what

91
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,920
they were charging.

92
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,990
I also know what ive charge clients in the past two years that helped me find out the sweet spot for

93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,100
these rates.

94
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:46,410
What is great about the scale is I can use it over and over once I develop my scale I'm happy with I

95
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:52,410
can also tweak it later if I want to raise my lowest price to 30 dollars per hour for example.

96
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:58,240
Lastly I can switch this to a fixed project based scale instead of just an hourly one.

97
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:03,870
If I'm interested in a fixed project quote I simply do the same research but with fixed project costs

98
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,890
instead back to our example.

99
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,390
Now I know where I fall in the scale let's size up the client.

100
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,410
The client is a large regional mall.

101
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:17,270
They're well-known in the area and they people drive large distances to go to the small.

102
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:23,030
They've also included many high end stores and their current marketing is done by a local ad agency.

103
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,760
So based on my client tier system which year can be created custom to you I've put them solidly in Tier

104
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,570
2.

105
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,880
Let's look at the our clients tier level.

106
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:37,010
But let's factor in our skill and experience level because this is a client that may have a decent marketing

107
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:37,560
budget.

108
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,800
I can stretch my pricing power a little bit and quote on the higher end of my range maybe right about

109
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,680
here.

110
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:49,280
This is not an exact science but a guide for you to use to find a range that's most reasonable for you

111
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,220
and your client.

112
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,360
We now have two factors that we could use to help us narrow down our pricing.

113
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,870
There's another factor that we can use to help solidify our pricing and that's exposure.

114
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,720
The project will have and we'll do that in the next lesson.
