00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.600
Wendy you know how to quit your full time job to pursue your freelance business full time.

2
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.560
It's one of the most challenging things to decide as a freelancer.

3
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:20.270
This chart a downloadable resource is a rough guide in helping you plot out when you might make that

4
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.130
important decision.

5
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.660
You will notice in this chart that the point where you switch to full time freelance and perhaps even

6
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.700
quit your job comes before you exceeded your current monthly income from your non freelance job or salary.

7
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.510
This may surprise a lot of people as most people think you should wait until you replace your salary

8
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.320
at your current income to move into full time freelancing.

9
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.890
This is not always the case.

10
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.800
As sometimes devoting your full time energy into your freelance business is what can help propel it

11
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.320
to that higher month over month income growth rate this chart also encourages you not to quit your main

12
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.920
income source or salary job until you reach a point of consistency month over month growth in your business.

13
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.140
Consistency is having average growth that exceeds a certain point for at least four to six months in

14
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.220
a row.

15
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.620
This makes sure your freelance business will have that can constant growth and income before jumping

16
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.260
all in remember growth in your freelance business is not always a continual upward growth curve.

17
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.410
There could be down months or months of decelerated growth and this is normal but overall a good sign

18
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.340
is seeing several months of consistent month over month income growth.

19
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.890
So the first stage is the exploration stage and you'll notice slow growth month over month.

20
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.460
You're exploring and testing the possibilities of this being a profitable business and you're also seeking

21
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.150
out clients.

22
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.720
The next stage is the high growth stage and this is where your month over month income enters double

23
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.920
digit growth.

24
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.600
For example 10 percent month over month growth for at least four to six consecutive months.

25
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.380
You may have a month where it dips and changes but over a few month time span your average growth rate

26
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.960
remains high.

27
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.160
This is usually the point where you can achieve several months of steady growth proving your freelance

28
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.940
business's potential for long term sustained growth.

29
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.800
You'll notice the inflection point here and this is the point where you notice an upward month over

30
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.420
month growth or improvement in earnings that jumps more than any prior months.

31
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.070
And this is when you start to enter into that high growth stage after being in the high growth stage

32
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.940
for several months.

33
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.690
Some people it takes a couple of years you'll have this proof of growth which is kind of your green

34
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.370
light to quit your job and after achieving four to six months of consistent average double digit growth

35
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.100
you could explore the possibility of quitting your job that's no longer desired are setting aside what

36
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.590
is taking time that could otherwise be spent growing your freelance business then we have salary replacement.

37
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.390
This is the point in the income growth chart where you have your first month of freelance income that

38
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.690
replaces your old job or salary income.

39
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.420
The orange line indicates replacing your salary plus any benefits like retirement you receive in addition

40
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.740
to your salary and then there's the flat growth stage.

41
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.450
This is a natural flattening out of the monthly income growth curve.

42
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.480
And this is very common to see flat growth in income.

43
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.680
After an intense growth stage.

44
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.440
You could see a boost of income yet again after this black growth stage or continuation of flat earnings

45
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.390
with some slight dips that can occur what you're really looking for here is a moment where quitting

46
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.330
your salary job can give you the time and focus needed to boost that consistent growing business that

47
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.840
has proven itself with income.

48
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.100
There is no perfect time to go full time but I think this is a rough guide for starting to think about

49
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.860
where that moment may fall for you.

50
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.230
So the next logical question is how many hours should I work every day.

51
00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.440
Let's talk about the time commitment you should expect when moving from part time to full time obviously

52
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.990
when working a full time job you can only commit evening or off hours to the business at max you might

53
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:12.130
be able to do three to four hours during the beginning growth stage of your business once you make a

54
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.690
commitment to go full time and let go of your other work job responsibilities.

55
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.410
You now have a full eight hour day to commit to growing your client base and growing your income.

56
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.940
There is a tendency to exceed that standard eight hour day when your income starts to increase.

57
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.670
It is normal psychological response to invest more time into something that's working or becoming successful.

58
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.280
When you go past that nine hour daily time commitment you start to reach an unhealthy level of daily

59
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.990
work time and naturally after your business reaches a certain growth point and client base residual

60
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.480
income and our client referrals will allow you to spend less time on finding new work clients and giving

61
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:59.200
you the chance to actually bring your daily time or hourly commitment down below eight hours and perhaps

62
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.420
even less than your previous job as you have more control over your productivity.

63
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.280
Remember you are the most valuable asset to your freelance business and making sure you take care of

64
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.150
yourself by not overworking is important.

65
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.790
Make sure to take regular breaks and take a look at your productivity.

66
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.740
Are there activities you can do to help you streamline your time so you're spending less and less time

67
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.390
doing those repetitive tasks.
