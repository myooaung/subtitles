00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.730
So now that we've built an online portfolio using Adobe Portfolio I thought I would also talk about

2
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:12.370
big hands.

3
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.960
Dot com bee hands is owned by Adobe but this what's great about bee hands is it's absolutely free to

4
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.000
sign up for an account.

5
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.530
It's basically a social media site for creative freelancers and other creatives not just freelancers

6
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.240
but anybody in the creative business and any type of creative business.

7
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.760
So photography web design graphic design illustration even copywriting all all sorts of things are represented

8
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.150
here if you're a creative freelancer you have to be on big hands.

9
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.750
I've noticed a lot of people getting jobs some students getting jobs through B.A. by just posting some

10
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.930
strong work and it was shared and it was featured and they happened to get a job because a potential

11
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.740
clients all that work saw that it was featured and they contacted them.

12
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.530
So it's a great way to kind of find work.

13
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.870
It's going to take a while to get to that point you have to have an incredibly amazing project to really

14
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.900
kind of stand out from the crowd because it's a very overcrowded space.

15
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.580
There's a lot of creative freelancers on here vying for the attention of ad agencies and other clients

16
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.040
who might be kind of looking for talent here.

17
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.840
So it's so don't expect to just get jobs falling from the sky but at least it's a first step because

18
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.450
having a profile on here is better than not.

19
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.800
And it doesn't take a lot of time to set up so we're gonna just go through the very basics of getting

20
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.680
it set up.

21
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.410
And if you're already familiar with the Dobie portfolio which we just kind of I just did a little sample

22
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.450
overview of that in the last few lessons then you'll be right at home because it's the very same builder

23
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.420
to build out your projects.

24
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.010
So here is your portfolio or your profile I guess I should say on bee hence make sure you have if you

25
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.810
have your Web site.

26
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.190
This is why having the Web site is so important.

27
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.630
We're all also going to be doing a wordpress kind of reviewing that and a few other Web site options

28
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.950
but go and get that Web site going to be posting it everywhere when we do our marketing where we do

29
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.720
our social media campaigns.

30
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.640
So you get a need to have that so you can go ahead and list as many projects as you want.

31
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.890
Of course less is more.

32
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.930
But this is kind of more of a social media account.

33
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.000
So as you come up with new projects and client work you know post this as you continually get more projects

34
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.280
because it's only going to give you more exposure.

35
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.960
And when you post will go over this in a little bit when you post a new project you can put in certain

36
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.340
tags and terms search terms in there so if someone searches letterhead design or someone searches product

37
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.800
photography you'll have those tags as a part of your project and you have a chance to be shown in the

38
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.970
search results.

39
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.610
So we'll go over how to properly do that soon.

40
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.020
So yeah going to be able to put your titles so make sure you have kind of a title developed for yourself

41
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.540
and also that bio is going to come in handy Of course when you're doing online profile social media

42
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.420
type bios you may want to tweak it a little bit you can be a little bit more raw and natural and a little

43
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.280
more authentic.

44
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.380
You don't have to be so much like you're applying for a job you can be a little bit more friendly and

45
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.790
open and honest with your bios for social media.

46
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.050
So let's go ahead and get started.

47
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.040
I'm going to start a new project to go up here to create a new project.

48
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.190
And so this will be very similar to to the last web builder we worked with.

49
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.950
You got to be able to add files text or be a boat to embed YouTube videos or anything that has embed

50
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.720
code.

51
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.040
You also going to be able to create gallery or photo grids.

52
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.070
So we're gonna build this out just like we would a landing page on a project on a Web site.

53
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.500
So it's going to be very similar bigger the better in terms of photos you really want to show off the

54
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.870
visual creative skills you have and make sure you have big photos that go all the way across the page

55
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:54.120
for the for the B Hantz type of items so be Hantz projects are a little less focused on the description

56
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.900
and a little more focused on this visual.

57
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.640
So this is an example of a really strong post.

58
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.960
There's not a lot of text involved in describing the whole project like it would on your personal portfolio.

59
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.560
So they're focusing on the images and they're big and they're beautiful nicely crafted photos here you

60
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.370
can see there's not a lot of words describing each thing because it's pretty obvious what what we're

61
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:22.040
kind of looking at the photos kind of help describe the project so the easiest thing to do is get all

62
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.770
of your project images ready and crafted so all you do is load these in so we're going to do just that

63
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.800
I have all these photos ready all the mockups and everything that I did to create this project I'm gonna

64
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.840
go ahead and upload all the files at once everything in my folder and it's going to do it in a random

65
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.060
order but that's OK because we're gonna be able to reorder our projects and once all those load in you

66
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.030
go up to any edit of any photo and I'll have a little option that says reorder project we're going to

67
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.460
reorder the project we can shift these around any way we'd like we have our already kind of had that

68
00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.000
as my headline photo or my start or photo and we can order these any way we want.

69
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.420
So I'm gonna go ahead and click on save any order and see how it looks like and see how quick it is

70
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.520
to to kind of create this you can also add a description text anything here if you wanted to kind of

71
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.310
have a project header push your project will already have a project name so you can go ahead and describe

72
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:22.160
what your project is using the project name so you have the chance to kind of put a little buffer there

73
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.850
in terms of having some margin or not you can have it be full screen so I'm looking through the order

74
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.970
here I think this is probably very zoomed in I kind of want to show a little bit more of these two photos

75
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:42.920
side by side so I'm gonna go ahead and delete this project or delete that image and I'm going to do

76
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.810
this side by side so what I'm going to do is I'm going to insert a gallery I'm gonna go and click on

77
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.960
this icon right here and I'm going to upload both of those files and I'm going to load them side by

78
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.460
side.

79
00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.380
And what's great about that is it's not so zoomed in I'm able to kind of really see those projects together

80
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.960
so you can also do galleries to do side by side photos if you feel like a photo is going to be way too

81
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.370
zoomed in you're not going to be able to see the details especially with photography that's another

82
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.780
way you can do it is putting two side by sides together and of course you could do more than two if

83
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:23.490
you wanted to and it scrolls down you can also add video as well you can do an embed so we can go up

84
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:30.940
here and in bed here's the embed link I can copy and paste from YouTube my promo video for this.

85
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.940
This is my promo video that I want to also embed and might be hands profile I think videos go a long

86
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.870
way in helping describe projects.

87
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:43.950
Big fan of videos so I'm gonna go ahead and embed this clicking on the embed option when I go to share

88
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:50.770
and I'm just going to pop that into here and it's going to embed that video for me.

89
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.830
So if we want to include that at the bottom or the beginning of our project I think video is very very

90
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:56.460
helpful.

91
00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:03.010
And selling yourself or you can edit styles and layout there's going to be spacing stylings are going

92
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:09.090
to go down here and see the spacing between these is almost none but you can increase and decrease it

93
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:17.880
and also change the background colors if you want to do black this is a simple project that does not

94
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.200
need descriptions but you can also add type in here as well.

95
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:27.750
If you want to add descriptions so the most important part about posting a project on big hands is the

96
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.900
tags and the descriptions that you put when you post it.

97
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.250
Let's go and click on Save and we're going to continue.

98
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.400
And this is the most vital part of everything.

99
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.950
Putting it together is the easy part because we already had those so project title.

100
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.430
You want to use a title that has a lot of keywords that of people that would be searching for your type

101
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.910
of creative skills.

102
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.750
So if you're a web designer you might want to put you x y.

103
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.910
That's something that's a part of your project.

104
00:07:50.910 --> 00:08:00.890
So I'm gonna do logo design and branding project for Pacific calm and so I have logo design and branding

105
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.410
so those are some keywords that are already in there.

106
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:08.010
Course it does limit you to how many words and letters that you can use.

107
00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:08.850
So cover photo.

108
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:13.110
This is what people will see went on the search that you really need to make this high impact.

109
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:19.700
A lot of times I like to zoom in on small details instead of having a lot of detail so right about here

110
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.460
could also be the t shirt but I don't feel that really describes the project quite as well.

111
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.110
So let's just stick to the water bottle.

112
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.560
We can even zoom in.

113
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.990
This is a high resolution enough photo looks a little blurry when I do that zoom in on the Golden Ratio

114
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:40.810
part of the logo design or just stick right to that right.

115
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.890
So we have our thing we can go and crop and continue.

116
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:52.930
So go ahead and add your creative fields so I can do branding I can do graphic design as well.

117
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.340
Get select up to three.

118
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.240
OK done.

119
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:03.660
And tools used I can say the software that is more is more detail you can provide the easier searchable

120
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.650
your project will be

121
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:13.190
you can add copyright or licensing or get over licensing a little bit later in the class but I usually

122
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:20.540
like to stick with the default unless you have something in mind for that and go ahead and don't forget

123
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.280
this is the tab and you're tempted to click on publish.

124
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.620
Don't forget these little tabs appear.

125
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.160
Just make sure you kind of work through those tapped as well.

126
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.220
Easy to miss those.

127
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.580
And so especially this tab this is where all those keywords are really going to come in handy.

128
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.930
And so it's very easy to miss that tab.

129
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:42.010
So we're gonna go ahead and write a good description for this just as much as they'll allow us to do

130
00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:47.630
because it helps with search for people finding and searching your project when they search for specific

131
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.570
keywords so key words.

132
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:55.350
Think about the keywords for your particular type of projects are going to do branding.

133
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.980
Logo Design.

134
00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:00.340
Logo

135
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.390
marketing golden ratio.

136
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.180
Because this is the golden ratio which is a way to kind of do a logo design.

137
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:16.750
So that's specific to my project that you can add up to 10.

138
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.390
So really maximize all 10 if you can.

139
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:20.590
All right.

140
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.980
So when we're done with our keyword let's go ahead and publish this as a real project that I'm posting

141
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.790
so I'm ready to go go out ready to publish.

142
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:33.950
So it's always a little nerve wracking when you're publishing a project so you can all share your profile

143
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.650
with anybody that you want.

144
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:41.960
And there it is there's a little quick project we put together on behalf and I'll show you what it looks

145
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.720
like on my profile.

146
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.130
Of course I can always move the video and put the video a little bit higher up

147
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:08.860
this is what it looks like in the profile.

148
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:13.330
You could see how important that cover photo is trying to keep it as simple as possible.

149
00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.830
So there we go continue to add your projects as you get a chance and build that portfolio and be able

150
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.430
to send that out to clients but also be discovered by who knows who.
