00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.970
You can never be too careful with photo and licensing.

2
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.840
I once got in trouble for using a photo that was copyrighted.

3
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.160
The photo was included with something I downloaded online for free and I assumed all the contents inside

4
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.720
were also free.

5
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.860
Little did I know a large stock photo company sent me a bill for the use of the photo books.

6
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.780
Fourteen hundred dollar mistake.

7
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.660
How do I make sure all photos are used for projects both personal and paid for clients are safe to use.

8
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.540
There are a few things need to know when buying and downloading free photos.

9
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.970
First of all I'd like to start with the easy free to use licenses as they seem to be less complicated

10
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.980
in nature with no strings attached.

11
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.640
These are the Creative Commons zero are sometimes seen as zero when listing the type of license the

12
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.770
photo uses.

13
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.460
Take for example pixels dot com or pics eBay.

14
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.400
Most photos on these Web sites are open source and free to use.

15
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.430
They come with a C C zero or creative commons zero license.

16
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.710
These are as free to use as it gets.

17
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.970
You don't have to even provide attribution or link back to the original author although it's still nice

18
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.800
to do they still come with a few rules which you can look at on each photo and you cannot resell the

19
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.640
image without modifying it significantly.

20
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.280
You can also not offer it as a free download on your own Web site.

21
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.470
You never own the photo you're just free to use it for projects for both commercial paid and personal

22
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.100
use Creative Commons is a common form of open source photo licensing.

23
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.340
They come with a few stages of protection for the author of the photo.

24
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.510
It is good to understand these different types of licensing.

25
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.060
As you hunt down free photos as they will let you know if you need to offer a link or small print giving

26
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.160
credit to the original author or not.

27
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.610
Or if you have the ability to use that free photo for commercial use remix culture allows you to remix

28
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.590
or combine this photo and alter it in some way to create a different or unique picture.

29
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.070
Take for example a double exposure of two images.

30
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.880
I'm on Wikipedia for example and typed in graphic design.

31
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.350
I click on the first photo available and I look down at the license for each photo.

32
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.410
If I want to use this photo in one of my videos I am free to do so because it's marked as public domain.

33
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.910
This photo has been released to the public and there's no license attached to it.

34
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.840
I have noticed a few photos later on that's titled C.C. b y essay 3.0.

35
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.890
This is a creative commons license.

36
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.630
I look back at the chart or click on the license you can read all about what you need to do to be able

37
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.620
to use this photo.

38
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.960
In this case I would need to give some sort of attribution to the author when using this photo.

39
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.610
So we talked about free photos but what about paid stock photography.

40
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.790
What are the rules there.

41
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.610
Not all paid stock photography is the same.

42
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.710
You'll sometimes see two different types of licensing levels that you could purchase the stock photo

43
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.300
and they need to pay attention to how you're going to use it because maybe you need the higher priced

44
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.970
extended license and not even know it each photo license is different depending on both the platform

45
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:14.920
and the author.

46
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.390
For example on this photo a standard license would be three credits or thirty three dollars and would

47
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.880
allow me to use it on items that would be printed or appear in less than a half million items.

48
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.010
But I cannot use it on physical products for resale.

49
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.460
A T-shirt for example although I can use it for a printed poster I just can't sell that poster online

50
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:42.050
for a price but I can use it as design for a client poster for example if I planned on multiple users

51
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.590
or computers being able to use this photo.

52
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.880
I do need to purchase an extended license for this photo.

53
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.050
The word multi seat is a term to explain this concept of multiple users being able to download and use

54
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.510
this photo for your company for example.

55
00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.460
Also if I wanted to place this item on something that's going to be printed on more than a half million

56
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.180
items.

57
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.120
You're going to need the extended license for this photo.

58
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.730
Also if I wanted to sell my poster design and use this photo as a part of it I'm going to need the extended

59
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.380
license for this photo.

60
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.020
Each photo will have different stipulations for when you need a standard license and when you'll need

61
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.570
the extended license.

62
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.430
A lot of people think they can purchase a standard stock photo license and placed in their photo library

63
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.610
and continue to use it Klein after client.

64
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:35.000
But if I buy a photo for client A's brochure I cannot use it again for clients B poster until I purchase

65
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.230
a second license with that client.

66
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.730
It would not be very fair to the original photographer if I did so as I'm using it for two different

67
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.510
clients but they only got paid once with photo.

68
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.460
Also I think some people make the mistake of purchasing a standard license on a photo and placing it

69
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.890
on a coffee mug for example for resale.

70
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.380
What they needed was the extended license.

71
00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.650
There's a pretty big penalty to placing a photo on a graphic for a t shirt without the proper license.

72
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.310
Remember not all graphics need to be purchased.

73
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.490
Try to create you are combining with several different free to use graphic resources that have open

74
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.920
license and create something unique.

75
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.430
Do not make the same mistake I did and assume a photo you received in a free template you found online

76
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.470
is free to use as well.

77
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.560
A totally legal double check the license of a free download a template to make sure the photo is covered

78
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.430
or is an open creative commons photo.

79
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.220
Interested in contributing a photo or image to the Creative Commons calls visit Creative Commons dot

80
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.080
org slash choose and pick the type of license you want to create for your photo.

81
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.510
Then whenever you post your photo for free you can attach a license to it to let others know what they

82
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.940
need to do to properly use your photo if anything at all.
