00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.800
So I spent a few minutes using the builder to add new assets and build out this page.

2
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.770
And so far I kind of have something very very simple kind of have that quote I used our PDA portfolio

3
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.390
as a guide to kind of how to build out this page and what images to use.

4
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.230
So that's already kind of been determined and I'm sprinkling a little bit of description throughout

5
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.150
instead of having one big old description.

6
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.250
I can kind of have some photos that go along with it.

7
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:38.030
So it feels like there's a mixture of photos and text to read as you kind of scroll down through each

8
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.770
one.

9
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.980
So all the way down to the bottom of the Web site of course you do want to have too many at this point

10
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.410
you just need to stop and you know we can always if you feel like your project needs a really really

11
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.420
really long page describe it all.

12
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.980
Sometimes having the use of video is not a bad idea at all to have video as a way to help really describe

13
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.600
your course without them having to continually scroll scrolls role.

14
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.220
So we're going to create a extra little promo video for one of our projects in an upcoming bonus lesson

15
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.350
so you can go and check that out if you want to skip ahead.

16
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.360
So just kind of using this portfolio builder I'm not going to get into too much detail about how to

17
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.690
use it.

18
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.520
Actually it's pretty intuitive.

19
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.640
You can click here you can add images text and you can reorder though the order of everything as well

20
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.180
so you can add images text photo grids you can even bring in Lightroom photos audio video you can embed

21
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.600
YouTube videos as a way to add your videos.

22
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.220
Of course social icons and of course a contact form which we all need on our portfolio and you can easily

23
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.220
arrange these by hovering over any element here and then clicking on this edit icon and going down to

24
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.650
reorder page content.

25
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.320
And this is kind of your big plan.

26
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.350
So this lays out all the different things on your particular project page and you can sit there and

27
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.810
you can reorder these however you wish.

28
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.370
So you can kind of have you see your whole layout here so you can have a nice plan of how everything

29
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.960
looks and flows.

30
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.270
So that's just one project.

31
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.410
Let me go ahead and go back to the home page of course now that we finished the project we need to find

32
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.210
a really good cover photo for that.

33
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.970
So we need to probably edit and crop this particular one right here so I can just go click on the edit

34
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.920
and go to edit cover image.

35
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.690
You can show whatever you'd like.

36
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.210
You can even bring in one of your other project photos if you feel like that really tells the project

37
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.300
better.

38
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.970
So we can kind of have that have that wow image what's the most important photo to put on your cover.

39
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.800
That's how you get a really grab people.

40
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.810
I think this is nice because it's clean and we have a lot of thumbnails you're going to have a lot of

41
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.700
business business going on.

42
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.340
So choosing more clean thumbnails might be a good idea.

43
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.220
It's going to click on done.

44
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.050
That's going to update.

45
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.130
And so there's our first project when go ahead and add actually like the cover for the second project

46
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.650
and we can go and add all of that and go ahead do our second project or a third or fourth or fifth or

47
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.410
six.

48
00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:03.650
Go ahead and load all these and kind of see what this final portfolio will look like.

49
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.020
So what about a bio page on here that's going to be created very similar.

50
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.740
We're gonna go ahead and add a new page

51
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.410
of course it's going to give you some basic layout options I think it'd be really need to do kind of

52
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.850
a profile pic on the right with a little description on the left so it's going to click on that.

53
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:28.770
This will be about me because bio sounds a little impersonal and we've already done a lot of this hard

54
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:29.880
work already.

55
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.030
We already have this developed from our PDA portfolio.

56
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.910
Let's go ahead and get that nice statement highlight quote.

57
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.530
Make that a little bit bigger.

58
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.990
I'm going to be adding a button.

59
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.340
I think having a button here kind of a call to action you're on a bio page.

60
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.320
Let's have some kind of call to action button.

61
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.500
Work together contact me let's get together find a quote all these kind of buttons can kind of help

62
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.140
have some kind of action for that user or viewer to take after they read your beautifully well-written

63
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.830
bio and they've seen your picture always have some kind of call to action or send them to the contact

64
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.880
page where they'll be able to contact you or have that right there below just to make it easy.

65
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.680
It is adding a text box and we have everything we need here in our bio go and scroll up to our bio.

66
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.930
We can decide to use the third person bio on the Web site if we feel like that works a little bit better

67
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.120
in this portfolio it's really up to you.

68
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.610
We're going to try the third person bio here

69
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.990
and we have to do some significant little edits to the text and typography.

70
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.480
It's going to kind of highlight this and go ahead make it what we've been making everything which is

71
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:58.880
our Bitton Sands was trial lighter weight to light and make it a lot smaller and this is we're having

72
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.800
a little bit more of a reduced bio for a web digital environment.

73
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.800
I know we kind of had a longer one for PBF portfolio which is more of a formal document for a Web site

74
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.280
bio.

75
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:19.040
I would probably even cut as much as you can just say less with more I'd probably cut a few more lines

76
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.420
of type here.

77
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.050
Try to get it to a decent size.

78
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.300
So now let's add.

79
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.050
Let's go and change your name here.

80
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.780
We can even add our logo instead so we can go ahead and delete this and let's add our logo because that's

81
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.690
going to look really nice and what's great about this space is we can add our nice seal or circular

82
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.800
logo here.

83
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.420
You know look a little bit more professional

84
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.060
it's change the margin here and a little more padding

85
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.880
it's nice whitespace helps.

86
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.620
Everything look a little bit more professional.

87
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.400
So let's add a little headshot so there's a headshot.

88
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.800
Added I would say this is a very nice clean professional bio if I were to arrive on this person's web

89
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.300
site I would take them incredibly seriously.

90
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.210
I could scroll down here I can even click on the work together.

91
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.960
I can go down the social media they're giving me something to kind of click on.

92
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.240
I got a nice big bold photo here.

93
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.490
I think this looks great as a bio.

94
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.180
So now we have an about me.

95
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.370
We have our work we have a contact page where we can add a form on that contact page or some way to

96
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.260
to have them contact you we have kind of our other social media icons.

97
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.780
We even have a flutter at the bottom that has kind of our all rights reserved and we have six different

98
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.240
items here so you see how clean this is.

99
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.160
Let's go and preview the site and see how clean it is.

100
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.560
We don't need a lot of junk on our portfolio.

101
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.740
There it is we're on the Web site.

102
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.690
You can scroll over find the titles.

103
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.420
It's very easy to use and that's it.

104
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.890
We're not offering rows and rows and rows of projects.

105
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:10.710
It's nice and clean.

106
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.290
I feel like if I'm visiting this Web site I'm not overwhelmed.

107
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:19.290
I can click on one project and I can get a lot more detail that way if I want to find out more detail.

108
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.120
So there's kind of the landing page I have a little quote up at the top.

109
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.780
Everything's nice and readable.

110
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.140
This is nothing fancy there's not a whole lot of major design work going on here and this is all very

111
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:33.570
very basic and I know kind of put this together in about a half hour or so so you don't have to spend

112
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.390
a ton of time putting together a nice web site portfolio.

113
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.290
Let's go ahead and go back.

114
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.490
Of course there's always the ability to add video we're going to do a bonus video next we're going to

115
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:51.690
be able to switch out our theme and add a video driven portfolio for those who want to use a video real

116
00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.430
or want to show off your projects.

117
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:58.890
You can also embed them like we did in this project at the end and better YouTube video you can upload

118
00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:05.040
it to YouTube and get the embed code and you can be able to embed that on any Web site where you could

119
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.760
switch your themes at anytime and I'll automatically populate for you.

120
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:14.520
So if we wanted to switch to maybe this lug weak lug wig theme we can go ahead and click and it's going

121
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.160
to automatically populate.

122
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.490
That's one of the big benefits to this type of Web site so you can look I can all I have to do is switch

123
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:24.330
my logo out to make sure I have white type instead of dark.

124
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.290
But other than that I really really like this presentation.

125
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.200
This looks actually a lot better.

126
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:34.550
So scrolling down we have just six very simple projects here and that's it.

127
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.900
Look on nice and simple that is.

128
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.790
And so I would just need to do some work lightening that up.

129
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.760
I could even change this background to blue and maybe have a white logo that would look really nice

130
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.500
too.

131
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:50.850
So it's very easy to switch your themes and find out which one you want and it will automatically populate

132
00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.890
with all the content that you have.

133
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:57.260
So if we wanted to have one that had the headline driven thing or an image driven thing let's do that.

134
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:01.060
Marta click on that kind of see how that looks.

135
00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.960
So this would be good of course I'd have to change all that text out but this would be good you could

136
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.170
actually put a video I believe back here are photo and have it be driven with the headline and then

137
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:15.250
you scroll down to your content so you'd see all the wide variety of templates and options and it's

138
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.010
very very very quick to put together.

139
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:23.290
That's probably one of the big benefits to using Adobe Portfolio as your web builder of course you need

140
00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:27.960
to have a subscription to access this but I don't pay anything for my portfolio.

141
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:32.820
I don't I don't have a professional domain name linked up.

142
00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:38.710
I just kind of use the one that's that's here that you're seeing right now but you can easily link went

143
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:45.400
up if you go to Settings you can buy a domain name off GoDaddy or any other domain seller and you can

144
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:51.900
link up a professional domain name so that you don't have to have a portfolio dot Adobe slash something.

145
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:58.450
It could be your you know graphic design business or your photography business or whatever name that

146
00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.800
you have for your freelance creative business.

147
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:06.190
So I wanted to go over that real quickly of course I can't dive into all the little details or this

148
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:10.600
would be the longest class ever but there's so many different options I wonder to really kind of go

149
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.560
in a little more detail on that one because this is one that I personally prefer and really like to

150
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.970
use because it's made for creative portfolios.

151
00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.600
It's designed for this.
