1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,990
We also need to see how much exposure we're going to have with our work.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,710
The higher exposure impressions and views we have on the project report and for the more we need to

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,370
price that project higher.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,760
I like to have this on the scale as well.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,780
This one as complex as a video editor will put this project with a scale based on views perhaps possibly

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,990
YouTube views based on similar client videos.

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,840
Maybe you're a social media marketer and you put this on a scale of shares on Instagram or Instagram

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,680
likes.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,390
Once again you would create this skill based on previous projects.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,670
The clients have had or produced or another competitor has put out are even basis on similar projects

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,220
who have done that are similar in scope and exposure.

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,000
The higher on the scale of exposure the more pricing power you're most likely to have.

13
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:56,050
For example I am editing a video to promote a new product for a current client.

14
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,440
They have not done any videos so far to promote it.

15
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:03,640
So this will be the only one so I'm not sure about the amount of exposure the video will have.

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,620
I explore more with the client about where this video will be shown and they're going to invest five

17
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,140
thousand dollars to promote this video via paid Instagram and YouTube promotions because of this.

18
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,390
I would rate my potential exposure of the project to be on the high side once again none of this is

19
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,460
an exact science but a guide to help you with pricing.

20
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,870
Now we have a third layer to help us fine tune our pricing.

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,350
Let's say for this one we're putting our project based on a fixed rate to create this video as opposed

22
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:37,660
to trying to figure out how many hours it will take me because for an editing project especially video

23
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,540
that may prove difficult based on the exposure of the project.

24
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,410
Based on what I found other videos have cost companies to edit with a similar length.

25
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,590
I have come up with this basic pricing skill for myself and my experience.

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,210
Lastly the client tier is a Tier 2.

27
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:00,100
I know they're spending some ad money on this so they're flexible with budget based on the assumption

28
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,270
and willingness for them to invest money into this project.

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,150
A tier 2 client my intermediate level experience based on the scale I created from prior projects and

30
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,310
research on what others are charging.

31
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,960
And lastly the exposure level of the project.

32
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,190
I'm going to come up with this fixed costs for the project.

33
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:23,300
All three scales helped me feel more confident about pricing based on research.

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:30,290
I feel like my quota is reasonable industry standard and a strong contender to be accepted by the client.

35
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,910
Hopefully these lessons give you some insight on how to formulate a price or quote you do not have to

36
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,220
feel like you're quoting Klein at random.

37
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,930
There's a process you can go through and help guide you to the right price based on research.

38
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:46,350
Hopefully the next time you quote a client project you can send that quote with confidence.

39
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,640
I no longer feel nervous about your pricing decisions.
