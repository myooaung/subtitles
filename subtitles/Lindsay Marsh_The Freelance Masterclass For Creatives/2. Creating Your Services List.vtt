00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.110
Have you ever been to a restaurant and they handed you a menu that felt more like a book full of hundreds

2
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.580
of different options and your instantly overwhelmed by the choices and it might have even given you

3
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.920
a slight panicked feeling.

4
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.070
Clients get the same way when you have a long extensive service list.

5
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.470
It's good to be concise and focus on the type of services you think will bring the most value to your

6
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.880
clients but also be services you have a particular experience in or have a passion for.

7
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.750
Take for example graphic design.

8
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.120
Graphic design is a large field that can easily spread into other disciplines and services like web

9
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.190
design and illustration.

10
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.660
When a client sees a huge long services list they think two things.

11
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.440
First off they think they're a jack of all trades but a master of none.

12
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.350
There's no way they have stellar experience in all those different services or number two.

13
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.150
They're desperate for work and they're willing to do about any type of project.

14
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.850
It's the second one I'm most worried about in terms of presenting yourself as a top notch freelance

15
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.820
contender.

16
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.860
Remember they will always be considering other options and freelancers.

17
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:17.030
Anything you can do to present yourself in the most professional way possible is vital instead of offering

18
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.560
so many services perhaps narrowing it down to four to eight main services might help you in focusing

19
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.980
in on the types of services you'll provide.

20
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.720
These will also be what you slowly want to specialize in as you continue to fine tune your freelance

21
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.520
business.

22
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.090
For example if I list logo design branding product package design and finally print design all of those

23
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.160
services are connected somehow and there's a good chance a client will need more than one but they're

24
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.870
not randomized services.

25
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.930
They all require similar software and skill sets.

26
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.740
I want you to work through the services list guide a downloadable resource to find out and work through

27
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.950
the top services you'll want to provide.

28
00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.510
This will also set the tone for how you craft your portfolio and Web site later on in the course and

29
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.740
what projects will come first in your portfolio presentation the following tips are for me having a

30
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.100
chance to look at hundreds if not thousands of portfolios a freelancer Web site.

31
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.660
It's my time as an art director in charge of hiring freelancers for various creative needs.

32
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.560
These are the tips I wish they followed and the ones who followed them quickly went to my short list

33
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.410
of possible next contacts first tip focus on services that can cross-sell.

34
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.450
This means one service will naturally lead to another after the completion of one service.

35
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.000
For example web design offering FCO services are working with another partner that also offers those

36
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.560
services might be mutually beneficial for you your partner and the client.

37
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.410
They know that they can take the next natural step in the process and know that you can continue to

38
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:56.180
work with them outside that initial need tip to keep your list as short as possible without hurting

39
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.530
your total offerings.

40
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.780
Write out the reasons why that service deserves to make it to your services list TIP 3.

41
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.860
Be thinking about how you can best market these services.

42
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.630
Do you have a prior project or portfolio piece that can help you sell the service to a future client

43
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.530
tip floor.

44
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.910
Be open to removing or adding new services as your client work progresses.

45
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.370
Client demand shift with industry shifts being open to adding new services and specializing in a new

46
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.220
skill that you seem to notice an increase in client demand or something that you can add value to the

47
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.970
client.

48
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.080
I want you to work through the services list worksheet and create your own main services list.

49
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.740
Those will be important to have on hand as we continue to work through the course build our site and

50
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.030
build our portfolio.

51
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.740
It will definitely need some feature.
