1
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.790
So terms and conditions you simply sign it.

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.590
You said that the client they sign it and then you each get a copy.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.750
This is you agreeing to all the terms and conditions of the contract.

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.130
So here's where it really goes into kind of the legal jargon and kind of detailed written stuff about

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.620
each legal item.

6
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.030
So I'm not going to read all of this but I'm going to talk about kind of what each one means overall

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.190
so you can just have a general understanding of anything you want to modify or add to to make it your

8
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.820
own so intellectual property rights.

9
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.070
This is all about who owns the copyright of the work produced.

10
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.950
And after reading this paragraph it's clear that the ownership of anything that you create for this

11
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.090
project that you're getting paid for is all belongs to the client.

12
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.480
So any kind of illustrations you do or vector art or photography will belong be the sole owner of the

13
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.640
client's rights so they will own that property you can't go off and sell it.

14
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.340
I can't take this illustration and sell it if I want to be able to still own rights to the illustration

15
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.110
and be able to sell it online.

16
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.970
I'm going to have to put that in here.

17
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.660
I'm going to have to change this a little bit and say you know maybe kind of say that the rights belong

18
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:20.610
to the client but the freelancer has the ability to resell it on such and such stock site.

19
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.500
So you need to be very specific about who owns what.

20
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.740
If you want to get all of your rights away.

21
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.420
This is pretty standard.

22
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.240
And most industries whatever work you produce is no longer yours.

23
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.620
It belongs to the client.

24
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.040
Let's say you do a logo design.

25
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.890
It's not your logo design anymore.

26
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.110
When you send those files off it belongs to them.

27
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.150
They have the rights to allow you to put it in your portfolio or not.

28
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.010
And most of the time they allow you to put it in your portfolio.

29
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.780
That's not a big deal.

30
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.860
But you don't have the right to redo the logo or repackage it and sell it somewhere else.

31
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.260
So this just kind of protects everybody and clearly spells out who owns what.

32
00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.470
That was produced and the project so a lot of times when you're a contractor or a freelancer you may

33
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.620
be dealing with a big business and they may have some insider information or some information that they

34
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.220
don't want to make public because they haven't announced it yet.

35
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.640
And maybe your project is part of helping that announcement happen.

36
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.480
So there could be some stuff that they really don't want to get out there into the public.

37
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.200
So this is just a simple statement.

38
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.640
This whole paragraph a confidentiality just talks it pretty much says if there's anything that is is

39
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.480
not public to the world do not share it do not share it during your project do not share thumbnails

40
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.960
of your project along the way on social media.

41
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.950
If it's not publicly information that's publicly known.

42
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.560
This protects the client to make sure that they don't have any secrets share or anything ruined in terms

43
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.710
of revealing information so the next section goes into termination rights.

44
00:02:52.740 --> 00:03:00.230
A win can you stop the project and when can the client stop the project and what happens when that happens.

45
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.510
So the customer may terminate this contract or individual project whenever it's convenient for them

46
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.840
without a liability at any time upon prior written notice to the freelancer so they can terminate whenever

47
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.340
they need to and then all work stops.

48
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.480
So the freelancer may also terminate this contract within 30 days prior to a written notice provided

49
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.610
there are no open projects at the time the notice is given.

50
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.470
So the customer this is C customer may terminate this contract or any open projects immediately for

51
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.500
cause if the freelancer fails to perform its obligations under the contract or if the freelancer breaches

52
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.410
any of the warranties provided or fails to do.

53
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.220
Yada yada yada.

54
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.190
So that the client can cancel at any time if you're not living up to the expectations that are written

55
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:55.260
out in the contract and they can cancel and make the contract void so this one two three just goes into

56
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.490
specifics about what the process what the process is.

57
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.460
If there was a termination so you can feel free to change this in terms of their specific days you want

58
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.920
to change if you want to change it to 15 or or eight whatever you feel comfortable.

59
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.570
This is where you can definitely modify this contract to your needs and to your liking.

60
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.250
So this kind of reiterates what was mentioned above.

61
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.940
Upon termination of any project or work given the freelancer needs to immediately provide the client

62
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.870
with all work in progress completed prior to the termination date.

63
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.180
So if the clock if the project is terminated you need to send them whatever work you have so far.

64
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.820
The next section is limitation of liability.

65
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.910
This basically goes into something happens there's data lost there's damage some something happens that's

66
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.180
accidental that either party is not liable.

67
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.740
So if the client accidentally deletes my file permanently or does something to my computer and it was

68
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.600
an accident they're not liable.

69
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.460
Same thing with me if I accidently break their copier I am not liable for that.

70
00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.430
It's just part of doing business.

71
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:07.470
As long as it was an accidental type of end of an issue so I went back and added a few additional items

72
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.880
to this contract.

73
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.770
I'm right here in the beginning section and I wanted to add a little bit after project schedule and

74
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.890
pricing rates.

75
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.320
I want to add two things that I've felt like I really wanted to spell out in more detail.

76
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.950
And when you download the document these will already be added for you so don't worry about adding these.

77
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.400
The first one is going to be project scope.

78
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.190
So I wanted to make sure we had a definite way to define the project's scope which is how big the project

79
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.370
is.

80
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.760
So when the client exceeds that or I exceed that there's going to be an additional hourly rate or another

81
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:46.030
fixed rate revision upward just to protect ourselves from what they call scope creep project scope.

82
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:52.410
The scope is defined by the description of services which is right up here so everything that's listed

83
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.230
in the services will be the scope in anything that exceeds those services or is not on that list will

84
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.710
be considered outside of the project scope.

85
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.820
So anything outside of the services listed will be considered outside of the scope of the contract and

86
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.730
any additional work or revisions in addition to the stated description of services list will be done

87
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.820
at an hourly rate of forty four dollars an hour.

88
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:21.510
Or you can have another statement in there that says we will reassess at another fixed project rate

89
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.980
and another contract.

90
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.050
So if you wanted to spill that over to another contract you can.

91
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.540
You don't always have to do additional out of scope revisions at an hourly rate.

92
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.450
You could also do that at a fixed rate whatever you'd like to determine.

93
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:34.830
That's up to you.

94
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.720
I also wanted to put changes in revisions in here because I want to be very clear about how many revisions

95
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:46.020
the client may receive in a creative field like what we do what we freelance and a lot of times clients

96
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.930
could take advantage of unlimited revisions and it can really drag out those fixed rate projects.

97
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.000
So this is where you can determine how many revision rounds they get and if it exceeds a certain amount

98
00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.120
you can charge them extra or charge them hourly.

99
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.970
So that is all listed here so I added that to the contract.

100
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.510
So that'll be when you download the document you'll have these two extra things in there.

101
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.180
Just want to make sure these were included to make sure you had a very extensive contract.

102
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.950
So there you have it.

103
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.650
It's a very very basic freelancer contract.

104
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:21.600
You may find other clauses online that might be applicable that you can work into this contract.

105
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.270
This really covers a lot of the good basics though it covers the deposit it covers a schedule when things

106
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.660
are due by each you or the client.

107
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.860
It describes the services that you're going to provide.

108
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.230
And it also spells out the pricing.

109
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:39.150
So this is kind of the area that you really need to be particular on this is what you really get a customized

110
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.050
to your project.

111
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:44.970
Spend a lot of time making sure you have as much detail as possible so if there's ever any question

112
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.260
you have to refer back to the contract.

113
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:54.240
You you're protected and you have everything spelled out so that's contracts very quickly kind of reviewed.

114
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.490
Feel free to download this as an example or you can find lots of other great templates online and you

115
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.230
can use this as a basis to build one of your own.

116
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:09.030
But I've had fun kind of reviewing contracts once again I'm not a legal expert so I can't kind of review

117
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.640
this from a lawyer client perspective.

118
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.010
That's not what this is.

119
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.290
I'm not a legal expert so just making sure I cover my bases there.

120
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.550
But anyway I'll see you in the next section we're going to talk about some client situations and how

121
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.320
we can best deal with some of those.
