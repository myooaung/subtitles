00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.580
You have a chance to use that link in the resource guide.

2
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.030
You'll be able to download this sample contract created by Jessica Swartz.

3
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.010
She posted a blog on medium and so kindly shared it.

4
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.400
What I'd like to do is adapt somebody who is also willing to share their contract with us.

5
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.590
Adapt it to our own needs and I got to teach you how to do that with this one so we can customize it

6
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.210
and make it our own.

7
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.240
So we're not going to no longer going to need this top portion so let's go ahead and customize this.

8
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.680
We're going to go through this line by line and kind of talk about a little bit about contracts.

9
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.830
So this freelance contract the contract or the freelancers contract is entered in and made effective

10
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.580
on this date.

11
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.270
So all you do is fill out the date client name.

12
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:56.260
So this is going to be the big coffee company the big coffee ink with an office in location you can

13
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.840
always google that and find the main headquarters your location office okay.

14
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.660
And then we are the name.

15
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.130
So let's go and put our freelance company or personal name so we are the contractor we are the freelancer

16
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.600
right here.

17
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.060
And so this is kind of the basic ideas of if we sign this contract this is what we're agreeing to.

18
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.010
The client has a need for services and the freelancer has an interest in performing services for the

19
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.790
client.

20
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.400
So just like earlier there's something we're exchanging for a service for money or a service for something

21
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.350
in return.

22
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.370
The parties wish to set forth the terms and conditions upon which such services will be provided to

23
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.150
the client.

24
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.590
So we all agree to the following.

25
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.290
So this is where we're really going to have to create our own structure here.

26
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.730
So descriptions of the services of the freelancer will.

27
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.730
So I will be providing a one page illustration for an ad design and so we're just could I kind of write

28
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.990
that right now in a quick sentence or two OK.

29
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.960
So this is very brief but if you have a detail project maybe a web design project you might want to

30
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.260
be more descriptive of all the services you're going to provide if you're providing multiple service

31
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.880
make sure you have them and different lines so have service one service to make sure you list every

32
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.500
single service you're going to be providing that's going to be under this contract.

33
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.010
So the freelancer will provide a one page full color illustration for the use and a national marketing

34
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.550
campaign by the big Coffee Company Inc.

35
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.540
Okay so the deliverables will be what the client will receive from us.

36
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.660
So in this case it'll be a one page illustration.

37
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.960
But what files am I going to be sending to them.

38
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.380
This is where I need to make it really clear what they're going to get.

39
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.430
Are they going to get original files.

40
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.020
Are they going to get any physical illustrations or concepts or brainstorming kind of pages what exactly

41
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.610
are they paying for.

42
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.530
So this is going to be a one page illustration it's going to be in j peg format and also high resolution

43
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.420
formats.

44
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.910
I can list that as a PMG.

45
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.230
It depends on if it's going to be a vector illustration or not but you need to be as clear as possible

46
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.460
what the deliverables are.

47
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.850
So if that's ever a problem later on you can go back and say this is exactly the type of files that

48
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.100
you needed and there was no other extra files in there so project schedule is going to be the overall

49
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.070
timeline between you and the client of different project milestones.

50
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.580
For this example we have some initial sketches that we did do about five weeks after the contract is

51
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.420
signed.

52
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.530
So it wouldn't start until the contract was signed.

53
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.640
Five weeks to deliver my first item on the second item would be revisions so there would be two weeks

54
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.280
after I get feedback from those revisions.

55
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.200
So if I get feedback from those revisions those that two week timeline of me having to turn around and

56
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.050
give the next round of revisions starts.

57
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.600
So this protects both you and the client because it gives them deadlines for them to send you stuff.

58
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.170
And sometimes clients stall with sending items and if you have it in your contract you have to send

59
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.660
me this item before the next stage starts.

60
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.270
It kind of motivates them to get you the items they need.

61
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.790
And the other way around to it helps set deadlines for yourself.

62
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.720
And I find that having deadlines really helps me commit to a project.

63
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.210
This is where you'll spell it out.

64
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.100
You don't need to do it in big long paragraphs.

65
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.900
You could do it in short lines.

66
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.110
It could be as detailed as you want but I'd like to keep it very factual and just have dates and exactly

67
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.180
what they need to give me by that date.

68
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.350
And the other way around so pricing and rates this is where we obviously put what we're going to charge

69
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.070
for the project.

70
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.490
This is a very simple one project kind of thing.

71
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.170
So it's only going to be twenty one hundred dollars and it's USD.

72
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.200
I like to put U.S. dollars of it's going to be in U.S. dollars.

73
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.990
Make sure you put the currency so there's no conversion if you have a Canadian dollar.

74
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.150
Make sure you are very clear with your currency.

75
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.440
This is a legal document.

76
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.130
We have to be as clear and detailed as we can be.

77
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.230
So to any one hundred dollars for the completion of the project and you can build the scene as well

78
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.370
if you want to do anything that goes outside of the scope of the project or any additional projects

79
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.590
you could say forty two dollars per hour for any additional revisions outside of the scope of the illustration

80
00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.590
or you can not you can just leave that open ended and then if anything goes beyond you can draw up another

81
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.390
contract for a different project and charge a fixed rate just really up to you to build that in there

82
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.640
if you want to.

83
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.850
I like to do it for projects like this because sometimes there's that little extra things they want

84
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:17.190
to do oh we want the illustration resized to another size and instead of having to go back and figure

85
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.740
out a fixed price quote I could just do per hour until I'm finished resizing the illustration.

86
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.300
So sometimes I like build that in there but you know if you think they want to add a whole lot more

87
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.250
in addition to that one illustration then I might even do a separate contract and another another fixed

88
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.450
rate.

89
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.070
So here we go.

90
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.950
So we don't need to talk about when payments are due.

91
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.420
Because that's what this next item is is payment terms and schedule.

92
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.380
So this is where we need to really think about how much they need to pay up front.

93
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.060
So this is going to be their deposit.

94
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:54.330
So this all by default is a 25 percent upfront deposit but a lot of times you'll see 50 percent as a

95
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.310
recommendation for freelancers.

96
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.770
What I'd like to do is it really depends.

97
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:06.080
I like to do a 50 percent deposit for new clients or clients that haven't proven proven themselves.

98
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.560
Sometimes I like to do with clients that don't have a lot of cash flow maybe have some new businesses

99
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.730
because the higher your deposit the more you're protected.

100
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:20.430
If the project fails or if the client cannot pay their money you have a non refundable 50 percent deposit

101
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.190
already.

102
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.290
So you're protected.

103
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.210
You get that 50 percent deposit.

104
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.950
You don't have to give it back it's non-refundable.

105
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.720
So it depends.

106
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:34.890
Sometimes a higher deposit level like a 50 or 75 percent can scare off some smaller clients larger clients

107
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.450
know the deal they understand that that's pretty standard for freelancers and contractors to have a

108
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.490
50 percent deposit.

109
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.940
Sometimes I'll have a 25 percent for those smaller new clients maybe I know them.

110
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:53.280
You know I don't want to intimidate them with such a high initial deposit so as long as you have one

111
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.950
and you get one that's all that matters.

112
00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:03.510
You could do it anywhere from 25 to 75 percent upfront although 75 percent is a little high 50 percent

113
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:09.110
standard and 25 percent is if you're being nice and if you're being very lenient toward the client.

114
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.940
But I wouldn't do anything less than 25 percent because you know this is the money you get to keep if

115
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.380
something messes up.

116
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:23.120
So you want to make sure it's high enough to make it worthwhile if something goes wrong so I'm switching

117
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.270
it to a 50 percent upfront deposit because it's a large company.

118
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.200
They know the deal.

119
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.420
This is a very standard.

120
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.470
No they're not going to be intimidated by that so 50 percent upfront and spell out exactly how they

121
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.120
can pay.

122
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.770
Can they pay via pay pal.

123
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:36.880
Is that an option.

124
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:41.370
There is a two and a half or three percent fee every time a client pays with PayPal.

125
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:46.160
So sometimes you need to talk about that so maybe they have appear in the payment.

126
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.510
That's twenty one hundred dollars.

127
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:52.340
But if they pay with PayPal it'll be an additional 3 percent extra.

128
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.280
So you need to spell that out here in the payment terms.

129
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.220
If they pay by cheque or cash there's no extra fee.

130
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:04.700
If they pay by Pay Pal there's an extra 3 percent project charge for the transaction costs because you

131
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:10.250
don't want to take all those cost as you as as the freelancer you want to try to pass that onto the

132
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.190
client.

133
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:16.130
Sometimes the client might push back on that but you know that 3 percent adds up over time if you're

134
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:20.900
taking that transaction costs by using Pay Pal or another online transaction place.

135
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.100
You know those places aren't free.

136
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:29.060
So I like to take checks and cash from clients I really love checks because there's no transaction fees

137
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.240
and sending a check to me.

138
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.080
I could to keep 100 percent and I don't have to charge you a fee for it.

139
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.590
So for this case I got to do just payable by check.

140
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.320
They're a large company their marketing department can cut me a check and send it to my house.

141
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.670
No problem.

142
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.870
So this is some clauses I wanted to talk about either party has a right to terminate this agreement

143
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:53.930
at any point and feel free to modify these or add to them upon the termination of any project or work

144
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:58.940
given by the freelancer or the freelancer will immediately provide client with all or in any work in

145
00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.020
progress or completed prior to the termination date.

146
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:07.280
So that means if I decide I have a lot going on and I can't complete the project I need to give them

147
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.470
all my sketches and everything I've done until that point because they did pay a deposit so they are

148
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.860
owed some level of work if I decide to quit early on.

149
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:21.680
So this is protect new client number two client so obligation to the freelancer resulting from termination

150
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:27.260
that client will pay the freelancer an equitable amount as determined by the client for partially completing

151
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:32.680
work in progress and the agreed to price for the completed services or deliverables.

152
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.730
So the second one protects you a little bit.

153
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.120
So this means that the client has to pay you something for the work that you send.

154
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.140
That's partially completed.

155
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:47.330
So that is protecting you the second one the third one upon termination or expiration of this contract

156
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.780
or the project performed by the freelancer whichever occurs first.

157
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:55.610
The freelancer so promptly return to client all materials and tools provided by the clients.

158
00:09:55.610 --> 00:10:00.220
This protects the client if you they gave you software to use and you terminate the project.

159
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:04.340
You have to get back the software or any kind of physical things they needed for you to complete the

160
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:08.500
project that protects the clients you don't keep anything that's that's not yours.

161
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:08.770
When.

162
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:14.690
When the project was terminated and this also says the fee is nonrefundable we changed that to 50.

163
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:20.060
So let's make sure everything is consistent and this number up here matches the number down here so

164
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.620
that 50 percent fee is non-refundable.

165
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.020
I keep it no matter what.

166
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:28.720
So they need to understand that's part of the deal if I decide to terminate the project early.

167
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:34.400
I get to keep the fee that is part of what happens of course they can go back and sue you for that in

168
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.920
court and maybe have a case but that's only if you're the one who never completed any work.

169
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.080
I mean if you've completed some work and you still leave there's a little bit of leeway where you know

170
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:51.440
it all depends on this is this is law at all it's a very gray area it all depends on on the exact situation

171
00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:56.930
but it's usually non-refundable so after a couple months we quit the project if you already completed

172
00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:01.400
some things you're going to have to give them what you completed in exchange that you get to keep that

173
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.600
50 percent fee within reason why everything has to be within reason.
