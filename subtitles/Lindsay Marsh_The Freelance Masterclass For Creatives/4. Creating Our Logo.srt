1
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,570
Now that we have our inspiration board or brand board we can start to sketch out those concepts for

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:16,110
our global design which will be our main focal point for our personal branding project.

3
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,860
Since you already defined your target market and created your inspiration board sketching out ideas

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:26,110
for a logo and picking out our colors and fonts will go a lot quicker now that we have a bases of who

5
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,890
are designing for.

6
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,850
There are many directions we can go in with our logo design.

7
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:37,040
This class will focus more on the branding aspect and less on the technical steps we need to go through

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,270
using software.

9
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,760
I have many classes that focuses solely on local design and software like Adobe Illustrator and even

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,140
free cloud based programs like Canada.

11
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:52,490
If you wanted to get into the technical side of Do It Yourself logo design and branding.

12
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:57,790
First we want to sketch out our concepts and ideas on paper or digital sketching app before we make

13
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:58,860
it a reality.

14
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,700
There's many of you out there that may not have any graphic design background or experience and you

15
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:11,540
may prefer hiring a designer to turn your concept into a real vector usable logo design perhaps you're

16
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,440
an illustrator or a photographer or a web developer and design is not your strong suit.

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,120
Hiring another freelancer or designer can be an overwhelming task.

18
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,550
So I created this downloadable guide that gives you a lot of tips and tricks on places to start searching

19
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:30,130
for a designer or freelancer and also what to look out for when doing so.

20
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,000
For those who are graphic designers this can be helpful to look at too as it gives you some great insight

21
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:42,060
into what other small business owners are looking for and great designers if you decide to hire another

22
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,030
designer to create your logo or branded assets.

23
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,610
Make sure you send them some work we have done prior including your mission statement your target audience

24
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,000
sketches inspiration boards or brand boards.

25
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,250
Those will be very helpful to the designer that will be helping you craft your personal brand so Let's

26
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,500
sketch out some rough ideas on paper.

27
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,870
I'm going to be using a digital sketching app called procreate which you can use with your Apple iPad

28
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:12,630
and Apple pencil for this demonstration why you're sketching out ideas.

29
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,190
Think about your target audience along the way.

30
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,620
Are you targeting and high end clientele.

31
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,650
If so that might change the look and feel of your logo.

32
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:27,340
Would your target audience appreciate a detailed illustrative style also be thinking about the different

33
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,290
type of logo styles when you're sketching some of you may want to leave this up to a professional designer

34
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,560
or try a hand at this yourself.

35
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,830
If I have a few downloadable resources.

36
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:43,650
One is called the logo types and styles Cheat Sheet which goes over some of the basic logo design types

37
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,380
personal branding for freelancers as a bit different than branding for a company.

38
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,850
As I talked about before.

39
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,970
First of all personal branding as well.

40
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,650
It's very personal.

41
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,740
It's about you and your unique style and what you're going to bring to the market.

42
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,800
I find the best freelancer logos put the freelancers style on full display and you can echo similar

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,300
colors you use in your work.

44
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:12,840
Like we just arrived from our brand board in the lesson prior branding and logo design for companies

45
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,880
tend to focus on the product or service in a personal freelance branding we want to focus on yourself

46
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,290
and your personality.

47
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:26,000
Remember that being authentic and true to your own unique style sells yourself better to the right clients.

48
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,210
Remember how finding the right clients is kind of like dating.

49
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,230
We want to make sure we represent ourselves to the client in the most accurate way possible and the

50
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:40,470
style you choose for your logo design and the layout is a great way to show that style.

51
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,900
So what about names.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,310
Freelancers can either stick to their personal name so in my case Lindsay marsh or they can create a

53
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,210
freelancer company name.

54
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:54,930
I recommend using your personal name if you plan on remaining independent with your client work or projects.

55
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:00,150
That means you work mostly with yourself and working collaboration with others but not really function

56
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,360
as a growing company or agency for example.

57
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,800
I would recommend using a company name or not your personal name.

58
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,050
For those who want to eventually grow into a multi employee company down the road look back at your

59
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,560
freelancing goals that you established earlier.

60
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,540
Maybe this could help you decide what might be best for you.

61
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,730
The great thing about sticking to your name at first is building up name recognition for our case with

62
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,580
Lillian.

63
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:30,970
We could be sticking with our personal name for now you can also include your official title as part

64
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,770
of your logo.

65
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,400
They can make sure you clearly communicate with surfaces you provide.

66
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:41,180
For example as a web designer making sure that is clearly communicated with text below it could be a

67
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:47,720
symbol an icon a tagline some way to tell the viewer what you do in your logo.

68
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,910
You may even provide multiple services like web design and photography and being able to communicate

69
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:58,580
through that in your logo through a type or a tagline is critical and showing the client right away

70
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,990
who you are and the kind of services you can provide for them.

71
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:08,660
It's not required but it's a nice inclusion and a strong logo design for freelancers when sketching

72
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:15,680
out your ideas find icons symbols illustrations that can represent what you do and help brainstorm concepts.

73
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,630
For example it could be the pen tool in Adobe Illustrator for a graphic designer for example and this

74
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:27,040
is a tool that she use everyday in her profession and so it makes a lot of sense and including in her

75
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,260
logo just for an example do not overdo it on brainstorming.

76
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,570
For those of you who are wanting to go as far as possible creating your own logo and branding.

77
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:44,110
Try coming up with three viable concepts you want to develop further using vector software every logo

78
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,020
needs to eventually be created in vector format.

79
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,880
There are many great vector programs like affinity design which is a cheaper version or if you have

80
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,460
the Adobe Creative Suite Adobe Illustrator you may also want to hire a graphic designer to take on your

81
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:04,310
rough sketches and create that vector format for you offended a designer is that cheaper solution and

82
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:10,340
only cost around 50 dollars just a one time fee for those wanting to give this a try on their own and

83
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,530
not hire a graphic designer.

84
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:18,500
You can even put together a logo using Kanda which is a cloud based free design tool that allows you

85
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,380
to put together simple logos although it is a little bit limited.

86
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:28,580
So now that we're able to sketch out three different ideas and concepts I'm going to go a step further

87
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,540
and make these are reality and vector format and Adobe Illustrator.
