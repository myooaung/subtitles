00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.740
Pricing in the big one is once you get comfortable knowing how long certain projects take you can make

2
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.450
much more.

3
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.250
Quoting fixed prices for those freelancers who complete projects quicker than most you can double or

4
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.450
triple what you can make.

5
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.880
If you're just quoting an hourly rate.

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.650
But the opposite holds true.

7
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.560
And if projects take longer or you did not quote a fixed price that was high enough you start to lose

8
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.590
money by not charging hourly.

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.500
So let's make sure we know how to price fix projects so we don't run into the trouble of losing money.

10
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.300
First of all researches again at the start of it all.

11
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.300
Ask others in your industry and freelance groups how much they charge per project or different project

12
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.240
types.

13
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.630
Also there's different Web sites you can visit to find average fix prices for certain types of projects

14
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.120
always come into this with a bit of research as guessing how much to charge on projects will be almost

15
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.190
impossible without knowing when others have charged for similar work.

16
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.190
There are several factors that help us find the perfect fixed price quote.

17
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.220
The first thing we want to do is figure out our experience level.

18
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.830
If you've been doing this for more than a decade and even have management experience working with other

19
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.570
creative designers or freelancers you'll be able to have more pricing power to the upside.

20
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.110
So how do I know where I fall with my skill level.

21
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.570
Just like I signed my clients with a different tier level I signed my own personal skill and experience

22
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.890
level into three different categories.

23
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.850
The first category level would be a total beginner.

24
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.370
This is my first official project with the client.

25
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.480
I'm going to need to price much lower level than others simply because this is my first project.

26
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.690
I'm going to want to shoot at the lower level of the scale for example of this was doing a social media

27
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.190
graphic.

28
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.490
Just one simple graphic.

29
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.990
Instead of charging 100 hundred dollars for that graphic I would charge maybe somewhere around 30 to

30
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.960
40 dollars and that's first level beginner situation what the client is getting is a great deal.

31
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.070
But what you're getting is a real world project and social proof they can use to gain future clients

32
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.870
that value you worth.

33
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.610
You can also ask for referrals that proves client experience.

34
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.360
Think of this as part of your payment for your services and this first level payment is more than just

35
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.640
monetary opportunity to prove yourself for your first two projects is invaluable.

36
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.970
Your next level is going to be the intermediate level.

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.990
You definitely have some paid client work under your belt and you may have done some work on a wide

38
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.290
variety of projects.

39
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.650
You may even have 2 to 5 years of experience you've worked with other freelancers to do larger projects

40
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.130
at times.

41
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.790
So you have some team experience.

42
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.950
This is where you start to have a little more power with pricing.

43
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.020
You have proven work experience so this intermediate level pricing I usually price close to industry

44
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.210
average for that particular work project.

45
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.670
I no longer under charge or under price I price what is a reasonable industry average now I'm at the

46
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.710
point where I could start to explore higher pricing and maybe edge that hourly price or fixed project

47
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.570
price higher and higher with each new client contract.

48
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.120
And once again in the next lesson we're going to talk about client tier assignments and how that will

49
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.530
factor into your pricing as well.

50
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.160
The next level is the advanced level.

51
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.870
So you probably have five plus years of experience where you have a proven track record of success working

52
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.240
with larger clients regional clients and perhaps you've even had some agency work.

53
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.890
Maybe you've worked alongside national level projects that have gotten a large amount of exposure.

54
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.830
The difference between an intermediate skill level freelancer and an advanced freelancer is the amount

55
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.260
of exposure your client or personal work has gone.

56
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.090
So instead of getting a thousand impressions with your project or for your client your work has been

57
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.960
seen shown digested by tens of thousands if not millions of people news impressions likes.

58
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.780
They're all the same.

59
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.200
You should also be paid on the level of your prior exposures have been projects that are used by prior

60
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.270
clients who have gone on to be shown to millions of people.

61
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.400
You deserve a much higher payout than someone who's only had a project exposed to a couple hundred people.

62
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.350
We'll talk more about exposure of your projects and quoting later in the class so understanding where

63
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.640
you fall gives you a chance to know what your pricing power is.

64
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.530
The lower your skill level the lower your pricing power.

65
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.150
There are some ways you can overcome this by having an amazing portfolio even if you're at the beginning

66
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.150
stages and you don't have your first client or maybe you've only done a couple of paid client projects.

67
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.220
This is where your portfolio can help you charge just a little bit more out of your level.

68
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.370
That means working on projects just for your personal portfolio to fill that pool portfolio with a rich

69
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:42.220
engaging projects to make up the lack of paid client work so let's do a few examples.

70
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.760
It's great to talk about pricing theory but to be able to talk about pricing in nominal terms is so

71
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.690
important.

72
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.700
So here's pricing power at work in terms of your skill and experience level.

73
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.590
Let's say I'm at the beginner level I've had two paid clients before but I've only been at this for

74
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.640
six months.

75
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.180
I'm a graphic designer and I've done a couple of logo and branding projects.

76
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.940
The amount of my exposure of work has been minimal but has mostly been at the local population in my

77
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.490
town.

78
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.270
A new client approaches me about a project they've seen my work locally and they've enjoyed the style

79
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.750
and want to approach me about doing a branding project for their company.

80
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.130
After talking to the client and figuring out it'll probably take me around 15 to 20 hours to do the

81
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:28.510
local design maybe 3 revision rounds I would say I need to make about thirty five dollars an hour let's

82
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.260
say I've previously made 25 to 30 dollars an hour but I'm just getting started and that's OK.

83
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:41.220
So I find out that 20 hours times thirty five dollars an hour equals seven hundred dollars so that would

84
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.260
be beginner level pricing but if I was at the next level maybe have two to three years of experience

85
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.330
and I'd been doing this for a little longer maybe my work has gotten a little bit more exposure maybe

86
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.400
on the state level or regional level.

87
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.350
I'll probably want to price closer to 60 dollars an hour so that same project would be sixty dollars

88
00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.770
an hour.

89
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.430
Times 20 dollars which would equal twelve hundred dollars.

90
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:08.160
You could see the difference in pricing power between your experience and skill level and how that affects

91
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.860
your pricing.

92
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.390
Now for the advanced level I probably charge somewhere between 80 dollars now or if I was charging hourly

93
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:21.780
but if I'm going to stay consistent and stay on my hourly rate pricing 80 dollars an hour times 20 hours

94
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:28.410
is sixteen hundred dollars so you can see the difference between the skill level and how a beginner

95
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:34.170
level freelancer and their industry peers make less than half of someone who would be considered an

96
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.290
expert does.

97
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.800
This is the value of experience and you need to know that when pricing your projects that this is valuable

98
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.600
to clients and essential to how you price.

99
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.540
This example used hourly pricing but the same method applies for fixed rate pricing.

100
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:54.240
You can see how your skill level can affect your pricing power even for fixed rate prices and with fixed

101
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.200
rate prices.

102
00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.300
Sometimes that upside can be more dramatic because fixed rate pricing can be more flexible.

103
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.790
This is why someone can charge 10000 dollars for a logo design while others struggle to get clients

104
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.100
at 200 dollars.

105
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.590
Of course there's more than just your skill level involved.

106
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.870
There's also the client size and client budget.

107
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.940
We need to figure out we're going to talk about assigning clients their own levels to be able to have

108
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.020
more information to help us find the perfect pricing.

109
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.010
So stay tuned.
