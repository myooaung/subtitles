00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.110
The biggest question I get from aspiring and current freelancers is where do you find clients.

2
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.180
And how did you get your first few clients.

3
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.340
This section is dedicated in reviewing all available options and finding clients both online and off.

4
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.690
I'll be following this downloadable guide throughout this section so make sure you downloaded to have

5
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.620
a full list and description of all the online and offline platforms.

6
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.830
I'll be talking about throughout the next few lessons.

7
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.560
A lot of students place their well-made personal portfolios profiles written biographies on all these

8
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.620
online freelancer platforms like people per hour dot.com or up workshop and they're pretty discouraged

9
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.750
by the lack of action.

10
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.980
Dust balls roll across the desert and discipline runs high.

11
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.310
The lack of clients contacting them for work can make them feel like they did something wrong.

12
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.520
Like their portfolio was not good enough for their pricing was too high.

13
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.050
And I want to be honest before the section starts and say that finding clients online is hard.

14
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.600
It is not because of a lack of talent on their part but an oversaturation not only of people wanting

15
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.690
to be freelancers in this new freelance gig economy but also the high competition on each one of these

16
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.960
Web sites.

17
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.540
It is not impossible to do very well online.

18
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.370
There are freelancers making a good living off of just working on these online freelancer platforms

19
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.980
but it's not going to be for everybody.

20
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.140
We'll be creating an up work profile together in detail later on in the section and I wanted to make

21
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.160
sure expectations are set before we do so.

22
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.190
I still recommend trying all sorts of different methods for finding clients both online and off.

23
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.820
But we'll need to do as much as we can to put ourselves on the top of the stack.

24
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.740
By having that killer portfolio profile bio headshot and being able to set the right pricing for ourselves

25
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.930
and speaking of pricing we'll learn a lot about that in the next section of the course.

26
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.500
While finding clients is the hardest part of starting a freelance business.

27
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.580
The good news is after you're finding those first few clients future clients are not as hard to grab

28
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.340
as referrals start to takeover and you have established yourself with social proof like reviews and

29
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.170
client testimonials.

30
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.440
My first year freelancing was mostly continuing to locate new work while my last 13 years were spent

31
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.350
actually doing the client work with little time needed to go out and find new clients.

32
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.010
This is the referral system and all of its glory.

33
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.090
Realistically you may want to spend your first month freelancing locating and finding your first two

34
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.110
clients.

35
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.580
Once those clients are obtained and you've completed their work with excellence there's a good chance

36
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.700
they could refer you to another client but only if they're more than satisfied with your work.

37
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.150
That is why those first few clients get the most dedication for me as they could be worth more than

38
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.320
the money they pay for you.

39
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.640
For that project they can also give you additional client referrals let's say.

40
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.970
CLIENT 1 never refer easy to anybody else but client 2 does you complete work for the second client's

41
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.900
referral and that referral gives you another referral.

42
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.370
You can start to see this web of relationships that start to develop as your name gets passed around

43
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.900
to different contacts.

44
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.020
There are two types of clients long term steady clients that give you constant work each month week

45
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.810
or day and short term clients that have a one time project.

46
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.570
Long term clients that give you steady work are the most valuable clients around.

47
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.990
Sometimes it's even worth charging a little less for those clients just establish that longer term relationship

48
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.710
overtaking a lot of short term projects that pay more.

49
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.020
It only takes several long term steady clients to fill up your weekly work schedule which is of course

50
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.600
a good thing of finding clients is a huge chore for you.

51
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.830
So take heart.

52
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.320
This is the hardest aspect of freelancing and it will not be your main task forever.

53
00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.350
Doing great work with the first few clients can pay huge dividends for your future freelancing career.

54
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.500
Once you build up a nice combination of long term clients and a few short term clients continuing to

55
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.860
get that referral system going you could see all finding clients will be just a temporary battle.

56
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.340
Now let's review all of the different ways we could start finding clients.

57
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.180
As mentioned above all those some platforms and methods may be more difficult to find clients.

58
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.770
I do recommend trying out as many avenues as you can and finding those first new clients as anyone this

59
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.250
really is going to get our business going.
