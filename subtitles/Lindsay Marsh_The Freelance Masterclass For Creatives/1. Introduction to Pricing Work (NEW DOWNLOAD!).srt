1
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,810
So how do you price your work as a freelancer.

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:13,080
We have a lot to discuss and the section will review several different ways you can price your projects.

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:18,130
I hope this section will make you feel more confident not only in pricing your work but also helping

4
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:23,950
you maximize your profits by helping you find the highest price possible without that risk of losing

5
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,790
a client because you price too high.

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,110
And that's the biggest constraint on pricing.

7
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,490
I think that scares most freelancers.

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,850
Finding that balance between charging a reasonable profitable rate for yourself but also not being so

9
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:43,630
high it turns the clients toward other more affordable options once you have a pricing system in place.

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:49,830
You'll want to be able to easily find that just right middle pricing point as you start to price more

11
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,750
and more projects you will develop your own pricing model.

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,990
Some freelancers can think of the perfect quote right after hearing a project brief why some struggle

13
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,090
because of the complexity of it all.

14
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,370
Let's review several different ways you could price.

15
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:09,520
You can start to find out which pricing model or combination of pricing models may work best for you.

16
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,840
There are two main ways to price projects.

17
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:19,010
We can charge an hourly rate or a fixed project price and you can even use a mix of both fixed pricing

18
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,840
is simple and straightforward just like going to the store and buying items off the shelf.

19
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,900
Let's say I'm giving a client quote for a Web site design.

20
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,720
Once I find out the scope of the project I charge a fixed rate of let's say forty five hundred dollars.

21
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:37,090
If the project takes me 10 hours I still make forty five hundred dollars.

22
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:41,710
If it takes me 400 hours I still make four forty five hundred dollars.

23
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,220
You can see all this way of pricing could be beneficial if you're quick at completing your tasks and

24
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,590
detrimental if it takes longer than you expected.

25
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,230
You can even break fixed pricing quotes in a different line items to show the client exactly how we

26
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,900
added up that forty five hundred dollars in our quote.

27
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:02,540
For example this breakdown two for design and branding fifteen hundred for creating a custom war press

28
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:08,910
template and a thousand for coding and development with a forty five hundred dollar total so the big

29
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,970
benefits for fixed rate pricing.

30
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:16,750
Our number one you have total control over how much you receive for a given project.

31
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:22,410
Number two you can make more money if you move through your work quickly.

32
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:28,540
Number three the client has more certainty about total project costs before committing.

33
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,510
Of course there are also downsides to think about with fixed project quotes.

34
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,400
So number one if a project takes longer than anticipated you take the hit as you cannot go back and

35
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,950
increase your fixed quote unless it's built into the contract which we'll talk about a little bit later.

36
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,780
Number two it's not easy to have price fixed rates when you have not quoted for that project type before.

37
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,170
It's a little bit easier to price hourly but a little bit harder to learn how to price fixed rates.

38
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,980
On the other side there is that hourly pricing model where he can simply give the client an hourly rate

39
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,380
and maybe a projected time range for each line item for our same web design quote above.

40
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,980
This is what an hourly rate quote might look like.

41
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,910
Forty five dollar hourly rate.

42
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,750
And that's broken down by the following 20 to 25 hours for design and branding.

43
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
Notice the range.

44
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,730
It's not an exact number because we're not sure the exact amount of hours will need 10 to 15 hours for

45
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:29,490
creating a custom wordpress template and 10 to 12 hours for coding and development customizing a store

46
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,400
plug in total hours.

47
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,030
Of course all of this will be projected as a range from 40 to 50 to hours.

48
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:43,250
As you can see I included my example hourly rate but I also need to include projected hourly ranges

49
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:49,190
for each item or project as the next natural question a client has is how many hours might it take for

50
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,790
me to complete a project.

51
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,520
Hourly is an easier way to price for those freelancers who have yet to know how many hours it takes

52
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,000
to complete each project.

53
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:03,400
As you can include a wide range in your hours for that line item to protect yourself the benefits to

54
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,460
pricing hourly are hourly is an easier way to price for this freelancers who have yet to know how many

55
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:15,210
hours it takes to complete each project as include as wide ranges and hours for each line item.

56
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,920
Number two you're guaranteed to know how much you're going to make per hour you work and it's easier

57
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:27,940
to manage your income and cash flow projections number three clients have more clarity of how much you

58
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,680
make per hour which could make them feel more at ease.

59
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:37,900
Number four when pricing scopes get a little bit larger it is easier to adjust pricing for the additional

60
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,610
new work items by just adding more hours.

61
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,280
Of course there are some downsides to hourly pricing as well.

62
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,760
Number one this is the biggest downside.

63
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:53,720
If you complete a project in less hours than expected you will make less overall on the project and

64
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,240
some ways you're being punished for being quick and effective.

65
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:04,940
Not a great motivator to move fast and to do well number two clients may feel your quote is more speculative

66
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,870
and it could be higher project cost of the project goes longer than anticipated.

67
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,310
As we've discovered there are benefits and downsides to each way to price.

68
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,630
I usually recommend for those just starting out to start quoting hourly rates until you start feeling

69
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,670
more comfortable with how long it takes you to complete projects.

70
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,440
Once you've quoted several hourly projects you can try out fixed pricing so you can increase your overall

71
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,240
income.

72
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:36,980
Now that you know what problems may arise and you can price ahead of those issues it takes experience

73
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,590
to start coming up with solid fixed rate pricing.

74
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:45,860
But it does give you a chance to make more per hour if you move quickly and efficiently with projects.

75
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,550
There are times we can use both fixed and hourly rate in the same project especially those projects

76
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,550
with an undefined scope project scope is the total breath of the project.

77
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:02,230
Project scopes can change and become larger if a client decides to add a mobile app design for example

78
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,790
to our simple web design project.

79
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:11,830
If they add new items to the scope it changes and so can the pricing if you stuck with fixed pricing

80
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:17,020
model for the web design quote and they wanted to expand that scope and add another project later on

81
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:22,960
you can send them a new quote and start the process all over again with a new project or build it into

82
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,460
your contract clause.

83
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:30,640
When you do charge an hourly hourly rate for anything that exceeds the original project's scope.

84
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,460
This makes expanding and adding smaller projects easy without having to draw up another fixed rate quote

85
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,510
or contract or produce another proposal.

86
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:44,680
If the project scope is increased dramatically perhaps it might be smart to start over with another

87
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,900
fixed price quote for smaller scope creeps as they call it are small increases in scope.

88
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:58,000
Sometimes building in that hourly price pricing is smart and makes it easy for both you and the client

89
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:05,200
to have continuing work projects that are easy to add on but that comes to my next point about the benefit

90
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,780
to hourly pricing for long term clients sometimes they prefer to switch over to an hourly rate.

91
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:16,450
This helps them better project costs but also helps them continually give you steady stream of smaller

92
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,860
and larger projects.

93
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,780
If you did several projects per week imagine having to send them a fixed quote for each one of those

94
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:28,630
different projects being able to just keep a log of your hours and send them a monthly invoice might

95
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:35,500
be less hassle for the both of you finding out whether to price hourly or a fixed rate is never straightforward

96
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:41,960
but with time you'll learn what feels best for both you and your client the next few lessons will help

97
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,390
you figure out how to find your hourly rate as well as how to think about pricing fixed rate projects

98
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,650
with confidence.
