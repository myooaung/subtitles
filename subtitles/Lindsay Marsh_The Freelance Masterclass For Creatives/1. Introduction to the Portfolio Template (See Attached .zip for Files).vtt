00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.170
I need to be able to offer you this great resource.

2
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.690
I spent a couple of days really crafting this to make sure it could be really helpful for my students.

3
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.620
So one of the biggest questions I get is how do I build a portfolio.

4
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.920
I have classes and lessons that go in more detail about that but I wanted to provide you guys with a

5
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.850
template a portfolio building template when various sizes so you can at least have a framework to get

6
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.670
started with building your portfolio and this would be a PDL based portfolio for sending to clients

7
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.240
for applying to jobs whatever it is you need a PDA based portfolio for.

8
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.780
So if you look at the resource files I provide you you're going to have this file system.

9
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.640
I have this in two different sizes.

10
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.230
We have a horizontal presentation and a vertical presentation.

11
00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.570
They both have their benefits depends on what kind of work you do and how your photos are working.

12
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.390
What orientation you want to go for.

13
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.920
And also I'm happy to announce that I have this and both A4 size so European sizes Asian sizes basically

14
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.990
the whole world uses this measurement system and then for the United States for this.

15
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.920
For those who use inches I have a eight and a half by eleven template as well.

16
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.300
So two different sizes depending on where you are in the world and two different orientations vertical

17
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.210
and horizontal.

18
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.050
So I wanted to talk a little bit about how to use the template.

19
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.930
If you've taken the InDesign basic lessons and you'll be right at home you're going to be able to to

20
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.750
really move around this template without any issues.

21
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.870
I also provided an example PDA.

22
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.520
So you can kind of see how I adapted this template and grabbed a couple of different layout pages to

23
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.670
craft something a little more custom.

24
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.180
I'm seeing kind of see how I've used that in this example just kind of scroll through this.

25
00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.390
I have a PDA where you'll be able to access this and see how I've used some of the premade layouts to

26
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.570
be able to craft a portfolio.

27
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.250
So let's open one of these.

28
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.520
In the example let's do a horizontal version and let's stick with the A4 horizontal size.

29
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.190
We're going to go ahead and open this up.

30
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.480
And this is a packaged and designed file we studied that in the basic and design lessons and so you

31
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.700
have the links here to all the photos that are used in this case there's only one photo you have document

32
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.230
fonts which you have rubato.

33
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.640
This is from Google fonts.

34
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.250
Make sure you check the license it's free for personal use so you could just check out the license on

35
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.270
that.

36
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.460
And that is the only font I used throughout the entire piece and you can get it on Google fonts or you

37
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.710
can install it directly from the template files.

38
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.850
And lastly is a two different files the iron D.D. would be the file that you would open.

39
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.180
That's the InDesign file the IDM L is kind of a more universal format that you can open it up.

40
00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.090
It's kind of more of that universal document so if you have an older version of Adobe in design this

41
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.470
would be kind of the file that you would use if you don't have a current up to date version.

42
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.980
Let's go ahead.

43
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.540
I have the 2020 version so let's go ahead and open it up and here's the basic template I got to go and

44
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.750
zoom out because the all the page layout options you have to go ahead Start with page one and it's got

45
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.000
some basic instructions on page one but I figured a video might be a little bit easier.

46
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.490
So moving pages around I'm going to go up to my pages tab and we can go ahead and move any of these

47
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.220
around.

48
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.410
So how do you use this portfolio builder.

49
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.980
What I'd like to do is go through all the different layouts to see kind of what particular case study

50
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.030
might match with a certain layout.

51
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.000
Of course all these can customize you can move this over and make it go bleed or however you want to

52
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.560
customize it but there are just some basic layouts that I think are personally effective when displaying

53
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.710
different case studies and graphic design projects.

54
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.390
So let's say I want to use this one right here.

55
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.040
This is the photo overlap layout.

56
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.400
It's the eighth layout.

57
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.330
Let's say I want to start with that page for my first case study.

58
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.690
I can just drag this page all the way up to the top make that my first page.

59
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.550
And same goes for the other ones I can even duplicate.

60
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.530
Let's say I want to have two of those in a row.

61
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:14.490
I can right click duplicate spread and now have page one and page two and you can customize all this

62
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:23.550
is just a header so I can either say this is my first case study and swap that out with information.

63
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.470
So let's say I want to change the color so I don't really like this color for my headers or I want to

64
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.370
use a different color for each one and my portfolio for each case study.

65
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.900
I decided to go with a different header color so that when people were scrolling through the PDA if

66
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.590
they'd be able to identify what pages went with what.

67
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.430
Case Study.

68
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.610
But let's say you want to have them all change the same.

69
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.050
I'm going to go over to my colors watches my swatches panels.

70
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.740
Go ahead drag this out and I have something called branded color.

71
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.390
So this could transfer over and your template.

72
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.910
I'm just going to double click this branded color and I'm going to change it to any old color.

73
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:07.120
Let's say kind of this darker blue click OK and this is global so that swatch is on all of the headers

74
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.040
and also all of the type.

75
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.170
So let me go ahead and change that again so you can see

76
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.870
so I noticed that changed the topic.

77
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.110
Also all of the headers as well so you can kind of change that globally.

78
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.220
You don't have to sit there and change it on each page.

79
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.500
That's what's so nice about having these swatches assigned to specific objects.

80
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:35.200
Let's say I want to drag this photo right in and just drag it right in it populates I can right click.

81
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.330
Good a fitting good fill frame proportionately.

82
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.700
Or however you want to fit it and you can go ahead and do your photo of course we covered a lot of this

83
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.710
in my InDesign basic life's lessons where you can double click the photo and crop it within the frame

84
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.890
or just click the frame wants to change the frame size as you could see for my example there are so

85
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.770
many different varieties of layouts here that she can use.

86
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.110
And I find these layouts fairly effective and it's going to depend on your project type and how many

87
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.990
photos you have what layout might work out best.

88
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.210
I like to have a variety of layouts in my PDA presentation so that they're not the same layout over

89
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.200
and over you're switching it up maybe you have a photo on the right and then you have a photo on the

90
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.380
left on the next page.

91
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.590
Just trying to keep her PDA portfolio interesting as people look through the pages and remember not

92
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:22.520
to make it too long.

93
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.530
Try to keep it you know under 15 pages if possible because that's a whole lot of work for people to

94
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.840
look through they may never get all the way to the bottom.

95
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.420
So keeping it with your only your best work maybe pick three to six different case studies that she

96
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.970
can have pick out your best work only all that other smaller work you can put that on the side or make

97
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:46.520
a gallery page at the very end with some kind of random selected work instead of featuring a whole page

98
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.750
on some of those.

99
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.040
So there's some quick tips and hopefully you'll enjoy this portfolio building template.

100
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.900
I spent a lot of time on it making sure you had both a vertical and horizontal version and came up with

101
00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.280
some what I thought were really good layouts but you can customize it make it your own.

102
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:07.100
I can't wait to see your PDA portfolios and actions that can land some of that client work and start

103
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.060
to get some jobs.
