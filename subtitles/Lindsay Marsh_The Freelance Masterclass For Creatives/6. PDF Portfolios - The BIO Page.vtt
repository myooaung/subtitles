00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.880
So every good portfolio is a great bio page.

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.620
And what's also good about putting this together now is when we do a Web site based portfolio and also

3
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.650
have our profile on lots of different freelancer Web sites and other places to have your portfolio or

4
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.520
profile all this is going to come in handy.

5
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.320
So in the goals section of the class you've already written kind of a bio but we're gonna talk about

6
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.520
how to kind of perfect that bio for different situations.

7
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.760
So for a print or digital PDA you can be a little bit longer with your bio.

8
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.340
That's OK.

9
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.250
You can dedicated entire page to it or a half a page whatever you feel like you have room for.

10
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.140
So you've already written your bio.

11
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.530
But what do you do do you do a third person bio or a first person bio so you can download this document

12
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.260
so you can kind of see how I have written her bio I've done it from a third person and a first person

13
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.940
which one works better.

14
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.210
That's really up to you what's great about each one.

15
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.960
The first one the first person bio.

16
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.150
What's great about this is you get to write this from your own perspective.

17
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.790
I did this I got these awards.

18
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.100
It's great to be able to be personal you feel like you're talking directly to the viewer which has that

19
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.900
personal touch to it.

20
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.110
The great thing about a third person bio which is where it feels like someone else is writing to you.

21
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.620
So I talk in the third person so Lillian Hernandez was always dabbling in creative things from sketching

22
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.400
portraits in high school to diving headfirst into photoshop before Photoshop was even a thing.

23
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.690
Lillian is now using her very talents so you can kind of see how it looks like someone wrote this for

24
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.320
them.

25
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.710
It looks really professional and when you look at a lot of really famous people's bios usually they

26
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.490
use third person because it's really hard when you reach a certain level of success.

27
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.940
It's kind of hard to talk about yourself in the first person without sounding a little conceited.

28
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.130
So that's where the third person is nice because he can talk about awards that you've won but she can

29
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.070
do it in a way that doesn't sound like you're boasting.

30
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.070
So that's kind of the benefit to the third person bio so you can take a look and figure out which how

31
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.390
you want to crafted if you wanted to do in the third person the first person and it could be a little

32
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.320
bit longer with this.

33
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.690
So now that we have our bio put together or we're going to head into end design and we're going to lay

34
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.240
this out of course we need to find the best cropping for our profile image or headshot.

35
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.750
We're gonna do that right now.

36
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.470
So I'm starting to put together all the essential things that we're gonna need for her bio page.

37
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.100
We have a headshot we have kind of this attention grabbing headline and then the bio.

38
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.620
So I just took the first line of her written bio and made it more of a headline to kind of grab your

39
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.380
attention so you just don't have a big old block of bio.

40
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.270
You want to have it be have a little pull quotes are a little interesting things to break up large blocks

41
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:59.140
of text and this is a pretty large bio so we could even put a pull quote here We can kind of put a little

42
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.900
space in here and find some kind of pull quote there.

43
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.880
There's a lot of different things we can do to make this a little bit more interesting and so with headshots

44
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.070
we want to make sure it's nice and big this is a chance for people to really get to know you and to

45
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.120
kind of have a personal connection with you along with the bio.

46
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.850
We can also put another photo in the background maybe faded of some work or maybe her at work maybe

47
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.710
her at a desk or take a picture of you or have a friend take a picture of you working at your computer

48
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.600
at your desk something that makes you more of a real person.

49
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.800
We want to make you a real person not just someone smiling in the camera.

50
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.080
So having that secondary photo will be really important to have along with a formal headshot.

51
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.750
So I'm going to kind of work with this layout a little bit.

52
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.620
You can also work in client testimonials.

53
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.000
You could put three client testimonials here in this area so that people can see your bio they can read

54
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.270
all the great things clients have said about you.

55
00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:00.100
Not all of you agree to have client testimonials yet so you may not be able to do that but you can work

56
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.360
in other things.

57
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.540
Certain facts about you certain skill sets that you have.

58
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.020
I would think of this a little bit like a resumÃ©.

59
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.470
You don't have to be quite as detailed or have your entire work history we're not going to do anything

60
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.060
like that but this will act a little bit like a resume and you're not applying for a job but you're

61
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.790
applying for a client work a little bit different but you're going to want to know and tell people that

62
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:29.340
your skill sets and kind of kind of talk about who you are a little bit this is the final bio page I

63
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.170
came up with after maybe an hour of finding several different versions.

64
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.690
I want to do a couple things I definitely wanted to have a bigger headshot.

65
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.090
I wanted to have that background photo of creation process although this particular photo is not perfect

66
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.890
at least kind of proves the point of having just one other secondary photo of that person.

67
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.200
Are you in action would be really helpful.

68
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:56.130
I also included a kind of a script font for the bottom to look like it was a hand written signature.

69
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.840
I think handwritten signatures are great.

70
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.340
You can actually write it with a pen and take a picture of it and be able to import that in that way

71
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.080
and get a real signature.

72
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.400
It'll be even more authentic than using a script font.

73
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.320
Also included a quote down here of course if you're using a quote on your project down here make sure

74
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.370
these quotes are different make sure you find a different quote You don't want to repeat the same one

75
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.110
all the time.

76
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.820
So we will make sure you have different quotes there.

77
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:27.150
If you even have a quote and then I like to incorporate the logo again here on the on the bio page to

78
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.450
kind of bring home that brand consistency and kind of show them a little bit of your talent at work

79
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.190
and branding your own stuff.

80
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.900
So this is it.

81
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.920
This is kind of what we've created for the bio.

82
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.780
Nowhere does the bio fit in all of this.

83
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.980
So we have our cover photo.

84
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.560
We have a bio we have two projects we'll have a third project there at the bottom.

85
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.280
Where do we put their bio.

86
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.510
A lot of people put it as the first page but we have a nice cover photo so we have it as the second

87
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.410
page.

88
00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.540
Some people wait and they put it after the first project as kind of a storytelling kind of thing where

89
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.610
they have a project.

90
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.650
Then you show share a little bit about yourself.

91
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.350
I kind of prefer it after the cover photo but you can put it really on any page you'd like.

92
00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.490
I can go in and zoom out and figure out where you think it would fit well in the plan.

93
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:20.640
As I mentioned before in prior lessons you can sprinkle in a little bit about yourself throughout between

94
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.630
each project.

95
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:28.800
So instead of having one big bio page you can divide that up and be able to sprinkle that out between

96
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.090
projects do people get to know you through a series of different paragraphs.

97
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.630
So here's kind of your I would call it a more resumÃ© kind of presentation.

98
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.840
It's not exactly a resume.

99
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.020
It's kind of written a little bit more like that you're trying to sell yourself.

100
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.090
This is your big marketing page your marketing push.

101
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:55.200
So there you have it we have just created a PD f portfolio we can export this as a PD f I'm in Adobe

102
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:56.410
and design.

103
00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:03.360
But if you're in Canada or even in word just export that and a PDA digital or print depending on which

104
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:09.240
one you need I would do a Adobe PDA if interactive or print our digital version.

105
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.220
If you're going to be uploading uploading it to a Web site or emailing it if anybody's ever going to

106
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:19.470
print it out which is kind of rare these days you'd make sure you do a print version but an interactive

107
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.990
version keeps it nice and light.

108
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.560
So the file size is not so heavy.

109
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:31.170
We're going to go ahead and export that just another side note try not to export PDX as spreads which

110
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.580
is what this looks like it's a spread.

111
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:38.220
You want to do single pages because that's easier for people to look at when you email it.

112
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:43.010
So I'm just going to keep it as single pages and exporting it all.

113
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:48.510
And of course this is not a finished PDA portfolio it's still kind of in process but just wanting to

114
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.080
show you a quick example of how I put together that.

115
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.560
And of course next we have lots of different portfolios to do.

116
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.860
We can do our online Web site based one next.

117
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.910
We're not going to do a full blown web design but I'm going to go through some of the basics of what

118
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:07.980
you need to gather together and think about before doing your Web site based portfolio.

119
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:08.970
So I'll see you there.
