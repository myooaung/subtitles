1
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.340
I'm going to walk through the basic setup of an account for up work and this is going to be very similar

2
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.660
to other freelancer sites so once you kind of know the process and how to go through this you'll be

3
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.640
able to sign up for a lot of different freelancer sites in similar ways.

4
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.090
So we're just going to go through upward because that is one of the more well-known platforms out there.

5
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.530
So this is what kind of work do you do select up to three categories.

6
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:35.840
So we're going to be really just focusing on design and creative with Lillian Hernandez but we want

7
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.270
to go ahead and select this one as well because just in case she wants to get into web design or kind

8
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.310
of expand her audience a little bit or her client base we're going to go ahead and look at the future

9
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.420
of what we want to do.

10
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.790
So this is where we're going to basically select our keywords for what we want people to search when

11
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.400
they want to pull up our profiles.

12
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.300
These are gonna be our strongest skill sets.

13
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.630
So we're good to really think about what do we do the best.

14
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.300
That's what we want to focus on.

15
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.910
So you're not going to put every single one every single item you do good to do not only do what you

16
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.580
want to do but also what you think you can deliver the best quality work in.

17
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.540
So in this case we're going to do brand strategy graphic design art direction

18
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.910
we're going to just double check and make sure there's not other ones we think would be more powerful

19
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:28.380
so perhaps I can on click art direction and go into creative direction that's probably more specific

20
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.510
to what she does so just really we only get to pick five.

21
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.530
So we have to be very picky on what we select and also we won't be able to select any in the web because

22
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.850
it combines all the ones you've selected so five total.

23
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.750
So we leave that out just for now.

24
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.880
I kind of feel like she really needs to focus on the design and creative side where she could search

25
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.290
for your own terms.

26
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.070
So I wanted to love was a design that specialty is not found.

27
00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:03.900
So I get to stick with what we have and go to select specialty so now we need to pick one of these five

28
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.160
that's going to be our specialty.

29
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.020
So this is going to be your top keyword or category that we're going to really focus on.

30
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.720
And for her.

31
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.620
Obviously it's going to be graphic designers.

32
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.480
I you'll do a lot of all of this in graphic design the graphic design is the main overall category that

33
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.410
she'll be applying for jobs in.

34
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.680
So go to skills to select the design deliver deliverables you can provide.

35
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.320
So we could do infographics logo design will be one

36
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:43.770
brand identity and guidelines social media imagery brochures business cards catalogs

37
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.360
she may not want to do e-books it just depends on this is kind of if you don't want to do a particular

38
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.670
project don't include it if you're not a big fan of doing a particular type of work in your categories

39
00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.830
then just don't feel included if you don't want to do a book cover then don't put it on their email

40
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.470
magazine merchandise package Design

41
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.680
Inc.

42
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.950
When you feel like you're done filling out the kind of projects that you can do in your category let's

43
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.810
go ahead move on.

44
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.730
So this is when you get to select your styles.

45
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.680
This is where going through that beginning section of the course and figuring out what your style is

46
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.810
and your goals will all start to come in handy

47
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.290
and this is great because if I don't feel like I have a graffiti style or I can create that I'm not

48
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.400
going to put it.

49
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.400
So this is really nice and being able to fine tune what your particular skill sets are and you might

50
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.600
need to Google some of these and it depends on what industry you're in it will give you different results

51
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.510
than what I have for mine that I'm doing right now.

52
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.790
You might have to Google and figure out do I can I do this style.

53
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.280
Is this something I want to do.

54
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.750
If a client requests this because they might request a specific style and if I don't feel comfortable

55
00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.030
with it you know I don't know if I'm going to feel like I want to do it OK so select the software you

56
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.480
can use.

57
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.540
So they'll be able to use any of those not oral draw because you didn't have that software that's OK

58
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.200
to create infographics select the features you can create.

59
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:22.420
So I can do data visualization or she can flow charts that's getting really specific very specific wide

60
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:29.230
variety of social media expertise here are experience and working with these platforms.

61
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.390
Just not Snapchat.

62
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.170
So I'm not going include that.

63
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.240
So go to expertise level.

64
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.470
So what level.

65
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.110
Emma and you have to be honest.

66
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.910
Are we entry level or are we just starting.

67
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.720
Most of you guys will be entry level are we intermediate.

68
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.450
Do have we already done some work for a company worked full time for a couple of years.

69
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.140
Our expert.

70
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.800
Have we been in the business for five to 10 years and you feel like you are a leader in the industry.

71
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.940
So for her I'm going to put intermediate she's already had a couple years working for a firm a couple

72
00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.830
years doing that.

73
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:06.070
She's never done freelance before but this is really about how are you in that specific categories of

74
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.000
graphic design.

75
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.880
She's intermediate and experience choose the type of works you like.

76
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.370
All in-person work occasional in-person work or remote work.

77
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.430
Most of you guys are probably going to prefer remote work if there is a lot of opportunity available

78
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.380
locally or you live in a large city then perhaps doing some in-person work might work.

79
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.880
So I'm going to go and select all because I feel like she lives in a bigger city in Virginia and she

80
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.150
wants to kind of see if she can get some in-person work and also of course remote work so hourly rate.

81
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:45.670
So here's when you might want to skip to that pricing section and kind of look at what you want your

82
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:51.610
hourly rate to be because this is incredibly important in establishing this we don't want to under charge.

83
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:57.670
We don't want to cheapen ourselves but we also don't want to overcharge and not get any bids or job

84
00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:58.490
offers.

85
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.090
So we kind of want to find that happy medium where we're respected with the price that we can charge

86
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.460
or we can live off that.

87
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.490
But also we're not overcharging.

88
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.900
So since she is an intermediate level designer she can maybe push this a little higher than normal.

89
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.370
But honestly this is such an oversaturated platform.

90
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.550
I would actually do a lower hourly rate than you would normally charge a client just to kind of get

91
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.760
some of the job initial job so they can get some reviews on your profile because that's everything if

92
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.790
you don't have a review on your profile.

93
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.100
A lot of clients are going to skip over you.

94
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:38.170
So you want to get those initial high reviews so to get that kind of have to lower that hourly rate

95
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.340
lower than maybe you feel comfortable with at first.

96
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:49.300
Once you get a few client work jobs done and they leave reviews then you're able to increase that hourly

97
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.930
rate a little bit more.

98
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:56.260
So we're going to start off with a a much lower rate for the United States and for her intermediate

99
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.790
experience level that I would feel comfortable with.

100
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.150
But I think it'll help us land those first couple of gigs our jobs and then we can be able to get some

101
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.490
reviews and social proof.

102
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.200
So this is where we can add our Web site.

103
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.460
We already went through that profile portfolio Web site building process.

104
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.120
So we have that already ready so we go and paste that in there.

105
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.600
I'm just putting mine on there because I don't have a domain name for Lily and yet just because she's

106
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.310
an example of a search she's kind of representing me throughout this classing to put my personal Web

107
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:33.180
site and it says a portfolio increases the chances of getting hired by five times and may qualify you

108
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.650
for special programs.

109
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:40.230
So this is why getting that Web site set up or a portfolio setup is so critical.

110
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:45.540
So she's had some intermediate experience and a larger company working in-house as a graphic designer.

111
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:51.810
So going to put large businesses not quite Fortune 500 companies and we're going to have to list who

112
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.860
she worked for

113
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.930
enter school and education.

114
00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.370
I think this is important if you have any education to listed just like looking at someone's resumé

115
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:09.120
if they see that you have some real qualifying experience that helps and even putting Udemy courses

116
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:16.600
or skill share courses you've taken that are totally applicable to your line of work can also be used.

117
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.950
This is where we add our profile image.

118
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:24.210
I talked a little bit in prior lessons about how cropping that really nicely works really focusing in

119
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.400
on the face.

120
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.290
Make sure you have a nice smile.

121
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:33.330
Make sure it's clean edited sharp lines there's nothing blurry there's nothing pixilated has a nice

122
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:38.850
background image so if you want to take it outside behind a nice green tree you want to take it behind

123
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.700
your desk with your computer and your background.

124
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:47.180
If you're a painter or illustrator have have it taken in your studio lots and lots of light.

125
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:52.860
This profile image a lot of people when they look at your profile image and maybe the only image they

126
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.010
see of you.

127
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:59.220
So if it's done in a professional manner and you look like you're smiling and you're professional and

128
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:05.190
you're doing the right things people really make judgments based on profile images and it's kind of

129
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.600
a sad reality of how we are as humans.

130
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.860
But you need to have something that that puts your best foot forward because people do judge if it's

131
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:19.840
pixilated if it looks like it's taken in a dark room if it just doesn't look like you're a real professional

132
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.280
you know make sure you wear a nice professional clothing.

133
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.730
If you're an artist make sure you have something bright and vivid that goes along with your style.

134
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:32.520
All sorts of things you could do sometimes wearing glasses can help you know if you do wear glasses.

135
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.960
Don't be afraid to put those on.

136
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.640
That could make you look really professional.

137
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:41.890
So yeah it's just doing those little things to get that image looking as nice as possible.

138
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.670
So is going to give you a chance to crop.

139
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.630
I'm just using my image because I didn't want to use the image of Lillian Hernandez because that's a

140
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:53.550
created person that didn't want to put that photo on there and have any legal problems so I'm using

141
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.750
my own photo to crop this in as much as we want.

142
00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.730
And notice how it's focusing on the head.

143
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.630
It's got some nice background imagery.

144
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.420
I might even find a different photo where perhaps the House is not in there I can always clone that

145
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:12.390
out in Photoshop but it's kind of finding a nice smiling high lighting photo.
