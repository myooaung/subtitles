00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.430
Let's come up with a layout plan for a photo.

2
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.260
We have two different logo variations.

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.130
We did a personal branding project.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.640
These are some of the logos that Lillian came up with for the brand project.

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.550
So we need to figure out which one will be the most effective.

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.960
I like to since her name and her title are already in the logo.

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.470
Maybe we can make the logo a little bit bigger and the front center so it's really obvious whose portfolio

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.250
this is.

9
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.720
You want your name to be the center object of this piece.

10
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.800
Your name is the most important thing because a lot of recruiters are people who are looking for freelancers

11
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.530
are seeing portfolio after portfolio and names really get mixed up.

12
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.820
They really get lost.

13
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.320
So making sure you have a memorable presentation of your name or make it big enough is incredibly important

14
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.620
to pair it with a really really good photo of your work.

15
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.800
So we're going to go ahead and use that one maybe the full color display maybe could tuck this away

16
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.170
you never know when we might need that Web site is just as important as the name.

17
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.820
Usually the bottom is where people Danielli go to find the Web site.

18
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.630
Now going to have this on its own bar.

19
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.770
So there's no photo to blur it out so I'm going to put a white bar here so when we do start to drag

20
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.630
in photos the name and the Web site is going to be very very clear.

21
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.290
And so this is the only thing we're not quite sure where that needs to be it's very very important that

22
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.080
we tell them exactly what we do we can even have this up here and the top bar as well we can go ahead

23
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.990
and copy and paste this and put that up there so that it's easy easy to read.

24
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.520
So how are we going to pick a photo from everything we've done.

25
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.830
Let's say you've done well lots of personal work you've done lots of student work there's a lot of work

26
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.500
you want to display how do you know which one to pick to feature on the front.

27
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.510
We could always send that send this out to other colleagues and go watch one of these.

28
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.010
Do you like you can have a poll on your Facebook or social media.

29
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.830
Which project do you think deserves the top billing for my portfolio cover.

30
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.600
Or you could do a combination of a couple of great screenshots to kind of make a little bit of a gallery

31
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.770
of course avoid using too many because then people will kind of it'll lose its effectiveness.

32
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.320
So one thing I'm going to do is scroll through my projects I haven't done the third project yet.

33
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.000
We may or may not do that in the class it depends on how much time we have.

34
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.910
But I think a combination of maybe one or two photos might work really well.

35
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.670
We're going to this kind of figured this out.

36
00:02:27.670 --> 00:03:11.620
I'm going to go and drag some photos in and see what I can do for this cover.

37
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.280
So this is what I settled on.

38
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.180
Of course you can go do a lot of different layouts but I wanted to have something that kind of captured

39
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.710
everything that she does.

40
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.050
So instead of just doing one project image I used a mock up from graphic Burger dot.com I'm going to

41
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.940
go ahead and show the screenshot of the one I used and put together lots of different logos and logo

42
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.000
designs to create kind of a little bit of a different image here where you get to see and taste a little

43
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.950
bit of all the different style she has which is kind of nice to be able to not feel like you have to

44
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.610
show just one project on that cover photo.

45
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.470
You can put to use mockups to really kind of present all of your couple of different illustrations or

46
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.190
designs or photos or web designs in your own special way.

47
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.000
So I wanted to tick off a couple boxes to make sure this is going to be an effective cover.

48
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:05.260
First of all I know the person's name within the first few seconds so check I know what they do or what

49
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.070
they can offer.

50
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.200
So that's their check.

51
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.380
I have a contact way to find you check.

52
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.810
And so next we're going to focus on the bio and we're going to figure out where to place this in the

53
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.070
overall portfolio we have two projects done we still need to do a third one and we have a cover image.

54
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.040
So where does that bio fit in all this.

55
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.990
Do we need to have that in the next page.

56
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.910
Do we need to have it after the first project we're going to go ahead and put that page together.

57
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:31.600
Right now.
