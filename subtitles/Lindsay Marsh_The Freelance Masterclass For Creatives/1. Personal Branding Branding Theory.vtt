00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.300
This section will set the tone for the rest of the course as the personal branding aspect will be where

2
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:16.780
we find our inspiration for the look feel and message we send to our potential clients.

3
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.670
The copywriting we create during this process can be used later on when we craft our portfolios and

4
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.500
Web site.

5
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.910
The logo created can be used on all materials we produce including the invoices we'll be creating together

6
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:28.640
as well.

7
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.820
Branding is at the heart of any freelancers journey and that's why after we set our target markets and

8
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.330
our goals this is the next natural essential step.

9
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.820
First of all what exactly is the brand and how to brands differ for freelancers and individuals and

10
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.460
for larger corporations our personal brand consists not only of the logo and symbol but the freelancers

11
00:00:51.460 --> 00:01:00.580
personal story experience history personality unique selling point color palettes stationery look apparel

12
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.560
digital assets portfolio styling and Web site presentation.

13
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.000
Whoop.

14
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.870
That's a lot.

15
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.800
But your brand touches every part of your business.

16
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.550
Think of the branding as an extension of yourself and your skill set.

17
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.850
This means it may be more than just visuals.

18
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.630
It can also be how you write your bio the words and personality you bring and also how you present your

19
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:30.700
work and the colors you choose strong personal brands exude consistency in everything they produce.

20
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.130
Even without a logo you know just by looking at the copywriting styling personality who it might be

21
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:43.020
your personal brand should be unforgettable remember people looking at your portfolio website will be

22
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.020
looking at many more your branding can play up port and part of making you look polished and professional

23
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.800
and helping you land the right clients with matching goals.

24
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.570
I want to review the characteristics I see of strong personal branding.

25
00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.780
First of all they have personality.

26
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.120
They echo the freelancers main talents and skill sets by presenting the freelancers unique style on

27
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.570
full display.

28
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.170
You want to attract clients but you also want to find clients that will match with your style not only

29
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.910
to benefit the client's needs but to find projects that are fulfilling and rewarding for you as a freelancer.

30
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.500
They are adaptable.

31
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.540
Their logos and logo marks can be used on all things and maintain the same quality.

32
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:34.350
This includes small social media images Fava Khan's business cards and even email signatures.

33
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.670
They make memorable experiences they leave impressions on the viewer or potential client not only in

34
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.580
how they show their work but how they craft their stories and explain their projects they show a high

35
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.850
level of professionalism.

36
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.760
This means great grammar spelling and sentence construction and all text shown their photos and photo

37
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.530
rails resolutions are cropped properly.

38
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.490
They present themselves in a professional manner and even in casual communications like email and texting

39
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.300
they nail their target market.

40
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.760
They appeal and define their target markets the way they build their logo down to their color selections

41
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.880
they know and understand how to appeal their target clients and their viewers.

42
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.900
Now they reviewed some fantastic examples of personal branding for freelancers.

43
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.740
I now want to review the process of the personal branding timeline.

44
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:36.450
It could be broken down into four main stages crafting the story creating the logo creating brand assets

45
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.020
and finally putting together your digital presence we're going to work through a lot of these steps

46
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.350
together in this course.

47
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.080
You can download these documents you can take a detailed look at some of the natural stages and the

48
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.720
personal branding process.

49
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.760
You do not have to complete them all.

50
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.660
Not all freelancers are going to need a T-shirt or certain social media graphics but think of this as

51
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.520
a general guide and it thinks about all aspects of the brand.

52
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.570
I'll see you in the next lesson as we work on the first section which will be crafting our story.
