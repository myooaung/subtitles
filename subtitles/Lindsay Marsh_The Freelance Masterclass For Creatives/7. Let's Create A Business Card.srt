1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,220
So now I need to apply the personal brand to a multitude of items in this class I'll walk through the

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,720
creation of two very important items a business card and a letterhead.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,940
We'll talk about the paid an organic social media post design and other types of digital design a little

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,770
bit later in the marketing section of this course.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,700
Business cards may seem outdated to some but when it comes to working and finding local clients having

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,220
a physical card to hand out really helps with remembering who you are and even jotting down quick notes

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,870
about your conversation when we start talking about finding clients.

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,360
I will emphasize heavily how important local networking is the business card is your golden ticket to

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,550
starting conversations but also providing something they can walk away with and remind them to follow

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,690
up with you your task is to create either a single side or double side business card for your personal

11
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,490
brand.

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,710
There is no requirement to what to include on a business card.

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,020
More commonly you'll find basic contact information like phone email or web site.

14
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,930
I'd like to include something interesting about my business.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,760
Maybe my main headline or phrase that defines who I am what I do and how I do it better than the next

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,310
guy or gal business cards are small.

17
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,530
So this does not lend itself to big paragraphs of text.

18
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,330
So use this real estate wisely to say more with less.

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,610
There are all sorts of lovely effects you can apply to your business cards ever using an online printing

20
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,620
company like mu dot com.

21
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:32,290
You could apply a wonderful gold or silver foil stamping to give you a logo or another brand asset a

22
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:38,900
nice high end shine during the process of creating your first food marketing items you'll start to work

23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,040
out certain layouts font sizes for particular things like I mentioned earlier.

24
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,680
For example working with this contact information I created a unique way of dividing the lines to display

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,000
the information.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,590
This pairs well with the elements in my logo too.

27
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,530
There's a little bit of a theme there.

28
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,790
I could take this arrangement and use that on the letterhead layout or the business card layout displaying

29
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,190
the same information.

30
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,240
This is called brand consistency.

31
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:09,970
Using those similar layouts in different situations remember use your textures icons patterns or other

32
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,650
brand assets and find ways to incorporate those to continue that brand consistency.

33
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:20,230
In this example I'm using the repeat pattern I created from a few custom icons I created to create that

34
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:27,040
subtle background to complement the logo those who are illustrators or photographers may want to feature

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,520
your own work paintings photos illustrations to show that style whatever might capture the attention

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,000
of your target client or make them happy.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,150
You could start to notice our theme throughout the items were creating.

38
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,170
We can easily apply this style to many different items.

39
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,340
T-shirts are a great way to start conversations with people while you're out and about networking or

40
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,930
just living your life.

41
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:55,510
I had a brand T-shirt with my logo and tagline on it and it landed several clients just by living my

42
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,550
normal life.

43
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,930
People are interested in what you are and what you do and what is on your T-shirt.

44
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:06,720
They're intrigued by it and so they ask you naturally some follow up questions.

45
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,580
So now that we developed our logo and some brand assets what file formats do I need to have these in

46
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,570
I'm going to be doing this yourself or hiring another person to do this part for you.

47
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:21,890
These are the formats I like to have my logos or brand assets and if possible the logos.

48
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:28,970
I'd like to have these in smaller J pegs larger PND pages can have transparent backgrounds as I like

49
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:33,770
to have these in vector format so as simple daddy I or illustrator file or a dot.

50
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,980
P.S. If using another program is great.

51
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,560
If you're getting your logo printed out and custom promo items a vector file is usually requested by

52
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,330
a printing company so it's nice to have one of those on hand we'll be uploading all of these exported

53
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:54,760
PMG and JPEG files that we have of our brand assets so we could start to put together a sample business

54
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,150
card front and back we're gonna be doing that in Adobe Illustrator.

55
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,700
But you could put this together in any program of your choice.

56
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,610
Once again these lessons focus less on using the software as many of you guys will be using different

57
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,350
software or some of you will be hiring someone to do these designs for you.

58
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:15,550
I'll focus more on how to extend your personal brand to other areas and less on graphic design as this

59
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:21,850
course is focused on freelancing and getting that personal brand ready to go if you're interested and

60
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,720
knowing how to use canvas in detail and how to create your entire brand in Canada.

61
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,590
I off offer a branding course for non designers.

62
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,330
Do it yourself non designers.

63
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,790
I also offer courses in all the Adobe software if you're interested in doing all this in Adobe software

64
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,690
OK we're ready.

65
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,980
We have all these brand assets we can pull from and are going to be doing that as you create all the

66
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,410
different assets you'll need.

67
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,650
You may not need a business card but you're going to need some kind of contact information whether it's

68
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,860
an email signature or some kind of way to display all your vital contact information.

69
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,410
So let's begin we have a two sided business card front and back.

70
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,070
I went ahead and pulled our headline.

71
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,550
This was kind of a little bit more generic than I'd like it to be this headline but there's several

72
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,560
more that I developed in that brainstorming process in the goal section of the class whereas coming

73
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:18,190
up with some kind of ways to talk about what I did and on one very simple statement I like to put this

74
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,080
in my business card because a lot of business cards will just have kind of your generic contact information

75
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,450
but they don't really tell you how you bring value like with my business cards.

76
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:33,010
I do elevate your business through design or something very similar to that.

77
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,780
They cut it tells them a little bit what you do more than just your title.

78
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,270
So I like to incorporate a little bit more of ideas and a little bit of text that way you never want

79
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,570
to overwhelm it too much if you can't say it in one sentence.

80
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,710
It's probably to be too long for a business card.

81
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,940
They're very very tiny.

82
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,790
You don't want to overwhelm a text.

83
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,150
Another great thing about having all of your branding standards manual developed.

84
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,280
I could start pulling all these assets that I need so I can go ahead and pull you know a logo over.

85
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:07,600
I can also have my type setup so I know what type of fonts I should use here for the headline and other

86
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,500
information.

87
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,180
So it's really just a matter of figuring out what I think would capture the imagination of a client.

88
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,990
What do I think would be a proper layout on the front in the back.

89
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:21,610
I like to have business cards that are front and back because they're really not that much more expensive

90
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,360
to get back these days.

91
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,420
And I'd like to put high quality upgrades and finishes to my business cards maybe a metallic ink foil

92
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:35,020
stamping and bossing go to move dot com if you want to get all those fancy effects but I like to do

93
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,130
that just because I don't mind spending a little bit more on my business card because I hand him out

94
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:44,050
very deliberately when I go meet people and I hand out a business card at somebody I've had a conversation

95
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,180
with someone I seriously want to pursue as a client.

96
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,040
I want to give them my best foot forward.

97
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,970
I'm going to give them a very high quality maybe even a little bit more expensive business card maybe

98
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:00,820
even you spend 50 cents even a dollar on a business card that's worth it a dollar if you're handing

99
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,190
that out to a high quality potential client or lead.

100
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,750
So let's continue to kind of fiddle around with the layout and we're just thinking about ideas we're

101
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,800
not thinking about graphic design I'm going to focus more on what what I'm including and why.

102
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,530
So we definitely want to have that headline over here.

103
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,030
So you to bring that headline we don't want to overwhelm people so it's going to make it a little bit

104
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,100
smaller.

105
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,490
I'm a big fan of putting the logo on both sides because you never know what side when they take it out

106
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,280
of their wallet or they take it out of their purse you don't know what side they're going to land on.

107
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,790
And I also like to do different contrasts on the side.

108
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:40,960
So instead of have two white sides I maybe have a darker background and then a lighter background or

109
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,360
the other way around.

110
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:47,170
I think it really helps to kind of add to the experience so you're just adding to the experience the

111
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:53,410
back of your card could even feature one of your works as long as maybe you have your logo or a watermark

112
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,030
mark somewhere on there so they can kind of see that work and see your name.

113
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,520
They want to connect your work in your name together.

114
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:05,080
So that's another great thing if you're illustrator especially a photographer or even a web designer

115
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:11,140
putting a little piece of your work a little snapshot on the back along with your logo really really

116
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,090
really helps.

117
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,680
So you need to make business cards fairly unique.

118
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,720
You know you kind of have the standard layout where you have the information over here and you kind

119
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,750
of have a typical layout but try to be creative even though you have to do contact information and clear

120
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,880
manner and you want to be consistent with your brand so continue to use the same typefaces throughout.

121
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,310
Find ways to get it to work or if you feel like your typeface or colors are not working please revisit

122
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:41,940
your branding inspiration and brand boards and all that stuff and branding standards and tweak it.

123
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,760
This is when you go back and forth in that creative process.

124
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,180
So some other things I'd like to include is I'd like to include obviously a Web site that's working

125
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,170
that they're going to drive them to the Web site.

126
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:57,640
That's the main focal point is not really the e-mail I'd like them to contact me but I'd like them to

127
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,560
contact me after they visited my Web site and portfolio because I want to get them sold before they

128
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,990
email me so that it would be a very soft sell for it to land that client they've already seen my work

129
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,940
I don't have to then send them to the Web site and keep going through that.

130
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,050
So the Web site Big bold beautiful.

131
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,070
That's what we want to have the Web site is going to be very prominent.

132
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,360
We could even bring in some of our colors I'm going to go ahead and copy and paste my color palette

133
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,760
so I have easy access to it.

134
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:31,160
So if we wanted to go ahead and switch things up we can so that'll be the main focal points is sometimes

135
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,170
putting your Web site away from the other contact information helps especially if you're doing its own

136
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:42,320
side because it really helps that user focus more on the Web site and not get lost among the other contact

137
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,580
information.

138
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,470
And also like to put a very obvious statement if my header making your small business ideas come to

139
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,690
life it's a little generic it doesn't actually say that I'm a graphic designer although we have a graphic

140
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,720
designer in her logo which is nice.

141
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,630
I wanted to have a very obvious statement almost like a title.

142
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,430
So if you want to say senior graphic designer or senior photographer or art director or illustrator

143
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,620
those are great to have titles.

144
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:12,650
Sometimes I'll put it in a phrase so offering full service graphic design or I can probably even rephrase

145
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:18,350
that a little bit to make it sound better but just kind of having something that's very very very obvious

146
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,340
what you do right when you look at it you're not playing in a games you're getting right to the point

147
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,150
so they can remember oh yeah she's the graphic designer I met in the elevator.

148
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,490
So that's exactly what you want to kind of do.

149
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,840
So I got to spend about 10 minutes rearranging everything and trying to find what I think is a suitable

150
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:39,050
layout already kind of did a couple of ideas here with an invoice and there's already some kind of brand

151
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:44,330
consistency I'm developing with kind of how I arrange everything so I'm going to do that and incorporate

152
00:10:44,330 --> 00:11:26,570
that to have that brand consistency and I'll be right back.

153
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,030
So each one of these concepts are effective in their own ways.

154
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,030
That's why it's important to put together several different ideas and layouts to find out which one

155
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:39,340
you think would work in some cases even getting multiple different versions of your business card printed

156
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,160
for different situations.

157
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,540
The one here on the left really works well for high end clientele with this nice gold foil stamping

158
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,910
on the bottom and beautiful use of texture.

159
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,560
It's very clean and it reduces all the extra clutter.

160
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:57,760
I don't have the tag line and just focus on the offering full service graphic design as kind of the

161
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,820
main focal point on the front as well.

162
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:05,960
The Web site so it's very clean modern and really would do well at attracting a hiring clientele.

163
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,470
The one on the middle is very basic it's got the tagline on the top it's got my basic information as

164
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:16,480
everything it needs it even has a little sketching photo in the background using photo to kind of help

165
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,990
draw the user in and explain a little bit about what you do and how your process is different.

166
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:26,500
Of course we're a brainstorming design company so I put a little bit of that sketch pencil in the background

167
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:33,340
I thought that would be a fitting image for what we she does as a graphic designer on the bottom my

168
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:40,180
future her work on full display I would had an arranged a lot of her logos in a particular order and

169
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:46,240
was able to kind of put that on the back and of course with a big focal point on that Web site because

170
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,220
that's where they're going to be able to look at these in more detail and get case studies which we'll

171
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:57,310
be doing in the next section of the class creating our Web site portfolio in our PDA portfolio on the

172
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:04,420
right is kind of more of your everyday use I think it's kind of more flexible and adaptable to different

173
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:10,900
situations kind of your basic front and a very clean back not showing any work or photos but just kind

174
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,120
of showing what needs to be shown for the business card.

175
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,820
So three different layout ideas you know took about 20 minutes kind of brainstorm this you can of course

176
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,920
put this together in any program you like but it's kind of a little bit of my rough process of how I

177
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:31,240
think about business card and what needs to be on it not necessarily design but kind of the effectiveness

178
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,360
of the card.

179
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,930
So once again you're seeing a lot of two tone contrasts.

180
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,750
We have a bright front and kind of opposite darker back.

181
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,690
Not required but it is find that higher contrast nice as the user flips the card over they can definitely

182
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,790
tell the difference between the sides.
