00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,980
Fort licensing is a complicated mess.

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:11,990
It can have huge consequences if you use a font requiring a purchase license for a commercial project

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,210
and you don't hold the proper license for it.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,630
Let's start with the easy stuff the stuff that should not scare you.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,280
I'm going to talk first about the open flight licensing which provides the user to free use of fonts

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,960
without attribution.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,950
A great example of this in action is Google fonts.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,530
Here's what they say about the Google font program which contains all open font licensing all of the

9
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:42,440
fonts in our catalog are free and open source making beautiful type accessible to anyone for any project.

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,580
This means you can share favorites and collaborate easily with friends and colleagues.

11
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,650
Google fonts takes care of all the licensing and hosting ensuring that the latest and greatest version

12
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,880
of any font is available to anyone.

13
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,080
That all sounds great.

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,210
So that means I can use these fonts without fear of needing a license.

15
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,340
Yep you betcha.

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,600
I'd love to find fonts on Google fonts knowing I do not need to purchase a license.

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,750
Makes me feel less worried when picking fonts for client projects.

18
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,030
I'm also free to share the fonts with clients if they needed to use them on the computer as well.

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,790
If you visit fonts stock Google dot com you'll be able to view their entire font library and download

20
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:25,170
the fonts you'd like to use open Sands and railway are fun to use all the time for my videos.

21
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,730
And you're seeing railway in use right now throughout this entire class.

22
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:34,730
When you visit the open Sands page on fonts that Google dot com you could see the font author and view

23
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:41,510
the specific type of open license each font uses please visit each font you plan to download and take

24
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:49,150
a look at their licensing just to make sure not all fonts are open source some fonts require the purchase

25
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:55,030
of a license or a EU L.A. an end user licensing agreement.

26
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,680
There are different type boundaries where you can find and purchase font licenses.

27
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,960
I'm on typography dot com which leads to the hoofer and company Web site.

28
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:08,770
There are type foundry that sells hundreds of different fault licenses for many different styles and

29
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,860
typefaces.

30
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,310
Take for example the archer font families.

31
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:19,180
I could purchase a license to use Archer on one computer or I can purchase it for use of up to a thousand

32
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,070
computers.

33
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:25,240
If I'm at a large company and I want this font to be used on every computer in the company but if I'm

34
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:32,800
a single freelancer I just need to purchase it for my 1 computer but if I have a laptop and a desktop

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,500
computer I want to be able to use Adobe Illustrator and have access to the Archer fonts on both my laptop

36
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,730
and my desktop.

37
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:46,130
So that doesn't mean I need to purchase a license for both computers who buys font licenses.

38
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:53,200
Me my client both of us fonts are essentially pieces of software used by other software like Photoshop

39
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:59,470
Illustrator or Microsoft Word For example when you buy a font license you buy it for that computer like

40
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,900
it's a piece of software.

41
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:07,930
For example if my client owns a license to use let's say Adobe Photoshop they can allow me to use it

42
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:13,840
if I'm an employee of said company and they purchase enough licenses for Photoshop for me to use on

43
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,670
that company computer.

44
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:21,460
If I'm a freelance designer for example I'm not part of said company just a contractor so I would need

45
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:28,370
to buy my own version of Photoshop to remain legal even though I'm doing work for said company.

46
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,180
That same basic concept can be applied to fonts as well.

47
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,350
Treat them just like a piece of software.

48
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,140
If my client purchased a font to use in their branding package that means if I'm going to maintain a

49
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,660
freelance design work for that client I also need to purchase a license for that font and charge the

50
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:51,450
client the amount for that license or the client may have an extended license that gives me the ability

51
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,530
to use it as well.

52
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,600
But it's good to find out that piece of information from the client first thought licenses come in a

53
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,940
few different forms.

54
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,030
This is where it gets a little complicated.

55
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,990
If I intended to use this font for print design for example a flyer I designed in Adobe Photoshop I

56
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:13,690
can purchase the desktop license for this font or if I'm going to use it for a Web site I need to have

57
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,910
the web font type of license.

58
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:21,310
Also if I wanted to use this font as a part of a web application there's a separate license for that

59
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,350
as well.

60
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,850
Fortunately most type foundries make it easy by buying all of them in a bundle so you can feel free

61
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:35,290
to use that font if any application in any form of course is bundles cost a little more this is where

62
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:41,170
having a font subscription pays off you can purchase a monthly subscription at type kit for example

63
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,780
and be able to have access to all the fonts in their library.

64
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,880
Adobe happens to own type kit.

65
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,900
And if you have a creative cloud subscription you automatically have access to the entire font library

66
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,210
and licenses that come with it.

67
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,150
Another good reason to be an Adobe Creative Cloud user

68
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,770
I noticed that died out as a font that needs a license to use.

69
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,930
I also notice that type Kit has a version of data that is free to use because of my creative cloud subscription.

70
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,780
If you want to subscribe to these fonts without the adobe cloud subscription you could still pay an

71
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,640
annual fee to have access to the spot library.

72
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,320
Remember when you have subscription to a font b any one of these spots subscription websites and you

73
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,580
pass your work on to another designer or to a client who wants to update or modify that work themselves.

74
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,380
They must also have a subscription to type kit for example to use the same font you used on type kit

75
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:45,250
for their system or they need to hold a license for that font you're passing along the anywhere any

76
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:51,940
one of their software programs or hold an individual license for that font so we have covered France

77
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,390
that you need to purchase fonts that come bundled into software subscription.

78
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,850
But what about those free fonts.

79
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,900
You can download all over the Internet.

80
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,790
They each come with a licensing agreement.

81
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,070
When you download the font read it carefully.

82
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:10,190
Some require an attribution to the author and some come with restrictions.

83
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:17,820
I'm on a Web site called Duff on dot com which is a common place to find these free fonts when browsing

84
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,240
fonts.

85
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,990
I looked over toward the licensing and then noticed a few different types.

86
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,410
Some are 100 percent free and these are the same as being open source.

87
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,980
No attribution is required but make sure you double check.

88
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,590
Another may say free for personal use only.

89
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,590
So if you're doing this for a personal project or zine you're free to use.

90
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,860
For a client or if you plan on using it for a for profit business you need to purchase a license on

91
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,230
the font Web site.

92
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:47,610
When you download a font it usually comes with a text document that lists the type of license it has

93
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,880
and outlines how you can use it and make sure you do this for every font you download online.

94
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,450
You can never be too careful.
