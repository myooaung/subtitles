1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,970
Are you ready for a student design challenge.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,070
This one is going to be a bit personal.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:13,080
Your task is to create a personal brand for yourself or your freelance business.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,410
You may be a graphic designer web designer illustrator or creative writer but all of us have something

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,940
personal about us that makes us unique.

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,650
I want you to create a logo that best represents your unique approach to your craft.

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,480
This could be with use of color symbols abstract art or something and it has personal value to you and

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,100
your business.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,170
Branding is more than just a logo the logo is a small part of this or the student project.

10
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,020
The only requirement is to create some sort of logo and name presentation but also to combine it with

11
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,790
other brand assets.

12
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,230
This can be a business card.

13
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:55,380
A simple letterhead or just a simple social media post using your brand and extending your brand out

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,610
to one item so we can see how this works in action.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,460
I would love to see your work so make sure you post in the community area of the course you're currently

16
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,590
taking our post in the student Facebook group or just message me your work.

17
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,160
Remember the following when creating your personal brand.

18
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,010
Number one.

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,790
Remember that personal branding is hard.

20
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,770
It could be very introspective and require you to really think about your style skill and uniqueness.

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,150
Number two that personal brand development is about hitting your desired target audience.

22
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:37,360
What type of clients do you want to attract number three that you may go back and forth between lots

23
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,670
of great concepts and still not be able to settle on one.

24
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:46,000
That is why submitting concepts to a community can be helpful and helping you think and process through

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,550
which one might work out best for you if you want to follow the entire personal branding process.

26
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:58,790
I do so in my freelance masterclass for creatives course that's on both skill share and Udemy.

27
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,720
You are not required to be a student or enroll to participate.

28
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,210
Everyone is welcome.

29
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:10,280
I look forward to seeing what you guys come up with and I'm expecting this to be a highly active student

30
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,480
design challenge with lots of great projects submitted.
