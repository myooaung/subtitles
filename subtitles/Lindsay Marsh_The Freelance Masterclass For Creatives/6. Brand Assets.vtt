00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.710
Good branding takes a more complex logo and can simplify it further to be able to exist on its own.

2
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.320
For example Lillian's logo can be simplified to exist as a smaller icon for example we can then take

3
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.400
this icon and create a background watermark to use as background for letterheads this takes our finished

4
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.210
logo and takes to the next level branding.

5
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.500
Not only do we have a full logo but we can also develop these icons illustrations.

6
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.220
What they say is brand assets that can be used on our Web site letterheads invoices and little creative

7
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.950
details and flair to help further communicate our style and personal preferences.

8
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.930
Maybe there's a consistent texture that is used throughout all of your materials.

9
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.640
There could even be a series of shapes or geometric shapes that are used as common supporting graphics

10
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.390
to help to continue to elevate your brand theme across all channels.

11
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.450
Are you a designer who focuses on icon design for example you could create an entire series of personal

12
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.570
icons and create a pattern background for use on all materials giving your brand a consistent matching

13
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.630
feel once again if you're hiring someone else to create this for you.

14
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.350
Make sure you share your thoughts and ideas with them on this.

15
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.090
Just an example if you're a photographer maybe you can share your personal favorite photos and maybe

16
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:32.010
they can create a background graphic to use the branded asset your task is to create several branded

17
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.770
assets you can use alongside your logo.

18
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.750
This could be a background texture separator bars for example or icons you can use.

19
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.580
These assets will come in handy as we create your business cards and other branded materials and feature

20
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.830
lessons you could start to incorporate some of those headline phrases we developed in the goal section

21
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.760
of the class.

22
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.890
Those headline phrases will be great for Instagram and the business cards we'll be creating together

23
00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.290
in the next lesson before we start creating a few example assets for our brand.

24
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.090
Lilian HERNANDEZ I wanted to go over a few tips when creating your brand assets.

25
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.850
Make sure there's a consistent theme throughout your logo and branded assets.

26
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.110
This will make your brand cohesive and interesting.

27
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.090
Notice similar color usage throughout these branded elements.

28
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.870
Did you notice similar treatment to the style of typography as well.

29
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.760
Make sure these asset elements are in separate files so you can use them independently for a multitude

30
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.080
of situations.

31
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.180
This may be more for those who hire someone to create their personal brands need to have all the icons

32
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.320
as separate files.

33
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.700
So in case the need to use one when creating another branded marketing material you'll have all those

34
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.560
assets and a nice neat folder and ready to access.

35
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.020
Don't be afraid to be creative.

36
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.620
Remember we're developing personal brands for creative freelancers.

37
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.780
Be bold find your style and maximize it.

38
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.540
This is the chance to be creative with branding.

39
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.820
Not everyone gets this chance as the only limits you set are the ones you set for yourself.

40
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.850
So now we're going to create a broadening standards manual for our freelancing company branding standards

41
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.740
are a little bit different than inspiration boards branding standards or sometimes they're called branding

42
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.850
manuals or guides outlines and overviews your entire brand.

43
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.710
This helps to explain to others who may be creating assets for you how to use your brand assets and

44
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.630
logo.

45
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.350
It also explains in details your color palette and when to use certain colors it will show the many

46
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.380
different formats in which your logo can exist including single color full color and other variations

47
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.860
that might be used for different situations.

48
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.540
Will also show what font choices are suitable for use when creating your branded materials including

49
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:56.370
a headline or a larger sized font as well as what font to use for your smaller body copy these also

50
00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.560
show any the other branded assets like textures patterns icons and more.

51
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.020
I find great branding standards manuals include a few Finnish designs including a business card or a

52
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:15.450
social media post just to show how these branded assets are being used and how to properly use them.

53
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.120
I wanted to show you how messy it is to create all your brand assets in our logo design.

54
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.190
So this is just the logo concept process was really trying to find the right fonts and try to find the

55
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.520
right font pairing.

56
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.300
It took some time to figure out what colors I wanted to use as well I tried out quite an array of different

57
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.850
colors I tried bright colors I tried to bring out the colors for my inspiration board to try to pull

58
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.980
things there and so I kind of settled on that green teal color that I pulled from the inspiration board

59
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.020
but I started to develop icons and patterns.

60
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.220
Just having an area to play around with and really produce some ideas and concepts for my brand assets

61
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.560
you can kind of see this kind of mess I created try to think of some maybe some icons that I thought

62
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.560
really connected with what she does which is a graphic designer right cause some basic tools like layout

63
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.530
the pen tool a little typography element they're like she works with Type A lot and also kind of a color

64
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.600
wheel type area.

65
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.720
So just kind of coming up with some generic icons at all.

66
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.400
I did this all in Adobe Illustrator Of course you can use affinity designer you can hire a designer.

67
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.960
A lot of different ways you can approach this but I thought I wanted to kind of show you a little bit

68
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.670
of the mess that it took.

69
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.960
I also made a pattern using the pattern tool in Adobe Illustrator to be able to create that pattern

70
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.740
I thought it'd be great to have a really neat branded asset that I can put on backgrounds and in this

71
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.180
area.

72
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.860
I was still trying to figure out how to best overlay that texture on top.

73
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.540
And this was kind of what I came up with.

74
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.540
I don't think in the end I ended up going with something a little bit more clean but just some ideas

75
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.650
that were running through my head and one to kind of show you my raw process because a lot of people

76
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.840
I don't know a lot of instructors to show the finished polished stuff but I wanted to show you the messy

77
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.540
stuff because this is what it's like when you're creating brands.

78
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.590
It gets messy.

79
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.640
There's a lot of different versions and iterations you have to go through to find that final design.

80
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.820
So this is kind of my rough play area where I'm figuring all this out I'm going to take a lot of this

81
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.130
and put it together in a really nice brand presentation and we're going to be doing that with our brand

82
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.640
manual which is going to be right over here.

83
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.150
So this is the brand manual that I settled with.

84
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.320
You can kind of see how I have the color palette have the choices I've found the inspiration there and

85
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:34.050
also including that as a part of my brand presentation and we have a couple different versions of the

86
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.260
logo like we talked about a little earlier.

87
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.120
There's a single color version and it can exist and a lot of different primary colors of the brand so

88
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.610
it can exist in the teal it can exists as a watermark which is kind of a lighter gray color it can exist

89
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.280
on the back of a letterhead.

90
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:57.240
You could put this very easy to read still text on top so just kind of laying out the different arrangements

91
00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:03.840
of logos and you know what happens is when you start to develop your Web site your portfolio your business

92
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.040
cards you'll start to use this logo and you might run into some limitations.

93
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:13.470
And that's great because you can always revisit your brand manual and add different versions of your

94
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:14.310
logo.

95
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:20.340
And so for example when we create our profile our online portfolio we're gonna have some limitations

96
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:27.540
with a round seal logo because they don't always fit nicely on a top of a Web site in the header area.

97
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:32.460
So we're going to need to create a really simplified non seal version of the logo so we can be able

98
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.910
to have multiple applications of our logo.

99
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.570
And that's going to be very common with almost any logo not every logo is going to fit perfectly in

100
00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.190
that one format.

101
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:46.170
So we're going to be developing that a little bit later to make sure that we have a horizontal version

102
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.320
of the logo so we can work in digital formats.

103
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.200
So we could see kind of the iconography icons are not required.

104
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.270
I'd just like to have them because you know it's kind of nice to have a series of icons just for this

105
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.260
particular person.

106
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:05.340
I found it to be nice and also secondary colors not required what I did is I wanted to pull for my inspiration

107
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:11.070
boards some of those colors that I found that weren't didn't did not end up as primary colors but I

108
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:16.460
thought what if for some reason those colors are not working out for that particular format or add you

109
00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:21.090
know I don't want to be stuck with these cool colors when I really want to have a high impact color.

110
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:26.580
And so that's why I chose some secondary colors that I thought were alternatives if I felt like a particular

111
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.580
ad needed to be much more brighter and vibrant and eye catching.

112
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:36.360
And so just kind of developing a secondary color palette and I have the hex codes underneath just so

113
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.790
I can copy and paste those hex codes whenever I start to develop online assets I can copy and paste

114
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:48.810
and I have a document I can go to and easily access that stuff that can further expand on the brand

115
00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:53.700
assets including the background texture I created to create something subtle enough where I can put

116
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:59.490
text on top and it doesn't fight with it too much and I'll see when a layout your typography plan or

117
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.610
your font plan.

118
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.250
So what type of fonts can you use as there are multiple fonts that you can use in your brand is there

119
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.020
one you use for headlines.

120
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.200
And is there one that use for secondary lines.

121
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:13.840
Is there one you use for body copy if you have long blocks of copy.

122
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:19.950
This is great for your digital web site but it's also great when we create your PDA portfolio and other

123
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.620
kind of assets we can kind of have the setup.

124
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:28.310
So you have kind of a font or typography plan so you can literally copy and paste from this area you

125
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:34.060
can drag this over you you know what typeface is going to be this one's bitten Sands and this one's

126
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:40.230
commuters Sands light so I can already have that establish it's easy for me to go ahead and pick those

127
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:45.570
as a start to develop the branded assets and also application on darker backgrounds it's always great

128
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.830
to think about that I go through that and a lot of my design courses when we're developing brands and

129
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:55.440
logo designs how important it is to have your logo be as flexible as possible that means it needs to

130
00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.180
work on darker backgrounds or so many situations where you're on a social media site and they have a

131
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.460
dark background and you're forced to use it.

132
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:07.320
This is great to have that option you're not limited you're not stuck in a box with your logo design

133
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.300
also we have invoices I'm just kind of.

134
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:18.780
This is a great way to show kind of how our brand and brand manual can be applied to an actual product.

135
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.640
So I decided to come up with a mock invoice.

136
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.920
Of course we're going to talk about invoicing software later in the class and there's some limitations

137
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.000
with what you can design on some of them.

138
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.390
Some of them like Quick Books is very flexible you can design a really custom invoice and some of them

139
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:38.790
like zip books which is a free invoicing tool they'll allow you to change your header they might allow

140
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.360
you to put a logo but they're not going to allow this kind of custom look.

141
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:46.320
So but I went ahead and kind of put one together just in case.

142
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:53.100
And just to kind of help to practice brand extension and help to kind of show how do I handle type and

143
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.340
text and layout how do I use the texture.

144
00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.100
Are there any kind of things that can apply to other branded assets.

145
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:04.830
So in this case I have this kind of line system here was able to keep contact information was great

146
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:09.720
about developing this is once we develop a few items so we're going to do a social media post and a

147
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.190
business card next.

148
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:17.370
Once you develop a few items you can copy and paste a lot of those to keep the same look and consistency.

149
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:22.710
So when you already develop a first wiki I can copy and paste this little chunk of text and I can easily

150
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:24.460
apply it to a business card.

151
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:29.910
So here's the business card I applied kind of the same information and kind of the same style with the

152
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:30.480
lines.

153
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.660
So we're starting to develop that.

154
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:39.620
You can't develop your entire branded campaign without having to do real projects.

155
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.990
So sometimes you have to go back and revisit your brand.

156
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.630
And that's OK.

157
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:47.820
That's a very normal part of the branding process is going back maybe adding a new logo and new style

158
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.650
maybe tweaking something is when you start to apply it to other assets that maybe didn't work.

159
00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:55.620
And so it's a back and forth creation process.

160
00:11:55.710 --> 00:12:01.140
And don't be afraid if you kind of messed up and said oh my logo design is not working well there you

161
00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.560
can find a way to adapt it or have a different version that works on it.

162
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:05.820
All part of the process.
