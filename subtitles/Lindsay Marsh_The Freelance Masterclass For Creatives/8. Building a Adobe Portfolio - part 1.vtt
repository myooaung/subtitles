00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.670
I'm on Adobe's Adobe Portfolio and this is free for use for anybody who has Adobe Creative Cloud subscription.

2
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.440
So if you pay your monthly subscription for the adobe cloud you automatically have a place where you

3
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.480
can host a Web site.

4
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.070
You can even purchase a domain name from GoDaddy and bring it into Adobe Portfolio so you can have a

5
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.220
professional U.R.L. or Web site name.

6
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.140
So I've used this for a couple of years I've been pretty impressed with how easy it was to build a portfolio.

7
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.890
This is built for portfolios in mind.

8
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.020
So all of these templates benefit a portfolio driven Web site not necessarily magazines or blogs it

9
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.410
really really benefits showing off photos and work and videos as well.

10
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.800
So they've since added a lot of extra templates.

11
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.930
I'm going to go through each and every one but going to go through the basics of creating a basic Web

12
00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.460
site here and we're going to do that right now so we're gonna create a new site already have my portfolio

13
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.170
loaded there we're going to go ahead and create a new site.

14
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.790
So I'm going to go ahead and click on the gallery of work because we really want to show off all of

15
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.230
our stuff.

16
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.280
And this is where it's great to sketch out your layout have a layout plan look at that downloadable

17
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.590
resource to get some ideas of some basic layouts even if you just take a pen and paper and sketch out

18
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.070
what you think is your desired portfolio layout.

19
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.760
Do that ahead of time so when you're finding templates for wordpress or themes for wordpress or you're

20
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.710
using Adobe Portfolio or you're using square space you kind of know which template out of the box is

21
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.430
going to match what kind of layout you desired the quickest.

22
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.110
So we're gonna go ahead and do gallery of work.

23
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.620
And so there's a lot of great fantastic themes you know I've already kind of thought about what I think

24
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.020
would be the best layout for Lillian and her portfolio and her projects and I'm thinking you know we

25
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.540
have three that we want to feature but on our online Web site we had three we featured on the PDA portfolio

26
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.120
but on the online Web site we can add a few more.

27
00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.790
I think if we stick to six very simple projects a lot of these layouts will show those all above the

28
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.400
fold.

29
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.340
And so if you don't know what Web site basic terminology is above the fold is when you get onto a Web

30
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.410
site that's what you see on the on the screen and you don't have to scroll.

31
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.030
It's right there in front of your face.

32
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.710
It's above the fold which comes back from the days of newspaper where everything that was below where

33
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.870
the newspaper folded or anything that was above it was more important because that's what the user or

34
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.540
the viewer sees first.

35
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.320
So trying to find a portfolio that I think would work with that I think this one down here Thomas might

36
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.440
work really well if I had if I was a writer or if I had something where copywriting or text was really

37
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.810
important then maybe this Marta might be very good because it really puts maybe a client testimonial

38
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.440
or some kind of headline puts Texas at the forefront instead of photography.

39
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.560
And it depends on kind of what you do if you have high resolution images that need to be bigger on screen

40
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.000
when you show them off and using something like this marina template might work out a little bit better

41
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.240
for you we're gonna go with the Thomas layout we can always changes very easily and it will automatically

42
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.260
make the adjustments for us if we change the templates so it's going to automatically load a lot of

43
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.970
my projects from behind Ask.com because big hands and Adobe Portfolio are connected.

44
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.520
So every time you post a project on big hands it can automatically load on your portfolio on Adobe which

45
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.760
is kind of a neat way to connect both both Web sites both types of portfolios.

46
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.760
So I got to kind of remove the ones that I'm not going to include for Lillian and go ahead and add her

47
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.500
projects in and of course you can change the size of these boxes as well.

48
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:42.670
You give them rounded edges padding between each box which can kind of be nice so you can add a little

49
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.720
bit of visual separation between each project and you can also change the amount of columns that you

50
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.080
have.

51
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.810
So I'm going to go ahead and adjust this.

52
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.550
And so this is when kind of layout theory comes in handy when it comes to portfolio building so this

53
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.370
would really overwhelm a user coming in because your profile cover photos for different projects are

54
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.710
going to look pretty different.

55
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.220
And so it's going to seem quite disjointed all these projects slammed together.

56
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.470
So if we reduce the amount that were shown to maybe three per bar we could show our six and have nice

57
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.650
big preview files for them to be able to see so they can click on and see the whole project and all

58
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.900
of its detailed glory.

59
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.550
We're going to stick with just three across.

60
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.030
Just do two rows of three projects each.

61
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.060
And of course with this you can change anything we could switch it to our font choice that we have that

62
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.850
we developed in our branding standards for Lillian we can use those same type faces or those same fonts

63
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.680
throughout so that everything matches

64
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.380
of course we can even use those hex codes that we developed in the branding we did the personal branding

65
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.680
for Lillian in the previous section of the course.

66
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.760
You can add those hex codes that we have in our branding standards to be able to pull those out.

67
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.730
So I'm going to take this as an example.

68
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.020
Take our blue grab our hex code here.

69
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.010
This is where it really comes in handy and is pasted in there.

70
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.230
And now we have her blue in there.

71
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.180
So now we need to add kind of a top header.

72
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.780
We need to add a logo in there.

73
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.100
And this is why when we did the personal branding for her we developed a horizontal version for her

74
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.740
logo.

75
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.490
So it would fit really well on a traditional Web site layout not that the big seal that we developed

76
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.350
for her may work really well on certain things but it's not going to work well all the time in those

77
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.810
traditional portfolio Web site layouts so we're going to add that in right now.

78
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.350
And it depends we're going to need to get that plan going so if you sketched out your plan and you decided

79
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.640
you wanted to do a darker background instead you can have had the logo load that end with white.

80
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.590
So it looks really good on a black background or in my case I think I'm going to stick with a stark

81
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.410
white and try to do a very clean contemporary look with my portfolio.

82
00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.350
I'm going to stick with a just a black ink on white background

83
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:10.240
just making sure everything matches up in terms of all the typography or all the font choices so the

84
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:17.000
links and the of her logo are all the same typeface which has bitten sands and that same type weight.

85
00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:25.800
So they're all bold so each project will need a specific cover and this particular layout.

86
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.190
So we really want to find a photo that really captures each project and so we already did the PDA portfolio

87
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.620
so we already got a lot of our photos gathered together those hero images that we used in the PDA portfolios

88
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.550
for our first page whatever whatever image we use for our first page to introduce that project.

89
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.820
That's probably what you'll end up cropping for your project photos.

90
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.240
This is a perfect square cropping.

91
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.440
If you're a photographer if you have something that needs to be in a different ratio if you're in video

92
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.650
you can always change the ratio of these as well.

93
00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.810
You can also add social media icons very easily.

94
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:06.000
So we're just going to customize up here at the top and just kind of switch these on and add as many

95
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.610
relevant social media channels as possible don't put any social media channel that you haven't built

96
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:12.110
up yet.

97
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:18.770
Make sure it has a really nice at least several projects already posted on their clients very well may

98
00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.530
check this out.

99
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.130
So you need to make sure you have all your social media that you're posting make sure it's final make

100
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.570
sure there's several really great posts already on the on there it doesn't look like an empty social

101
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.720
media page so we have some kind of basic structure here.

102
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.330
Each one of these right we need to find kind of the right cover photo for each one of our projects and

103
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:41.100
need to start loading in all those images when you click on a particular project it goes to a landing

104
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.970
page.

105
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:48.420
And this is kind of what we want to kind of expand on and talk about kind of having a nice title having

106
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.400
a client quote.

107
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:54.150
This is when we did our PDA portfolios we did a lot of work with that already so this will be really

108
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.710
easy to put together because it's going to be very similar you got already going to have your descriptions

109
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:03.930
written for your project and already going to have the types of photos you're going to use as well so

110
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.030
we're going to be rebuilding that.

111
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.600
But in the digital format for each one of these landing pages and this is where it's nice to show the

112
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.760
process as I talked about in prior lessons how you're showing the brainstorming process and your guiding

113
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.110
users kind of through a journey walking them through your project in detail.
