1
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,560
Online portfolios are a little more fun to create.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:18,060
We now have the ability to glued video on our Web sites as well as ad motions animations and interactions.

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,500
So the biggest question I get is where do I build my Web site.

4
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,370
Do I need my own Web site or can I just host my portfolio and a third party Web site like Be hands.

5
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,550
Dot com.

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:33,760
The downside to hosting your portfolio on a third party Web site is you lose control over your portfolio.

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,960
That Web site can close down at any time.

8
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:42,330
Taking your portfolio with it another great benefit of having your own Web site is having a professional

9
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,560
domain name.

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:49,080
You can purchase a domain name on Web sites like GoDaddy dot com for a fairly cheap price depending

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,330
on what you want your domain name to be.

12
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:57,660
I can look up Lilian Hernandez on GoDaddy to find her domain name would be fairly cheap once you purchase

13
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,850
a hosting plan.

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,540
You can link up your domain name with your hosting plan and you're ready to go.

15
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:10,020
Lilian Hernandez dot com are Lilian Hernandez designer dot com sounds a lot better and easier to remember

16
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,740
than be hands.

17
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,530
Dot com slash Lilian Hernandez.

18
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,030
There are a lot of options when it comes to finding a good hosting plan.

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,270
I've used GoDaddy in the past and they've been the cheapest.

20
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,070
They also have the option of automatically installing WordPress for you seeing it started right away

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,510
building your web site using Wordpress.

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,240
Square space is a great alternative.

23
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,040
They provide hosting and a Web site builder that includes some pretty great looking templates.

24
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,590
There's the ability to customize a square space Web site but it's a little bit more limited than a wordpress

25
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,330
template or Web site.

26
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:48,060
If you're looking for a super polished out of the box template Web site or design then square space

27
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,450
is worth checking out.

28
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,930
There's also the option of building your portfolio on Adobe's portfolio building solution called Adobe

29
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,130
Portfolio.

30
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,310
This is free if you're an Adobe Creative Cloud subscriber.

31
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,760
This also includes free hosting and a great Web site builder.

32
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,080
Although do you find it a little limiting when it comes to total customization like you can do with

33
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,840
that WordPress Web site.

34
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:16,380
Speaking of WordPress WordPress offers a combination of ease of use and customization.

35
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,300
I use WordPress myself for over 10 years for my business before switching over to the Adobe Portfolio

36
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,280
option.

37
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,220
I use godaddy as my host for my wordpress Web site and also to purchase my domain name.

38
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,850
This was the cheapest solution as WordPress basic templates are free.

39
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,530
Once you learn Wordpress and understand the basics of how templates work and working with plug ins you

40
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,450
can create just about anything even from basic templates.

41
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,410
There are tons of fantastic premium wordpress themes so these costs money each with their own style

42
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,760
and layout focus.

43
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,970
There are some themes that offer out of the box total customization and do not require any coding knowledge.

44
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,290
One of those themes is called a Veda.

45
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,480
I will be listing in the resource guide several great places to find wordpress themes.

46
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,310
If this is the route you plan to go I'll also list several themes that I've used in the past that I

47
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:12,170
think are not only flexible but would also make great portfolio websites.

48
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,290
I'll be teaching a wordpress course that teaches the basics of getting WordPress set up and learning

49
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:23,720
all the ins and outs like setting up your plug ins your widgets themes and adding and customizing templates.

50
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,860
I'll be teaching this alongside my buddy Jonathan Davis.

51
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:32,050
If you're interested in going into more detail about building out a wordpress Web site I'll briefly

52
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:38,360
touch on the basics but it would take quite a bit of time to go through everything in this course we'll

53
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,700
be focusing on building an Adobe Portfolio Web site and we'll also as I mentioned before be showing

54
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,020
the very basics of building a wordpress Web site and walking through choosing the right template for

55
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:54,730
a freelance business later on we'll be focusing on building our profiles on several freelancer Web sites

56
00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:00,880
and also building a b Hanscom portfolio as we work through the creation of all these different portfolio

57
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,410
types.

58
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,390
It gets only easier and quicker as we already have gathered our descriptions or photos.

59
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,140
We have our layout ideas we have several graphics now it's just a matter of using different Web sites

60
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:17,530
and software to maximize our potential and our presentation before we get started.

61
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,810
Building our online portfolios and profiles.

62
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,850
I wanted to show you another downloadable resource that walks through several layout ideas for online

63
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,920
portfolios which when you decide to go with really depends on what will show off your work the best

64
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,740
and what industry you're in.

65
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,550
There are thousands of layout choices some which are not listed but these will give you a head start

66
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,400
in thinking about your layout for an online portfolio.
