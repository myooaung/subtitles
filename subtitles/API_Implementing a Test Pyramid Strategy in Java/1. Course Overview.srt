00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,295
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,295 --> 00:00:08,031
My name is Catalin Tudose,

3
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:12,535
and welcome to my Implementing a Test Pyramid Strategy in Java course.

4
00:00:12,535 --> 00:00:15,460
I am a Java and web technologies expert at Luxoft Romania,

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,828
and I have more than 20 years of experience in the IT field.

6
00:00:19,828 --> 00:00:25,636
More than 15 of them have been dedicated to Java and the technologies around it.

7
00:00:25,636 --> 00:00:26,376
In this course,

8
00:00:26,376 --> 00:00:29,622
we are going to follow one of the most frequent situations in

9
00:00:29,622 --> 00:00:32,592
the development of contemporary projects.

10
00:00:32,592 --> 00:00:35,725
The focus will be on clearly explaining the concepts of a

11
00:00:35,725 --> 00:00:39,148
particular testing level and to apply them in practice.

12
00:00:39,148 --> 00:00:42,061
You'll be able to replace most of the previous manual

13
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:46,077
testing build strong and safe applications.

14
00:00:46,077 --> 00:00:48,072
The main topics that we are going to approach will

15
00:00:48,072 --> 00:00:51,826
be introducing software testing, unit testing,

16
00:00:51,826 --> 00:00:54,574
our basic components work in isolation,

17
00:00:54,574 --> 00:00:58,654
integration testing units combined as a group,

18
00:00:58,654 --> 00:01:01,577
system testing, looking at the complete software,

19
00:01:01,577 --> 00:01:06,869
and acceptance testing the compliance with the business requirements.

20
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,241
By the end of this course,

21
00:01:08,241 --> 00:01:12,235
you'll know how to develop Java applications that are tested at all

22
00:01:12,235 --> 00:01:16,120
levels from the units up to the acceptance testing.

23
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,446
So making the software ready for delivery to the end user.

24
00:01:20,446 --> 00:01:25,520
You will be prepared for the real-life challenge to know how to develop

25
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,888
reliable applications starting from solid building blocks,

26
00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:32,994
integrating them, working with external systems,

27
00:01:32,994 --> 00:01:36,606
and arriving at the target of software development

28
00:01:36,606 --> 00:01:39,335
satisfying the business needs.

29
00:01:39,335 --> 00:01:40,710
Before beginning the course,

30
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,138
you should be familiar with object-oriented programming

31
00:01:43,138 --> 00:01:48,296
concepts and with the JUnit tool, be proficient in writing Java Core code,

32
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:52,816
and have some basic understanding of the Apache Maven build tool.

33
00:01:52,816 --> 00:01:55,709
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn

34
00:01:55,709 --> 00:02:05,000
implementing a test pyramid strategy in Java, at Pluralsight.
