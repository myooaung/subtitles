1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,535
This section will focus on demonstrating the way to cover from the

2
00:00:04,535 --> 00:00:08,731
requirements analysis to the features breaking them into stories

3
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:13,681
and writing the acceptance criteria.

4
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,609
During the requirements analysis phase,

5
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:18,492
the discussion takes place between the business analyst and

6
00:00:18,492 --> 00:00:21,613
the product owner representing the customer.

7
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:24,389
It is important that both sides have a clear understanding about

8
00:00:24,389 --> 00:00:27,566
what the project will need to deliver and about the business

9
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:30,667
goals that this delivery will satisfy.

10
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:39,263
So the two sides need to express and For our flights operating company,

11
00:00:39,263 --> 00:00:43,162
one business goal that we can formulate is increased sales by

12
00:00:43,162 --> 00:00:46,336
providing higher quality overall flight services.

13
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:49,516
It is a very general goal and can be expressed in

14
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,899
more detail with a few requirements,

15
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,483
provide an interactive application to choose flights,

16
00:00:55,483 --> 00:00:57,838
provide an interactive application to change flights,

17
00:00:57,838 --> 00:01:01,345
provide an interactive application to calculate the optimal

18
00:01:01,345 --> 00:01:06,490
route between source and destination.

19
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,427
To define the requirements, the features generated by their analysis,

20
00:01:10,427 --> 00:01:12,731
need to achieve the customer business goals,

21
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:14,858
or deliver business value.

22
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:18,261
The initial ideas need to be described in more detail.

23
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:22,053
One way to describe the previous requirements would be,

24
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:23,162
as a passenger,

25
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:28,223
I want to know the flights for a given destination within a given period of

26
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:33,336
time so that I can choose the flights that suit my needs or,

27
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:34,139
as a passenger,

28
00:01:34,139 --> 00:01:39,007
I want to be able to change my initial flights to different ones so

29
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:43,959
that I can follow the changes of my schedule.

30
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,500
A feature may be detailed and have to work as it is,

31
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,382
but often you will need to break it up into smaller pieces.

32
00:01:50,382 --> 00:01:53,017
When a feature is broken up in stories,

33
00:01:53,017 --> 00:01:56,601
each story addresses a different facet of the problem.

34
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:57,319
For example,

35
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:00,367
the I can choose the flights that suite my needs feature

36
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:04,027
might be too large to be implemented at once,

37
00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:06,848
so it must be divided.

38
00:02:06,848 --> 00:02:07,112
Additionally,

39
00:02:07,112 --> 00:02:09,895
you might like to get some feedback of the

40
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:14,210
functionality before you build a whole feature.

41
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,697
The previous feature may be broken into smaller stories such as the following,

42
00:02:18,697 --> 00:02:20,545
find the direct flights that suit my needs,

43
00:02:20,545 --> 00:02:26,122
if any, find the alternatives of flights with stopovers that suit my needs,

44
00:02:26,122 --> 00:02:28,451
find the one-way flights that suit my needs,

45
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:34,194
find the there and back flights that suit my needs.

46
00:02:34,194 --> 00:02:38,476
Generally, particular examples are used as acceptance criteria.

47
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:41,241
The acceptance criteria represent what will satisfy

48
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:44,811
stakeholders in order to agree that the application is

49
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:47,055
working the way it is supposed to do.

50
00:02:47,055 --> 00:02:50,830
The definition of acceptance criteria is made using the given,

51
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,788
when, then keywords.

52
00:02:52,788 --> 00:02:56,783
More exactly, even a context when something happens,

53
00:02:56,783 --> 00:02:59,719
then some result is expected.

54
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:03,322
As concrete example, given the flights operated by the company,

55
00:03:03,322 --> 00:03:06,860
when I want to travel from Bucharest to London next Wednesday,

56
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,602
then I should be provided two possible flights,

57
00:03:11,602 --> 00:03:14,174
10:35 and 16:20.

58
00:03:14,174 --> 00:03:25,000
The examples that serve as acceptance criteria may be refined and grow in complexity, but the general idea remains the same.
