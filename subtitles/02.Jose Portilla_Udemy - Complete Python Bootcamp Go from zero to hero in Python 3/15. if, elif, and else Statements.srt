00:00:00,912  -->  00:00:03,353
<v Instructor>Hello everyone, and welcome to the if,</v>
2

2

00:00:03,353  -->  00:00:06,234
elif, and else statements lecture.
3

3

00:00:06,234  -->  00:00:08,303
So this is gonna be our first lecture in the statements
4

4

00:00:08,303  -->  00:00:10,334
portion of this course.
5

5

00:00:10,334  -->  00:00:12,487
So, we're gonna go ahead and hop over
6

6

00:00:12,487  -->  00:00:15,496
to a quick presentation to kind of just explain
7

7

00:00:15,496  -->  00:00:17,691
the basics of an if statement.
8

8

00:00:17,691  -->  00:00:19,310
Here, I have opened the Jupyter Notebook
9

9

00:00:19,310  -->  00:00:22,768
and we're just gonna be going over this quick introduction.
10

10

00:00:22,768  -->  00:00:25,351
Alright, let's go and hop over.
11

11

00:00:26,222  -->  00:00:29,139
Okay, so if, elif, else statements.
12

12

00:00:30,189  -->  00:00:33,549
So if statements in Python allow us to tell computers
13

13

00:00:33,549  -->  00:00:37,452
to perform alternative actions based on a certain
14

14

00:00:37,452  -->  00:00:38,631
set of results.
15

15

00:00:38,631  -->  00:00:41,237
So verbally, we can imagine as if we're telling the computer
16

16

00:00:41,237  -->  00:00:45,694
hey, if this case happens, perform this particular action.
17

17

00:00:45,694  -->  00:00:48,457
So we can then expand on this idea a little further
18

18

00:00:48,457  -->  00:00:51,589
with elif and else statements, which elif kind of
19

19

00:00:51,589  -->  00:00:54,189
you can think of it as else, if
20

20

00:00:54,189  -->  00:00:55,531
so, it's basically telling the computer
21

21

00:00:55,531  -->  00:00:58,604
hey if this case happens, perform some action.
22

22

00:00:58,604  -->  00:01:02,545
If another case happens, then perform some other acton.
23

23

00:01:02,545  -->  00:01:04,535
Else, if none of the above cases happened,
24

24

00:01:04,535  -->  00:01:08,504
perform this action. Et cetera, et cetera.
25

25

00:01:08,504  -->  00:01:10,889
So let's go ahead and hop over the Jupyter Notebooks
26

26

00:01:10,889  -->  00:01:14,389
so we can get a look at the syntax format.
27

27

00:01:15,402  -->  00:01:17,760
So here in the Jupyter Notebook we can see that
28

28

00:01:17,760  -->  00:01:21,215
the syntax for if, elif, else statements
29

29

00:01:21,215  -->  00:01:23,370
looks a little something like this.
30

30

00:01:23,370  -->  00:01:25,537
So you have if space case,
31

31

00:01:27,191  -->  00:01:30,463
so some sort of Boolean check, see something's true
32

32

00:01:30,463  -->  00:01:34,148
or greater than or equals to, et cetera.
33

33

00:01:34,148  -->  00:01:36,670
Then perform a particular action
34

34

00:01:36,670  -->  00:01:38,662
so a certain piece of code.
35

35

00:01:38,662  -->  00:01:42,243
Then elif will be another if case
36

36

00:01:42,243  -->  00:01:44,576
to perform some other action
37

37

00:01:45,819  -->  00:01:48,582
or else, if neither of these cases occurred
38

38

00:01:48,582  -->  00:01:51,106
you can have more than just two elif statements
39

39

00:01:51,106  -->  00:01:52,938
you can have as many as you want.
40

40

00:01:52,938  -->  00:01:55,377
Then finally perform the third action.
41

41

00:01:55,377  -->  00:01:58,792
So, we're gonna go and walk through some quick examples
42

42

00:01:58,792  -->  00:02:00,306
and in this case, we're just gonna
43

43

00:02:00,306  -->  00:02:04,473
be using straight Booleans as the check statements.
44

44

00:02:06,117  -->  00:02:09,207
So let's go ahead and start a very simple example.
45

45

00:02:09,207  -->  00:02:12,207
So I'm gonna say if space true colon
46

46

00:02:16,188  -->  00:02:18,544
and if I click enter, notice how there's an automatic
47

47

00:02:18,544  -->  00:02:22,286
indent done for me, which I can just do a tab.
48

48

00:02:22,286  -->  00:02:25,334
So, start thinking about that white space
49

49

00:02:25,334  -->  00:02:27,778
we'll cover it more when it comes to for loops
50

50

00:02:27,778  -->  00:02:29,163
and things like that
51

51

00:02:29,163  -->  00:02:31,152
but this white space is actually necessary for Python
52

52

00:02:31,152  -->  00:02:33,140
to understand what you're typing.
53

53

00:02:33,140  -->  00:02:36,807
So I'm gonna say if true, print it was true.
54

54

00:02:42,904  -->  00:02:45,459
So it was true, so that makes sense.
55

55

00:02:45,459  -->  00:02:49,209
So what if I say, if false print it was true,
56

56

00:02:52,121  -->  00:02:54,353
nothing happens because it's false,
57

57

00:02:54,353  -->  00:02:57,269
it doesn't let you do anything.
58

58

00:02:57,269  -->  00:03:01,412
That's only gonna happen when the case is true.
59

59

00:03:01,412  -->  00:03:03,725
So now to take this example a little further
60

60

00:03:03,725  -->  00:03:06,486
I'm gonna add some else logic then.
61

61

00:03:06,486  -->  00:03:10,752
Let's go ahead and say X is equal to false.
62

62

00:03:10,752  -->  00:03:13,107
And we're gonna say if X, 'cause remember
63

63

00:03:13,107  -->  00:03:15,708
we're doing some sort of Boolean check here.
64

64

00:03:15,708  -->  00:03:18,291
And we'll say print X was true.
65

65

00:03:22,773  -->  00:03:26,523
Else, so in any other case where X isn't true
66

66

00:03:27,840  -->  00:03:29,673
I'm gonna say print...
67

67

00:03:30,523  -->  00:03:33,106
Let's see, I will print when...
68

68

00:03:35,280  -->  00:03:37,197
X is anything not true.
69

69

00:03:43,455  -->  00:03:44,288
Okay.
70

70

00:03:48,619  -->  00:03:53,012
So right now we have this print statement going.
71

71

00:03:53,012  -->  00:03:56,350
I will print when X is anything not true,
72

72

00:03:56,350  -->  00:03:59,478
so since X is false we had the else print.
73

73

00:03:59,478  -->  00:04:01,512
So let's go ahead and change this to true
74

74

00:04:01,512  -->  00:04:03,875
and see what happens.
75

75

00:04:03,875  -->  00:04:07,792
And you notice X was true was printed out here.
76

76

00:04:08,871  -->  00:04:10,373
Okay, so let's go ahead and break down
77

77

00:04:10,373  -->  00:04:12,244
what's going on right now and I'll go
78

78

00:04:12,244  -->  00:04:14,438
over a little bit more on formatting and syntax.
79

79

00:04:14,438  -->  00:04:18,866
So I set X equal to true and I said if space X,
80

80

00:04:18,866  -->  00:04:22,482
so some sort of Boolean check has to occur on this line.
81

81

00:04:22,482  -->  00:04:26,560
colon, and notice how when I start my next line I indent,
82

82

00:04:26,560  -->  00:04:28,832
so that lets you know that whatever
83

83

00:04:28,832  -->  00:04:32,569
is going on here occurs with that if.
84

84

00:04:32,569  -->  00:04:36,151
So if we hop over back to the syntax here
85

85

00:04:36,151  -->  00:04:38,182
notice that we have our statements,
86

86

00:04:38,182  -->  00:04:41,713
some colon, an indent, and that tells Python
87

87

00:04:41,713  -->  00:04:44,068
perform anything that's indented here
88

88

00:04:44,068  -->  00:04:46,302
underneath that if statement.
89

89

00:04:46,302  -->  00:04:49,510
And then elif goes back and lines up with that if
90

90

00:04:49,510  -->  00:04:51,865
and else also lines up with that if.
91

91

00:04:51,865  -->  00:04:53,774
And then the indented actions perform
92

92

00:04:53,774  -->  00:04:57,517
only when the case above it takes place.
93

93

00:04:57,517  -->  00:05:01,369
Okay, so then we have an else and then it says
94

94

00:05:01,369  -->  00:05:05,152
print and depending on what X is, if it's true or false,
95

95

00:05:05,152  -->  00:05:08,406
we'll get a certain print statement out.
96

96

00:05:08,406  -->  00:05:10,324
Alright, so to get a fuller picture of how
97

97

00:05:10,324  -->  00:05:13,164
far if, elif, and else and take us,
98

98

00:05:13,164  -->  00:05:15,449
we're gonna write out a nested structure.
99

99

00:05:15,449  -->  00:05:18,603
So take careful note of how if, elif,
100

100

00:05:18,603  -->  00:05:21,020
and else line up in the code.
101

101

00:05:22,025  -->  00:05:24,259
And just a quick note, I say ee-lif,
102

102

00:05:24,259  -->  00:05:26,943
some people say el-if, so feel free
103

103

00:05:26,943  -->  00:05:29,467
to say it however you want.
104

104

00:05:29,467  -->  00:05:31,092
So now we're gonna introduce a little bit
105

105

00:05:31,092  -->  00:05:33,759
of comparison syntax for Python.
106

106

00:05:35,977  -->  00:05:39,150
So I'm gonna go ahead and say loc
107

107

00:05:39,150  -->  00:05:41,833
is equal to Bank, so I'm saying
108

108

00:05:41,833  -->  00:05:44,561
loc, that variable, is equal to bank
109

109

00:05:44,561  -->  00:05:47,769
and that's gonna stand for location in my code.
110

110

00:05:47,769  -->  00:05:50,937
So I'm gonna say if loc, which is for location,
111

111

00:05:50,937  -->  00:05:55,417
is equal to, and notice how I'm putting double equals signs.
112

112

00:05:55,417  -->  00:05:59,561
So we went over some comparison methods before earlier
113

113

00:05:59,561  -->  00:06:02,851
and the double equals sign is just to check
114

114

00:06:02,851  -->  00:06:06,099
if loc is equal to something.
115

115

00:06:06,099  -->  00:06:09,182
If you use a single equals sign, that means you're
116

116

00:06:09,182  -->  00:06:11,786
trying to reassign something which won't work in this case.
117

117

00:06:11,786  -->  00:06:15,619
So I'm gonna say if loc is equal to auto shop,
118

118

00:06:16,647  -->  00:06:17,480
print...
119

119

00:06:20,389  -->  00:06:22,472
welcome to the auto shop.
120

120

00:06:27,996  -->  00:06:31,663
And then I'm gonna say elif loc is equal to,
121

121

00:06:33,041  -->  00:06:35,791
let's say the bank, colon indent,
122

122

00:06:38,657  -->  00:06:40,824
print welcome to the bank.
123

123

00:06:45,323  -->  00:06:48,697
And in any other case, which will be my else statement,
124

124

00:06:48,697  -->  00:06:50,246
note how I don't have any Booleans there
125

125

00:06:50,246  -->  00:06:53,092
because I'm saying in any other case that wasn't
126

126

00:06:53,092  -->  00:06:55,759
predefined, I want to just print
127

127

00:06:58,818  -->  00:07:00,985
a question, where are you?
128

128

00:07:02,967  -->  00:07:04,552
And in this case when I ran that cell
129

129

00:07:04,552  -->  00:07:06,791
it said welcome to the bank, so that makes sense
130

130

00:07:06,791  -->  00:07:08,499
because my location was bank.
131

131

00:07:08,499  -->  00:07:11,416
So if I set this equal to auto shop
132

132

00:07:12,959  -->  00:07:14,423
it says welcome to the auto shop.
133

133

00:07:14,423  -->  00:07:17,680
If I set this to something else such as mall,
134

134

00:07:17,680  -->  00:07:22,318
since neither of these if statements get activated as true,
135

135

00:07:22,318  -->  00:07:25,576
the else occurs and asks me where are you.
136

136

00:07:25,576  -->  00:07:27,488
So it's important to note how the nested
137

137

00:07:27,488  -->  00:07:29,974
if statements are each checked until a true
138

138

00:07:29,974  -->  00:07:34,486
Boolean causes the nested code beneath it to run.
139

139

00:07:34,486  -->  00:07:36,761
And you should also note that you can put
140

140

00:07:36,761  -->  00:07:39,238
as many of these elif statements as you wanted
141

141

00:07:39,238  -->  00:07:42,523
so we could also have put in an elif loc
142

142

00:07:42,523  -->  00:07:44,773
double equals sign to mall,
143

143

00:07:46,215  -->  00:07:49,548
and then said print welcome to the mall.
144

144

00:07:54,902  -->  00:07:58,557
Okay, and if we ran that then we say welcome to the mall
145

145

00:07:58,557  -->  00:08:02,900
since right here this occurred as a true Boolean.
146

146

00:08:02,900  -->  00:08:05,583
So let's just create two more simple examples
147

147

00:08:05,583  -->  00:08:08,835
of the if, elif, and else statements.
148

148

00:08:08,835  -->  00:08:12,616
I'm gonna say this person, some variable
149

149

00:08:12,616  -->  00:08:15,116
called person is equal to Sam.
150

150

00:08:17,188  -->  00:08:19,817
And I'm gonna say if person,
151

151

00:08:19,817  -->  00:08:23,067
double equals sign Sam, let's say print
152

152

00:08:28,019  -->  00:08:29,269
Hi Sam, whoops.
153

153

00:08:31,819  -->  00:08:33,652
And then else print...
154

154

00:08:38,236  -->  00:08:40,486
Let's say what's your name?
155

155

00:08:42,216  -->  00:08:44,698
Now notice what happened here, I have to use
156

156

00:08:44,698  -->  00:08:46,612
double quotations since I'm using a single
157

157

00:08:46,612  -->  00:08:48,648
quotation with the 'what's' in order
158

158

00:08:48,648  -->  00:08:50,964
for that string to work properly.
159

159

00:08:50,964  -->  00:08:52,629
Alright, so if you've noticed here
160

160

00:08:52,629  -->  00:08:55,836
have person equals Sam, if person is equal to Sam,
161

161

00:08:55,836  -->  00:08:57,465
hi Sam what's your name.
162

162

00:08:57,465  -->  00:08:59,780
Since person was equal to Sam then this Boolean
163

163

00:08:59,780  -->  00:09:02,092
check right here, person equal to Sam,
164

164

00:09:02,092  -->  00:09:04,731
and I'm gonna go ahead and copy and paste that,
165

165

00:09:04,731  -->  00:09:06,761
so person equals Sam that's gonna return true
166

166

00:09:06,761  -->  00:09:10,823
since that variable is equal to the string Sam.
167

167

00:09:10,823  -->  00:09:13,226
And since this happened to be true then the nest
168

168

00:09:13,226  -->  00:09:15,830
of code beneath it will run.
169

169

00:09:15,830  -->  00:09:18,916
So just a quick note on indentation,
170

170

00:09:18,916  -->  00:09:20,457
it's important to keep a good understanding
171

171

00:09:20,457  -->  00:09:22,045
of how indentation works in Python
172

172

00:09:22,045  -->  00:09:23,507
and it really maintains the structure
173

173

00:09:23,507  -->  00:09:25,258
and order of your code.
174

174

00:09:25,258  -->  00:09:27,737
We're gonna touch in on this topic again
175

175

00:09:27,737  -->  00:09:29,892
as we go through all the different statement
176

176

00:09:29,892  -->  00:09:31,597
types in Python and we're really gonna
177

177

00:09:31,597  -->  00:09:33,391
hone in on it when we start talking about
178

178

00:09:33,391  -->  00:09:36,398
building your own functions and methods.
179

179

00:09:36,398  -->  00:09:40,565
So right now just keep in mind that I'm indenting here
180

180

00:09:41,440  -->  00:09:43,727
whenever you see a colon.
181

181

00:09:43,727  -->  00:09:46,482
So that says based on what happens up here,
182

182

00:09:46,482  -->  00:09:50,399
indent space, right here this code's gonna run.
183

183

00:09:51,267  -->  00:09:54,882
Alright, so just a quick overview of what we went over here.
184

184

00:09:54,882  -->  00:09:58,730
Quick and a brief overview of if, elif, and else statements.
185

185

00:09:58,730  -->  00:09:59,713
So those if statements in Python
186

186

00:09:59,713  -->  00:10:01,300
allow us to tell the computer
187

187

00:10:01,300  -->  00:10:02,482
to form alternative actions based
188

188

00:10:02,482  -->  00:10:04,395
on a certain set of results.
189

189

00:10:04,395  -->  00:10:06,022
This is what the syntax looks like,
190

190

00:10:06,022  -->  00:10:09,435
you have if, a bunch of cases that check for Booleans,
191

191

00:10:09,435  -->  00:10:11,644
once one of those is true,
192

192

00:10:11,644  -->  00:10:13,638
then you perform one of the actions.
193

193

00:10:13,638  -->  00:10:15,793
Then you can have an else statement that says
194

194

00:10:15,793  -->  00:10:17,500
if none of those happen to be true,
195

195

00:10:17,500  -->  00:10:19,816
then perform some final action.
196

196

00:10:19,816  -->  00:10:22,459
Okay, there's a couple more examples here in the Jupyter
197

197

00:10:22,459  -->  00:10:25,102
Notebook you can check out, but other than that
198

198

00:10:25,102  -->  00:10:29,019
we'll go ahead and move on to the next lecture.
