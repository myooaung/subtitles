00:00:02.206  -->  00:00:03.893
Your homework assignment for this lecture
3

3

00:00:03.893  -->  00:00:07.393
is to download a either module or library,
4

4

00:00:08.641  -->  00:00:11.384
and explore GitHub, download one
5

5

00:00:11.384  -->  00:00:12.629
and just play around with.
6

6

00:00:12.629  -->  00:00:13.766
Have fun.
7

7

00:00:13.766  -->  00:00:14.780
So, what you're gonna do
8

8

00:00:14.780  -->  00:00:16.613
is come to GitHub.com.
9

9

00:00:17.557  -->  00:00:20.224
Go enter python into the search.
10

10

00:00:21.785  -->  00:00:23.871
And what I want you to do is
11

11

00:00:23.871  -->  00:00:25.856
then click here on languages.
12

12

00:00:25.856  -->  00:00:27.971
Make sure it's in Python.
13

13

00:00:27.971  -->  00:00:30.304
And then sort by most stars.
14

14

00:00:32.182  -->  00:00:33.393
And now what I want you to do
15

15

00:00:33.393  -->  00:00:35.915
is just check out this second link
16

16

00:00:35.915  -->  00:00:37.998
that says awesome-python.
17

17

00:00:39.142  -->  00:00:41.474
Click it or we can directly go to this
18

18

00:00:41.474  -->  00:00:44.424
just by going to GitHub.com/vinta
19

19

00:00:44.424  -->  00:00:48.991
V-I-N-T-A/awesome-python.
20

20

00:00:48.991  -->  00:00:51.368
And here it's a curated list of frameworks
21

21

00:00:51.368  -->  00:00:53.581
and libraries all on Python.
22

22

00:00:53.581  -->  00:00:54.481
So what I want you to do
23

23

00:00:54.481  -->  00:00:55.776
is just check out this list.
24

24

00:00:55.776  -->  00:00:56.808
See what interests you.
25

25

00:00:56.808  -->  00:00:59.613
So, for example I'm gonna zoom in here.
26

26

00:00:59.613  -->  00:01:01.946
Let's say I am interested in
27

27

00:01:02.988  -->  00:01:04.651
audio in Python.
28

28

00:01:04.651  -->  00:01:05.645
I can click that.
29

29

00:01:05.645  -->  00:01:08.229
It'll take me down and scroll down here into audios.
30

30

00:01:08.229  -->  00:01:10.097
And here are all the amazing libraries
31

31

00:01:10.097  -->  00:01:12.971
that people have written here for Python.
32

32

00:01:12.971  -->  00:01:14.662
So for instance, pyechonest
33

33

00:01:14.662  -->  00:01:17.821
is one of my personal favourite Python libraries.
34

34

00:01:17.821  -->  00:01:19.706
And it's the Echo Nest API.
35

35

00:01:19.706  -->  00:01:21.384
So you can come here.
36

36

00:01:21.384  -->  00:01:23.237
Read about it, play around with it.
37

37

00:01:23.237  -->  00:01:25.299
And it basically
38

38

00:01:25.299  -->  00:01:27.299
let's you, for instance,
39

39

00:01:28.677  -->  00:01:29.677
connect with
40

40

00:01:31.435  -->  00:01:33.638
Excuse me, Echo Nest API,
41

41

00:01:33.638  -->  00:01:36.764
and you can ask for artist IDs,
42

42

00:01:36.764  -->  00:01:38.240
songs
43

43

00:01:38.240  -->  00:01:40.086
different features of the songs etc.
44

44

00:01:40.086  -->  00:01:41.438
Some people put GIFs
45

45

00:01:41.438  -->  00:01:43.460
on their read me page.
46

46

00:01:43.460  -->  00:01:45.395
So, choose whatever interests you.
47

47

00:01:45.395  -->  00:01:46.228
Download it.
48

48

00:01:46.228  -->  00:01:47.141
Play around with it.
49

49

00:01:47.141  -->  00:01:49.295
Remember to use conda instal first.
50

50

00:01:49.295  -->  00:01:52.019
If that doesn't work, then use pip instal.
51

51

00:01:52.019  -->  00:01:52.866
Okay.
52

52

00:01:52.866  -->  00:01:54.714
So, this is just a fun little assignment.
53

53

00:01:54.714  -->  00:01:56.428
Choose what interests you.
54

54

00:01:56.428  -->  00:01:57.644
And, that's it.
55

55

00:01:57.644  -->  00:01:58.805
Okay.
56

56

00:01:58.805  -->  00:01:59.638
Thanks.
57

57

00:01:59.638  -->  00:02:02.086
And I'll see you at the next lecture.
