00:00:01.559  -->  00:00:02.477
<v Instructor>Hello everyone,</v>
2

2

00:00:02.477  -->  00:00:04.273
and welcome to the object oriented programming
3

3

00:00:04.273  -->  00:00:06.005
homework assignment.
4

4

00:00:06.005  -->  00:00:07.434
So in this homework assignment, you're gonna have
5

5

00:00:07.434  -->  00:00:09.599
two basic problems, and you're gonna be filling out
6

6

00:00:09.599  -->  00:00:12.524
some skeleton code that I've written for you.
7

7

00:00:12.524  -->  00:00:15.441
So this first class is called Line,
8

8

00:00:16.476  -->  00:00:19.924
and what it does is it takes in two coordinates.
9

9

00:00:19.924  -->  00:00:23.956
And what you're gonna do is fill in the attributes here,
10

10

00:00:23.956  -->  00:00:27.631
and you're gonna fill in two methods, distance and slope.
11

11

00:00:27.631  -->  00:00:30.068
And what's gonna happen is your coordinates
12

12

00:00:30.068  -->  00:00:31.896
are gonna be tuples.
13

13

00:00:31.896  -->  00:00:34.881
So here I've written coordinate1,
14

14

00:00:34.881  -->  00:00:36.821
which is a tuple .
15

15

00:00:36.821  -->  00:00:39.403
So x is first, and y is second.
16

16

00:00:39.403  -->  00:00:40.976
So you can have xy coordinates.
17

17

00:00:40.976  -->  00:00:45.522
And then coordinate2 is also a tuple , so x and y.
18

18

00:00:45.522  -->  00:00:50.256
And you can create a line using coordinate1 and coordinate2.
19

19

00:00:50.256  -->  00:00:53.502
So remember how we assign attributes to your class
20

20

00:00:53.502  -->  00:00:55.770
using the special method init.
21

21

00:00:55.770  -->  00:00:57.588
So that's what you're gonna fill out.
22

22

00:00:57.588  -->  00:01:01.002
So your example output's gonna look something like this.
23

23

00:01:01.002  -->  00:01:03.174
And I want you to fill in two methods,
24

24

00:01:03.174  -->  00:01:05.231
distance and slope.
25

25

00:01:05.231  -->  00:01:09.181
So I want you to be able to call the distance method
26

26

00:01:09.181  -->  00:01:11.352
on this Line object,
27

27

00:01:11.352  -->  00:01:13.423
and it'll return the distance of that line,
28

28

00:01:13.423  -->  00:01:16.630
and the slope will return the slope of that line.
29

29

00:01:16.630  -->  00:01:19.148
You may have to look up the distance and slope equations
30

30

00:01:19.148  -->  00:01:22.915
on the Google in case you forgot, or are unfamiliar with it.
31

31

00:01:22.915  -->  00:01:24.282
But that's the basics here,
32

32

00:01:24.282  -->  00:01:27.514
and you're gonna fill out the attributes in those methods
33

33

00:01:27.514  -->  00:01:29.619
so it returns the distance and slope,
34

34

00:01:29.619  -->  00:01:34.395
given two coordinates as tuples for this Line class object.
35

35

00:01:34.395  -->  00:01:35.978
That's problem one.
36

36

00:01:37.456  -->  00:01:39.637
Problem two, you're also gonna fill in the class
37

37

00:01:39.637  -->  00:01:41.479
and it's gonna be very similar.
38

38

00:01:41.479  -->  00:01:43.389
You're gonna have a Cylinder class.
39

39

00:01:43.389  -->  00:01:46.312
It's gonna be instantiator initialised
40

40

00:01:46.312  -->  00:01:49.445
with a height and the radius.
41

41

00:01:49.445  -->  00:01:50.756
You're gonna fill that in.
42

42

00:01:50.756  -->  00:01:52.056
So fill out the attributes,
43

43

00:01:52.056  -->  00:01:53.288
and it's gonna have two methods,
44

44

00:01:53.288  -->  00:01:55.288
volume and surface_area.
45

45

00:01:56.325  -->  00:01:59.434
So the volume method will return the volume of the cylinder,
46

46

00:01:59.434  -->  00:02:01.370
and the surface_area will return the surface area
47

47

00:02:01.370  -->  00:02:03.076
of the cylinder.
48

48

00:02:03.076  -->  00:02:07.427
Given a height here of two, and a radius of three.
49

49

00:02:07.427  -->  00:02:08.403
So that's it.
50

50

00:02:08.403  -->  00:02:10.948
You're gonna have to fill in those methods
51

51

00:02:10.948  -->  00:02:13.613
and make sure those volume methods
52

52

00:02:13.613  -->  00:02:15.390
and surface_area methods work,
53

53

00:02:15.390  -->  00:02:18.787
as well as just the attribute assignments in your class.
54

54

00:02:18.787  -->  00:02:21.245
Okay, that's it for the homework assignment.
55

55

00:02:21.245  -->  00:02:23.162
Good luck and good job.
