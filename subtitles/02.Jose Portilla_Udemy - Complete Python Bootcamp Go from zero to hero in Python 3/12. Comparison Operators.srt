00:00:01,059  -->  00:00:02,488
<v ->Hello everyone, and welcome to</v>
2

2

00:00:02,488  -->  00:00:05,238
the comparison operators lecture.
3

3

00:00:06,158  -->  00:00:07,744
In this lecture we'll be learning
4

4

00:00:07,744  -->  00:00:10,342
about comparison operators in Python.
5

5

00:00:10,342  -->  00:00:11,369
So, these operators are gonna allow us
6

6

00:00:11,369  -->  00:00:13,717
to compare variables and output a Boolean value.
7

7

00:00:13,717  -->  00:00:15,797
We've already seen a few of them throughout the course,
8

8

00:00:15,797  -->  00:00:17,679
but now we're really gonna dig deeper.
9

9

00:00:17,679  -->  00:00:19,414
And if you have any sort of background in math
10

10

00:00:19,414  -->  00:00:22,106
these operators should be pretty straight forward.
11

11

00:00:22,106  -->  00:00:24,210
If I look at the Jupyter notebook
12

12

00:00:24,210  -->  00:00:25,949
that corresponds to this lecture,
13

13

00:00:25,949  -->  00:00:28,102
I have a table of comparison operators,
14

14

00:00:28,102  -->  00:00:31,902
and then a couple of examples for most of them.
15

15

00:00:31,902  -->  00:00:35,771
So let's go ahead and zoom in, into this table,
16

16

00:00:35,771  -->  00:00:38,302
and just tackle them one by one.
17

17

00:00:38,302  -->  00:00:42,962
The very first one, operator, is two equal signs in a row.
18

18

00:00:42,962  -->  00:00:47,221
And what that means is if the values of the two operands,
19

19

00:00:47,221  -->  00:00:49,415
whatever the two objects you are comparing,
20

20

00:00:49,415  -->  00:00:52,076
are equal, then the condition is true.
21

21

00:00:52,076  -->  00:00:55,826
So in this case, a equal equal b is not true.
22

22

00:00:56,709  -->  00:00:59,328
But, if a equal equal a was written,
23

23

00:00:59,328  -->  00:01:01,353
then that would be true.
24

24

00:01:01,353  -->  00:01:03,860
So as long as these two objects are the same,
25

25

00:01:03,860  -->  00:01:06,176
then equals equals will output true.
26

26

00:01:06,176  -->  00:01:09,378
If they're not same, it'll output false.
27

27

00:01:09,378  -->  00:01:11,744
Moving along, the opposite of that is
28

28

00:01:11,744  -->  00:01:14,315
exclamation mark equals.
29

29

00:01:14,315  -->  00:01:16,070
So, that means if they're not equal,
30

30

00:01:16,070  -->  00:01:18,103
then the condition becomes true.
31

31

00:01:18,103  -->  00:01:19,564
So this statement basically says
32

32

00:01:19,564  -->  00:01:23,231
a is not equal to b, which will output true.
33

33

00:01:24,108  -->  00:01:26,770
Another way to write this is with
34

34

00:01:26,770  -->  00:01:30,819
a less than and a greater than sign back to back,
35

35

00:01:30,819  -->  00:01:34,273
so that's the same as this operator right here,
36

36

00:01:34,273  -->  00:01:36,969
but in most cases I would encourage you
37

37

00:01:36,969  -->  00:01:38,888
to use exclamation equals mark,
38

38

00:01:38,888  -->  00:01:41,457
that's what most people use.
39

39

00:01:41,457  -->  00:01:44,223
Okay, then as far as greater than
40

40

00:01:44,223  -->  00:01:46,925
or less than or equal to et cetera.
41

41

00:01:46,925  -->  00:01:50,602
So for this symbol right here,
42

42

00:01:50,602  -->  00:01:54,907
this means greater than, so, a greater than b.
43

43

00:01:54,907  -->  00:01:59,348
Similarly you have less than, so a less than b.
44

44

00:01:59,348  -->  00:02:01,083
And depending on which the values,
45

45

00:02:01,083  -->  00:02:03,358
so for instance numerical values,
46

46

00:02:03,358  -->  00:02:05,301
you can see is two greater than one?
47

47

00:02:05,301  -->  00:02:07,495
That will equal true.
48

48

00:02:07,495  -->  00:02:09,352
Is three greater than ten?
49

49

00:02:09,352  -->  00:02:11,323
That will be false, et cetera.
50

50

00:02:11,323  -->  00:02:13,245
And then if you wanna do greater than or equal to
51

51

00:02:13,245  -->  00:02:14,676
or less than or equal to,
52

52

00:02:14,676  -->  00:02:19,096
you just add an equals sign to those symbols.
53

53

00:02:19,096  -->  00:02:22,660
Okay, so let's go ahead and see these guys in action
54

54

00:02:22,660  -->  00:02:25,410
by jumping over to the live code.
55

55

00:02:26,876  -->  00:02:28,950
Alright, so, comparison operators.
56

56

00:02:28,950  -->  00:02:30,301
Let's go ahead and dive in.
57

57

00:02:30,301  -->  00:02:33,655
So, remember we have the equals operator
58

58

00:02:33,655  -->  00:02:36,608
and we can go ahead and play with that.
59

59

00:02:36,608  -->  00:02:39,292
So I'm gonna say two equal equals two, is that true?
60

60

00:02:39,292  -->  00:02:41,242
Yes it is.
61

61

00:02:41,242  -->  00:02:43,680 line:15% 
So one equals equals one, is that true?
62

62

00:02:43,680  -->  00:02:45,475 line:15% 
Yes it is.
63

63

00:02:45,475  -->  00:02:47,387 line:15% 
What about one equals equals zero?
64

64

00:02:47,387  -->  00:02:48,850 line:15% 
Well, that's false.
65

65

00:02:48,850  -->  00:02:52,992 line:15% 
Okay, so now let's go ahead and practise with not equal.
66

66

00:02:52,992  -->  00:02:55,159 line:15% 
So switching to not equal.
67

67

00:02:57,415  -->  00:03:01,589 line:15% 
Remember that was exclamation mark equals.
68

68

00:03:01,589  -->  00:03:03,539 line:15% 
So, is two not equal to one?
69

69

00:03:03,539  -->  00:03:05,176 line:15% 
That's true.
70

70

00:03:05,176  -->  00:03:07,106 line:15% 
Is two not equal to two?
71

71

00:03:07,106  -->  00:03:09,172 line:15% 
That should be false.
72

72

00:03:09,172  -->  00:03:11,644 line:15% 
Remember we have the other way of saying it,
73

73

00:03:11,644  -->  00:03:14,035 line:15% 
which isn't as common but we can still use it,
74

74

00:03:14,035  -->  00:03:16,724 line:15% 
which is the less than and greater than sign
75

75

00:03:16,724  -->  00:03:18,462 line:15% 
put back to back.
76

76

00:03:18,462  -->  00:03:21,125 line:15% 
So, is two not equal to one? That's true.
77

77

00:03:21,125  -->  00:03:22,730 line:15% 
Is two not equal to two?
78

78

00:03:22,730  -->  00:03:25,453 line:15% 
That's true, excuse me, that's false.
79

79

00:03:25,453  -->  00:03:28,203 line:15% 
Two does equal two.
80

80

00:03:29,870  -->  00:03:31,864 line:15% 
Like I mentioned the more common way
81

81

00:03:31,864  -->  00:03:35,094 line:15% 
is with the exclamation mark equals sign.
82

82

00:03:35,094  -->  00:03:39,261 line:15% 
So, moving along, we're gonna now go with greater than.
83

83

00:03:44,105  -->  00:03:48,280 line:15% 
And that's just gonna be two is greater than one.
84

84

00:03:48,280  -->  00:03:50,258 line:15% 
That's true.
85

85

00:03:50,258  -->  00:03:53,287 line:15% 
Is two greater than four? That's false.
86

86

00:03:53,287  -->  00:03:55,969 line:15% 
And similarly, we have less than.
87

87

00:03:55,969  -->  00:03:58,570 line:15% 
So I can say two less than four
88

88

00:03:58,570  -->  00:04:00,403 line:15% 
and two less than one.
89

89

00:04:01,901  -->  00:04:04,534 line:15% 
That's false.
90

90

00:04:04,534  -->  00:04:06,282 line:15% 
And then we have greater than or equal to.
91

91

00:04:06,282  -->  00:04:09,126 line:15% 
So I can say is two greater than or equal to two?
92

92

00:04:09,126  -->  00:04:11,613 line:15% 
Yes, 'cause two is equal to two.
93

93

00:04:11,613  -->  00:04:14,795 line:15% 
Is two greater than or equal to one?
94

94

00:04:14,795  -->  00:04:17,366 line:15% 
That's also true 'cause it's greater than one.
95

95

00:04:17,366  -->  00:04:19,784 line:15% 
And I can also do less than or equal to.
96

96

00:04:19,784  -->  00:04:22,190 line:15% 
So is two less than or equal to two?
97

97

00:04:22,190  -->  00:04:23,023 line:15% 
Yup.
98

98

00:04:23,023  -->  00:04:25,087 line:15% 
Is two less than or equal to ten?
99

99

00:04:25,087  -->  00:04:26,701 line:15% 
Yes, it's less than that.
100

100

00:04:26,701  -->  00:04:28,367
So that all works out.
101

101

00:04:28,367  -->  00:04:30,634
Okay, so, hopefully that should
102

102

00:04:30,634  -->  00:04:33,315
have been pretty straight forward.
103

103

00:04:33,315  -->  00:04:36,656
If you have any sort of math background or basic math,
104

104

00:04:36,656  -->  00:04:39,237
this greater than or less than sort of operations
105

105

00:04:39,237  -->  00:04:41,430
should just pretty much make sense.
106

106

00:04:41,430  -->  00:04:42,804
If you have any trouble with it,
107

107

00:04:42,804  -->  00:04:45,038
you can always go back to this Jupyter notebook
108

108

00:04:45,038  -->  00:04:46,705
and read the table in more detail,
109

109

00:04:46,705  -->  00:04:48,757
in case you need any refreshers
110

110

00:04:48,757  -->  00:04:51,886
on what these comparison operators do.
111

111

00:04:51,886  -->  00:04:55,360
Alright, so, that's it for this lecture
112

112

00:04:55,360  -->  00:04:57,156
and I'll see you at the next lecture.
113

113

00:04:57,156  -->  00:04:59,463
Thank you.
