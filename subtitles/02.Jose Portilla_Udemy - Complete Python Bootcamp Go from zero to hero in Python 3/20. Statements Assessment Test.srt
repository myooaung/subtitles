<v Narrator>Hello everyone, in this lecture we're actually</v>
2

2

00:00:03,626  -->  00:00:06,083
just going to be going over the questions on the
3

3

00:00:06,083  -->  00:00:08,509
Statements Assessment Test to just make sure
4

4

00:00:08,509  -->  00:00:10,034
you understand everything.
5

5

00:00:10,034  -->  00:00:12,145
So let's go ahead and get started.
6

6

00:00:12,145  -->  00:00:15,148
So this first question here, I want you to use this,
7

7

00:00:15,148  -->  00:00:18,209
these three different methods: for, split and if
8

8

00:00:18,209  -->  00:00:20,983
to create a statement that will print out letters
9

9

00:00:20,983  -->  00:00:24,066
that start with S, given this string.
10

10

00:00:25,267  -->  00:00:26,100
Okay.
11

11

00:00:27,391  -->  00:00:30,009
Next up, I want you to use range to print
12

12

00:00:30,009  -->  00:00:33,540
all the even numbers from zero to 10.
13

13

00:00:33,540  -->  00:00:36,422
After that, I want you to use list comprehension
14

14

00:00:36,422  -->  00:00:39,183
to create a list of all numbers between one and 50
15

15

00:00:39,183  -->  00:00:41,516
that are divisible by three.
16

16

00:00:42,619  -->  00:00:45,175
Then, I want you to go through this string below,
17

17

00:00:45,175  -->  00:00:47,804
and if the length of a word is even,
18

18

00:00:47,804  -->  00:00:49,804
go ahead and print even.
19

19

00:00:50,971  -->  00:00:54,273
Then, I want you to write a programme that prints the integers
20

20

00:00:54,273  -->  00:00:58,977
from one to 100, but for multiples of three, I want you to
21

21

00:00:58,977  -->  00:01:01,648
print fizz instead of the number.
22

22

00:01:01,648  -->  00:01:04,777
And for multiples of five, print buzz.
23

23

00:01:04,777  -->  00:01:07,509
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five,
24

24

00:01:07,509  -->  00:01:09,148
print fizzbuzz.
25

25

00:01:09,148  -->  00:01:11,175
Now this is a really common question,
26

26

00:01:11,175  -->  00:01:13,942
and it's one of the first basically screening tests
27

27

00:01:13,942  -->  00:01:16,902
for a lot of interviews just to make sure you actually
28

28

00:01:16,902  -->  00:01:18,665
know syntax of a language.
29

29

00:01:18,665  -->  00:01:22,866
So make sure you really understand that question.
30

30

00:01:22,866  -->  00:01:25,416
After that last question, I just want you to use
31

31

00:01:25,416  -->  00:01:27,899
list comprehension to create a list of the first letters
32

32

00:01:27,899  -->  00:01:31,417
of every word in this string below.
33

33

00:01:31,417  -->  00:01:32,250
Okay.
34

34

00:01:32,250  -->  00:01:33,833
So, it's a pretty short assessment test
35

35

00:01:33,833  -->  00:01:36,558
and the reason for that is we're going to be using
36

36

00:01:36,558  -->  00:01:40,467
a lot of this knowledge as far as statements and assessment
37

37

00:01:40,467  -->  00:01:42,582
or statements go throughout the course,
38

38

00:01:42,582  -->  00:01:45,749
so you're going to be seeing this over and over again.
39

39

00:01:45,749  -->  00:01:48,749
Okay, so best of luck and great job.
