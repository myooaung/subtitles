00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:05.000
- You're working on a new project

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.004
and you want to send the project along to someone else,

3
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:08.008
so that they can try it.

4
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.008
But they don't need the whole Git-Repo.

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:13.009
Now what's a quick way to send them a specific folder

6
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.004
of a specific branch in a zip format?

7
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:19.004
I'll give you a couple of seconds to think about how

8
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:25.002
you would do something like this.

9
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:27.004
All right, so the command for taking care of this

10
00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:29.009
is called git archive

11
00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.009
and there's a few options that you can use.

12
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.004
So for example, you can specify a format

13
00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:36.008
and it's really just zip or tar.

14
00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:40.001
So normally you would just want to include it as a zip file.

15
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:41.006
It's also the default

16
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:46.001
and you can also specify a specific work tree

17
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:47.006
or a specific remote.

18
00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:48.008
So this is actually pretty cool

19
00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:52.005
because you can ask to zip a specific folder

20
00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:56.005
of a remote branch automatically from your local folder.

21
00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:58.006
So let's give this thing a try.

22
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:01.003
So I'm going to say, git archive

23
00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:05.008
and I'm going to issue the minus O option.

24
00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:07.006
With the O option you're just saying,

25
00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:08.009
where do you want to put this file

26
00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.004
and what do you want to call it?

27
00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:13.005
So here, what I usually do is back up a folder

28
00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:14.009
and then give this thing a name.

29
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.002
So I'll call it parallax.

30
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:20.001
And I know I want to use a zip file.

31
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.005
Now here, if you just do this

32
00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:24.001
it's going to take the content

33
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:28.006
of the entire project and put it in this file

34
00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:32.005
but you can also specify a specific branch.

35
00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:35.001
So we can say, I want to get this

36
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:38.003
from the 02_02b branch,

37
00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:39.001
if you want

38
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:42.003
if you have that branch on your project right now,

39
00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:44.006
and then if you want to,

40
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:48.004
you can also just specify that it only copy

41
00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:51.004
a specific folder in that specific branch.

42
00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:53.003
And that's super powerful.

43
00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:56.000
So to do that, you just specify two dashes.

44
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.008
And then the name of the folder

45
00:01:57.008 --> 00:01:59.006
notice that we have the build folder

46
00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:02.001
which is how my project is built out.

47
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:04.000
That way people are not getting all this other

48
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.005
configuration stuff that I have outside my build folder

49
00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:11.003
but I can send somebody the content of whatever is in here

50
00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:13.004
which is usually the website

51
00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:16.007
that they might be able to open just in a browser.

52
00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:18.007
All right, so let's go ahead and execute that command

53
00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:20.002
and you can see that it just does it

54
00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:22.001
it doesn't give you a lot of feedback.

55
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:24.009
Right, so let's take a look at our desktop

56
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.006
and you can see that the file is sitting right there.

57
00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:30.006
If I double click on it and open it up

58
00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:34.000
you'll see that it's just the contents of the build folder.

59
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.009
And as a matter of fact

60
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.004
it's just the contents of the build folder

61
00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:40.005
at a specific branch compressed in a zip format.

62
00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:43.006
Super easy to email that to somebody.

63
00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:46.006
And you can even do this with remote files

64
00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:49.005
just super powerful, because you don't even have to download

65
00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:52.004
or clone the repo or fork the repo, or do any of that.

66
00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:55.000
You can just send them a copy directly

67
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
from a remote location.
