00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:05.001
- [Instructor] In a multi-user environment

3
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:07.007
with a large history, it's harder to detect

4
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:10.004
when the changes were made by an individual.

5
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:13.001
So how would you look for specific changes

6
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:16.006
that only you made to a specific line of text?

7
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:17.007
I'll give you a couple of seconds

8
00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:20.003
to think about how you do something like this.

9
00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:24.000
(upbeat music)

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.001
All right, that's just perfect for the git blame command.

11
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.007
It's sort of the cousin of the git log command,

12
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:30.008
but it works on individual files

13
00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:32.003
and gives you more information

14
00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:34.008
about who changed what on a specific file.

15
00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:37.001
Let's check out our index.HTML file

16
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:39.009
that's in this build folder, and it's right here,

17
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:42.004
to see what sort of changes have been made

18
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:44.007
to the file by individuals.

19
00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:47.003
So I can just do a git blame

20
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:48.008
and then look for the build folder

21
00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:53.000
and look for this index.HTML file.

22
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.002
Now, if you keep scrolling through this,

23
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:57.004
it's going to show you every single change that was done

24
00:00:57.004 --> 00:00:59.000
and it's also going to show you the ID

25
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.009
of the commit where you changed that file.

26
00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:03.000
That's pretty interesting

27
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
because you can now see which commit

28
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.004
and what person made a change at that specific commit.

29
00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:11.003
If you had a lot of people working on this document,

30
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.000
that can be quite useful.

31
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.002
Let's go ahead and exit by hitting the Q key

32
00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:19.002
and now I'm going to try something slightly different

33
00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:22.003
so I can add a few flags that I find pretty useful.

34
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:25.000
So, if you don't want to see the person who did the commit,

35
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.008
you can just issue a -s option

36
00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:31.003
and now you can just see the commit hash right here

37
00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:33.003
as well as the line number,

38
00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:34.009
so that's a little bit better.

39
00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.006
Now, what if you wanted to take a look

40
00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:39.004
at a specific number of lines?

41
00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:42.000
Let's go ahead and Q again

42
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.002
and we'll do a git blame,

43
00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:52.006
we'll do -s still, but I'm also going to do a -L command

44
00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:54.004
and I can include a couple of numbers here,

45
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:56.005
so I can say, just show me the first three lines

46
00:01:56.005 --> 00:01:59.000
and it'll show me just those three lines,

47
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.006
or I can also say, start at line one

48
00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:05.002
and then add a number of lines with this plus sign

49
00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:08.001
and I can say, just show me the first five lines.

50
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:11.001
That's a quick way to get to a specific line number

51
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:13.000
in your project and take a look

52
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.006
at the commits that were made

53
00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:17.003
and so therefore, you can go in here and take a look

54
00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:21.002
at this hash and copy that and issue maybe a log

55
00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:23.003
on a specific hash to see what happened

56
00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:26.000
to the file at that point.
