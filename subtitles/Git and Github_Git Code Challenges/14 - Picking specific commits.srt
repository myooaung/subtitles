00:00:03,008 --> 00:00:05,008
- [Instructor] Let's say you're working on a branch

3
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:07,007
to update some of the libraries

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,004
that you're using in your project.

5
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:11,001
However, after a bit you realize

6
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:13,005
that it would be fine to bring some of those commits

7
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:15,006
over to the main branch.

8
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:18,001
How do you bring only specific commits

9
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,008
from one branch to another?

10
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:21,001
I'll give you a couple seconds to think

11
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:23,003
about how you would do something like this.

12
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:27,003
(video game music)

13
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:28,004
Now, what I would do here

14
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:31,007
is use a feature called cherry picking.

15
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:34,005
Now, cherry picking allows you to pick specific commits

16
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:37,004
from one branch and move them to a different place.

17
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,000
So if I do a git branch right here,

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,003
you'll notice that I have two different branches,

19
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:43,001
main and updates.

20
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:48,003
And if I go into the updates branch,

21
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:51,004
you'll see that some of the changes that have been made here

22
00:00:51,004 --> 00:00:55,007
are importing a different JavaScript file, different CSS,

23
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:58,006
and there's some other changes to make this dropdown work

24
00:00:58,006 --> 00:01:00,008
'cause that's one of the things that we'll break

25
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:02,004
from bootstrap 4 to 5,

26
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:04,005
which is the library that I'm using here.

27
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:08,008
Now, if I take a look at the log for this branch,

28
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:14,004
so oneline, you'll see that I made three specific commits

29
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:17,005
that I want to bring into the other branch.

30
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:20,006
So I updated the JavaScript and CSS files.

31
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:23,004
Then I modified some of the margin and padding,

32
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:25,002
and then I fixed this dropdown.

33
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,002
And I started making some additional changes,

34
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:29,006
so I'm working on updating the version

35
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:32,000
of another library called GSAP,

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,003
but I realized that I can actually go ahead

37
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:38,006
and bring these other changes into the main branch.

38
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:41,002
So what I'm going to do here is I'll copy these,

39
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:44,001
and then I'm going to just make a new file.

40
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:45,003
And what I want to do

41
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:48,002
is bring in these three commits in order,

42
00:01:48,002 --> 00:01:51,006
so I'm going to delete all these sort of comments

43
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:56,004
and just paste these commits in sequence

44
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:57,005
one right after the other.

45
00:01:57,005 --> 00:01:58,008
So these are the commits,

46
00:01:58,008 --> 00:02:01,005
and I want to make sure that I do them in the order

47
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:03,008
that I want them to come in.

48
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:05,006
So I'm going to copy this,

49
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:07,008
and let's go ahead and come over here.

50
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:09,009
I'll hit Q to get out of here,

51
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:12,007
and I'm going to go back into my main branch.

52
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:16,009
So I'll checkout main, right, back into main.

53
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:19,001
And now let's clear this out.

54
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:23,009
I want to do the git cherry-pick,

55
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,007
and I'm going to paste these three commits

56
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:28,001
that I want to bring in from the other branch.

57
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:29,003
Now, if I just do this,

58
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:33,000
what it's going to do is bring in those three commits

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,005
as three different commits.

60
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:38,000
If I don't want to bring in the commits

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,006
as separate elements,

62
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:42,007
what I can do is just bring in the changes

63
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:44,000
without the commits.

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,007
So by adding this minus n,

65
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:49,009
it's going to let me sort of bring in all the changes,

66
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:52,006
and I can take a look at what's actually different

67
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:55,009
from this particular main branch

68
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,002
and the commits that I've made.

69
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:59,002
So let me just go ahead and do that.

70
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:03,003
And you'll see that my Visual Studio code

71
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:06,007
has given me some indication of what I have modified.

72
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:09,003
If I do a git status right now,

73
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:13,000
you'll see all of the different changes

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,002
from the previous commit that I had on this project.

75
00:03:17,002 --> 00:03:19,008
And they're just the things that you would expect,

76
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:24,002
new index file, a new bootstrap, JavaScript, and CSS

77
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:27,000
as well as there's always a few little modifications

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,005
on the package-lock, that JSON file,

79
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:29,007
so we can ignore that.

80
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:31,008
But those commits are fine.

81
00:03:31,008 --> 00:03:33,005
And I want to test out to make sure

82
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,000
that my dropdown is working.

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,008
Everything looks pretty much like it did before.

84
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:43,002
So now I can go ahead and git add all these files

85
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:46,005
and git commit and go ahead and say

86
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:51,001
just update it to bootstrap 5.

87
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:53,006
I like having the n option there

88
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:55,006
so that you can actually test things out

89
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:56,009
and make sure that you're comfortable

90
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:58,009
with whatever changes were made.

91
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:00,004
I can close out of this.

92
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:04,006
I really love this ability to cherry pick specific commits

93
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:06,000
from all over the place.

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,006
A lot of times people use this

95
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:10,005
when they actually commit something to the wrong branch.

96
00:04:10,005 --> 00:04:13,006
You don't realize that you are in a different branch,

97
00:04:13,006 --> 00:04:16,002
and then you want to just bring something into main

98
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:19,000
that you have done in a separate branch.

99
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,001
This is really useful in a lot of different ways.

100
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:24,006
And there's also, just like with anything else in git,

101
00:04:24,006 --> 00:04:25,008
a lot of options,

102
00:04:25,008 --> 00:04:27,008
so you can check the documentation

103
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:30,000
for some additional features.
