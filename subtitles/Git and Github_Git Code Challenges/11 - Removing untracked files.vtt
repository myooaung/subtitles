00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:05.000
- [Instructor] You can easily use

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.005
git checkout period to rewind a commit to its late state

3
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:11.000
but that doesn't remove to any Ontrack documents.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.002
Now, if you have a project where you've added some folders

5
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:15.005
and our files, how do you get rid of not just

6
00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:23.001
the last few changes, but also Ontrack files.

7
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:26.006
So if I take a look at my git status, you'll notice

8
00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:29.004
that I have certain items that were modified right here.

9
00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:32.002
And then I have a number of Ontrack files.

10
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:38.001
Now, if I issue a get checkout period, it's going to get rid

11
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:43.000
of the stage files and rewind them to their previous state.

12
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.001
Let's clear this out and then do a git status again.

13
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:51.001
And now you can see that, although we got rid

14
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:54.005
of any of the files that it was tracking

15
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:57.000
any Ontrack files are not really going to change

16
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.006
but there's one command you can use

17
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:00.008
to take care of this and it's called git clean.

18
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:05.003
So the way that it works is if you do a git clean command

19
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:08.003
and at a minus N flag

20
00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:11.001
it's going to let you preview, what's going to be deleted.

21
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:12.001
And it's really important

22
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.008
that you learn to use this command

23
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:15.009
'cause you don't want to just delete things

24
00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.008
without knowing what you're doing.

25
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:18.008
So this is going to show you

26
00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:23.002
that it's going to remove the about that HTML file.

27
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:26.002
So if you take a look at my status though

28
00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:29.002
you remember that there's actually another folder

29
00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:30.009
and it's not going to get rid of that folder

30
00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.006
without an additional flag.

31
00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:34.008
And that is the minus D flag.

32
00:01:34.008 --> 00:01:36.001
Let's go ahead and use that one.

33
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:37.003
So git clean

34
00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:39.007
and again, I'm going to use minus N

35
00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:43.003
but I'm also going to use the minus D for directory.

36
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:45.003
Now that's going to show you that it's going to get rid

37
00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:47.002
of both of the on track files

38
00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:50.008
and that's normally the one that you would want to run.

39
00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:53.004
Obviously, if you want this to be applied

40
00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:58.000
you need to get rid of the N and we will use an F instead.

41
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.004
So we'll do a clear here and do a git clean

42
00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:07.008
and then minus D as well as F because we want to git force

43
00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:11.006
or git rid of all of those on track files.

44
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:13.008
So I'm going to hit return and you can see

45
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:17.003
in the preview here that it's gotten rid of all the files.

46
00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:21.007
So let's clear this out, get status, and now you can see

47
00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.009
that everything appears to be up to date.

48
00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.001
It just rewound everything.

49
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:28.003
And with the clean command

50
00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:31.003
we were able to get rid of all the Ontrack files.

51
00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:33.001
Be really careful when you use this

52
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:34.006
because it is dangerous.

53
00:02:34.006 --> 00:02:36.009
Just go ahead and delete things

54
00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.006
but at least with the minus and flag

55
00:02:39.006 --> 00:02:44.000
you can take a look and preview what is going to be deleted.
