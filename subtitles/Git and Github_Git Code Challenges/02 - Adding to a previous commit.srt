- [Instructor] Sometimes you do a commit,

6
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:06,007
but you immediately realize

7
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:09,001
that you need to change one more thing.

8
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,009
Instead of doing a new commit with a different message,

9
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:15,002
how do you add something to a previous commit?

10
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:16,007
I'll give you a couple of seconds to think

11
00:00:16,007 --> 00:00:18,006
about how you would do something like that.

12
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:21,001

13
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:21,009

14
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:22,007
(videogame whirling)

15
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:23,008
Now, again, this one's pretty easy,

16
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:26,003
and it's called amending your commit.

17
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:30,002
I'm updating the version of this project to Bootstrap.

18
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:33,004
So I'm going to start by going to the package.json file

19
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:37,005
and bumping up my version to 2.0.0.

20
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:42,004
So I'll save this, and I'm going to call this.

21
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:46,001
So I'm going to add this, and I'm going to commit this

22
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:55,003
with a message of "Bumping up Bootstrap Version."

23
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:58,009
Now, what I need to do next would be add

24
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:01,001
the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript.

25
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:03,007
Already downloaded them from the Bootstrap site.

26
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:06,005
So I'm going to come in here, and let's look

27
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:08,007
at what's in the css folder.

28
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:13,009
Add the bootstrap min and the bootstrap css map.

29
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:15,003
So let's go ahead and add those.

30
00:01:15,003 --> 00:01:17,009
Here is all the bootstrap CSS files.

31
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:26,003
There's quite a bit of them. So we'll add the Bootstrap.

32
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,004
So we'll add the bootstrap min.css

33
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:32,003
as well as the bootstrap min.css.map

34
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:33,003
that I already have in here.

35
00:01:33,003 --> 00:01:35,000
These are the older versions.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,006
So I'll just replace them in here,

37
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:43,004
and then I'll do a git status.

38
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:45,004
I'll see that there's two files to add.

39
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:49,007
So I'll go ahead and add those.

40
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:53,002
Now, I can't commit this, but if I want to just add them

41
00:01:53,002 --> 00:01:55,007
to the previous commit, then I can issue.

42
00:01:55,007 --> 00:01:57,002
Let's go ahead and clear this.

43
00:01:57,002 --> 00:02:02,003
I can issue a git commit with the amend option.

44
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:03,009
Now, for some reason, I'll always want

45
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:05,008
to type two Ms for amend, and sometimes

46
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:07,006
I forget about the two dashes.

47
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:09,001
So just be careful there.

48
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:12,003
Now, if I do this, it will open up a text editor

49
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:14,007
and allow me to add a message.

50
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:16,004
If I want to change the message

51
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:19,001
I can rename this message something other

52
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:20,007
than what I've already typed.

53
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:24,009
So I could say something like

54
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:34,000
"Added New Version of Bootstrap" here.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,005
Now, if I clear this out, and I do a git log,

56
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:41,003
you'll notice that my last commit is now added

57
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:43,002
a new version of Bootstrap.

58
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:45,005
If you would've done this git log command earlier,

59
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:47,005
you would've noticed that this hash is

60
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:49,008
different than it was before.

61
00:02:49,008 --> 00:02:52,001
Now, I know that I also need

62
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:54,001
to update the JavaScript version,

63
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:55,005
and I forgot to do that.

64
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:58,001
So I'm going to open up this JavaScript folder, lib,

65
00:02:58,001 --> 00:02:59,008
and then there are files in here

66
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:02,006
that I need to update, this bootstrap bundle

67
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:04,009
and the bootstrap bundle min js map.

68
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:07,004
So let's go ahead and do that.

69
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:08,006
Come over here. It's editor.

70
00:03:08,006 --> 00:03:10,002
So it should be here.

71
00:03:10,002 --> 00:03:11,004
Let's come over here,

72
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:14,006
and we'll open up the JavaScript folder,

73
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:18,002
and we need to do the bootstrap bundle min.js

74
00:03:18,002 --> 00:03:20,002
as well as the map.

75
00:03:20,002 --> 00:03:22,002
We'll copy them here,

76
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,009
and we'll just hit Replace a couple times

77
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:29,006
and again, if I do a git status,

78
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:31,004
it's going to show me those two new files.

79
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:34,005
I'll add them and in this case,

80
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:39,006
I'm going to do a git commit, amend,

81
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:44,006
and I can include a no-edit option because the message

82
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:47,003
that I had written previously is just fine.

83
00:03:47,003 --> 00:03:49,006
Now it updated the files,

84
00:03:49,006 --> 00:03:52,009
and I was able to add something to my previous commit,

85
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:55,007
and this only works with your previous commit.

86
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:59,003
So if I do a clear, and I show the Git log,

87
00:03:59,003 --> 00:04:02,002
you'll see that even though I added

88
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:05,004
a new set of files, it rewrote this commit.

89
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:08,001
Again, notice that it is a different hash

90
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:10,001
than it was just a minute ago,

91
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:13,005
and it included the previous message

92
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:16,003
since I added the no-edit option.

93
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:18,001
So this is quite a handy command when you need

94
00:04:18,001 --> 00:04:20,006
to just add something else to the previous commit.

95
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:22,007
Now, this isn't really safe for commits

96
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:24,004
that have already been pushed.

97
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:27,002
That's because someone may have already cloned

98
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:30,001
an old commit with the previous messages.

99
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:32,003
So that would get a little bit confusing,

100
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:34,004
but if you're just working on your local directory,

101
00:04:34,004 --> 00:04:36,000
this is one that I use all the time.
