- [Instructor] Every once in a while, a tool comes along

3
00:00:08,003 --> 00:00:09,008
that changes things.

4
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:13,001
Git revolutionized the way we work on code for the better.

5
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:16,008
it allows for fully-distributed, simple but fast tooling

6
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:19,009
that is able to handle extremely large projects.

7
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:22,003
In this course, we'll start out with some basic challenges

8
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:24,000
to test your knowledge of Git

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,001
and progress to more and more of what makes it special.

10
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:29,006
Most solutions are really just a few commands,

11
00:00:29,006 --> 00:00:32,000
and most videos can be watched on their own

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,005
and don't require to have completed the previous challenges.

00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:39,000
If you're ready to test your skills, then let's get started.
