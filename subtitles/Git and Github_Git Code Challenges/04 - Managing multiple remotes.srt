2
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:05,009
- Sometimes it's good to be able to send your work

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,007
to more than one location,

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,005
but how do you manage to send changes

5
00:00:09,005 --> 00:00:11,005
to more than one repos?

6
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:12,004
I'll give you a couple

7
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:16,000
of seconds to think about how you'd something like this.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
(electronic music)

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,009
Now the answer is understanding remotes.

10
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:24,002
You're probably used to adding your remote

11
00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:26,004
when you first open a project,

12
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:28,005
by issuing a git remote

13
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:32,007
and then add, then plus a name that's usually origin,

14
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:34,000
whenever you get started,

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,003
and then you use a URL right here.

16
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,008
Now there's a number of other commands

17
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:41,000
that you can use in addition to this.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,009
So you can change of course

19
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:43,008
the name to something like "working"

20
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,008
if you're working with a specific project,

21
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:48,006
and then add another remote.

22
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:52,001
You can just push to more than one place if you want to.

23
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:55,005
Now, you can also remove an existing origin

24
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:58,007
and also do things like "get-url"

25
00:00:58,007 --> 00:00:59,006
and also for example,

26
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:03,003
get or change the URL of a specific remote.

27
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:04,009
So let's do a get-url

28
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:08,001
and I know that I already have the origin set right here,

29
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,005
and this is the link to the current origin.

30
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:12,004
So if I want to,

31
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:17,001
I can go to github and type in something like github.new

32
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:18,007
to create a new remote

33
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:23,007
and I'm going to call this one parallax_working

34
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:25,008
and this will let me create a working project

35
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:28,005
for this parallax repos.

36
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,006
So I'll hit Create Repository

37
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,003
and notice that here, it's going to tell me

38
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:35,004
the usual sort of how I would add the project.

39
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:38,000
So normally I would say "git remote add"

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,008
and then I would put the name "origin"

41
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:44,007
and type in the URL of this project.

42
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:47,008
So now if we go back here and we say,

43
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:50,003
"git remote add"

44
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:52,002
and I'm going to call this "working"

45
00:01:52,002 --> 00:01:54,000
and then I'll paste that URL,

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,003
and now I have a new remote that I can push things to.

47
00:01:57,003 --> 00:01:59,004
So now I can say "git push"

48
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:04,002
and instead of origin, I can say "working"

49
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:07,005
and now this is all being pushed to my working remote.

50
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:09,001
You can add as many remotes as you want,

51
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:10,002
and this is useful

52
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:12,004
for when you want to work in different places.

53
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:15,002
So for example, you can have the remote that you use

54
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:17,002
for a different purpose,

55
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:19,007
and I don't like to keep things on my local directory,

56
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:24,006
it's safer to create a local remote on GitHub

57
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:27,000
that I can push to and I can feel safe,

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,005
and then whenever I feel that the project has been tested,

59
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:35,001
then I can push it to my sort of final URL or final remote.

60
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:38,003
Usually I use the origin name for that

61
00:02:38,003 --> 00:02:42,000
and it can be a much safer way to work.
