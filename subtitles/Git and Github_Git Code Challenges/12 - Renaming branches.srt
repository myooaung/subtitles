2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,001
- [Instructor] In the old days, it was common

3
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:08,002
to name the main branch master and today it's common

4
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:09,004
to call it main.

5
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:11,005
Now, how do you change an older project to

6
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:13,005
use a different name and also set

7
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:16,008
up your environment to use main as the default?

8
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:18,001
I'll give you a couple seconds to think

9
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:21,000
about how you would do something like this.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,004
(game music)

11
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:25,006
The first part is pretty easy.

12
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:27,009
All you have to do is go to your reboot

13
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:30,001
and rename the default branch.

14
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:31,005
So you can see right here

15
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:35,001
that my default branch right now is named master.

16
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,004
So I could just hit this edit button right here

17
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:40,004
and just change the name of this to main.

18
00:00:40,004 --> 00:00:43,000
However, notice that it does say that rename in

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,007
this branch will not update your members' local environment.

20
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:48,004
So you do need to let people know that you are

21
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:52,003
renaming the project's branch from master to main.

22
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:54,001
So if I refresh this page, you'll see

23
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:58,007
that now it's called main, all is good in the project repo.

24
00:00:58,007 --> 00:01:01,004
However, I need to take care of things locally.

25
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:03,000
So let's go ahead and close this out.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,007
Here's my project locally notice the branch right now

27
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:07,002
is called master.

28
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:10,004
Now to change the name of a branch is actually pretty easy.

29
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:16,000
Use a git, and then branch, then you say MV for move.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And this is sort of weird to me.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,005
And actually this needs to be a flag.

32
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:24,007
So minus MV, and then you just give it the name

33
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:26,001
that it used to be called.

34
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:28,001
So we're going to change master

35
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:30,007
and then we're going to take that to main.

36
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:34,006
So if I hit return, notice that the branch is renamed

37
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:35,009
to main.

38
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,003
Now that doesn't solve the problem of what happens

39
00:01:38,003 --> 00:01:41,004
if I did a git init in a new project.

40
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:46,003
Whatever I have set up as my default for the configuration

41
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:52,001
of git is what name would be assigned to a new repository.

42
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:53,006
So let's go ahead and clear this out.

43
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:56,002
To change that, I can change the global configuration

44
00:01:56,002 --> 00:01:57,008
right from the terminal.

45
00:01:57,008 --> 00:02:03,003
I can issue a git config and then do a global command here.

46
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:06,003
So this will mean for any project that you create

47
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:10,005
in this machine, I'm going to change in it

48
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:15,006
default branch and change that to main.

49
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:17,003
And that's all you need to do from now on.

50
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:20,008
Anytime you do a git init on a folder, it's going to assume

51
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:24,006
that you want to use main as the name of your branch.

52
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:27,008
And since you already did it at the project level,

53
00:02:27,008 --> 00:02:31,000
now everything will be in sync.
