2
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:04.007
- [Instructor] Let's say you want

3
00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:06.005
to clone an existing repository

4
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:09.001
but you don't need all the history of commits.

5
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:12.002
Now, perhaps it's an older project with a rich history.

6
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:15.007
How do you clone a repository with a limited history?

7
00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:17.001
I'll give you a couple of seconds to think

8
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.002
about how you would do something like this.

9
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:22.007
(upbeat music)

10
00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:24.004
The solution is called a shallow clone

11
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:26.005
and the command is pretty easy.

12
00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:29.006
I'm going to go right here on GitHub to this code section

13
00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:33.008
and copy the URL and copy the URL for the repo.

14
00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:35.006
Now, I'm going to go to my terminal

15
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:37.006
and I'll type in a git clone

16
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:39.004
but in addition to a normal clone,

17
00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:43.008
I'm going to add the depth flag and then add a number.

18
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.001
Now this number has to be at least one,

19
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:48.004
but it can include up to the number

20
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:50.007
of commits you want to include.

21
00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:55.002
Finally, you add the URL of the repo.

22
00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:58.000
Now you can see that it downloaded the repo.

23
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Let's go ahead and clear this out and we'll do a cd,

24
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.001
you can see that the file is right here on the desktop now,

25
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:11.000
and I'm going to switch to that folder

26
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and issue a git log.

27
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.007
You'll see that there is only one commit.

28
00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:18.005
It's the last commit that Steven did.

29
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:20.004
This allows you to create a repo with a history

30
00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:23.006
that will download and operate a lot faster.

31
00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:26.005
We can use this URL on this course to copy a repo

32
00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:30.003
for use for the rest of what we're doing here,

33
00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:33.000
although you can also do this with any repo.
