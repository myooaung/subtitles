00:05.260 --> 00:12.070
Allowing the user to log in by simply clicking on a link like this isn't really worth doing as anyone

00:12.070 --> 00:13.290
could do it.

00:13.630 --> 00:20.320
When a user logs in we need to get some credentials from them which usually consists of a username and

00:20.320 --> 00:21.530
password.

00:24.340 --> 00:33.460
So here in our logging script let's remove this code for now and add a log in from We'll start with

00:33.460 --> 00:41.690
our standard 8 2 email header and footer and then add a title next.

00:41.770 --> 00:49.930
We need a form which will process in the same script so we don't need an action attribute.

00:49.930 --> 00:59.350
Then we need the label and input for the user name which is a simple text input and also a label and

00:59.350 --> 01:06.130
input for the password which is a password type input.

01:07.120 --> 01:11.650
Finally let's add a button to submit the farm

01:14.680 --> 01:15.370
in the browser.

01:15.370 --> 01:22.190
Here's the farm and we can enter a username and password and submit the farm.

01:22.910 --> 01:29.770
However the username and password I typed in have appeared in the address bar of the browser revealing

01:29.800 --> 01:31.870
the password.

01:31.870 --> 01:38.050
In addition to being visible here this u are l will be saved in the browser's history which anyone with

01:38.110 --> 01:40.620
access to this computer could see.

01:40.660 --> 01:42.780
Not what we want.

01:45.270 --> 01:49.100
This is because we haven't specified the post method in the farm.

01:49.260 --> 01:52.070
It's using the get method by default.

01:52.470 --> 01:57.330
So let's add to that like that.

01:57.330 --> 02:07.020
So when the farm is submitted we can detect this as before and we can check the user's credentials from

02:07.020 --> 02:10.790
the value submitted on the farm.

02:10.830 --> 02:17.730
For now let's just check that they match a hard coded username and password.

02:19.210 --> 02:28.120
And if they do we'll print out one message and stop the script otherwise we'll print out a different

02:28.120 --> 02:29.380
message.

02:33.440 --> 02:41.600
So now if I enter the correct credentials and then submit the farm we get one message and note that

02:41.600 --> 02:45.740
we no longer see the user name and password in the address bar.

02:47.870 --> 02:55.010
If I enter incorrect credentials and we submit the farm we get the other message.

02:57.680 --> 03:06.460
So if we log in correctly we want to set the value in the session as we did before and after that Let's

03:06.470 --> 03:10.240
redirect back to the index page.

03:10.310 --> 03:14.310
We can do this using the redirect function we created earlier.

03:14.720 --> 03:17.080
And don't forget so we can use this.

03:17.180 --> 03:20.920
We need to include the file where that redirect function is.

03:21.080 --> 03:24.860
So will do this here at the top.

03:25.700 --> 03:30.320
If the log in is incorrect Lets put this error message in a variable

03:33.020 --> 03:35.940
and then in the 8 Tim and below.

03:36.890 --> 03:44.590
If this variable isn't empty will print the message out like that.

03:47.780 --> 03:56.750
So now if I try and log in and I enter incorrect credentials we get there a message.

03:57.740 --> 04:06.470
If I enter correct credentials and submit the farm were redirected to the index page and the message

04:06.470 --> 04:07.900
says were logged in.

04:08.150 --> 04:13.300
So the value has been correctly set in the session and we've been logged in successfully.
