If you have a database table with a large number of records and you want to display these records on

00:11.940 --> 00:20.550
a web page selecting all of them at once could take a long time use a lot of server resources and the

00:20.550 --> 00:24.160
resulting page would be very long.

00:25.170 --> 00:32.580
So instead of selecting all the records it's better to select them in small consecutive groups.

00:32.580 --> 00:35.080
This is known as pagination.

00:37.400 --> 00:47.490
By default an Eskew L. select statement selects are all matching records using the offset class.

00:47.500 --> 00:54.910
You can tell the select statement to skip a specified number of rows before it starts to return data.

00:57.450 --> 01:02.870
You can use the limit class to limit the number of roles that I returned.

01:03.450 --> 01:10.440
So by using these together you can return results one page at a time.

01:12.430 --> 01:18.430
It's very important to ardagh the results using an ardour by clase when you're doing this because if

01:18.430 --> 01:25.360
you don't specify an ardour the ardour of the results isn't guaranteed and of course if you are using

01:25.360 --> 01:30.810
an order by clase it's important to have an index on the column you are doing by.

01:34.280 --> 01:36.620
Let's look at an example here.

01:36.710 --> 01:39.970
In the articles table I've added some more records.

01:40.100 --> 01:43.200
So now there are 18 records in this table.

01:46.260 --> 01:53.740
If I execute this ESC Eskew L statement all the records in the table will be selected.

01:54.090 --> 01:58.630
First let's limit the number of results by adding the limit class.

02:01.620 --> 02:08.490
This returns the number of results specified 3 starting from the first rijkaard.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.200
If I add an offset class.

02:15.160 --> 02:19.520
Then that number of Ricardos is skipped before the results have returned

02:22.930 --> 02:26.810
so we can get pages of results by changing the offset.

02:32.290 --> 02:37.200
And let's not forget to ardagh the results.

02:37.200 --> 02:41.680
Otherwise the ardour of the resultset isn't guaranteed.

02:46.200 --> 02:53.550
There's also an alternative syntax that you can use passing two values to the limit class the first

02:53.550 --> 02:57.920
being the offset and the second the limit.

02:58.050 --> 03:04.130
However this isn't any faster and I think the other syntax is much clearer.
