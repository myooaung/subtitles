If you have a farm with lots of inputs it could be quite daunting for the user.

00:11.960 --> 00:19.880
We can use the fieldset element to group together related farm controls fieldset SAT optional but useful

00:19.880 --> 00:26.790
for aag and icing farms into sections making a complex farm much easier for the end user.

00:29.310 --> 00:35.330
Let's add a field set around the first two inputs on this farm like that.

00:38.730 --> 00:45.480
In the browser it looks like this by default a box is placed around the controls.

00:47.810 --> 00:54.560
Within a fieldset element we can add a legend element to give that fieldset a title

00:57.320 --> 00:58.210
in the browser.

00:58.220 --> 01:02.680
By default this title is shown up here in the border.

01:03.110 --> 01:09.290
Adding a legend like this is also better for accessibility as greenery the software will read out the

01:09.290 --> 01:12.430
legend before each label.

01:16.440 --> 01:25.740
Let's add a fieldset and legend around this checkbox and also a fieldset around these radio buttons

01:27.840 --> 01:29.970
for the legend of these radio buttons.

01:29.970 --> 01:36.200
We can replace this paragraph element with the legend.

01:39.410 --> 01:47.030
Now in the browser we have our farm divided into sections so it's much easier to use.

01:50.190 --> 01:56.940
In addition to labels and field sets there are lot of things we can do to make our farms easier to use.

01:56.970 --> 02:05.300
The place holder attribute provides a shot hint to what the expected value of a field is.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.310
Let's also add one to the text area

02:11.040 --> 02:12.750
like that.

02:15.580 --> 02:19.530
In the browser This text is shown inside the controls.

02:19.750 --> 02:25.810
But as soon as you enter a value the text disappears.

02:25.810 --> 02:33.180
If you don't enter anything this field is still submitted as an empty value.

02:33.490 --> 02:40.870
The place holder text isn't sent with the form data the place holder attribute is valid for text like

02:40.900 --> 02:44.500
inputs like text email tell and so on.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.900
Along with textarea elements.
