00:04.450 --> 00:09.410
The only page we have left to convert to pdl is the new article page.

00:09.520 --> 00:16.270
If I open the page without changing anything we see the farm but each field contains an error saying

00:16.270 --> 00:20.460
the article variable doesn't exist.

00:22.860 --> 00:28.920
That's because here in the form which we share with the edit page we're now using an article object's

00:28.920 --> 00:33.520
properties instead of simple variables.

00:33.750 --> 00:46.860
So in our new article script let's remove these variables and create a new article object instead to

00:46.860 --> 00:52.270
create a new article we need the article class so that's require It's up here.

00:53.540 --> 00:55.010
Replacing the article.

00:55.010 --> 00:57.750
Include which we no longer need.

00:58.010 --> 01:03.970
While we're here let's replace the database include with the class as well.

01:07.980 --> 01:14.640
And in the browser the errors have gone and the empty farm works again.

01:15.360 --> 01:21.780
Next if the form is submitted were getting the values from the farm and then inserting in you rijkaard

01:23.430 --> 01:30.080
were doing something similar in the edit script only using an object method instead.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.830
So start by copying this.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.820
And replacing this code.

01:49.580 --> 01:52.450
Like that.

01:52.460 --> 01:55.320
Then instead of calling the update method.

01:55.670 --> 01:58.640
Let's change this to a method which is right in a moment.

01:58.640 --> 02:08.060
Let's call it create and then in our article class we can add this new method.

02:10.520 --> 02:15.310
We're going to be doing something similar to the Update method.

02:16.730 --> 02:19.470
So start by copying that.

02:25.190 --> 02:26.900
And pasting it at the end

02:31.070 --> 02:35.150
like that will change the name to create.

02:36.170 --> 02:47.320
Then will change the ESC u l to insert instead of update using named place holders as before.

02:47.420 --> 02:54.930
We don't need to bind the idees value as this is a new rijkaard so we can delete this line.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.500
Finally let's change the comment.

02:59.840 --> 03:00.990
Like that.

03:03.860 --> 03:09.620
Now you might be thinking that we've repeated ourselves a bit here by having this method and the update

03:09.620 --> 03:11.160
method we based it on.

03:11.480 --> 03:19.610
And you could if you wanted to have one method for example cold save that would insert are updater rijkaard

03:19.910 --> 03:23.920
depending on whether it had an I.D. are not for example.

03:24.530 --> 03:29.840
However if you do that you'll find that you're filling the method with lots of IF statements for the

03:29.840 --> 03:33.390
parts that differ between insert and update.

03:33.440 --> 03:40.240
For example the Eskew L binding the idees value are nuts and it can get messy.

03:40.290 --> 03:44.730
I think it's clearer to have two similar methods instead.

03:47.750 --> 03:54.380
One more thing we need to do before we test this is to create the database connection object which we're

03:54.380 --> 03:56.800
passing into this new method here.

03:57.380 --> 03:59.140
So let's do that.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.860
As in the other scripts.

04:07.630 --> 04:09.670
Let's give that a try.

04:09.670 --> 04:12.300
First let's check the validation.

04:13.030 --> 04:22.600
And that works read displaying the farm and if we enter a value that's displayed as well.

04:22.600 --> 04:33.250
If I enter a valid values and submit the form we get an article not found a message looking at the U

04:33.250 --> 04:37.830
R L we have being redirected to the show article page.

04:38.050 --> 04:41.010
But there's no idae in the query string.

04:45.450 --> 04:48.720
After we've inserted in you rijkaard with this method.

04:48.780 --> 04:50.090
Here is where we read.

04:50.090 --> 04:57.120
I read it to the new article but simply executing this esky well.

04:57.180 --> 05:05.830
Walter signed the idea of the new record to the object far as we have to do that manually.

05:06.330 --> 05:11.990
We can get that by calling the last insert idees method on the PDA object.

05:12.060 --> 05:18.770
This returns the idae assigned by the database to the new rijkaard.

05:20.460 --> 05:28.020
So instead of returning from the method here let's change this to an if statement and if this returns

05:28.020 --> 05:36.670
true will assign the idea of this object to the new idea from the database and return true.

05:40.750 --> 05:50.480
So now if I enter valid data in the form and submit it were redirected to the newly created rijkaard.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.120
Finally.

05:56.180 --> 06:02.930
Now that we've converted all our code pages to use the new article and database classes we no longer

06:02.930 --> 06:10.020
need these two files so we can safely delete them.
