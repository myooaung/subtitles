00:05.470 --> 00:11.210
We've got our admin area to administer articles but it's not working fully yet.

00:11.650 --> 00:16.860
If I click on a link to an article we get a page not found error.

00:19.700 --> 00:26.180
This is because when we created this page by copying the main index page we didn't change this link

00:26.420 --> 00:29.780
to the individual article page.

00:29.780 --> 00:34.380
We don't want to link to this page as this would take us out of the admen section.

00:34.790 --> 00:39.130
So that's copy the individual article page from the root.

00:41.950 --> 00:44.460
And paste it in the admin folder.

00:52.090 --> 00:53.110
That's change.

00:53.110 --> 01:00.850
These require lines as we did with the admin index and also where were including the header

01:03.610 --> 01:06.110
and footer.

01:08.680 --> 01:15.220
We also need to restrict access to this page as this is for administrators only which will do at the

01:15.220 --> 01:21.500
top by calling the required log in method on the Artha class like that.

01:24.170 --> 01:35.600
Now if we click on an article in the admin index we see this new page the edit and delete links are

01:35.600 --> 01:37.350
broken however.

01:40.560 --> 01:46.450
This is because the edit and delete scripts are still in the root of the site.

01:47.040 --> 01:50.260
Let's move them to the admin folder.

02:04.150 --> 02:05.550
On the edit page.

02:05.620 --> 02:11.310
As with the individual article page we need to change these four includes.

02:16.940 --> 02:22.430
And also where we are including the shared article farm here.

02:22.960 --> 02:28.160
Let's also require luggin for this page at the top.

02:30.030 --> 02:35.200
We'll do the same with the delete articles script.

02:36.990 --> 02:43.890
Changing the required lines and also requiring logging

02:47.280 --> 02:51.420
back in the individual article scripts in The Root.

02:51.510 --> 02:55.980
We can now remove these edit and delete links.

03:01.030 --> 03:02.850
Let's give that a try.

03:02.950 --> 03:14.790
If we view an article in the abdomen area let's edit it make a change and click save.

03:15.310 --> 03:23.260
The change has been saved but we've been redirected back to the individual article page in The Root.

03:23.290 --> 03:28.510
We can also see that the edit and delete links are no longer shown.

03:31.830 --> 03:38.210
This is because after saving the changes the cold redirects to the article page in The Root.

03:38.580 --> 03:43.410
Let's change this to the article page in the admin folder instead.

03:43.980 --> 03:45.130
Like that.

03:48.820 --> 03:50.770
Now if we edit an article

03:55.470 --> 04:00.690
we're correctly redirected to the article page in the admin folder.

04:01.510 --> 04:05.240
Let's also try deleting an article.

04:11.200 --> 04:17.260
And again the article is deleted but were redirected back to the wrong index page.

04:19.550 --> 04:29.210
It's the same issue as in the edit script so that's changed this redirect to go to the admen index instead.

04:31.250 --> 04:37.270
Now when we delete an article we're redirected correctly.
