00:05.440 --> 00:09.740
We just added a table to the database to store our categories.

00:09.970 --> 00:14.880
We're going to apply these categories to the articles in the article table.

00:17.790 --> 00:23.330
In a relational database there are different types of relationships between tables.

00:23.760 --> 00:30.420
A one to one relationship is where one rijkaard from one table is related to one and only one rijkaard

00:30.690 --> 00:32.410
from another table.

00:33.150 --> 00:39.960
For example in our CNS any single article could only have one category.

00:40.470 --> 00:46.510
Additionally any category could only be related to a single article.

00:49.810 --> 00:58.860
To model this in the database we add a field to the article table kalid category idae.

00:58.990 --> 01:06.700
This will be an integer which will default to Noel and this art somatically checks the column allowing

01:06.700 --> 01:14.030
the field to contain a nil value will add a unique index on this column.

01:16.100 --> 01:17.550
Let's save that.

01:17.810 --> 01:20.460
And there is the new column.

01:21.660 --> 01:24.740
This field is called a foreign key.

01:24.780 --> 01:31.920
It's a field that links to a primary key field on another table from a field to be a foreign key.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.190
It needs to have an index on it.

01:36.860 --> 01:41.340
Next we need to define the relationship between the two tables.

01:41.420 --> 01:50.200
Based on this field if I click relation view then we can select the category idae column we just added.

01:52.130 --> 01:59.760
The table that were relating it to which is category and the column in that table which is the idae.

02:01.330 --> 02:06.550
When I click save the foreign key relationship is added.

02:10.830 --> 02:15.220
If we browse the Ricardos in the article table now and edit one of them.

02:17.030 --> 02:20.850
We can see the values of the Ricardos columns.

02:21.200 --> 02:27.710
The category idae is shown as a select list where we can select one of the categories from the other

02:27.710 --> 02:29.100
table.

02:29.120 --> 02:32.250
Select one and save the rijkaard.

02:33.660 --> 02:39.670
This place is the I.D. of the Category rijkaard in the foreign key field of the article rijkaard.

02:41.240 --> 02:47.370
Let's edit another one and select the same category.

02:47.510 --> 02:51.520
When I click save we get an error.

02:54.850 --> 03:00.640
This is because of the unique index on the category i.e. column.

03:00.700 --> 03:03.840
This is what makes this a one to one relationship.

03:03.970 --> 03:11.590
An article can only have one category as the category idees field can only contain one value and the

03:11.590 --> 03:17.730
category can only be assigned once to an article because of this unique index.

03:21.740 --> 03:25.180
This kind of relationship is not very common.

03:25.190 --> 03:30.950
We could model the same data by simply including the name of the category is a field in the article

03:30.950 --> 03:32.030
table.

03:32.090 --> 03:39.260
There's not much point in having a separate category table like this for a one to one relationship.

03:39.320 --> 03:46.190
However there are certain cases where this type of relationship is used so it's important to be aware

03:46.190 --> 03:46.780
of it.
