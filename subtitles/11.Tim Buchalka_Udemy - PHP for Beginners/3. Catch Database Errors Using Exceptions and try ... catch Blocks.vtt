00:04.460 --> 00:07.900
When we connect to the database using my Escuela.

00:08.120 --> 00:16.010
We can detect if there's a connection error using the my ESC You will connect ever function in pdl.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.850
There isn't an equivalent function.

00:18.980 --> 00:24.710
However instead it uses the object oriented way of dealing with errors.

00:27.750 --> 00:33.520
P HP uses exceptions to handle specific error conditions.

00:33.520 --> 00:41.200
If an error occurs in some code that code can throw an exception object when this occurs we can catch

00:41.200 --> 00:44.460
it and take the necessary action.

00:45.430 --> 00:48.630
Let's look at an example at the moment.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.870
This PDA code is working.

00:51.220 --> 00:53.530
If I change the password dull for example

00:56.770 --> 00:59.420
so that it's now incorrect.

01:01.540 --> 01:10.090
In the browser we get a fatal error that says one cart PDA an exception and it tells us where this is

01:10.090 --> 01:13.340
happening in the pdl Constructor.

01:17.260 --> 01:24.090
The constructor is kalid when we create a new object of this class to handle exceptions.

01:24.130 --> 01:29.900
First we enclose the code that could cause an exception in a try block.

01:30.850 --> 01:40.730
Then we add a matching catch block which has an argument which is the exception object that's been thrown.

01:42.720 --> 01:51.840
This exception object is an object of the exception class R of a child class of this class so this object

01:53.220 --> 02:00.690
will have the get message method which returns the detailed error message of the error that's occurred.

02:01.140 --> 02:07.620
So if an exception is thrown when we try to create a Pedia object let's print out the error message

02:08.730 --> 02:11.560
and then exit the script.

02:14.500 --> 02:20.710
Now when we ran the code in the browser we get the error message saying Access denied because the password

02:20.710 --> 02:23.260
is wrong and the script stops.

02:25.730 --> 02:27.740
If I correct the error.

02:30.860 --> 02:32.960
The page is working again.

02:36.480 --> 02:42.350
There's another place that we're checking if an error occurs here in the index script.

02:42.510 --> 02:48.140
If the query method returns FALSE something has gone wrong with the query.

02:48.450 --> 02:55.240
We're checking this and then dumping out this array which contains the error details.

02:55.260 --> 02:59.280
If I make a change to the esky well so that it's invalid

03:02.400 --> 03:08.150
when we run this code we get an array that does contain the error message.

03:11.450 --> 03:18.280
It would be easier if this code threw an exception so that we could trap it in a try catch block.

03:20.460 --> 03:30.060
We can configure PD 0 to do just this by setting this attribute so that if an error occurs when working

03:30.060 --> 03:34.880
with the database an exception is thrown.

03:35.160 --> 03:38.280
We set this attribute under PD o object.

03:38.520 --> 03:47.380
So here in the Database class instead of returning it directly Let's assign it to a variable then sets

03:47.400 --> 03:54.650
the attribute that throws exceptions and then finally return the object as before.

03:58.370 --> 04:02.880
Now in the browser with the error in our esky Well we get an exception.

04:05.390 --> 04:12.890
So we could wrap this query line in a try catch block to catch the exception and print out the details

04:12.890 --> 04:19.000
of the error as we're doing here in the Database class.

04:19.910 --> 04:24.150
However there's not much point in just catching exceptions everywhere.

04:24.290 --> 04:31.190
If all we're going to do is just print out the error message later on will look at how to add a general

04:31.190 --> 04:40.280
exception handler that catches on cart exceptions and Lexa's deal with them in one place so we can remove

04:40.280 --> 04:43.470
these lines that check the result of the query method.

04:48.820 --> 04:53.470
As we'll deal with any exceptions later run.

04:53.560 --> 04:58.300
This also makes our code much cleaner which is always a good thing.

04:59.080 --> 05:04.750
Finally let's fix the error in the esky real time introduced earlier.

05:09.020 --> 05:13.320
Which means that in the browser our index page is working again.
