When we view an article in the admin area one of the options we have is to delete it.

00:11.730 --> 00:17.970
Clicking on the delete link on this page takes us to another page where we can confirm that we want

00:17.970 --> 00:19.700
to delete this article.

00:23.480 --> 00:30.170
The delete button submits a form to the same page using the post method and when submitted using.

00:30.170 --> 00:36.330
Post the article is deleted and were redirected back to the admen index.

00:40.170 --> 00:46.590
Instead of going via this page to get confirmation we can do it in Javascript instead which will be

00:46.590 --> 00:50.460
faster and therefore a better experience for the user.

00:53.110 --> 01:00.250
First we need to identify this delete link elements on the article page so we'll add an I.D. attribute

01:00.280 --> 01:01.020
to it.

01:03.430 --> 01:09.860
Now we can add an event handler for when this link is clicked in the script file.

01:12.170 --> 01:17.330
This says when the elements with the I.D. of delete article is clicked.

01:17.330 --> 01:20.580
Run the code inside this function.

01:26.170 --> 01:30.400
Now if I click the delete link nothing different happens.

01:30.400 --> 01:34.560
Were taken to the Delete confirmation page as before.

01:37.240 --> 01:44.640
The argument to this function represents the click event in the browser to replace the behaviour.

01:44.650 --> 01:50.350
When this link is clicked we need to stop the original behaviour of the link which is to request the

01:50.350 --> 01:54.320
page in the h ref attributes of the link.

01:54.460 --> 01:59.220
We do this by calling the prevent default method on the Click event.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.610
Now in the browser.

02:05.640 --> 02:09.570
If I click the delete link nothing happens.

02:13.470 --> 02:16.630
Next we want to show a confirmation dialogue.

02:16.770 --> 02:23.820
We can do this with the Confirm function which shows a dialogue with this message and O K and cancel

02:23.820 --> 02:28.320
buttons and returns true if O K was pressed and false.

02:28.330 --> 02:34.040
Otherwise let's add a message for now if the message is confirmed.

02:38.610 --> 02:46.280
Now if I click delete We get the confirmation dialogue which I can cancel and nothing happens.

02:46.650 --> 02:51.660
If I click o k we see the alert message.

02:56.480 --> 03:05.030
So instead of this message we want to request the delete article script using the post method so that

03:05.030 --> 03:09.500
the article is deleted without showing this confirmation page.

03:11.210 --> 03:14.350
We can't use the post method in the link element.

03:14.510 --> 03:16.000
Only in a form.

03:16.130 --> 03:24.800
So what we can do is create a farm on the fly and submit that we can do that in J query by first creating

03:24.830 --> 03:26.310
a farm element.

03:27.720 --> 03:29.000
Like this.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.580
Then we can set the attributes of that farm.

03:32.580 --> 03:38.260
First we'll set the method to be post using the attribute function.

03:40.680 --> 03:49.280
Then we need to set the action attribute or where the form is submitted to to the Delete article script.

03:52.880 --> 03:56.250
We can get this from the hcf attributes of the link.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.310
We're clicking on.

03:59.990 --> 04:09.200
In Jake Query we can get the current element by using the this keyword and using the attribute function

04:09.200 --> 04:14.090
again to get the value of the hcf attribute.

04:14.510 --> 04:19.940
Then we need to add this farm to the astm l. before we can submit it.

04:20.120 --> 04:26.480
We can do that using the append to function appending it to the body element.

04:29.240 --> 04:31.540
Finally we can submit the farm.

04:33.650 --> 04:40.430
This is the equivalence of having a farm in h.t. a male with these attributes and clicking a submit

04:40.430 --> 04:41.560
button.

04:42.020 --> 04:47.750
Instead we've just created it dynamically in the browser and submitted it with code.

04:52.410 --> 04:54.360
Let's give that a try.

04:54.360 --> 05:02.460
If I click delete and click on okay to confirm that I want to delete this article we're redirected back

05:02.460 --> 05:07.060
to the index page and the article has indeed been deleted.

05:11.830 --> 05:20.080
For articles with images the option to delete the image also goes via a confirmation page.

05:23.330 --> 05:30.290
This page works in the same way as the delete article page if it's submitted using post then the image

05:30.350 --> 05:31.340
is deleted.

05:35.020 --> 05:39.420
So if we add the click event handler to this link to.

05:40.490 --> 05:44.300
The Javascript code we just wrote will work out Mattingly.

05:47.670 --> 05:51.690
To identify the delete link in the article page.

05:51.690 --> 06:00.270
We gave it a unique I.D. in the I.D. attribute only one element can have this value far in idae.

06:00.270 --> 06:02.850
Let's change this to a class instead.

06:05.040 --> 06:08.370
Multiple elements can have the same class.

06:08.400 --> 06:12.050
We'll see more of this later on when we learn about stylesheets.

06:14.310 --> 06:20.560
Let's add the same class to the Delete link on the edit article image page 2.

06:24.190 --> 06:26.780
Then in our javascript code.

06:26.980 --> 06:30.030
Instead of attaching this click event handler to the element.

06:30.040 --> 06:36.030
With this idea if we change it to this this will run any time.

06:36.040 --> 06:39.340
A link with the delete class is clicked.

06:44.600 --> 06:52.650
Now if we edit the article image and click delete the confirmation is shown using javascript.

06:52.950 --> 06:58.500
And if I click okay the image is removed and were redirected as expected.

07:02.230 --> 07:05.930
So we haven't actually changed any P H P cold here.

07:05.980 --> 07:11.890
The delete code still expects the post method but we've improved the user experience by showing the

07:11.890 --> 07:16.440
confirmation using javascript instead of a full page in the browser.

07:16.780 --> 07:23.280
And if the user has javascript turned off in their browser the other confirmation is still shown.
