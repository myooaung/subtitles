In this video we're going to install the atom text editor on Windows.

00:11.440 --> 00:16.000
We'll start by going to the atom website in a browser.

00:16.030 --> 00:20.670
Click on the link to download the installation file.

00:21.280 --> 00:31.480
And once we've downloaded and saved that file we'll run it which will start the installation program

00:32.740 --> 00:34.450
unlike some other programs.

00:34.450 --> 00:37.550
This doesn't have any installation options.

00:37.600 --> 00:45.030
So as soon as you run the installation package you'll see this splash screen installation.

00:45.160 --> 00:49.150
Take a few minutes depending on your system.

00:53.190 --> 00:59.530
Once the installation has completed the editor will start and it looks like this.

00:59.640 --> 01:03.830
The first thing we're going to do is make a change to one of the settings.

01:03.960 --> 01:12.620
So in the file menu we'll go to the settings entry and in there click on the packages option.

01:12.810 --> 01:17.820
And we're going to look for the package called Art a complete plus.

01:18.560 --> 01:26.540
There will click the settings button and we're going to uncheck the box that says show suggestions on

01:26.540 --> 01:37.010
keystroke will re-enable this later on in the course to see how it can help us code.

01:37.010 --> 01:46.550
Then we can close the settings window and I'll solve these welcome pages and to get us ready to start

01:46.550 --> 01:47.140
coding.

01:47.150 --> 01:54.380
We're going to open the folder that we set up earlier with our web server so we'll go to the File menu

01:55.010 --> 02:00.640
select open folder and we'll select the folder that we created earlier.

02:00.750 --> 02:13.130
I created the folder w w w here will select the folder and finally will just make sure that the treeview

02:13.640 --> 02:18.720
is displayed which shows us the folder on our system.

02:18.800 --> 02:22.980
Now we have the editor installed and we were ready to start coding.
