00:04.380 --> 00:12.880
When we submit this farm the data from it inputs are shown in the you owl.

00:13.890 --> 00:16.920
This is fine for a search farm for instance.

00:17.040 --> 00:24.210
But what if it's a sign up are logging farm containing a password for example let's change this farm

00:24.210 --> 00:33.450
to have a username and password input and will look at different types of inputs in more detail next.

00:35.370 --> 00:44.070
In a browser when we type a user name and password and submit the farm the data as shown in the query

00:44.070 --> 00:45.250
string.

00:46.020 --> 00:54.450
In addition to being visible in the address bar the U R L is also saved in the browser's history on

00:54.450 --> 00:56.080
a shared computer.

00:56.370 --> 00:58.050
Anyone could see it.

01:01.100 --> 01:02.470
There are two methods.

01:02.480 --> 01:05.370
A farm can use to send its data.

01:05.720 --> 01:10.800
The method the farm uses is specified using the method attribute.

01:11.020 --> 01:14.710
Get is the default which sends data in the query string.

01:14.720 --> 01:21.980
As we've just seen so if you specify the method as get are you don't specify a method then the data

01:22.010 --> 01:24.440
are sent in the query string.

01:24.440 --> 01:30.010
However far sensitive data we don't want data to be seen in the query string.

01:30.050 --> 01:34.100
The other method farms can use is called post.

01:34.100 --> 01:37.470
This sends data separately from the query string.

01:40.960 --> 01:50.110
So now if we enter some values into the form and submit it the values are sent but not shown in the

01:50.110 --> 01:51.680
query string.

01:53.720 --> 01:58.160
Let's add some code so that we can see what's being submitted.

01:58.160 --> 02:02.500
Remember as we're not specifying a value for the action attributes of this farm.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.050
It'll be submitted to itself.

02:07.400 --> 02:08.760
Using the get method.

02:08.780 --> 02:15.020
The data are available in the getaway as we've seen using the post method.

02:15.020 --> 02:18.170
The data are available in the post array.

02:20.380 --> 02:25.850
So let's dump out the entire array here at the top like that.

02:28.170 --> 02:34.400
If we visit the party again initially we're shown an empty array because nothing has been submitted.

02:34.710 --> 02:43.450
If we enter some data and submit the farm we can see the values we put in the farm in the post array.

02:43.680 --> 02:47.800
But they're not shown in the you O L in the address bar.

02:50.380 --> 02:56.710
Additionally we can detect which method of form used when it was submitted by checking the request method

02:57.160 --> 03:01.010
element of the server super global.

03:03.780 --> 03:05.770
So here at the top let's check this.

03:05.810 --> 03:12.340
Value is equal to post so we only print out the array if the farm was submitted.

03:15.810 --> 03:19.950
So now when we first visit the farm an empty rate isn't printed out.

03:20.190 --> 03:29.990
But when we add some values and submit the farm the array is printed out.

03:30.030 --> 03:36.330
Note that the value in the server array is returned in uppercase which is why we compare it to the word

03:36.330 --> 03:42.590
post in capitals but in the astm attribute we put it in lower case.

03:42.660 --> 03:48.900
You can use either in the astm Al but the convention is to put it in lower case like this.

03:52.760 --> 03:58.980
So which method should we use as the get method to sends its data in the U R L.

03:59.120 --> 04:06.290
You can bookmark the result but also because of this however we shouldn't use get for sensitive data

04:06.740 --> 04:13.100
like a farm were using to log in are send data to be inserted into a database.

04:13.160 --> 04:21.020
In addition the uml does have a size limit in some browsers which can be about 3000 characters so you

04:21.020 --> 04:24.720
can't send a lot of data using the get method.

04:27.270 --> 04:34.320
The Post method sends its data separately to the U R L So the data are not shown in the address bar

04:34.320 --> 04:42.730
of the browser so we can't bookmark the results of submitting a farm using the post method.

04:42.780 --> 04:49.650
However if we're sending data to the server to be used file log in after data to be saved to the database

04:49.920 --> 04:53.540
then we need to use the post method.

04:53.970 --> 04:59.760
There's no size limit to how much data we can send in a farm that uses the post method.

05:02.640 --> 05:10.090
So if you just getting some data from the web server for example search results you'll get if you're

05:10.110 --> 05:16.020
changing data on the server inserting updating are deleting your record in the database.

05:16.020 --> 05:18.130
For example use post.
