When using bootstrap were not just limited to using that framework styles.

00:10.680 --> 00:14.510
We can still add our own in a custom style sheet.

00:17.270 --> 00:23.970
It's common practice to put style sheets in a folder called C Ss So let's add one.

00:28.280 --> 00:34.950
And in here create a style sheet called styles dotsie SS.

00:42.490 --> 00:45.460
Then in the header section it's turmoil.

00:45.670 --> 00:54.430
Let's add a link element to load this style sheet after the bootstrap one so that we can override any

00:54.430 --> 01:01.630
bootstraps dhows if we want and making sure we start the u r l of the file with a slash so that it always

01:01.630 --> 01:03.760
finds this file in The Root.

01:03.760 --> 01:06.990
Even if we include the header file in a sub folder.

01:12.480 --> 01:19.890
In the main index page were using an ordered list element to display the list of blog posts by default

01:19.920 --> 01:27.280
and on order the list shows a bullet next to each list item and each list item is indented.

01:32.520 --> 01:39.900
We can remove the bullet by setting the list style type property of the list item elements to none and

01:39.900 --> 01:43.080
remove the indent by setting the left padding.

01:43.080 --> 01:45.650
If the U L element to zero.

01:49.730 --> 01:53.600
First to identify the list element on the index page.

01:53.660 --> 01:55.570
Let's add an I.D. to it.

01:57.990 --> 02:02.550
Then in the stylesheet will add a selector for that element.

02:03.780 --> 02:07.060
And first let's set the padding to zero.

02:09.070 --> 02:15.330
We need to apply the list style type property to the L elements not the U.

02:15.370 --> 02:16.180
Element.

02:16.450 --> 02:22.520
So let's add another selector full list item elements inside this you know element.

02:24.570 --> 02:28.440
Then we can set the list style type to none.

02:32.930 --> 02:39.980
Now in the index the bullet points have gone and so has the left padding on the list items so they line

02:39.980 --> 02:43.600
up nicely under the main title.

02:47.210 --> 02:55.370
We can make this slightly more concise by moving the list style type declaration to inside the U L selector

02:56.990 --> 02:59.980
and we can remove the other selector completely.

03:01.730 --> 03:09.050
We can do this because list style type is a property that's inherited so any child elements of the U

03:09.050 --> 03:10.060
L element.

03:10.280 --> 03:14.740
In other words the L Y elements inherit this property.

03:17.570 --> 03:20.140
And in the browser it looks the same.
