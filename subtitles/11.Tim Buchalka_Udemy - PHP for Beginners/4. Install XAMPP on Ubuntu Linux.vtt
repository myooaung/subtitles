00:05.190 --> 00:13.230
In this video we're going to install X ramp but when to Linux We'll start by going to the exact Web

00:13.230 --> 00:14.660
site in a browser.

00:15.300 --> 00:23.160
Clicking on the download link at the top scrolling down to the accent for lennix section and choosing

00:23.160 --> 00:27.340
the download for the latest version of HP.

00:29.920 --> 00:36.970
Once we click on the download link this will download the installation package.

00:36.970 --> 00:41.410
Once this is downloaded were not going to run it directly from the browser.

00:41.500 --> 00:50.970
We need to do it from the command line so we'll open a terminal window and there's the file We've downloaded.

00:51.520 --> 01:00.610
First will make it an executable file civil type the command chip mod plus X and then the name of the

01:00.610 --> 01:01.680
file.

01:01.690 --> 01:04.510
This has made it into a file we can run.

01:04.870 --> 01:14.560
Next we need to run it with administrator privileges so will type sudo a dot slash and the name of the

01:14.560 --> 01:16.510
file again.

01:16.510 --> 01:21.900
When I run this it will prompt me for my password.

01:22.750 --> 01:28.380
And when I press Enter the installation program will begin.

01:28.540 --> 01:38.050
And here we are in the set up wizard will click next and next again and this is the folder where X humpies

01:38.050 --> 01:44.320
going to be installed will click next again will uncheck this box.

01:44.320 --> 01:48.610
I don't want to know more about it now me at the moment.

01:48.820 --> 01:54.580
Will click next and click next to begin the installation process.

01:54.580 --> 01:59.170
This might take several minutes depending on your system.

02:03.740 --> 02:10.880
Once that has completed will click finish which will launch the X ramp control panel which looks like

02:10.880 --> 02:12.680
this.

02:12.770 --> 02:19.330
The first thing I want to do is configure the web server to use a folder of our choice.

02:19.610 --> 02:25.220
So the first thing we're going to do here is create a folder where we going to be working with our p

02:25.220 --> 02:33.790
HP script files angling to create a folder in the documents folder and call it w w w.

02:33.830 --> 02:43.240
You can call it whatever you want and create it any way you like and to copy the path of this folder.

02:46.090 --> 02:48.380
And then back in the XM control panel.

02:48.400 --> 02:56.430
I'll go to the manage its servers tab select Apache Web Server and click on the configure button will

02:56.440 --> 02:57.480
click Open.

02:57.490 --> 03:01.830
Can't file which is the Apache configuration file.

03:02.020 --> 03:05.920
Say yes and in here.

03:05.920 --> 03:12.160
We're going to go down and find the document root entry.

03:12.250 --> 03:18.190
We're going to change this to the path of the folder that we just created.

03:18.190 --> 03:20.100
We also change the line afterwards.

03:20.110 --> 03:32.530
The Directory line to the same path will save that file and then back in the example control panel will

03:32.530 --> 03:37.020
click okay and then restart the web server.

03:43.300 --> 03:47.750
And now we're ready to start developing our p HP files.
