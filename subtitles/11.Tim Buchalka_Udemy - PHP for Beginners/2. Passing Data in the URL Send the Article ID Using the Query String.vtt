In the article up p.h. prescript we're showing a single article identifying that article by its I.D.

00:12.920 --> 00:18.080
at the moment we've got this I.D. hard coded into the esky well here.

00:18.770 --> 00:20.780
Obviously we don't want to do that.

00:20.780 --> 00:27.560
We want to pass the idea into this script somehow so that we can show any article just by supplying

00:27.560 --> 00:28.710
its side.

00:29.300 --> 00:32.780
So how do we do that.

00:33.350 --> 00:42.830
We can pass it in via the u r l the U R L R uniform resarch locator more commonly known as a web address

00:43.080 --> 00:45.320
typically it looks like this.

00:45.470 --> 00:49.350
The address of the server and the name of the script file.

00:49.400 --> 00:52.890
This is what we've been using so far.

00:53.000 --> 01:00.800
If you add a question mark to the end any text after that is known as the query string we can access

01:00.830 --> 01:05.340
this text inside the script file.

01:06.340 --> 01:13.310
P HP has some built in variables called Super global's that are always available anywhere in a script

01:15.110 --> 01:22.580
the server super global is an array that contains various information about that current script.

01:22.580 --> 01:27.580
One of these is the query string that was used when the page was requested.

01:30.760 --> 01:34.540
Let's create a new file so we can see an example of this.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.870
I'll call it a query string.

01:36.960 --> 01:40.300
Dr T H P in here.

01:40.330 --> 01:45.690
Let's simply dump out the value of the query string like that.

01:49.610 --> 01:57.680
If we access this page in a browser we get an empty string if we add a question mark to the U R L and

01:57.680 --> 02:02.960
then some text then we get that text.

02:02.960 --> 02:10.460
Anything that comes after the question mark is accessible using this variable to query strongest traditionally

02:10.460 --> 02:19.700
used for passing values to a script like this as key value pairs.

02:19.760 --> 02:27.830
So in our script we could process this string to extract the key which is a D and its corresponding

02:27.830 --> 02:30.220
value which is 1.

02:32.910 --> 02:38.510
However there is another super global that we can use to access this data more easily.

02:38.670 --> 02:46.420
They get great returns in associative array of any variables sent like this in the query string.

02:49.260 --> 02:53.680
If we dump out this way in our code like that.

02:56.060 --> 03:03.950
Then in the browser in addition to the entire query string we get an associate of Ray with the key of

03:04.010 --> 03:09.770
idae and it's a value of 1 in this array.

03:10.160 --> 03:17.270
You can add more variables to the query string separated by ampersands like this.

03:20.690 --> 03:28.990
And the ray separates out these variables from the query string into this array for easy access.

03:29.450 --> 03:33.150
You can have several variables here if you like.

03:35.800 --> 03:43.300
But note that they're all passed as strings even though they might be numbers our words are what look

03:43.300 --> 03:45.780
like boolean values.

03:49.130 --> 03:55.670
So going back to our article that p p page instead of having the idea hard coded into the esky well

03:55.670 --> 04:00.330
like this we can pass it through the query string.

04:01.190 --> 04:08.140
Let's concatenate the value from the query string to the end of the Eskew L string like this.

04:11.610 --> 04:12.650
Now in the browser.

04:12.660 --> 04:20.220
If we open our article page and put the idea in the query string like this we get the rijkaard corresponding

04:20.220 --> 04:27.270
to that idae we can change the idae and the record changes.

04:27.390 --> 04:32.420
So we're getting the idea of the rijkaard from the U R L.

04:35.890 --> 04:37.030
Now we've got this.

04:37.030 --> 04:45.400
We can add a link to this article page from our index page passing through the idae in the query string.

04:46.270 --> 04:55.360
Let's make each article title here into a link to articles up p p by wrapping the title in an anchor

04:55.360 --> 05:02.260
tag like this we can access the idea of each rijkaard in the same way they were accessing the other

05:02.260 --> 05:09.480
columns so we can put this in the query string of the U r l like this.

05:13.910 --> 05:21.290
So now the titles of the articles on our index page are links to the article page and if we click on

05:21.290 --> 05:25.280
one it takes us to that individual article.

05:25.340 --> 05:29.560
Each link is different taking us to the same page.

05:29.750 --> 05:33.910
But passing in a different article I find the query string.
