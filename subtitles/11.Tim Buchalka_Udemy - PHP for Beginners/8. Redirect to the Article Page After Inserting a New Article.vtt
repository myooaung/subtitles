00:05.180 --> 00:13.150
When we add a valid data to the new article farm and submit it a new article is inserted into the database

00:13.220 --> 00:17.150
and its I.D. is displayed at the moment.

00:17.180 --> 00:17.620
Oh.

00:17.730 --> 00:21.810
We're just read displaying the farm which includes all the data.

00:21.830 --> 00:29.990
We just insert it so we could keep submitting this farm adding more Ricardos it would be more user friendly

00:29.990 --> 00:36.020
that way to redirect to the article page where we could see the new rijkaard we just insert it.

00:38.750 --> 00:43.240
Normally a user requests a page by typing in a u r l.

00:43.340 --> 00:51.270
Clicking on a link are submitting a form the server receives the request and sends back a response.

00:51.290 --> 00:54.570
For example a page of h.t. Mail.

00:55.040 --> 01:01.280
Sometimes though instead of replying with some content the server replies with a message to tell the

01:01.280 --> 01:04.120
browser to request a different you are L..

01:04.190 --> 01:07.050
This is known as a redirect.

01:07.100 --> 01:13.150
It's common to redirect to another page after inserting some data into a database for example

01:16.490 --> 01:22.550
when a web server responds to a request through your email and sends a file to a browser along with

01:22.550 --> 01:26.460
the file it sends some additional information about it.

01:26.720 --> 01:31.610
Details of the server the type and status of the response and so on.

01:31.850 --> 01:38.210
These are kalid response headers because they're sent before the actual content of the page.

01:41.140 --> 01:46.150
We can see the response headers by using developer tools in the browser.

01:48.160 --> 01:55.150
To redirect to another eurail we send a header which comes in the response headers to tell the browser

01:55.150 --> 01:57.690
to request another you are L..

02:00.260 --> 02:06.470
To do this in p s p we use the header function and we pass in a string that contains the Eurorail of

02:06.470 --> 02:11.810
the page to redirect to now a new article script.

02:11.810 --> 02:16.420
At this point we've just inserted the rijkaard and we have it side.

02:16.760 --> 02:24.890
So here we can use the header function to redirect to the article page passing in the U R L of that

02:24.890 --> 02:33.070
page which includes the idae in the query string as the browser is going to redirect at this point.

02:33.230 --> 02:39.470
It's good practice to our ways exit the script after sending a redirect header like this.

02:39.800 --> 02:46.280
None of the code following this is going to be seen in the browser so it's better not to even execute

02:46.280 --> 02:47.570
it.

02:50.630 --> 02:52.360
Let's give that a try.

02:52.430 --> 02:59.240
If we enter some data and submit the farm the record is inserted and we have redirected to the article

02:59.240 --> 03:01.670
page where we can see the new rijkaard

03:04.460 --> 03:11.840
we can see the location header here that the server sent to the browser which is what caused the redirect.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.410
Here we are redirecting to a relative to our L..

03:18.480 --> 03:22.490
In other words the Eurorail is relative to the current one.

03:22.680 --> 03:26.170
The same server same directivity and so on.

03:26.190 --> 03:32.610
This works in modern browsers but might not work in older ones to make sure this works everywhere.

03:32.640 --> 03:39.200
We should be using an absolute u r l which is one that contains the protocol and the server name.

03:41.900 --> 03:48.110
Instead of hard coding the server address in our code we can get this information from data provided

03:48.110 --> 03:51.650
by this server super global.

03:53.750 --> 04:02.120
First we need to get the protocol which we can do using this piece of code without going into this in

04:02.120 --> 04:03.500
too much detail.

04:03.500 --> 04:12.560
This is the standard way of checking if the server is using H T T P R H T T P S we can get the server

04:12.560 --> 04:16.760
name using the H T T P host element from the server.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.160
Super global.

04:20.030 --> 04:23.780
So using these we can now redirect to an absolute.

04:23.780 --> 04:25.040
You are real.

04:29.780 --> 04:31.370
Let's give this a try.

04:31.790 --> 04:39.050
When we submit the farm with some data we're redirected as before and if we look at the headers we can

04:39.050 --> 04:45.650
see the location header is now an absolute u r l and we've artier magically included the protocol and

04:45.650 --> 04:49.080
server name without hard coding them.

04:49.160 --> 04:55.110
So now when we add a new article we're redirected to the individual article page.

04:57.380 --> 05:04.010
Finally instead of having to type the uml for the new article page let's add a link to the index page

05:04.010 --> 05:06.610
here like that.

05:08.940 --> 05:12.970
Now we can click on this link to get to the new article page.
