If you want to use control structures in P HP.

00:08.390 --> 00:10.080
Like if for.

00:10.100 --> 00:20.150
And so on when mixing p.h. P and h.t. email then there's an alternative syntax you need to use this

00:20.240 --> 00:28.610
alternative syntax is basically to change the opening brace to a colon then replace the closing brace

00:28.820 --> 00:33.160
with END IF end far and so on.

00:33.230 --> 00:39.990
This way you can have h.t. male code inside a p p control structure like this.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.490
Let's look at an example.

00:45.680 --> 00:53.630
Earlier on in the course we learnt how to use the if else if else control structure in HP and we wrote

00:53.660 --> 00:58.700
this code to display a message based on the hour of the day.

00:58.700 --> 01:04.370
Let's convert this to a mix of P HP and it's dml.

01:05.210 --> 01:09.620
First we'll cut out this code.

01:12.130 --> 01:20.620
We'll insert some basic s t email and we'll paste the p p code here inside the H T mail.

01:21.880 --> 01:31.300
If we add a p-h P closing tag at the end like that then this code will work without any further changes.

01:31.300 --> 01:38.120
When we view it in a browser and here's the message coming from the p-h P code.

01:42.110 --> 01:49.090
But as we just learnt it's not ideal to be echoing out strings like this inside h.t. AML.

01:49.130 --> 01:56.920
So let's change it so that we keep the p p control structure and the AITs tier male content separate.

01:56.920 --> 02:04.010
First let's move where we're setting this variable up to the top.

02:04.220 --> 02:10.850
It's quite common to move any code that is just setting our retrieving data up to the top like this

02:11.090 --> 02:18.350
before the term owl so that the p s p mixed in with the h t email is kept to a minimum and therefore

02:18.350 --> 02:21.990
the cold is clearer and easier to understand.

02:23.150 --> 02:26.560
Then in our IF statement let's change the opening.

02:26.570 --> 02:30.210
Curly brace to a colon.

02:33.610 --> 02:37.470
And then add a p-h P closing tag.

02:38.290 --> 02:45.410
Then we can get rid of the Echo and the quotes because we're now in turmoil here.

02:45.660 --> 02:53.230
Again far the semicolon and the quotes at the end and we'll just move this up so it's on the same line

02:53.680 --> 02:59.130
making sure we leave a space before the p p opening tag and the if statement.

03:02.660 --> 03:06.880
Now that we're in HS t email here to go back to p p code.

03:07.010 --> 03:09.640
We need another p p opening tack

03:14.180 --> 03:22.970
and then at the end we'll change the curly brace to akol on and close the p p again like that and we

03:22.970 --> 03:24.150
can get rid of the echo.

03:24.230 --> 03:27.720
And the quote and the quote and the semicolon.

03:30.460 --> 03:38.590
And we can continue like that all the way down the rest of the if statement and then at the end instead

03:38.590 --> 03:46.030
of this final closing brace we put end if like that.

03:46.030 --> 03:50.810
Now in the browser we get the same result.

03:53.660 --> 04:02.180
However now our p h p code which is the dynamic part of the page is separate from its female content

04:02.510 --> 04:04.780
which is static.

04:05.030 --> 04:11.420
So instead of some simple text in here we could have several h.t. Amount elements for example but written

04:11.420 --> 04:16.000
in H term L rather than a string in P H P.

04:19.110 --> 04:28.470
The same alternative syntax is useful while loops followups and so on only ending in end while end far

04:28.710 --> 04:30.960
end for each and so on.
