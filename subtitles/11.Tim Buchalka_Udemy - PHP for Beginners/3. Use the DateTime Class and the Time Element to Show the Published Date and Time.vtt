00:05.560 --> 00:08.190
Now that were only showing published articles.

00:08.440 --> 00:15.320
Let's show the publication date and time next to each article.

00:16.230 --> 00:19.350
This will use the AITs email time element.

00:19.540 --> 00:24.260
This element is used to semantically mark-up a date and optional time.

00:26.230 --> 00:27.490
Let's add this element.

00:27.490 --> 00:35.590
After the article title on the index page and inside will echo out the published at attributes of the

00:35.590 --> 00:36.390
article.

00:40.590 --> 00:47.520
This displays the published date and time in the format that it's stored in the database year month

00:47.520 --> 00:51.500
day hour minute second.

00:51.690 --> 00:53.880
This isn't a very friendly far Matt.

00:54.060 --> 00:56.220
So let's form at it differently.

00:58.850 --> 00:59.720
To do this.

00:59.750 --> 01:10.490
First we need to convert this value which is a string into a date time object the date time class constructor

01:10.760 --> 01:17.800
accepts the my s keywell are Maria idb date time format as a valid date time string.

01:23.330 --> 01:31.670
So instead of just echoing out this value first we'll create a new date time object passing in the value

01:31.670 --> 01:33.470
to the object constructor.

01:36.220 --> 01:42.050
We can then use the format method on the date time object to get a formatted date string.

01:44.910 --> 01:50.570
The format is a string containing letters that represent different parts of the date.

01:54.620 --> 02:05.450
So we can call this method passing in options to display the day full month name and year echoing out

02:05.510 --> 02:07.270
the return string.

02:11.180 --> 02:15.200
Now the date is shown in a much more user friendly format.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.380
This isn't as machine readable though.

02:19.420 --> 02:26.240
For example by a search engine that might be crawling the site plus were no longer displaying the time.

02:28.610 --> 02:35.800
The time element has an optional date time attribute where we can put a machine readable date time value.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.310
So let's add this attribute.

02:42.060 --> 02:48.600
Echoing out the original unchanged value that's coming from the database as this is a valid date and

02:48.600 --> 02:49.530
time string.

02:49.650 --> 02:52.180
As far as the time element is concerned.

02:55.140 --> 03:03.540
Now in the index the user is shown the friendly value whereas the time element includes the full value

03:03.870 --> 03:05.740
in the date time attribute.

03:09.870 --> 03:14.300
Let's add this same information to the individual article page.

03:18.030 --> 03:19.740
Will copy the time element.

03:19.740 --> 03:20.520
We just added

03:24.000 --> 03:30.140
and paste it in the individual article page after the title.

03:30.480 --> 03:37.330
Looking at the title notes how were getting the article data from the first elements of the array.

03:39.370 --> 03:44.570
So we need to add this index to where we're getting the published at attribute.

03:52.190 --> 04:00.080
Now the published at details are shown on the individual article page 2 with the full value in the date

04:00.110 --> 04:02.680
time attribute of the time element.
