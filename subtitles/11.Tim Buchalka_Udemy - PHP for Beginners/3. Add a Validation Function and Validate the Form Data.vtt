00:05.260 --> 00:08.330
Now we're displaying the article we want to edit.

00:08.380 --> 00:12.890
We need to add the code to process the farm once it's submitted.

00:16.040 --> 00:22.970
In the new article script when we submit the farm to create a new article we're getting the values from

00:22.970 --> 00:26.150
the farm then validating them.

00:26.330 --> 00:34.920
And if there are validation errors we're redisplay in the farm and displaying the error messages.

00:34.910 --> 00:42.460
Again we don't want to repeat ourselves by copying this code as the validation rules for a new are existing.

00:42.470 --> 00:44.520
Article will be the same.

00:47.640 --> 00:51.430
So let's create a function to validate an article.

00:51.510 --> 00:59.830
We will do this in here in the article include where we've already got the function to get an article.

01:00.510 --> 01:04.300
Let's create a function called validate article.

01:06.290 --> 01:13.100
Instead of relying on variables that already exist in the code when we call this function to encapsulate

01:13.100 --> 01:20.830
this code as much as possible we'll Passim the values were validating as arguments to the function.

01:23.560 --> 01:27.140
Then we can copy this validation code.

01:35.550 --> 01:40.440
And paste it in a new function.

01:44.650 --> 01:51.180
If one of these values is invalid then we're adding an error message to the errors array.

01:51.250 --> 01:57.670
However we don't want to rely on a variable that might or might not exist outside of this function.

01:58.120 --> 02:06.580
So let's add this variable to the top of our function and then at the end of the function we'll return

02:06.610 --> 02:07.420
this variable

02:10.090 --> 02:12.280
like that.

02:12.310 --> 02:19.830
Finally let's be thoughtful programmers and add a p-h p up comment for function.

02:21.330 --> 02:29.040
With the description list of parameters arguments and the return value.

02:33.060 --> 02:38.730
Now we can use this new function in our new article script.

02:38.730 --> 02:47.340
First we'll require the file where the function is here at the top then we can replace this validation

02:47.340 --> 02:49.320
code.

02:56.130 --> 03:03.610
With a call to the new function passing in the title content and published at variables and assigning

03:03.610 --> 03:07.210
the function's return value to the errors array.

03:10.570 --> 03:14.540
Let's just check this still works and it does.

03:14.560 --> 03:18.000
Validating the farm and displaying the error messages.

03:22.090 --> 03:26.350
Now we can use this same code in our edit article script.

03:31.010 --> 03:36.980
We'll place it here after we've retrieved the article from the database.

03:39.710 --> 03:47.810
So if the farm is submitted we'll get the values from the farm into these variables validate them and

03:47.810 --> 03:55.540
if they're valid for now that's just outputs a message saying so and stop the script.

03:59.310 --> 04:01.230
Let's give that a try.

04:01.350 --> 04:07.870
If we submit the farm with valid values we get the message saying the farm is valid.

04:08.790 --> 04:13.050
If we enter invalid data in some of the fields.

04:16.290 --> 04:19.000
And submit the farm.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.090
The farm is redisplay had along with the valediction error messages.

04:26.530 --> 04:31.070
One more thing I want to mention is this air is a variable.

04:31.210 --> 04:37.410
Earlier when we developed the new article farm we initialised the array variable at the top to avoid

04:37.420 --> 04:42.540
an error when we first loaded the page.

04:42.670 --> 04:49.050
However were not doing this in the edit script and we don't get the error.

04:50.440 --> 04:57.190
This is because in the farm when we display the errors we are using the empty function to check if the

04:57.190 --> 04:59.990
array has any errors or not.

05:03.250 --> 05:07.160
In addition to returning true if the variable is an empty array.

05:07.360 --> 05:11.830
This function also returns true if the variable doesn't exist.

05:13.930 --> 05:18.840
So perhaps we don't need to initialize this variable up here in the edit script.

05:19.570 --> 05:22.400
We don't need to do it in the new script either.

05:26.890 --> 05:32.590
And in the browser when we first visit the new article page we don't get any errors.
