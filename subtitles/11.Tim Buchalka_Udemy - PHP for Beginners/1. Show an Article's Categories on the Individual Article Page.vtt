00:05.440 --> 00:13.480
We can now we late articles to categories in the database using the article category join table article

00:13.480 --> 00:16.610
Ricardos can be related to 0 1.

00:16.660 --> 00:18.130
Are more categories.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.330
Let's display these categories in the individual article page.

00:26.610 --> 00:32.730
In the cold for this page we're calling the get by idees method on the article class passing in the

00:32.790 --> 00:35.910
article eidy from the query string.

00:36.690 --> 00:43.230
In this method in the article class were selecting the columns from the article table based on this

00:43.290 --> 00:46.580
I.D. and returning an article object.

00:49.880 --> 00:57.160
As we saw earlier to get the related categories at the same time we need to execute an ESC U L statement.

00:57.290 --> 01:03.260
Joining the article and category tables via the article category table.

01:03.560 --> 01:09.850
For example this article has no categories so we get one rijkaard.

01:11.010 --> 01:18.860
If we change the eidy in the WHERE clause to an article that does have categories.

01:20.380 --> 01:22.460
Then we get to records.

01:22.570 --> 01:26.530
As this article is related to two categories.

01:27.130 --> 01:30.920
So this Eskew l could result in 0 1.

01:31.030 --> 01:32.600
Are more records.

01:36.480 --> 01:44.600
So there's two problems with using a single query to get both the article and category data first.

01:44.640 --> 01:51.450
The category data aren't part of the article class and pdl were wolters Signed them as attributes of

01:51.450 --> 01:56.240
the article object when we use the fetch class mode.

01:56.490 --> 02:02.670
Also we might get more than one rijkaard back from that esky well which isn't suitable if we want to

02:02.670 --> 02:06.150
return a single article object.

02:06.150 --> 02:13.470
P The O doesn't have the option to return related objects when returning an object of a class.

02:14.610 --> 02:21.080
So instead of using this method let's add a method to return an article along with its category data.

02:21.180 --> 02:23.300
At the same time.

02:26.030 --> 02:32.900
Let's add a new method called Get With categories passing in the database connection and the article

02:32.930 --> 02:34.620
I.D. as parameters.

02:35.850 --> 02:44.040
Let's add the s keywell that we just used that joins the article and category tables together along

02:44.040 --> 02:48.300
with a place holder for the idae.

02:48.300 --> 02:51.880
Then it's the usual code far prepared statement.

02:52.650 --> 03:02.760
Prepare it bind the I.D. value and execute it as this could return multiple Ricardos will return an

03:02.760 --> 03:05.880
associative array of them.

03:05.940 --> 03:08.580
Let's add a p p duck comment.

03:11.320 --> 03:18.500
And then in the article script we can replace the call to get by idae with a call to this new method.

03:20.300 --> 03:26.910
Before we change anything else let's dump out the contents of this variable to see what's returned.

03:30.190 --> 03:38.980
If we view an article that has more than one category then we get more than one array element as expected.

03:38.980 --> 03:46.830
However the title content and other attributes of the array are repeated far the individual article.

03:51.280 --> 03:57.640
So to display these values instead of accessing them as object properties we need to access the array

03:57.670 --> 03:58.550
elements.

03:59.580 --> 04:06.840
We can get these from the first element of the array which has an index of zero followed by the index

04:06.840 --> 04:07.630
of the property.

04:07.650 --> 04:10.580
We want to get in this case the title.

04:11.940 --> 04:16.900
The same for the image file column and the content.

04:22.300 --> 04:28.300
Now when we view the article we can see the title content and so on as before.

04:29.050 --> 04:36.570
As for the categories we've got one array element are one rijkaard for each category.

04:38.290 --> 04:45.590
Also note that we're getting every column from each table in the query including the join table.

04:49.720 --> 04:56.980
Let's change the ASCII rail so we get all the columns from the article table and just the name of the

04:56.980 --> 04:58.190
category.

04:58.660 --> 05:05.220
Let's also rename the category name column in the resultset using the as keyword.

05:09.370 --> 05:16.600
Now were only getting the article columns and the category name column has been renamed as category

05:16.600 --> 05:17.750
name.

05:21.640 --> 05:24.430
Now we can show the categories.

05:24.430 --> 05:30.670
If there are any the category name element of the first array item won't be NULL so we can check for

05:30.670 --> 05:31.730
that.

05:31.960 --> 05:40.660
With this if statement if there are some let's loop around the resultset And for now just print out

05:40.660 --> 05:42.960
the value of the category name.

05:45.260 --> 05:51.570
And before we look at this let's remove the vardhan line we added earlier.

05:54.860 --> 06:02.500
Now if we view an article that has categories there shown below the title.

06:02.510 --> 06:07.170
If an article doesn't have any categories then nothing is shown.
