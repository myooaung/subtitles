00:05.470 --> 00:12.970
We're showing the article published at date on the main index page and the individual article page but

00:12.970 --> 00:15.710
not in the abdomen area yet.

00:15.910 --> 00:20.210
So let's add this data to the articles in the admin section.

00:22.800 --> 00:29.250
In the admen index as we're displaying the articles in a table we'll add the published at attribute

00:29.280 --> 00:31.030
in a new column.

00:31.090 --> 00:33.930
First let's add a header in the head section.

00:36.020 --> 00:44.720
Then in each row in the body section will add a new cell containing the value of the attribute inside

00:44.720 --> 00:45.930
a time element.

00:47.410 --> 00:53.230
As this is for administrators the default format of the date and time are sufficient.

00:53.230 --> 00:55.790
Although you can format them if you like.

00:58.050 --> 01:04.290
This displays the published date and time in the table for those articles that haven't been published

01:04.290 --> 01:04.970
yet.

01:05.010 --> 01:07.290
The cell is empty.

01:09.380 --> 01:13.300
Let's insert a value in the cell for one published articles.

01:13.700 --> 01:19.090
So if the value is present we'll print it out as before.

01:19.520 --> 01:24.660
If not we'll just output a string saying unpublished.

01:28.840 --> 01:34.640
Now those articles that haven't been published are shown as such.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.450
Also add this to the individual article page.

01:40.340 --> 01:45.120
Let's copy this entire statement.

01:46.330 --> 01:52.480
And paste it after the title in the admen article page.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.580
As with the article page in The Root.

01:55.900 --> 02:02.820
We need to add the index for the first array element to both these lines like that.

02:06.410 --> 02:11.350
So now the published at attributes is shown for both published articles.

02:14.150 --> 02:16.340
And unpublished ones.
