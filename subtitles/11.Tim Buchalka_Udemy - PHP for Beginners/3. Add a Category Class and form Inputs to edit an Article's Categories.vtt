00:05.810 --> 00:08.070
To edit an articles categories.

00:08.240 --> 00:11.810
We need to add the available categories to the farm.

00:13.570 --> 00:18.100
So first we need a method to get a list of all categories.

00:18.130 --> 00:24.070
Let's add a category class in the classes folder.

00:29.650 --> 00:32.880
And start with the class definition and comment.

00:35.380 --> 00:39.550
We can copy the get all method from the article class.

00:44.840 --> 00:48.420
And paste this in the new class.

00:52.400 --> 00:55.480
All we need to change is the esky well.

00:57.250 --> 01:04.870
To select all the cards from the category table instead ordering them by name and also the method comment

01:04.870 --> 01:05.640
block.

01:07.630 --> 01:10.410
Then in the edit article page.

01:10.420 --> 01:18.660
Let's call this new method and add a line to print out this data so we can check it's working.

01:21.790 --> 01:30.190
In the browser to erase our printed out the first is this articles categories and the second is an array

01:30.190 --> 01:32.930
of all available categories.

01:34.710 --> 01:39.110
These are coming from the method we just added.

01:39.540 --> 01:46.200
Now we need to add a farm control so the user can edit the articles categories.

01:46.200 --> 01:52.950
We could have a select list element with the multiple attributes specified but this isn't very easy

01:52.950 --> 01:59.880
to use as the user has to hold down the control key to select more than one item.

01:59.910 --> 02:03.670
It's more intuitive to have a series of check boxes.

02:06.500 --> 02:12.960
The farm is in the admen includes article farm script here.

02:13.190 --> 02:17.460
Let's start by adding a field set for the available categories.

02:18.990 --> 02:27.870
With an associated legend then we can loop around the categories array and let's put each category inside

02:27.870 --> 02:30.220
a div element.

02:30.330 --> 02:38.310
Each category will have a checkbox input with the name attributes set to an array so we can get multiple

02:38.310 --> 02:42.430
values and the value attribute sets to the category.

02:42.430 --> 02:52.080
Eidy will add a label element after this containing the name attributes of the category and not forgetting

02:52.080 --> 03:00.330
to escape this with the h.t. EMAIL special Charles function as this could contain user enter text to

03:00.330 --> 03:02.520
associate the input with the label.

03:02.520 --> 03:10.590
We need a unique idae on the input we can create one by using the Category eidy like that.

03:10.740 --> 03:14.910
And this is also what we put in the labels for attribute.

03:20.130 --> 03:27.030
In the browser Here are the categories and we can click on the labels and it selects the check boxes.

03:29.900 --> 03:36.470
As we were editing an existing article that already has some related categories we need to load this

03:36.470 --> 03:41.330
farm with those category check boxes already selected.

03:43.310 --> 03:50.450
In the edit article script we're getting the current articles categories using the get categories method.

03:52.600 --> 03:57.330
This returns an array of associative arrays like this.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.610
So we know which checkboxes to select.

04:03.820 --> 04:08.150
We need a list of just the I.D. of these categories.

04:13.270 --> 04:20.020
We can use the array column function for this given an array of associative arrays like this.

04:20.020 --> 04:25.700
This function will return an array of just the values from a single column.

04:28.290 --> 04:35.400
So let's change this vardhan line to call this function passing in the data and the name of the column

04:35.400 --> 04:37.140
we want.

04:37.140 --> 04:41.070
We can also remove this var dump line now too.

04:44.430 --> 04:47.740
Now we have an array of just the idees.

04:50.970 --> 04:56.930
Let's change the vardhan plein to assign this array to a variable instead.

04:58.190 --> 05:05.940
And then in the form in the check box input element if the category idae is in this array.

05:07.310 --> 05:09.940
We add the checked attribute.

05:15.480 --> 05:22.350
Now in the form if the article already has some categories related to it their associated check boxes

05:22.590 --> 05:25.800
are already selected.

05:25.800 --> 05:33.210
If I choose an article that doesn't have any categories then no check boxes are selected.
