00:05.390 --> 00:10.700
One of the columns in the article table in the database is published at.

00:10.700 --> 00:16.810
This is a date time field which can also contain null if it's normal.

00:16.820 --> 00:19.080
The article hasn't been published yet.

00:19.350 --> 00:25.370
Otherwise This field contains the date and time that the article was published.

00:28.180 --> 00:34.720
However we're not taking this into account when showing the articles on the index page are when showing

00:34.720 --> 00:41.080
individual articles only articles that have been published should be shown.

00:44.040 --> 00:50.580
In the individual article page were using the get with categories method of the article class to get

00:50.580 --> 00:56.280
the article rijkaard So to only get articles that have been published.

00:56.310 --> 01:03.380
We need to add a WHERE clause to ask esky well to only select records where the published field isn't.

01:03.390 --> 01:04.000
No.

01:08.210 --> 01:14.910
However were also using this function in the individual article script in the admin folder.

01:15.440 --> 01:19.240
We don't want to restrict this to only published articles.

01:19.370 --> 01:26.690
Only the one in the root so will make the additional work class optional in this method.

01:26.870 --> 01:29.760
First let's add a method argument.

01:31.560 --> 01:35.790
That if true will only return a published article.

01:36.270 --> 01:41.770
If we default this to false then we only need to change the method call.

01:41.790 --> 01:44.300
In the article script in the root.

01:47.450 --> 01:56.810
Then if this argument is true we need to append an additional where clause to the ask u l to only select

01:56.810 --> 02:00.390
records whether published at column isn't NULL.

02:02.970 --> 02:10.350
When comparing values like numbers and dates we have these various comparison operators like equal to

02:10.920 --> 02:16.060
not equal to and so on for null values.

02:16.060 --> 02:19.200
However we need to use the is operator.

02:19.230 --> 02:23.700
For example is null and is not no.

02:26.510 --> 02:30.440
So the additional where clase will look like this.

02:30.650 --> 02:34.520
Only selecting records where the published that field is not.

02:34.520 --> 02:35.190
No.

02:40.070 --> 02:47.550
Then when we call this method let's specify true for the new method argument.

02:47.900 --> 02:53.570
We don't need to change this method call in the admin script as the argument has a default value of

02:53.570 --> 02:54.420
false.

02:57.870 --> 03:04.860
In the database the article with an idea of two has a null published dat date.

03:06.190 --> 03:13.430
If I click on this article in the index it's shown as not found in the abdomen area.

03:13.430 --> 03:16.380
However we can still view it.
