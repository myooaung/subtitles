If an article has an image we can upload a new one and the previous one is deleted.

00:12.520 --> 00:15.440
What if we want to remove the image altogether though.

00:15.610 --> 00:18.920
So the article doesn't have an image at all.

00:18.940 --> 00:24.280
We can't just submit an empty farm as the validation stops us from doing that.

00:24.700 --> 00:29.530
Instead let's add an option to delete the article image.

00:32.290 --> 00:39.880
Let's start by making a copy of the edit article image file in the admin folder and we'll call it delete

00:40.180 --> 00:42.670
article image.

00:45.250 --> 00:51.550
In this new file we want to keep the cold at the top that gets the article based on the idae And then

00:51.550 --> 00:59.290
once the farm is submitted we don't need any of this code for validating and uploading a file so will

00:59.290 --> 01:08.440
select all this code down to the move uploaded file Karl and delete it including the exception handling

01:08.440 --> 01:10.130
code underneath.

01:10.390 --> 01:17.050
We're left with the code that sets the attribute of the article object deletes the file itself and then

01:17.050 --> 01:19.780
redirects back to the edit page.

01:20.610 --> 01:25.520
Let's change the set image file Karl to pass null as the file name.

01:28.470 --> 01:30.930
Then in the h t l.

01:30.990 --> 01:32.520
Let's change the title.

01:34.540 --> 01:36.240
Then change the form.

01:38.410 --> 01:46.390
To a farm that simply submits to itself using the post method containing an Are you sure message and

01:46.420 --> 01:51.210
including a cancel link to go back to the previous page.

01:51.220 --> 01:55.410
This is the same thing we doing on the delete article page.

01:58.160 --> 02:04.760
As are now passing noell into this method to set the image file name in the article object we need to

02:04.760 --> 02:09.300
take account of that in the method in the article class here.

02:09.500 --> 02:15.480
If the file name is null we need to bind it with a different P.D.A parameter type.

02:15.560 --> 02:21.190
We can do this with a ternary operator inside the bind value method call.

02:23.380 --> 02:28.990
If the file name argument is null then this parameter will be used.

02:28.990 --> 02:31.510
Otherwise it'll use this one.

02:33.240 --> 02:39.380
One more thing we need to do is add a link to this new delete page on the edit page.

02:42.540 --> 02:48.660
You'll do it inside this block so the link is only shown if there is an image.

02:53.210 --> 02:54.780
Let's give that a try.

02:54.980 --> 02:59.060
Here's an article with an image and here's the delete link.

02:59.060 --> 03:06.950
If I click it and then click the delete button the image is deleted and the link to the new delete page

03:07.160 --> 03:08.780
is no longer shown.

03:12.350 --> 03:17.150
In the edit article image page there's quite a lot of code in here.

03:17.150 --> 03:23.890
Once the farm is submitted including a VAR dump line that we've left in here that we no longer need.

03:26.100 --> 03:32.130
If you are uploading files in different scripts though then it's probably worth extracting all this

03:32.190 --> 03:35.960
out into properties and methods of a class.

03:37.930 --> 03:44.200
One more thing we need to do is move this error message into the asml.

03:44.590 --> 03:49.320
So instead of echoing out its value here will assign it to a variable.

03:51.900 --> 03:54.200
Then in the astm l..

03:54.540 --> 03:59.990
If the variable is set we'll display its value.

04:03.820 --> 04:11.560
So now if there is an error when uploading a file the error message is shown in the correct place inside

04:11.620 --> 04:12.750
the AITs to your email.
