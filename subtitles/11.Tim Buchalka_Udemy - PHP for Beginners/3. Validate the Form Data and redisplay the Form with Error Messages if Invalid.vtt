00:05.200 --> 00:10.930
Up to now when we've been inserting a new article we've been providing valid data in each of the farms

00:10.960 --> 00:12.200
inputs.

00:14.530 --> 00:19.560
So when we submit the farm it inserts a rijkaard into the database.

00:21.870 --> 00:28.140
However if we leave the farm blank and don't enter anything we can still submit the farm and a rijkaard

00:28.200 --> 00:33.210
is inserted into the database in the database.

00:33.210 --> 00:36.130
This rijkaard has empty fields in it.

00:36.210 --> 00:38.570
This is not what we want.

00:40.250 --> 00:46.990
So before we insert a new record into the database we need to validate the data coming from the farm.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.300
Let's do this here.

00:48.410 --> 00:54.980
Once the farm has been submitted but before we build the Eskew L statement we'll start by checking that

00:54.980 --> 00:59.740
the title isn't blank if it is.

00:59.780 --> 01:07.700
For now let's just halt the script using that dye function and print out a message.

01:07.700 --> 01:13.010
Now if we submit the farm with an empty title we get the message.

01:13.010 --> 01:18.490
This isn't very user friendly though just displaying an error message like this.

01:19.070 --> 01:25.010
Let's change it so that we redisplay the form with the error message so the user can correct the errors

01:25.880 --> 01:27.760
as we checking more than one field.

01:27.860 --> 01:33.590
We could potentially have more than one error message so let's create a variable to hold the error messages

01:34.790 --> 01:38.330
and set its initial value to an empty array.

01:38.930 --> 01:46.250
Now instead of halting the script we'll add this error message to the array to append an element to

01:46.250 --> 01:47.070
an array.

01:47.090 --> 01:53.040
We use this method of assigning the value to the variable name followed by empty brackets.

01:53.480 --> 01:54.340
While we're here.

01:54.600 --> 02:01.210
Let's also check that the content field isn't empty and add another error message to the array.

02:01.310 --> 02:10.960
If it is for now lets just print out the array and then stop the script so we can check it's working.

02:12.110 --> 02:17.420
Now if we submit an empty farm we get an array of errors.

02:17.960 --> 02:23.100
If we do submit some values in the farm the errors array is empty.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.020
So if the list of areas is empty which we can check using the empty function we can proceed with the

02:32.020 --> 02:34.310
esky well as before.

02:34.310 --> 02:37.080
And let's not forget to close the f block.

02:38.930 --> 02:40.670
Like that.

02:40.670 --> 02:44.690
Then in the x t email we can display these errors.

02:44.690 --> 02:49.570
Well let's just dump out the whole array for now like that.

02:51.800 --> 02:59.460
Now however when we first visit the page we get a message saying the air is variable is undefined.

02:59.570 --> 03:06.140
This is because this variable is first defined here inside this big block which is only executed if

03:06.140 --> 03:07.840
the form is submitted.

03:07.970 --> 03:12.460
So if we move it outside of this block like that.

03:13.490 --> 03:20.510
Now the error has gone although we do see an empty array and when we submit the farm we get the farm

03:20.510 --> 03:23.720
again but this time with the error messages.

03:24.860 --> 03:30.350
So that's changed this from simply dumping out this array to something a bit more user friendly.

03:30.380 --> 03:33.400
First of all check if there are any errors.

03:33.920 --> 03:41.750
Then if there are will loop around the array and display each error message and display these as an

03:42.020 --> 03:45.470
ordered list like that.

03:48.490 --> 03:54.610
Now when we submit an empty form we get the pharmacy displayed with the validation messages.

03:56.600 --> 04:04.010
If we submit a form with valid data then validation passes and we can still insert some data.

04:04.610 --> 04:09.550
Note that we could have added the required attributes to the farm inputs as we saw earlier in the next

04:09.600 --> 04:10.200
email.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.340
But these can be bypassed.

04:12.410 --> 04:15.830
It's very important to always validate data on the server.

04:15.830 --> 04:19.670
In addition to any client side validation your father may have.
