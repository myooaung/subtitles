Now we know how were going to send the email from the contact farm.

00:12.930 --> 00:19.090
First let's add the P eight p e mail a library to our project.

00:20.350 --> 00:28.920
I've added the cold in a vendor folder as we did in the previous video as this folder is inside the

00:28.920 --> 00:30.040
web root.

00:30.060 --> 00:36.870
Let's also add an H to access file to restrict direct access to files in this folder.

00:36.870 --> 00:40.590
We can copy the one from the includes folder.

00:52.580 --> 00:56.480
Next in the contact page code we can load the p h.

00:56.490 --> 01:01.540
P main classes as we did previously with these lines of code.

01:07.360 --> 01:14.830
Then if the server side validation passes we can use p s p Maila to send the email.

01:15.310 --> 01:19.520
We'll start with the code we wrote in the previous video.

01:22.380 --> 01:29.970
Now we could change the sender address to the address entered into the farm but in reality the email

01:30.060 --> 01:35.810
isn't coming from them it's coming from the account we are using on the s.a. server.

01:36.420 --> 01:45.630
What we can do though is add a reply to address containing the address entered into the farm.

01:45.900 --> 01:50.800
We'll see in a moment how this is used in the email client.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.420
We also want to change the subject.

01:54.790 --> 01:59.280
And the body to the values coming from the farm.

02:02.910 --> 02:08.980
Then if the message is sent successfully we dont want to echo out a message in here.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.430
We want to do it in the astm Owl.

02:11.970 --> 02:14.660
So let's set a variable to true here.

02:16.340 --> 02:20.920
Which will initialize to false at the top.

02:23.480 --> 02:26.650
Then if the message is sent.

02:30.130 --> 02:36.300
Will display a message and otherwise it will show the farm.

02:39.020 --> 02:46.460
Finally if there is an error instead of printing out the error here will add it to the errors array.

02:52.430 --> 02:54.230
Let's give that a try.

02:54.260 --> 03:03.720
If I enter a valid values into the form when I submit it the message is sent.

03:07.200 --> 03:10.980
And in the email client there's the message.

03:10.980 --> 03:18.870
Note that the reply to address has been set to the address I put in the farm so if I click Reply

03:21.510 --> 03:24.610
the reply will be sent to that address.
