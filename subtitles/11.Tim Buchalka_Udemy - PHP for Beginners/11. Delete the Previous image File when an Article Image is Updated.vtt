We can now upload an image and associate it to an article and the images are stored in the uploads folder

00:14.920 --> 00:18.320
here.

00:18.340 --> 00:24.820
What happens though if I upload another image to this article that already has one.

00:28.540 --> 00:30.110
The image is uploaded.

00:30.190 --> 00:35.650
The record in the database is updated and the new image is displayed.

00:37.440 --> 00:42.990
However the previous image file is still in the uploads folder.

00:44.310 --> 00:46.550
So we need to delete this file.

00:46.590 --> 00:50.420
If we successfully replace it with another image.

00:51.150 --> 00:58.450
So first let's assign the current value of the image file attributes to a variable.

00:58.560 --> 01:05.430
We do this because we're about to update this value on the next line so to get the previous value we

01:05.430 --> 01:09.550
want to do it before it's overwritten.

01:09.600 --> 01:18.060
Then if the update of the article record is successful and if the previous image value isn't NULL we

01:18.060 --> 01:29.220
can delete the previous image the on Link function in P P is used to delete a file from the file system.

01:30.850 --> 01:38.050
So will call this function passing in the path of the file in the uploads folder.

01:38.710 --> 01:45.990
While we're here as were now showing the image file on this page we can redirect to the same page.

01:46.870 --> 01:50.670
So the newly uploaded image will be displayed.

01:53.570 --> 01:55.150
Let's give that a try.

01:55.340 --> 01:57.950
Here's an article with an image.

01:59.390 --> 02:02.910
And here's the image file in the uploads folder.

02:05.420 --> 02:08.340
If I update the image to a different one.

02:11.940 --> 02:18.930
The new image is displayed and the old image file has been deleted.
