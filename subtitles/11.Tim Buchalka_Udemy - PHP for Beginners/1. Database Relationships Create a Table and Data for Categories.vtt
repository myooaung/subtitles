00:05.790 --> 00:14.220
At the moment Our see a mass has two tables in the database one for article records and one for users.

00:14.220 --> 00:18.340
There is no relationship between these two tables.

00:18.480 --> 00:24.720
One of the strengths of a relational database is the ability to define relationships between tables

00:25.110 --> 00:31.060
and to manipulate the data in two or more related tables using esky well.

00:31.310 --> 00:38.910
So let's add another table so we can learn how relationships work we'll create a table called category

00:39.840 --> 00:42.860
which will have two columns.

00:49.260 --> 00:57.350
The first column will be the idea which is an integer will make it the primary key.

01:01.730 --> 01:09.710
And also check the arto increment box so that new I.D. A is signed automatically.

01:09.710 --> 01:13.070
The next column will be the name of the category.

01:18.600 --> 01:30.000
Which will be a string and will put a maximum length of 128 characters will also add a non unique index

01:31.560 --> 01:34.830
so that we can sort this data on the name.

01:37.260 --> 01:38.510
Quick Save.

01:40.010 --> 01:41.880
And there's the new table.

01:44.690 --> 01:51.800
Let's insert some Ricardos we can leave the idees field blank as it's an art or increment field and

01:51.800 --> 01:54.490
will be assigned automatically.

01:54.590 --> 01:56.640
Let's add some example categories.

01:56.750 --> 02:02.290
For example News technology.

02:07.010 --> 02:11.160
Education and products.

02:16.370 --> 02:23.240
And there we have the four categories we just added with the I.D. having been inserted automatically.
