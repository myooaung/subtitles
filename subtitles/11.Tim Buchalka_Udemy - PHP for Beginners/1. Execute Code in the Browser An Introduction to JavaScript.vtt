00:05.460 --> 00:06.900
Nail the on in the course.

00:06.900 --> 00:13.590
We learnt that p h p code is executed on the server and the results of executing that code our sent

00:13.590 --> 00:14.930
to the browser.

00:15.270 --> 00:19.680
The p p code does not and can not run in the browser.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.960
It's a server side language.

00:24.080 --> 00:32.000
If we want to execute code in the browser we have to use a client side language like javascript javascript

00:32.000 --> 00:38.020
code is sent from the server to the browser and the browser executes this code.

00:40.090 --> 00:41.900
Let's look at an example.

00:42.220 --> 00:44.600
We'll start with this a s t email.

00:44.650 --> 00:50.530
We have a head and a body section a title and a button.

00:52.480 --> 00:53.360
In the browser.

00:53.380 --> 01:01.480
It looks like this and if I click the button nothing happens if the button was inside a farm element

01:01.540 --> 01:03.310
then this would submit the farm.

01:03.520 --> 01:05.930
But it's not so on its own.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.760
It doesn't do anything.

01:09.440 --> 01:18.020
Let's add some javascript code first will add an on click attribute to the button element inside this

01:18.020 --> 01:18.680
attribute.

01:18.680 --> 01:24.550
We can put javascript code that will be executed in the browser when the button is clicked.

01:25.920 --> 01:31.150
The alert function in Javascript shows a message in a pop up window.

01:31.650 --> 01:39.280
Javascript has similar syntax to HP you call a function by putting its name followed by brackets.

01:39.480 --> 01:44.220
Any arguments and ending the statement with a semicolon.

01:44.220 --> 01:51.630
So when the button is clicked this code will call the alert function passing this helo string to it.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.280
Let's give that a try.

01:55.830 --> 01:58.040
And there's the alert message.

02:01.300 --> 02:09.520
There are three ways we can add javascript to a page adding code like this directly to an element in

02:09.520 --> 02:13.420
the h.t. email is called in line javascript.

02:13.450 --> 02:20.230
This is generally not a good idea as it can lead to messy code that is difficult to maintain.

02:20.230 --> 02:23.970
Much better to keep the h.t. email and Javascript separate.

02:24.070 --> 02:25.050
If you can.

02:26.080 --> 02:35.620
You can do this by using the script tag which is the second way to add javascript to a page to replicate

02:35.650 --> 02:37.680
the in line code above.

02:37.690 --> 02:45.100
First let's remove it and create a function that shows the message instead.

02:46.370 --> 02:51.130
Recreate functions in a similar way to how we do it in P HP.

02:53.080 --> 03:00.730
Next we need to add an event listener to the button element javascript code is typically executed in

03:00.730 --> 03:08.860
response to events a button being clicked the page being loaded a farm being submitted and so on.

03:09.160 --> 03:13.460
To do this first will add an I.D. attribute to the button.

03:14.600 --> 03:23.120
So we can uniquely identify it then we need to get the but an element which we do by calling the get

03:23.210 --> 03:28.360
element by idees method passing in the I.D. of the elements.

03:28.370 --> 03:33.810
We want the document object represents the page of astm l..

03:34.960 --> 03:40.410
This returns a variable that represents the button element in the h.t. EMAIL.

03:42.740 --> 03:49.190
To this we can call the AD event listener method passing in the name of the event.

03:49.190 --> 03:56.000
We want to listen far in this case to click event and some cold air that will be executed which is the

03:56.000 --> 03:58.480
name of the function we just created.

03:59.180 --> 04:04.000
Adding the cold like this is sometimes referred to as M bedded javascript.

04:06.790 --> 04:12.290
And in the browser when I click the button the message is shown as before.

04:15.200 --> 04:22.430
The third way to add javascript code to a page is to specify it in an external file that's create a

04:22.430 --> 04:26.020
file called My script that J S..

04:34.680 --> 04:37.830
And will cut the contents of the script tag.

04:43.910 --> 04:47.940
And paste it in this new file.

04:48.680 --> 04:57.230
The name of this file can be anything you like but it's good practice to use the dot J s extension back

04:57.260 --> 04:58.830
in the index file.

04:58.880 --> 05:02.540
We can add a source attribute to the script tag.

05:04.090 --> 05:06.490
With the name of the file.

05:07.120 --> 05:12.690
Although this element is now empty we still need to include the closing script tag.

05:16.680 --> 05:20.570
In the browser the code works as before.

05:24.860 --> 05:32.420
This being a p-h because I'll only be covering the javascript code that's relevant to working with HP.

05:32.420 --> 05:35.580
But if you want to know more about javascript in more detail.

05:35.690 --> 05:38.310
This site is an excellent starting point.

05:39.670 --> 05:46.870
I should also mention that up until fairly recently javascript was pretty much exclusively a browser

05:46.930 --> 05:48.930
only language.

05:48.940 --> 05:55.330
However if you have the nolder jazz framework installed on your server you can run javascript on the

05:55.330 --> 05:58.400
server just like HP.

05:58.600 --> 06:05.740
We won't be using that though on the server we'll use P HP as we have up to now and Javascript will

06:05.740 --> 06:07.230
be used in the browser.

06:07.450 --> 06:10.170
But I just wanted to make you aware of it.
