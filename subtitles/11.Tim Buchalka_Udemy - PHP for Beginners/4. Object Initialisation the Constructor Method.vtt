There's a special type of method we can add to a class called a constructor.

00:09.880 --> 00:18.460
If we had a method like this called construct prefixed with two underscored characters this method is

00:18.460 --> 00:19.330
kalid.

00:19.330 --> 00:26.710
Whenever we create a new object of this class let's try this out by printing out a simple message inside

00:26.710 --> 00:36.370
this method and then when we create a new object in the other script with the new key word this method

00:36.430 --> 00:37.820
will be kalid.

00:40.370 --> 00:44.980
And when we run this code we see the message coming from the constructor.

00:48.150 --> 00:55.020
You can use the constructor method far whatever you like but it's commonly used to initialize properties.

00:55.020 --> 00:59.750
As with any function we can pass data into it using arguments.

00:59.880 --> 01:07.590
So let's add a couple of arguments to the constructor for the name and description and then inside the

01:07.590 --> 01:15.680
body of the method will assign the value of these to the corresponding properties as we saw previously.

01:15.690 --> 01:23.490
We can access the current object inside a method using the this variable so we can assign the values

01:23.490 --> 01:30.090
of the arguments to the object's properties like this.

01:30.090 --> 01:36.060
When we create a new object of this class with the new keyword the brackets following the class name

01:36.430 --> 01:41.190
are where we put the values you want to pass to the constructor.

01:42.780 --> 01:50.220
So let's pass in some values for each of these two arguments and then let's just dump out the entire

01:50.280 --> 01:53.340
object variable like that.

01:57.130 --> 02:03.250
When we run this code we see the name and description properties have been set to the values we passed

02:03.460 --> 02:05.520
to the constructor method.

02:09.630 --> 02:17.880
Adding a constructor to a class is optional but if you do add one it has to have this name.

02:17.880 --> 02:23.450
As with any function you can add as many arguments as you like and make some of them optional.

02:23.460 --> 02:30.660
If you need to you can place the constructor method wherever you like but it's common to put it before

02:30.930 --> 02:32.320
any other methods.
