00:04.510 --> 00:08.770
In addition to properties we can add functions to a class.

00:08.770 --> 00:11.550
These are referred to as class methods.

00:11.680 --> 00:16.620
Methods are simply functions that an individual object can perform.

00:16.690 --> 00:22.880
For example let's add a new function to our class called SAY HELLO.

00:23.110 --> 00:27.370
That just prints out a simple message functions inside.

00:27.370 --> 00:35.650
Classes are defined in exactly the same way you would define a regular function in our test script.

00:35.650 --> 00:38.290
We're creating a new object of this class.

00:38.290 --> 00:46.570
So let's call the function in the same way we'd access a property by using the hyphen and greater than

00:46.570 --> 00:49.650
symbol on the object variable.

00:52.560 --> 00:57.080
When we run this code in the browser the function our method is executed.

00:57.210 --> 01:00.810
And we see the message.

01:00.810 --> 01:09.750
Let's add another method called get a name that will return the name property of the object inside a

01:09.750 --> 01:10.290
method.

01:10.290 --> 01:17.690
There's a special variable called to this which represents the current object.

01:17.940 --> 01:24.870
You can access properties and call methods using this object variable so we can return the value of

01:24.870 --> 01:31.750
the name property of the current object using this followed by the name of the property.

01:34.990 --> 01:44.680
In the other script once we've created an object let's set its name property and then change this method

01:44.680 --> 01:54.400
call to call the Get name method instead and at the same time echo out the method of return value.

01:58.010 --> 02:05.030
We could have access to property value directly but this method is just to demonstrate how to access

02:05.030 --> 02:07.320
properties inside methods.

02:09.710 --> 02:14.950
And when we run this code we see the value of the name property of the object.

02:17.420 --> 02:23.600
As we saw once you have a class definition you can create as many objects as you like of that class

02:23.960 --> 02:27.660
and each object has its own property values.

02:27.830 --> 02:37.190
So let's create another object set it's name property to something else and print it out in the Echo

02:37.190 --> 02:39.290
statements too.

02:43.560 --> 02:48.900
When we run this code we see the property values from the two different objects.

02:52.370 --> 02:56.120
As far method naming standards inside a class.

02:56.120 --> 03:00.560
It's recommended that methods are named using kamil case.

03:00.560 --> 03:05.090
This is all lower case including the first character of a method.

03:05.090 --> 03:12.570
But if there are any other words inside the method name then they should be capitalized.

03:12.620 --> 03:18.170
You can see that here in say hello and gets named methods.

03:18.360 --> 03:24.790
Also inside a class definition it's common to place properties first followed by the methods.
