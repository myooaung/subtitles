When we add a new article were validating the data on the server in P HP.

00:11.930 --> 00:16.920
If there are any errors in the data we put in the farm for example an empty title.

00:16.920 --> 00:24.290
Our content like this then the form is read displayed with the error messages we have to send back the

00:24.290 --> 00:26.450
entire page to the browser.

00:26.450 --> 00:28.680
If there are any validation errors.

00:31.480 --> 00:35.690
We saw earlier on how we can do basic client side validation.

00:35.870 --> 00:43.720
Using H to email attributes such as required but validation using h.t. email only is quite basic.

00:43.960 --> 00:49.990
Using javascript to validate the farm provides a much better user experience.

00:49.990 --> 00:57.280
We could write code in vanilla javascript but as we're using J query we can use the j query validation

00:57.280 --> 01:04.030
plugin which is very powerful and has many features to install the plug in.

01:04.180 --> 01:05.860
We can download it.

01:06.120 --> 01:11.460
Ah we could include it on a C D n just as we did with the J query library.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.740
Let's load it from a c d n.

01:19.780 --> 01:27.610
Adding the script reference in the footer after the J query library because it depends on this and before

01:27.820 --> 01:36.800
our own script file then in the article form will add an idee to the font tag.

01:37.950 --> 01:40.500
So we can identify the farm element.

01:43.760 --> 01:51.120
To validate a form we call the validated method on the farm elements passing in various validation options.

01:53.180 --> 02:00.590
So first let's get the farm element based on the I.D. We just added and call the validated method on

02:00.590 --> 02:05.050
it passing in no real validation rules.

02:08.190 --> 02:15.300
The plugin includes several validation methods for example far required fields for validating minimum

02:15.330 --> 02:19.360
and maximum length email addresses and so on.

02:19.380 --> 02:24.130
It's also possible to add custom validation methods if necessary.

02:26.260 --> 02:33.100
So on our farm the title field is required and also the content field.

02:34.540 --> 02:40.520
The published at field isn't required but we do want it to be a valid date and time.

02:43.020 --> 02:49.530
There isn't a built in validation method in the plugin for this so we could add one using the add method

02:49.530 --> 02:57.510
function and then using the date pass method of javascript which parses a string representation of a

02:57.510 --> 02:59.340
date and time.

03:03.720 --> 03:09.800
Without going into this in too much detail this method might look like this.

03:09.840 --> 03:13.210
We add a new validation method called Date Time.

03:14.550 --> 03:18.140
And this will return true if the value is empty.

03:18.930 --> 03:19.420
Ah.

03:19.450 --> 03:25.300
Also if the value returned from the date does pass method is a valid value.

03:27.260 --> 03:33.820
Then when we validate the form we can use this method like that.

03:38.630 --> 03:46.580
Now if I try and submit an invalid form we get validation messages after each field.

03:46.580 --> 03:51.900
Note that the farm hasn't been submitted and nothing has been sent to the server.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.630
If I provide a value for one of the fields.

03:56.270 --> 03:59.000
The validation message goes away.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.030
This is where the jaquie revalidation plugin provides a better experience than validation with HDMI

04:05.070 --> 04:06.190
attributes.

04:06.500 --> 04:12.290
In addition to showing all the validation messages at once instead of one at a time as the validation

04:12.290 --> 04:16.590
messages are corrected the fields are validated immediately.

04:20.340 --> 04:26.240
The custom validation method we added further published at date allows an empty field.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.480
But if I add an invalid value.

04:33.090 --> 04:37.620
We get the validation error message if I correct this.

04:39.240 --> 04:45.830
The field is valid when we have no validation errors.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.310
The plugin lets us submit the farm.

04:56.200 --> 05:02.410
Now the date does it pass function will allow some date time strings that the server side cold will

05:02.410 --> 05:03.820
consider to be invalid.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.090
So it's not an ideal solution.

05:06.460 --> 05:12.670
However it's not worth fixing here because later on we'll add some controls to the farm so that a date

05:12.670 --> 05:19.920
and time can be selected from a calendar so it won't be necessary to type in an exact date time string.

05:22.580 --> 05:28.430
Even though we've improved the user experience by validating the farm in the browser it's important

05:28.430 --> 05:36.500
to keep the server side validation as client side validation can easily be bypassed for example by switching

05:36.500 --> 05:38.700
off Javascript in the browser.
