00:05.670 --> 00:12.780
We've got several Ricardos in the article table that have a foreign key to a category in the category

00:12.780 --> 00:13.590
table.

00:14.960 --> 00:20.830
Let's try and delete one of the category Ricardos that's being referenced in the article table.

00:25.140 --> 00:26.580
We get an error.

00:26.910 --> 00:33.310
This is because of this Category rijkaard is being used in a related rijkaard as we just saw.

00:38.730 --> 00:46.410
When we added the relationship to the article table we accepted the default for these on delete and

00:46.470 --> 00:50.040
on Update options which is restrict.

00:50.190 --> 00:56.160
This means that if we try to update our deleter rijkaard that's referenced elsewhere like we just did

00:56.670 --> 01:01.680
then the database will be strict that operation and raise an error.

01:01.740 --> 01:07.470
There are other options for these constraints if we select no action.

01:07.470 --> 01:14.620
The database will do nothing if a related record is deleted and will allow us to delete it with no error.

01:17.360 --> 01:24.290
By selecting set null the foreign key column that references the record where deleting will be set to

01:24.290 --> 01:25.790
NULL.

01:25.790 --> 01:29.390
Let's try this out for when we delete a rijkaard.

01:32.350 --> 01:37.080
Now if we try and delete the category that's referenced in the join table.

01:43.240 --> 01:46.170
The database Lexa's with no error.

01:47.280 --> 01:53.760
If we view the article Ricardos that previously referenced this eidy then we can see that this value

01:54.090 --> 01:56.350
has been set to NULL.

01:59.860 --> 02:03.670
Let's try changing the relationship to cascade.

02:10.270 --> 02:18.760
Now let's see what happens when we delete a related rijkaard for example this article with eidy 10 is

02:18.760 --> 02:22.400
related to the category with an I.D. of five.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.470
If we delete that category.

02:29.230 --> 02:31.900
And then go back to the article table.

02:33.160 --> 02:39.100
We can see that the article that referenced it Article 10 has also been deleted.

02:44.650 --> 02:48.370
The cascade option will delete our update.

02:48.400 --> 02:54.840
Any related to Ricardos when one of the records in a relation is deleted.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.590
You might want this behaviour.

02:56.620 --> 03:03.730
Depending on the type of relationship in this example though we don't want articles to be deleted if

03:03.790 --> 03:06.100
a category is deleted.

03:06.820 --> 03:11.960
Instead we want the foreign key field to be set to NULL.

03:12.070 --> 03:18.660
As for update this occurs if the I.D. of the category is updated are changed.

03:18.700 --> 03:22.690
So in this case we do want the change to cascade.

03:22.690 --> 03:27.230
We want the idea in the article rijkaard to be changed also.

03:29.160 --> 03:35.100
How you set up the constraints depends entirely upon how your database is structured.

03:38.820 --> 03:46.200
When working with P H P and specifically P.D.A Oh if an error does occur with a constraint an error

03:46.350 --> 03:48.540
or exception will occur.

03:48.540 --> 03:55.320
These can be cartin pedigo Using a try catch block and you can check for the s keywell Error Code and

03:55.350 --> 03:56.940
act accordingly.
