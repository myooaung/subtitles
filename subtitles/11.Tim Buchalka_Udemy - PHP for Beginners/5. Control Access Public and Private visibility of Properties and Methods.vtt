00:04.430 --> 00:10.460
When we added properties to our Item class we declared them as public.

00:10.460 --> 00:14.480
This means that they're accessible from outside the class.

00:14.480 --> 00:22.790
For example when we create a new object like this we can access the name property like this.

00:24.900 --> 00:29.030
And when we run this code we get the value of the property.

00:31.650 --> 00:39.130
However we can also declare a property as private by using the private keyword instead.

00:41.850 --> 00:49.050
Now when we run this code we get an error saying we can't access a private property.

00:51.970 --> 00:54.740
We don't get an error when we create the object.

00:54.740 --> 01:02.570
So as we can still access the property inside the class itself using the this keyword.

01:04.880 --> 01:09.280
All making a property private does is restrict its access.

01:09.380 --> 01:15.740
When we're working with an object of this class doing this is useful if you have a property that you

01:15.740 --> 01:22.160
want to use internally inside the class but you don't want code using the class to be able to change

01:22.160 --> 01:24.350
its value.

01:26.360 --> 01:32.050
We can restrict the visibility of methods to by default a method is public.

01:32.060 --> 01:34.540
If you don't specify it otherwise.

01:34.550 --> 01:43.160
So these methods that we've already added are public and we can call them on an instance of this class.

01:43.740 --> 01:45.160
Like that.

01:47.500 --> 01:51.050
So that when we run this code the method is executed.

01:53.430 --> 02:00.500
If I change this to a private method by prefixing it with the private keyword.

02:01.410 --> 02:04.520
When we run this cold we get an error message.

02:08.470 --> 02:13.960
As with the variables this only restricts access to methods from outside the class.

02:14.040 --> 02:19.070
We can still call methods from within other methods if we want to.

02:19.470 --> 02:23.600
As I mentioned earlier methods are public by default.

02:23.660 --> 02:32.070
However it's good practice to our way specify the visibility of a method as it makes the code more readable

02:32.520 --> 02:40.740
and that way you are also safe if the default changes at a later stage with a newer version of P HP.
