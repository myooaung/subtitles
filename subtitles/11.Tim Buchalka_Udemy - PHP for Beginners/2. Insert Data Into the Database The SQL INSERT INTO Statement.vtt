00:04.500 --> 00:11.460
We are ready learnt how to select data from the database using these select statement in esky well to

00:11.460 --> 00:13.460
insert data into the database.

00:13.530 --> 00:16.350
We use the insert into statement.

00:19.320 --> 00:25.530
We start an ESC you will insert in two statement with the words insert in two followed by the table

00:25.530 --> 00:27.060
name.

00:27.510 --> 00:32.640
Then we added the values keyword followed by a list of values in brackets.

00:33.090 --> 00:39.120
We have to put a value for each column in the table and they are a has to match the ardour of the columns

00:39.270 --> 00:41.140
in the table.

00:43.460 --> 00:48.440
Let's give this a try will insert a rijkaard into our article table.

00:48.440 --> 00:56.170
The columns are idae title content and published at then that order.

00:58.370 --> 01:08.050
So we put insert into article and then the list of values like that when we run this.

01:08.690 --> 01:14.580
The rijkaard is inserted into the database and there it is.

01:18.020 --> 01:22.940
It's also possible to only insert data into specific columns.

01:23.240 --> 01:30.500
To do this we add a list of columns in brackets after the table name and the list of values has to match

01:30.500 --> 01:33.790
the number and order of these columns.

01:36.030 --> 01:37.210
Let's try that.

01:37.560 --> 01:41.500
We'll just specify the title and content columns to be inserted.

01:41.700 --> 01:48.000
And we only need to supply values for those columns when we run this.

01:48.210 --> 01:56.210
The rijkaard is inserted and here is the new record for the columns that we didn't specify.

01:56.300 --> 01:59.340
Values have been inserted after Mattingly.

02:02.620 --> 02:04.180
The idees column isn't.

02:04.210 --> 02:09.750
After increment column so unique value for this column will be calculated automatically.

02:09.790 --> 02:12.480
Naturally the next available idae.

02:12.910 --> 02:15.500
This is a common technique for after increment.

02:15.520 --> 02:23.770
I did columns to let the database insert values aftermath hickley the published at column is allowed

02:23.770 --> 02:25.000
to be NULL.

02:25.150 --> 02:28.140
So this column is assigned the value you know.

02:28.900 --> 02:34.180
If you try an insert to rijkaard and don't include columns that can't be assigned automatically then

02:34.180 --> 02:35.780
you'll get an error.

02:38.570 --> 02:44.330
You can also insert multiple records at once with one insert statement.

02:44.630 --> 02:49.310
You can add multiple sets of values separated by commas.

02:49.310 --> 02:57.400
If columns are specified the number and odd values in each set has to match the column specified.

02:58.910 --> 03:06.030
Let's give that a try with this esky U L we can insert two ecards with one insert statement.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.550
There they are.

03:16.210 --> 03:22.080
If you want to specifically insert a null value in a column used in nold keyword.

03:22.330 --> 03:25.560
This is only allowed if the column allows nulls.

03:25.750 --> 03:30.190
For example in our article table the published at column allows nulls.

03:30.310 --> 03:31.940
So if we insert a new rijkaard

03:34.680 --> 03:38.970
no will be inserted into that column with this escudo.

03:44.220 --> 03:45.870
And there it is.

03:47.250 --> 03:52.670
If you try and insert a null value into a column that doesn't allow it then you'll get an error.

03:54.960 --> 04:04.470
Note how the list of values numbers and no are typed as they are strings and other values like daytime's

04:04.680 --> 04:07.890
need to be enclosed in single quotes.

04:07.890 --> 04:13.620
Some database servers will that you use double quotes but single quotes is the standard.

04:13.620 --> 04:21.660
If you want to insert a string value that contains a single quote like this then you need to escape

04:21.660 --> 04:26.630
that single quote by putting a backslash before it like that.

04:27.270 --> 04:29.200
If we run this.

04:32.950 --> 04:35.760
There's the rijkaard with a quote in this column.
