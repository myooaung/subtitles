00:05.960 --> 00:15.380
At this point we can upload a file restricting its size and type and if successful the file is saved

00:15.440 --> 00:18.880
with its original file name in the uploads folder.

00:19.730 --> 00:25.760
Although we've restricted the type and size of the file We're still accepting the original file name

00:26.030 --> 00:27.820
without changing it.

00:27.830 --> 00:30.370
This is a potential security hole.

00:30.420 --> 00:36.740
Someone could upload a file with a name that contains invalid characters are even a name that allows

00:36.740 --> 00:40.970
them to move the file to somewhere else in the file system.

00:43.170 --> 00:49.820
So before we move the file let's sanitize the file name only allowing certain characters.

00:51.850 --> 00:58.180
First we need to get the name part of the file name not including the file extension at the end.

00:58.180 --> 01:04.720
We can use this using the path info function which splits the file name up into its various parts.

01:04.720 --> 01:08.770
The name the extension and so on.

01:08.830 --> 01:15.140
So let's call this function passing in the file name from the files array.

01:15.220 --> 01:17.080
This returns an array.

01:17.230 --> 01:23.290
The base name of the file which is the file name without the extension on the end is in the file name

01:23.320 --> 01:24.620
element.

01:25.300 --> 01:33.190
Then we can use the Prag replace function to replace any characters we don't want to allow with another

01:33.190 --> 01:34.560
one.

01:34.600 --> 01:40.240
The first argument to the prog replace function is a regular expression.

01:40.240 --> 01:46.380
This is basically a pattern of characters the function looks far in the string.

01:47.200 --> 01:56.290
This regular expression matches any character that isn't a lower case A to Z uppercase A to Z numbers

01:56.290 --> 02:00.350
from not to 9 underscores and hyphens.

02:00.640 --> 02:06.430
If the function finds one of these characters it replaces it with the second argument to the function

02:07.090 --> 02:10.460
which we'll put as an underscore character.

02:10.600 --> 02:14.790
The final argument is the string we want to change.

02:15.550 --> 02:23.800
Then we can create the file name by adding a dot R period to the base and adding the original file names

02:23.800 --> 02:25.930
extension.

02:25.930 --> 02:31.870
Finally we can create the full destination path by adding the uploads folder.

02:35.360 --> 02:37.870
Let's give that a try.

02:37.940 --> 02:44.810
Here's a file that contains several odd characters but it is a valid image and it doesn't exceed the

02:44.810 --> 02:46.760
size limit.

02:46.760 --> 02:51.660
When we submit the farm it is uploaded successfully.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.930
But the file has been renamed to remove the characters.

02:56.930 --> 02:58.290
We didn't allow.
