WEBVTT

00:05.380 --> 00:07.820
To make coding javascript easier.

00:07.840 --> 00:10.400
We're going to use Jay Query.

00:10.420 --> 00:18.190
Jake Query is a javascript library that makes it easier to write JavaScript code different browsers

00:18.250 --> 00:25.530
support javascript to varying degrees and Jake Query also removes inconsistencies between browsers.

00:25.660 --> 00:29.760
So you know your code will work in as many browsers as possible.

00:31.600 --> 00:34.760
There are some drawbacks to using Jake Query.

00:34.810 --> 00:38.580
First it's additional code that your site has to download.

00:38.770 --> 00:46.360
When someone opens your site in a browser it's not a major performance hater Tal But if you're going

00:46.380 --> 00:55.000
with the fastest site possible you might want to consider using vanilla javascript instead vanilla javascript

00:55.090 --> 01:00.280
is simply the javascript code that your browser supports by default.

01:00.760 --> 01:07.120
You do have to be aware of differences between browsers though as not all browsers do things the same

01:07.120 --> 01:09.270
way in javascript.

01:11.450 --> 01:18.800
For the purposes of this course we're going to use a query as it's much faster to code using it and

01:18.800 --> 01:25.370
the javascript code is much more concise and easier to read so we won't get distracted from seeing how

01:25.370 --> 01:29.930
we can use Javascript in the context of P H P.

01:32.060 --> 01:36.460
There are two ways we can add the jaquie reliably to our code.

01:36.800 --> 01:43.220
J query is simply a file containing javascript that we need to load into our pages.

01:43.220 --> 01:45.740
So the first way is to download it.

01:48.620 --> 01:50.740
And save it with your code.

01:52.600 --> 01:59.240
The Virgin you download might be slightly different to this but always try and download the latest version.

01:59.350 --> 02:02.840
Unless you know you have a valid reason not to.

02:03.100 --> 02:09.130
Newer versions of the library are backwards compatible with Previous Versions So there's no problem

02:09.130 --> 02:13.000
using the latest version of J query with the javascript code.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.400
We'll be learning here.

02:17.310 --> 02:26.340
To add a query to this page we add a scrip tag with the path to the file we just downloaded we'll put

02:26.340 --> 02:33.660
it before our own script file so that we can use jaquie dysfunctions in our own code.

02:33.660 --> 02:39.350
You can load as many javascript files in separate script tags like this as you like.

02:39.360 --> 02:43.440
As for where to put the script tags they can be in the head.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.640
Are body sections of the team AML.

02:45.810 --> 02:52.800
But in some browsers the page isn't displayed until all the code is loaded including seperate files

02:52.800 --> 02:54.110
like this.

02:54.330 --> 03:02.580
So if you have the script tags in the head section your page could take a bit longer to display by putting

03:02.580 --> 03:04.150
the script references like this.

03:04.170 --> 03:06.000
The end of the body section.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.410
The page will be displayed sooner.

03:10.950 --> 03:19.080
The other way to include Jake Query is to link to the file on a content delivery network R C D N A C

03:19.080 --> 03:26.760
D N is a network of web servers that deliver files to a user based on their geographical location.

03:26.760 --> 03:34.020
When you link to a hosted query file via see the n it will potentially arrive faster and more efficiently

03:34.020 --> 03:38.530
to the user than if you hosted it on your own server.

03:38.820 --> 03:41.240
So unless you have a good reason not to.

03:41.430 --> 03:45.140
I recommend using a c d n to load J query.

03:47.500 --> 03:53.180
There are various different C DNA available and they all work in the same way.

03:53.230 --> 03:59.810
For example if we go to J queries o n c d n select the version we want.

04:01.220 --> 04:07.300
We're shown the script tag code that we need which we can copy.

04:10.220 --> 04:12.760
And paste it in our page.

04:13.340 --> 04:21.380
In place of loading the local file these additional attributes are our security check used by the browser

04:21.770 --> 04:24.640
to check the file hasn't been modified.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.480
Now we have Jay Query loaded.

04:30.480 --> 04:35.190
Let's convert this code to uja query instead.

04:35.190 --> 04:37.500
Here we are getting the button element.

04:37.620 --> 04:44.280
Based on its idea attributes and adding an event listener on the Click event that will run the say hello

04:44.280 --> 04:46.620
function when the event occurs.

04:46.650 --> 04:49.230
In other words when the button is clicked.

04:50.460 --> 04:58.920
In J query to get an element based on its idae we do this then to run some code when the click event

04:58.920 --> 04:59.710
occurs.

04:59.820 --> 05:09.000
We just call the honoured method like that much more concise than the vanilla javascript code.

05:13.620 --> 05:20.050
In the browser the code works as before showing the alert message when the button is clicked.
