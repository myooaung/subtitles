00:04.410 --> 00:11.640
When a visitor views a page from your website the server sends the data normally xterm Al to the user's

00:11.640 --> 00:13.650
web browser.

00:14.370 --> 00:22.740
In order to receive data from the user we need to use a farm in our 8 p.m. owl where the farm the user

00:22.740 --> 00:27.140
can enter data and send it from the browser to the server.

00:27.150 --> 00:32.340
Once we've got the data on the server we can process it using P2P.

00:34.860 --> 00:40.500
To add a farm to a Web page we use the farm element inside the farm elements.

00:40.500 --> 00:47.710
We place controls which can be text boxes buttons and so on.

00:47.730 --> 00:49.430
Let's look at an example.

00:49.770 --> 00:54.030
Let's create a new page and call it farmed up here p.

00:55.310 --> 01:03.330
Now add some basic t l for the head and body and so on in the body of the aced him out.

01:03.420 --> 01:05.500
Let's add a farm.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.040
And inside this farm Let's add a couple of controls.

01:10.200 --> 01:15.830
First an input followed by a button.

01:15.840 --> 01:20.190
We'll learn more about these elements in a moment.

01:20.190 --> 01:28.620
Next let's create another page and call it process from P Es P.

01:28.730 --> 01:31.280
We'll leave this blank for now.

01:31.350 --> 01:39.180
Back in the farm script we'll add an action attribute to the farm element that contains the name of

01:39.180 --> 01:39.690
the script.

01:39.690 --> 01:41.000
We just added.

01:45.130 --> 01:52.360
If we look at farmed up p HP in a browser we see a text box and a button we can enter text into the

01:52.360 --> 01:55.350
box and click the button.

01:55.360 --> 01:58.390
This is known as submitting a farm.

01:58.690 --> 02:04.150
If we look at the address bar we can see it's changed to process farmed up HP.

02:04.270 --> 02:09.800
We left this file blank which is why we don't see anything in the main browser window.

02:10.360 --> 02:15.910
However in addition to the address of the script file We've also got a value in the query string.

02:16.360 --> 02:21.440
This is the value that we just typed into the text box in the farm.

02:24.200 --> 02:28.580
We learnt earlier that we can access the query string using the get array.

02:28.940 --> 02:34.660
So in here let's just dump out the entire array like that.

02:37.770 --> 02:38.890
Back in the browser.

02:38.910 --> 02:40.120
If we try that again.

02:40.140 --> 02:46.710
Enter a value in the text box and press the button to submit the farm.

02:47.340 --> 02:51.000
We can see the value that we typed into the text box.

02:51.120 --> 02:56.540
So using this array we can access the data that was entered into the farm.

02:59.930 --> 03:07.670
When you submit a farm it's like clicking on a link to the page specified in the action attribute.

03:07.700 --> 03:15.510
However in addition to requesting this page any data typed into the farm is sent along with it.

03:15.590 --> 03:17.440
Let's try something else.

03:17.510 --> 03:21.020
What will happen if we remove the action attribute.

03:23.330 --> 03:24.670
Like this.

03:28.570 --> 03:29.680
In the browser.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.270
Now when we submit the farm

03:34.690 --> 03:36.640
we see the farm again.

03:36.640 --> 03:44.700
However if you notice the address bar the page is the same but the data is still in the query string.

03:48.480 --> 03:53.720
If you dont specify an action for a farm its submitted to itself.

03:54.060 --> 03:59.870
So when this farm is submitted its data is sent to this page from HP.

04:00.480 --> 04:07.160
The web server then sends this page back to the browser as the farm is being submitted to itself.

04:07.170 --> 04:10.790
Its like the page has been requested again in the browser.

04:10.920 --> 04:15.260
Only this time the farm has sent its data in the query string.

04:17.870 --> 04:21.790
So when we first visit the page the query string is empty.

04:22.160 --> 04:30.590
When we supply a value and submit the farm the page is loaded again and the data from the farm is available

04:30.740 --> 04:32.760
in the query string.

04:34.790 --> 04:37.380
Let's add some cold up here at the top.

04:37.550 --> 04:40.170
To print out the get array.

04:44.790 --> 04:47.630
In the browser we see an empty array.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.820
That's because there's nothing in the query string.

04:51.420 --> 04:53.340
If we enter a value in the form

04:56.310 --> 05:05.340
and submit the farm we see the form again but we also see what's in the get array processing farm in

05:05.340 --> 05:11.910
the same script like this is a quite common technique used when you want to redisplay a farm so a user

05:11.910 --> 05:18.150
can correct errors are supply required fields that they might have missed out and so on.

05:18.300 --> 05:20.930
We'll look at this in more detail later on.
