00:04.350 --> 00:10.340
To view a single article we're passing in the idea in the query string.

00:13.560 --> 00:21.690
We then retrieve this value using the get array and pass this directly into the ESC you l to see what's

00:21.690 --> 00:22.380
happening.

00:22.500 --> 00:33.000
Let's add a line to print out the full Eskew L statement and then in the browser if we view an article

00:33.930 --> 00:38.830
this is the select statement with the idae coming from the query string.

00:39.420 --> 00:44.880
However as this appears in the address bar of the browser there's nothing to stop someone from changing

00:44.880 --> 00:51.990
this for example to another number which isn't found as expected.

00:52.230 --> 01:02.690
But you could put anything in here from some simple text which could even include some ESC You L..

01:05.580 --> 01:08.670
This is called Eskew well injection.

01:08.670 --> 01:13.970
We've allowed a user of the website to run some esky well on our server.

01:14.190 --> 01:16.410
We'll look at this in more detail later on.

01:16.580 --> 01:20.510
And it's an important security issue to be aware of.

01:23.070 --> 01:26.010
Now we're not too vulnerable in this case.

01:26.160 --> 01:33.230
As the my Escuela query method restricts the number of Escuela statements to one later on.

01:33.240 --> 01:38.460
We'll see how Escuela injection can really cause problems and how to avoid it.

01:38.560 --> 01:45.150
For now we can make this safer simply by checking that the ideas coming from the query string is a number

01:47.850 --> 01:49.130
we can do this with.

01:49.170 --> 01:52.200
Is numeric function.

01:54.240 --> 01:57.560
So before we insert the value into the ESC You L..

01:57.750 --> 01:59.550
Let's check its numeric

02:02.040 --> 02:04.000
and if it isn't.

02:06.860 --> 02:10.630
Simply set the article variable to No.

02:15.350 --> 02:18.110
Now if we change the idea to a string

02:21.290 --> 02:28.100
we get the message saying article not found and we dont get the Eskew L printed out as that's inside

02:28.100 --> 02:29.850
the f block.

02:29.870 --> 02:33.810
This also works if we remove the value altogether.

02:34.820 --> 02:41.110
But not if we remove the query string variable all together.

02:41.630 --> 02:45.540
Now we get an error saying undefined index.

02:48.200 --> 02:56.000
This is because were trying to access an array element with the index idea and such an arrangement doesn't

02:56.060 --> 02:59.330
exist in this get array.

02:59.360 --> 03:05.690
Now we don't use this page without passing in an I.D. but someone could remove the query string.

03:05.690 --> 03:07.710
Like I just did.

03:09.410 --> 03:13.730
And doing this they would get a detailed error message like this.

03:16.880 --> 03:21.020
It's good practice to avoid displaying detailed error messages.

03:21.080 --> 03:28.130
Once your website is in production on a life server as information like this can give an attacker details

03:28.130 --> 03:33.430
about your site that they could potentially exploit.

03:33.800 --> 03:37.910
So to fix this before we check if the value is numeric.

03:37.910 --> 03:40.630
First let's check that it's set.

03:42.940 --> 03:49.180
We can do this using the IS SET function which returns have built in value based on whether a variable

03:49.180 --> 03:57.100
is set on UT and will check this in the same if statement as were checking that the value is numeric.

03:57.130 --> 04:04.570
Combining the two using the logical and operator there are two logical operators we could use for this

04:04.840 --> 04:07.970
and and to ampersands.

04:08.260 --> 04:11.650
I prefer to use the latter as it's more common.

04:14.430 --> 04:17.200
So before we check that the value is numeric.

04:17.370 --> 04:22.950
Let's first check that the value is set like that.

04:23.580 --> 04:28.370
Then in the browser we can still see an article.

04:28.380 --> 04:37.200
If the idea is a valid number but if we change it to a string we just get the article not found message.

04:37.200 --> 04:45.210
And likewise if we remove the query string all together we no longer see the error message will look

04:45.210 --> 04:50.170
at error handling in more detail later on.

04:50.190 --> 04:56.520
Finally we'll just remove the line that we added earlier that prints out the esky well so that when

04:56.520 --> 05:01.670
we view an article we no longer see the ESC u l string.
