00:05.300 --> 00:12.560
Earlier we saw how we can use an IF statement to run cold based on a condition being true and how we

00:12.560 --> 00:17.410
can add in Else block to run cold if the condition is FALSE.

00:20.420 --> 00:24.190
We can add more conditions to this by using El seph.

00:24.290 --> 00:32.020
This is a combination of else and if and allows us to extend an IF statement to include other conditions.

00:32.060 --> 00:34.700
If the first condition is FALSE.

00:37.130 --> 00:39.690
Let's look at an example here.

00:39.730 --> 00:44.180
We're conditionally executing code based on the hour of the day.

00:44.390 --> 00:47.330
Stored in this variable.

00:47.330 --> 00:48.130
This will print out.

00:48.140 --> 00:49.120
Good morning.

00:49.490 --> 00:51.540
If the hour is less than 12.

00:51.890 --> 00:56.940
And good afternoon otherwise with the hour sets to 11.

00:57.020 --> 01:03.060
If we run this in the browser it says good morning.

01:05.530 --> 01:10.930
If we change the hour to 14 for example using the 24 hour clock.

01:13.830 --> 01:15.540
Then in the browser it says.

01:15.570 --> 01:17.070
Good afternoon.

01:19.410 --> 01:22.830
Let's extend this to have some more conditions.

01:22.920 --> 01:25.890
We'll leave the first one if the hour is less than 12.

01:25.890 --> 01:27.310
We say good morning.

01:27.630 --> 01:34.890
But then let's add an L elusive for the afternoon for when the hour is less than 18.

01:35.310 --> 01:37.520
Then let's add another for the evening.

01:37.560 --> 01:41.150
If the hour is less than 22.

01:41.880 --> 01:44.550
And then finally the else which will be run.

01:44.580 --> 01:47.320
If all these conditions are false.

01:49.470 --> 01:56.280
Let's set the hour to 11 and then run this code to see what happens.

01:57.600 --> 01:58.140
We see.

01:58.140 --> 01:59.630
Good morning.

02:01.700 --> 02:10.970
If we change the hour to 20 for example and then run the cold again in the browser we see.

02:10.970 --> 02:12.230
Good evening.

02:15.310 --> 02:23.010
What happens is each condition is checked in turn if the first one is false then the next one is checked.

02:23.140 --> 02:30.360
And so on when one is true that block of code is executed and only that block.

02:30.790 --> 02:36.070
If none of the conditions are true then the else block is executed.

02:36.250 --> 02:41.260
You can have as many L sips as you like and the else is optional.
