We also have other components that we can style with bootstrap for example farms.

00:13.990 --> 00:20.730
As with navigation and pagination most styles can be applied just by adding classes to the h.t. Mail.

00:20.740 --> 00:27.340
We've already got the inputs containing div elements buttons and so on.

00:30.860 --> 00:39.290
So starting with the logging farm let's add these classes not changing any of the h.t. email at all.

00:43.110 --> 00:47.310
In the browser that's transformed the log in page.

00:48.420 --> 00:49.810
If I log in.

00:52.030 --> 00:57.680
The other farm we've got is the article farm in the admen section.

01:00.320 --> 01:07.950
This file is shared between the new article and edit article pages and is in the a.p. it includes folder.

01:08.510 --> 01:13.200
Let's add the styles to the current elements as we just did for the luggin farm.

01:18.440 --> 01:21.650
Far check boxes and their associated labels.

01:21.710 --> 01:24.160
We have to add different classes.

01:27.540 --> 01:30.620
So let's add those to the category checkboxes.

01:35.330 --> 01:42.350
And in the browser the form looks much better in the admin index.

01:42.350 --> 01:47.030
We've got a table which doesn't have any styling yet.

01:49.190 --> 01:55.140
Again we can style the table by adding a simple class to the table element.

01:58.020 --> 02:00.860
So when we add that in the admin index.

02:04.180 --> 02:08.210
The table gets the default bootstrap styling.

02:13.140 --> 02:22.460
There are many more options for styling tables and farms but will keep it simple and just use the basics.

02:24.740 --> 02:31.340
Bootstrap provides many components several of which I am sure would be useful in this a.m.s such as

02:31.340 --> 02:32.020
this.

02:32.060 --> 02:34.790
So I encourage you to try them out.

02:34.910 --> 02:40.610
And of course all of this without having to write any C Ss at all.
