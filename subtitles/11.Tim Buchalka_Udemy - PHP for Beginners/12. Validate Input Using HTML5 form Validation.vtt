00:04.390 --> 00:09.550
Previously in this section we looked at farm inputs of different types.

00:09.550 --> 00:16.540
In addition to changing the keyboard on mobile devices we saw specifying inputs of these types is used

00:16.540 --> 00:18.850
in farm validation.

00:18.850 --> 00:22.580
For example here in this farm we have inputs of.

00:22.630 --> 00:25.870
Email you are well and no

00:28.540 --> 00:29.490
in the browser.

00:29.530 --> 00:37.570
If we enter values into these fields that dont match their types and we try and submit the form we get

00:37.600 --> 00:40.040
the validation error message.

00:40.090 --> 00:43.660
In addition the fields are highlighted in red.

00:44.170 --> 00:46.750
If I correct the value in the email field

00:49.630 --> 00:56.860
so that its a valid email address the red highlight goes and if I try submit the farm again we get a

00:56.860 --> 01:00.870
validation error on the next field that you are L..

01:01.060 --> 01:02.860
If I enter a valid U R L

01:08.020 --> 01:11.210
then we get the next error message.

01:11.320 --> 01:14.840
If I fix this one so that its a number.

01:15.280 --> 01:22.510
The red highlight is gone and we can submit the farm h.t. email farm validation works by showing each

01:22.510 --> 01:24.670
validation error message in turn.

01:24.680 --> 01:28.380
Then tell the farm is valid only when the farm is valid.

01:28.420 --> 01:30.590
Will that browse and let you submit it.

01:33.420 --> 01:40.860
Email inputs are validated for a rudimentary email format that it contains the at sign no spaces and

01:40.860 --> 01:42.960
so on.

01:43.200 --> 01:50.400
You are well inputs are validated for a valid you are l including the protocol and no inputs are validated

01:50.550 --> 01:55.470
for a valid number for no inputs.

01:55.470 --> 02:03.060
We can also specify the min and max attributes to specify a minimum and maximum value that the control

02:03.060 --> 02:04.570
will accept.

02:07.420 --> 02:12.710
If we add these to the number in part like that.

02:13.600 --> 02:20.290
Now in the browser if we try and insert a number that's outside this range we get a validation error

02:20.290 --> 02:24.550
message if we correct it.

02:24.550 --> 02:28.650
The validation passes and we can submit the farm.

02:30.910 --> 02:35.710
You might have noticed that we just submitted the farm without a valid email address.

02:35.720 --> 02:42.880
While you are out in these fields by default these inputs are only validated if a value is supplied

02:43.360 --> 02:49.120
an empty value is accepted as valid.

02:49.270 --> 02:55.050
We can change this by adding the required attribute like that.

02:57.540 --> 03:04.560
Now in the browser if we try and submit the farm we're shown a message saying we need to supply a value

03:04.800 --> 03:07.730
for this field.

03:07.730 --> 03:13.650
The email validation still works but this is now also a required field.

03:17.180 --> 03:23.560
In addition to the built in validation for emails your URLs and numbers we can specify that a value

03:23.810 --> 03:29.560
must match a specific pattern with this text input at the top.

03:29.690 --> 03:33.320
Let's add a pattern attribute to it.

03:33.560 --> 03:39.280
And in here we specify a pattern using a regular expression.

03:40.750 --> 03:46.600
This website lists many common regular expression patterns for validation that you can just copy and

03:46.600 --> 03:47.350
paste.

03:47.680 --> 03:53.120
For example let's find the pattern for a UK postcode.

03:54.160 --> 03:55.960
All we need to do is copy this

03:59.470 --> 04:04.740
and paste it into the pattern attribute of our input like that.

04:08.740 --> 04:18.010
In the browser if we put an invalid UK postcode in here and then try and submit the farm we get a message

04:18.010 --> 04:21.740
saying please match the requested format.

04:23.120 --> 04:32.270
We can change this message using the title attribute of the input like that.

04:32.270 --> 04:40.760
Now if I put in an invalid value and try and submit the form then we see the custom message.

04:41.390 --> 04:44.210
If we enter a valid UK postcode.

04:46.730 --> 04:53.540
Then the validation passes the pattern attribute works for text search.

04:53.570 --> 04:57.250
You have I'll tell email and password fields.

05:00.680 --> 05:07.700
Previously you had to use javascript to validate a farm but nowadays H team L5 validation is supported

05:07.730 --> 05:11.930
in most modern browsers.

05:12.140 --> 05:18.590
One aspect that is difficult to change however is how the error messages are styled and the actual text

05:18.830 --> 05:20.350
of the message.

05:20.360 --> 05:26.630
These are hard coded into the browser and depend on which browser you are using the operating system

05:26.660 --> 05:29.420
and its default language.

05:31.030 --> 05:37.420
It is possible to change the text of the messages using the set custom validity function in javascript.

05:37.600 --> 05:43.200
But if you're going to be using javascript Anyway there are better options for farm validation that

05:43.210 --> 05:44.260
will see later on

05:47.110 --> 05:51.130
farms in HS team L5 validated by default.

05:51.130 --> 05:56.890
If you want to disable this for example if you want to use the various input types that change the keyboard

05:56.890 --> 06:02.540
on a mobile device but you don't want the input in them to be validated then you can add the.

06:02.550 --> 06:06.850
Now validate attribute to the form element.

06:09.700 --> 06:17.710
Now in the browser the validation is disabled but on a mobile device the email you email and no inputs

06:18.010 --> 06:21.480
will show the changes to the keyboard that we saw earlier.
