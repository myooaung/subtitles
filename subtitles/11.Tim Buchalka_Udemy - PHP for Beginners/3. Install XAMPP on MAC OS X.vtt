00:05.100 --> 00:08.890
In his video we go to install X EP on a Mac.

00:09.210 --> 00:15.090
So go to the XM website petchey friends dot org and click on that download.

00:17.070 --> 00:19.620
Scroll down to the Mac section.

00:20.730 --> 00:27.490
From here we want to select the latest version of HP which in this case is seven point to point to and

00:27.570 --> 00:30.560
make sure you don't choose the VM option.

00:30.810 --> 00:33.730
In some situations that can actually be unstable.

00:33.750 --> 00:37.940
In in my testing caused one of my Macs to reboot everytime I try to use it.

00:38.130 --> 00:42.750
So for that reason I suggest we install the native version which is this one here.

00:45.850 --> 00:47.370
Save the download.

00:49.410 --> 00:53.400
This will take a short while depending on the speed of your Internet connection.

00:57.300 --> 01:01.400
Once it's finished open up the downloaded DMV file.

01:06.750 --> 01:11.870
Is going to bring this to the middle double click to start the Excel installation.

01:12.150 --> 01:16.880
If this dialogue pops up click on Open into your password.

01:22.510 --> 01:26.400
And we know in the set up was a record next.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.630
He can leave the defaults there.

01:29.890 --> 01:30.940
Click on next.

01:31.960 --> 01:37.390
He can see the installation folder that it's apple been stored to click on Next.

01:37.420 --> 01:39.610
I'm going to check the learn more about it.

01:39.610 --> 01:43.740
NAMI for exam because we don't need to do that at this point.

01:43.830 --> 01:44.750
Context.

01:46.060 --> 01:48.080
Click on next to start the installation.

01:48.090 --> 01:49.700
I say up on your computer.

01:52.730 --> 01:56.950
This will take a few minutes a game depending on your computer and how fast it is.

02:01.500 --> 02:07.300
And eventually the XM set up wizard completes I'm going to lead the checkbox on so that we can launch

02:07.300 --> 02:08.330
checks out.

02:08.360 --> 02:09.410
Click on finish.

02:12.240 --> 02:19.220
We can close down jail except install and you should see XM showing on your screen.

02:19.920 --> 02:26.190
Next we want to click on Message servers and you can see that the Apache Web server is running.

02:26.220 --> 02:29.690
Click on my cicle dollar base and click on start for that as well.

02:31.590 --> 02:33.930
It's my caecal database is now running.

02:33.970 --> 02:38.770
So the next thing we need to do is configure a folder where we are going to store the page.

02:38.770 --> 02:43.400
Peace Groups for this cause so to do that we can open finder.

02:46.770 --> 02:50.700
I'm going to put mine in the documents folder.

02:51.180 --> 02:55.560
I'm going to create a new folder and call it W W W.

02:56.550 --> 03:00.090
However you're free to install it in any folder you wish.

03:00.090 --> 03:07.020
Once we've done that we need to go back to the Apache Web server in the configuration file and update

03:07.020 --> 03:11.170
to pass other points to this new folder that we've just created.

03:11.210 --> 03:16.320
You know the easiest way to do that generally is because right click click on services.

03:16.440 --> 03:23.100
If you've got an option there to open in terminal Selecter if the option doesn't appear.

03:23.100 --> 03:25.770
Making sure that tough finder is checked.

03:25.770 --> 03:30.850
Come up here and click on finder services and services preferences.

03:33.160 --> 03:40.180
That will open up System Preferences and from there what we can do is scroll down and select a new terminal

03:40.240 --> 03:41.890
folder option.

03:41.890 --> 03:46.770
This is a once only set up and if we do that then close down system preferences.

03:46.870 --> 03:51.790
If you go back to where we were before and right click the folder and select services.

03:51.790 --> 03:54.340
We can now select new terminal at vohra.

03:56.510 --> 04:00.580
That opens a new terminal and we can top pwt.

04:01.370 --> 04:03.760
So give us the path that we've just created.

04:03.790 --> 04:11.640
So I'm going to copy that path with command say close down the terminal window a closed down finder.

04:12.290 --> 04:14.470
I'm going to go to a petchey Web server.

04:14.840 --> 04:22.460
I'm going to stop that wouldn't a stopped or configure this directory that contains scripts by clicking

04:22.460 --> 04:23.350
on configure.

04:25.670 --> 04:27.990
From there I'm going to click on Open com file.

04:29.740 --> 04:31.660
We got a warning but that's okay.

04:31.690 --> 04:33.440
Click on yes to continue.

04:36.290 --> 04:41.580
From there we've got this file which is the configuration file for petchey.

04:41.690 --> 04:48.430
We can do a search with command F for document.

04:49.130 --> 04:51.020
It's the second option there.

04:51.250 --> 04:57.200
The second match and I'm going to replace this first line the path within the double quotes for document

04:57.200 --> 05:00.960
root in a paste to my folder that I created.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.540
I'm going to do the same for the next line and the directories.

05:03.540 --> 05:05.190
Well in the double quotes.

05:06.370 --> 05:10.600
Placed in the path and click on done up here.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.190
I'm going to close the file.

05:15.490 --> 05:22.210
At this point our changes have been updated and I can click on start start the Apache Web server again.

05:23.590 --> 05:28.790
At this point the installation and configuration of example on the Mac is now complete.
