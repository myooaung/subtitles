00:05.210 --> 00:10.520
As we just saw astm Al is about marking up content to make it appear.

00:10.540 --> 00:13.750
Are acts in a certain way in the browser.

00:13.910 --> 00:21.800
We just added some astm old tags to some text to give us a bit of farm outing and lay out when we viewed

00:21.800 --> 00:24.340
it in the browser.

00:25.800 --> 00:32.090
However although Doing this will work to get a properly formed to email document.

00:32.090 --> 00:37.010
We need to add some additional elements to this code.

00:39.120 --> 00:45.620
An eight tier mail document is made up of a head section where we can provide general information.

00:45.630 --> 00:53.970
Our metter data about the document including its title the type of characters used and so on.

00:54.490 --> 00:59.490
Following this is the body section and this is where we put our content.

00:59.510 --> 01:02.870
Basically what we see in the browser.

01:05.540 --> 01:11.700
Let's add the various elements we need to structure this h to mail document properly.

01:11.870 --> 01:16.610
The first line of an extra email document is the doc type.

01:16.970 --> 01:23.990
While this really does is tells the browser that what follows is some h.t. email several years ago different

01:23.990 --> 01:30.590
doc types were used to tell the browser exactly what version of h.t. email was being used so that we

01:30.590 --> 01:35.180
could do useful things like barter Mattingly check for errors for example.

01:35.660 --> 01:44.510
However nowadays it's not really used it's just necessary to include it for everything to work properly.

01:44.540 --> 01:53.090
Next we need to add an H t e mail element around the rest of the code we have the opening tab here and

01:53.090 --> 01:55.420
the closing tag at the end.

01:55.430 --> 01:59.370
This is always the very last line of NHT mail document.

01:59.480 --> 02:02.820
Nothing should go after this line.

02:02.870 --> 02:10.300
This is commonly referred to as the root element and it wraps all the content on the entire page.

02:10.550 --> 02:14.260
Then let's add the head section.

02:14.330 --> 02:21.740
This comes immediately after the h.t. Amount opening tag here will leave it empty for now.

02:21.950 --> 02:28.880
Then the body section which wraps the content the body element opening.

02:28.880 --> 02:36.130
Tag always comes immediately after the head element closing tag with no spaces in between.

02:36.470 --> 02:42.540
And the body closing tag always comes right before the s t r l closing tack.

02:45.140 --> 02:49.400
If we look at this in the browser we can see that nothing has changed.

02:49.400 --> 02:53.470
All we've done is added some information about the document itself.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.640
While we're in the browser.

02:55.700 --> 03:03.380
Note that the title of the page which is what is shown here in the top of the tab by default displays

03:03.380 --> 03:05.390
the current address of the page

03:08.390 --> 03:10.460
to change the pages title.

03:10.460 --> 03:16.340
We need to add a title element in the header section.

03:16.340 --> 03:22.040
You can put any text you like in the title as long as it's just text.

03:22.040 --> 03:25.360
Apart from the head and body tags themselves.

03:25.520 --> 03:28.350
If you're enclosing one element inside another.

03:28.520 --> 03:34.010
It's good practice to indent them like this so it's easier to read.

03:36.970 --> 03:38.050
Now in the browser.

03:38.050 --> 03:44.470
The title is shown in the tab at the top and it's also what you used to describe the page.

03:44.530 --> 03:52.780
When you add a bookmark favourites the text we've got at the moment just contains letters from what

03:52.780 --> 03:55.900
you might call the English alphabet.

03:55.910 --> 04:01.740
However let's add a new paragraph containing some different characters.

04:01.750 --> 04:03.890
For example in Spanish.

04:05.520 --> 04:14.490
If we look at this in a browser instead of the text we wrote we get these strange unintelligible characters

04:15.720 --> 04:22.230
by default an H timal document only understands characters in the English alphabet.

04:22.230 --> 04:25.630
This is called the character set of a document.

04:26.010 --> 04:32.430
However there are many more characters that we might want to use in a web page from languages from all

04:32.430 --> 04:34.970
over the world.

04:35.580 --> 04:40.890
To fix this we need to set the character set of our AITs to email document.

04:40.920 --> 04:50.160
We do this in the head section by adding a metter element with the charset attribute sets to a value

04:50.160 --> 04:52.170
of utf 8.

04:52.260 --> 04:59.480
This is a character set that includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages.

04:59.700 --> 05:04.850
Even if you're only planning to have your website in English there's no reason not to set this.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.170
And it can help avoid problems later on

05:10.170 --> 05:11.180
with this set.

05:11.190 --> 05:16.150
Now in the browser the accented characters appear as they should.

05:21.330 --> 05:29.240
Finally in this lecture I just want to mention this Web site which is an excellent searchable reference.

05:29.340 --> 05:34.000
If you need help with the various eight team elements and their attributes.
