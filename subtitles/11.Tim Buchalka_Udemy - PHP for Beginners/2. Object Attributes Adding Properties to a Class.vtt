00:04.460 --> 00:07.920
At the moment this is an empty class definition.

00:08.000 --> 00:17.300
And even though we can create objects of this class they're not much use as there's nothing in them.

00:17.300 --> 00:22.130
Objects of a class have certain attributes of properties.

00:22.340 --> 00:33.500
For example the user has a username maybe an email address and so on a book has a title an Arthur an

00:33.740 --> 00:37.390
S B encode and so on.

00:39.350 --> 00:48.860
Let's add some properties to our Item class an item has a name and a description.

00:48.860 --> 00:54.080
Properties are declared as variables inside the class definition.

00:54.080 --> 01:01.220
The public keyword is used to set the visibility of the property will learn more about visibility chartley

01:02.650 --> 01:09.860
properties are just variables that are associated to an individual object so we can set the value of

01:09.860 --> 01:17.360
a property like this to access a property of an object.

01:17.360 --> 01:22.000
We use it dash and the greater than symbol.

01:24.930 --> 01:30.700
If we run this cold in the browser we can see the two properties that have been defined.

01:30.750 --> 01:37.190
The name has been set to the string example and the description property is null.

01:37.260 --> 01:42.740
If you don't specify a value for a property by default it's set to NULL.

01:45.710 --> 01:49.380
We can read the value of a property in the same way.

01:49.430 --> 01:58.850
So if I change this vadon line to just print out the value of the name property like that when we run

01:58.850 --> 02:02.000
the code that's what we get.

02:04.210 --> 02:11.380
When we declare a property in the class we can optionally give it a default value like this.

02:11.380 --> 02:16.460
If we don't do this then the default value for the property is null.

02:18.760 --> 02:27.250
Let's change the vadon line to print out the description instead like that and then when we won the

02:27.250 --> 02:31.180
cold we see the default value of the property.

02:34.480 --> 02:42.220
As with any variable you can overwrite this default value like this.

02:42.220 --> 02:48.360
What we've done here is define some properties and then we've used these properties when we created

02:48.370 --> 02:50.000
an object.

02:50.000 --> 02:50.470
P H.

02:50.470 --> 02:53.840
P actually doesn't require you to do this however.

02:54.190 --> 03:03.220
For example let's assign a value to a property that we haven't defined and then change the vadon line

03:03.490 --> 03:09.550
to print out the whole object like that.

03:10.480 --> 03:16.180
When we run this code there are no errors and we set a price property on the object.

03:16.330 --> 03:20.260
Even though we didn't declare it in the class as a property.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.590
I'll thorpey HP lets you do this.

03:25.590 --> 03:28.050
It's not generally a good idea.

03:28.350 --> 03:36.270
It's best to declare any property you want to use first in the class definition of LP P won't show you

03:36.270 --> 03:41.460
an error just as we saw some code editors will actually complain about this.

03:41.460 --> 03:43.670
If you don't declare the properties first.
