00:05.290 --> 00:13.330
We've added classes for articles and users each of which have a corresponding table in the database.

00:14.020 --> 00:21.210
However classes don't have to necessarily have a database table associated with them here in the off

00:21.230 --> 00:27.100
include We're declaring a function that returns whether a user is logged in or not.

00:27.100 --> 00:35.080
Let's move this into a class instead which will allow us to argue now is our code better.

00:35.080 --> 00:41.860
Let's create a new class file in the classes folder called off P H.

00:41.850 --> 00:43.550
P..

00:43.900 --> 00:46.580
The class will be called off.

00:47.980 --> 00:51.610
And let's take this function out of the arfe include

00:54.760 --> 01:00.200
and paste it in the new off class.

01:00.220 --> 01:07.570
This will be a public method and were not going to create an object of this class so I will make it

01:07.570 --> 01:09.880
static too.

01:10.510 --> 01:18.700
And let's not forget to add a p-h P duck comments block to our class.

01:18.820 --> 01:23.480
We're calling the is logged in function from the index page.

01:23.500 --> 01:31.900
Let's change this to call the is logged in method of the arfe class instead first will change this require

01:32.290 --> 01:40.210
to load the class instead of the includes file and then when we call the function we'll prefix it with

01:40.210 --> 01:44.460
the class name which will call the static method.

01:47.740 --> 01:54.760
Let's give that a try the message and links shown on the index page at different depending on whether

01:54.760 --> 01:56.450
we logged in or not.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.410
Were not currently logged in and if I do log in

02:02.980 --> 02:05.810
the message changes as expected.

02:09.590 --> 02:16.520
We're also calling the is logged in function on the new article page here so let's do the same.

02:16.520 --> 02:24.330
Change the Require to the class and prefix the method call with the class name.

02:27.900 --> 02:32.570
The method is called In the new article script to restrict access to the page.

02:32.580 --> 02:34.680
If the use isn't logged in.

02:34.920 --> 02:45.330
We're currently logged in so we can access the page if I log out the link isn't shown but if I enter

02:45.330 --> 02:49.100
the U R L directly.

02:51.510 --> 02:55.830
We're denied access to the page so this is working as before

02:59.100 --> 03:04.980
and now we've replaced this after P XP script in the includes folder with the class.

03:05.130 --> 03:07.550
We can safely delete it.
