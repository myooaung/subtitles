00:05.250 --> 00:12.720
We just saw how to conditionally executed code using an F statement which uses a boolean value to decide

00:12.720 --> 00:15.630
whether to run some cold or not.

00:15.690 --> 00:22.410
In addition to getting a billion value from a function we can also get these values by comparing one

00:22.410 --> 00:24.000
value to another

00:26.780 --> 00:27.750
in P HP.

00:27.840 --> 00:31.030
We have several comparison operators.

00:31.050 --> 00:36.170
We use these to see if two values are equal not equal.

00:36.360 --> 00:43.890
If one is bigger than the other and so on the result of comparing two values always results in a billion

00:43.890 --> 00:46.980
value of true are false.

00:50.410 --> 00:52.220
Let's look at an example.

00:52.600 --> 00:56.600
We'll begin by comparing two values to see if they're equal.

00:57.010 --> 01:01.940
We do this with two equal signs like this.

01:02.230 --> 01:13.370
If we look at this in the browser we get false because three clearly does not equal four.

01:14.350 --> 01:17.500
If we change this so that the values are equal

01:20.830 --> 01:29.510
then in the browser we get true because 4 is equal to 4.

01:32.480 --> 01:39.530
In addition to comparing two values for equality we can also compare two values to see if they aren't

01:39.590 --> 01:41.340
equal to each other.

01:41.690 --> 01:49.330
The result of using this operator is true if the values aren't equal and false if they are.

01:50.120 --> 01:53.570
We can see if one value is less than another.

01:53.930 --> 02:02.330
If a value is greater than another if one is less than are equal to another and if a value is greater

02:02.330 --> 02:04.850
than are equal to another

02:07.610 --> 02:13.220
there are a couple of other comparison operators but will look at those later.

02:15.630 --> 02:17.510
Let's look at another example.

02:17.730 --> 02:28.790
First let's add a variable and then if statement that uses the result of a comparison as its condition.

02:29.250 --> 02:37.470
So here if the value of this variable is equal to twenty one will print out this message and if it's

02:37.470 --> 02:43.890
not it will print out this message when we run this code.

02:44.400 --> 02:49.500
We get the first message because the value is indeed equal to twenty one.

02:51.910 --> 02:54.750
Let's try another comparison operator.

02:54.790 --> 02:59.660
We'll change it to the not equal operator like that.

03:01.670 --> 03:05.860
Now in the browser we get false.

03:08.050 --> 03:14.350
This is because 21 not being equal to 21 is false.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.410
Let's try another one.

03:17.490 --> 03:25.080
If we change the age to 18 for example and the operator to less than

03:28.950 --> 03:37.500
now in the browser we get true because 18 is less than 21.

03:40.170 --> 03:43.230
Let's change the value of the variable back to 21

03:46.230 --> 03:46.870
and try the.

03:46.890 --> 03:50.620
Greater than operator.

03:52.140 --> 04:00.200
Now in the browser we get false because 21 isn't greater than 21.

04:01.530 --> 04:11.100
But if we change it to the Greater than are equal to operator then we get true because 21 isn't greater

04:11.100 --> 04:14.410
than but it is equal to twenty one.

04:17.090 --> 04:24.650
So by using these comparison operators we can compare two values to get a boolean result that we can

04:24.650 --> 04:27.440
then use in control structures.
