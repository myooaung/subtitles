Now that we now have to require classes automatically we can replace all of these require statements

00:11.370 --> 00:13.140
with an artful loader.

00:13.860 --> 00:21.090
However we're requiring classes in most of our scripts so let's register the artle load code in a separate

00:21.090 --> 00:28.830
script in the includes folder and then we can include that script in all of our scripts.

00:28.830 --> 00:34.770
So that's create a new file in the includes folder called in it up here.

00:35.850 --> 00:44.650
I want to call it art all load up it p for reasons we'll see in a moment in here we'll call the art

00:44.650 --> 00:46.530
aloud register function.

00:46.950 --> 00:54.660
And inside the artle Load function will simply require the file with the name of the class in the classes

00:54.660 --> 00:57.180
folder.

00:57.420 --> 01:06.090
Then in the index file we can remove these lines where we are requiring individual class files and load

01:06.120 --> 01:09.040
the new it script instead.

01:13.180 --> 01:18.670
When we look at the index page in the browser it still works meaning the classes have been required

01:18.700 --> 01:22.070
after Mattingly as and when we needed them.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.330
We can do the same in the rest of the scripts now.

01:27.340 --> 01:36.820
So here in the new article script we can replace all these require lines with just the init script before

01:36.820 --> 01:37.880
we continue.

01:37.880 --> 01:45.640
However note that in here we're calling session start to start by resume the session which we're also

01:45.640 --> 01:53.770
doing in the index script and in the luggin and logout scripts.

01:57.800 --> 02:03.170
Anywhere we want to be able to use the session file logging in are storing other data.

02:03.170 --> 02:12.410
We need to call session start so that's move this to the init to script to will call it after we register

02:12.410 --> 02:16.760
the artle loader like that.

02:16.760 --> 02:25.010
And while we're here let's add a comment block at the top so we know what this script is doing.

02:25.340 --> 02:32.680
This is why I didn't call the script after all load up with HP as were using it to do general initializations.

02:35.410 --> 02:44.170
Now we can remove the session start line from the index page as it's now in the init script and we can

02:44.170 --> 02:47.640
do that as well in the new article script.

02:49.060 --> 02:53.850
And we can do the same in the log in script.

02:55.000 --> 03:03.310
Replace all the requires And session start with the init script and also the same in the lock out script

03:05.260 --> 03:07.300
in the edit script.

03:07.300 --> 03:10.990
Just the requires and the same.

03:10.990 --> 03:17.290
In the article and the delete articles scripts.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.760
Let's make sure everything still works.

03:23.890 --> 03:28.630
The index page still works as before then let's log in

03:31.750 --> 03:34.770
then we'll create a new article.

03:37.170 --> 03:39.890
Which we can then edit.

03:43.150 --> 03:45.580
And then will delete it.

03:46.450 --> 03:48.780
And finally will log out.

03:49.450 --> 03:56.740
Everything is working as before but now our code is much cleaner as work.

03:56.760 --> 04:02.490
After loading all our classes instead of having lots of individual required statements.
