00:05.130 --> 00:10.370
No Iran we extracted out the database connection cold into this separate file.

00:10.370 --> 00:18.030
We did this to remove repeated code in our new article script when the form is submitted.

00:18.080 --> 00:21.880
We're requiring this file to connect to the database.

00:21.980 --> 00:28.250
We then use the connection variable created in that file to execute the ESC you l that insert the new

00:28.250 --> 00:29.820
record.

00:29.870 --> 00:37.250
However having a required statement that includes just p s p code inside a conditional like this isn't

00:37.250 --> 00:44.080
generally a good idea as it can become difficult to maintain and follow what's happening with the code.

00:44.150 --> 00:51.390
So let's move this line to the top like that.

00:51.500 --> 00:58.790
Now a page still works but when we first load this page we don't need to connect to the database only

00:58.790 --> 01:03.740
when the form is submitted.

01:03.740 --> 01:10.550
This is because the code in this included file is evaluated and executed immediately as though it were

01:10.550 --> 01:13.560
part of the page it was included in.

01:13.590 --> 01:16.830
There's also another problem with this in here.

01:16.840 --> 01:22.350
We're declaring a variable that were then using in this script.

01:23.210 --> 01:29.520
This is a bad idea because in this script it's not clear where this variable has come from.

01:29.540 --> 01:33.780
We can solve both these problems by creating a function.

01:34.970 --> 01:43.850
So in our database script let's change this playing code to a function and then in the new article script

01:44.240 --> 01:49.760
call this function here like that.

01:49.760 --> 01:56.720
Note that now this code is inside a function when its included are required.

01:56.720 --> 02:00.650
The code inside the function isn't executed straight away.

02:00.650 --> 02:02.960
It's executed when the function is called

02:06.170 --> 02:12.410
in the browser when we first load the page were no longer unnecessarily connecting to the database.

02:12.410 --> 02:21.010
When I submit the FA however we get an error saying the connection variable is undefined.

02:21.350 --> 02:24.650
This variable is defined inside this function.

02:24.650 --> 02:30.470
However variables defined inside functions are limited to use with in those functions.

02:30.470 --> 02:33.020
This is known as variable scope.

02:33.020 --> 02:38.090
We can't access this variable outside this function to fix the error.

02:38.240 --> 02:40.740
We need to return this value.

02:41.300 --> 02:50.660
Then in the new article script will assign the function's return value to a variable.

02:53.360 --> 02:58.910
Now in the browser when we submit the farm the error is fixed.

03:01.740 --> 03:06.780
Now that we've changed the database include we've broken our existing pages.

03:09.510 --> 03:12.740
Let's fix these first at the top of the index page.

03:12.750 --> 03:20.450
We need to call the Get dbe function like that and the same and the individual article page.

03:23.220 --> 03:27.270
This fixes our index and article pages.

03:29.960 --> 03:34.420
Finally let's add a p h p doc comment to this function.

03:36.330 --> 03:41.340
This includes a description of what the function does and specifies what it returns.

03:41.370 --> 03:43.680
By using the at return tack.

03:44.760 --> 03:49.470
If you're using an integrated development environments are ideas that supports it.

03:49.470 --> 03:54.010
Adding this comment will help for things like after completion when your coding.
