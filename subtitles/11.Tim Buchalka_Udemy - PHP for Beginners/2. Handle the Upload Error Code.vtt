00:05.540 --> 00:14.780
When we upload a file one of the elements in the array is an error code.

00:16.810 --> 00:22.230
The error code will be a number which corresponds to one of these constants.

00:22.570 --> 00:29.670
If it's 0 0 this error o k. Constant then the file was uploaded successfully.

00:30.150 --> 00:31.810
If it's not 0.

00:31.900 --> 00:37.800
In other words one of these other values then an error has occurred with the upload.

00:37.930 --> 00:43.900
For example if the value is 4 then no file was uploaded.

00:47.090 --> 00:55.430
So if I submit the farm without selecting a file in the file input control first the error code is indeed

00:55.670 --> 00:57.060
for.

01:01.020 --> 01:04.480
As there are various error codes to take into account.

01:04.640 --> 01:12.980
Let's add a switch statement passing in the value of the error code from the files array.

01:13.190 --> 01:20.580
If the code matches the error O K constant then we don't actually want to do anything.

01:20.630 --> 01:28.350
The upload is okay so we'll just break out of the switch if the error matches the no file.

01:28.370 --> 01:29.550
Constant.

01:30.140 --> 01:32.990
Then we want to handle that.

01:33.110 --> 01:38.330
We're going to be performing several steps in this section to validate the uploaded file.

01:38.480 --> 01:43.670
So let's throw an exception here with a custom message.

01:43.670 --> 01:48.390
Then later on we can catch any exceptions thrown and handled them.

01:48.950 --> 01:52.290
Let's not forget to break out of this case block.

01:55.660 --> 02:00.060
Now we could add a case block for each possible error code.

02:00.280 --> 02:03.760
But a lot of these error conditions are unlikely.

02:03.850 --> 02:10.540
Plus we also want the default case to handle any additional error codes that might be added to p s p

02:10.840 --> 02:13.410
at a later date.

02:14.850 --> 02:23.470
So to handle the rest of these error codes Let's add a default case where will throw an exception with

02:23.530 --> 02:30.080
a generic error message then to handle the exceptions thrown.

02:30.310 --> 02:39.760
Let's wrap the switch statement in a tribal arc with a corresponding catch block where we'll just print

02:39.760 --> 02:42.530
out the error message for now.

02:45.850 --> 02:53.910
So now if I submit the farm without selecting a file we get the error message printed out.

02:54.070 --> 03:01.350
If I do select a file and submit the form no error message is shown.
