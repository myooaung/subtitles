00:04.500 --> 00:09.040
We just converted the off include into a class.

00:09.180 --> 00:13.650
We've also got an include that contains this redirect function.

00:13.770 --> 00:19.950
Let's do the same and convert this to a class to first will copy this function

00:23.100 --> 00:31.830
and then create a new class file in the crisis folder called you an L duck p s p will add the class

00:31.830 --> 00:37.500
definition and paste in the function.

00:38.040 --> 00:42.750
Again this will be a public static method.

00:43.110 --> 00:48.070
And finally in this class let's add a dot block at the top.

00:51.100 --> 00:57.610
We're using the redirect function in several pages which we need to convert to use the new class now

00:58.600 --> 01:01.070
first in the new article script.

01:01.090 --> 01:11.160
Let's change to require to include the class instead and then add the class to the method call.

01:12.070 --> 01:15.160
We'll do the same in the edit page.

01:15.400 --> 01:21.310
First the require and then the method call.

01:24.140 --> 01:32.600
Then the same in the delete page they require and then down here the method call

01:35.480 --> 01:41.090
then will make the same changes in the in page.

01:41.090 --> 01:45.950
Here and here and in the logout page

01:48.830 --> 01:53.110
here in the require and here for the method call.

01:55.830 --> 01:58.860
Let's make sure that everything still works.

01:59.100 --> 02:01.520
First let's log in.

02:04.680 --> 02:07.940
Then we'll create a new article.

02:11.480 --> 02:16.690
We'll edit it.

02:18.860 --> 02:21.850
And then delete it.

02:23.090 --> 02:26.230
And finally will log out.

02:26.390 --> 02:30.540
These are all redirect successfully so it's all still working.

02:30.590 --> 02:31.970
As before.

02:34.490 --> 02:38.210
And now we're no longer using the U R L include.

02:38.210 --> 02:40.630
We can safely delete it.
