00:05.620 --> 00:11.830
We've moved the edit and delete scripts to the abdomen area but we haven't moved the new article script

00:11.860 --> 00:12.510
yet.

00:12.760 --> 00:18.300
So when we click on the new article link we get a page not found error.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.190
Let's move this page to the admin folder.

00:28.930 --> 00:33.080
And as with the edit and delete scripts we need to change.

00:33.100 --> 00:44.950
These require lines the init scripts the database include the header and the footer

00:47.770 --> 00:49.810
in the edit page.

00:49.810 --> 00:55.550
We've also changed the line where we're requiring this shared article farm.

00:56.230 --> 01:03.280
However we are only sharing this farm between the edit page and the new page which are both in the admin

01:03.280 --> 01:09.330
folder so instead of leaving this page in The include folder in The Root.

01:09.870 --> 01:13.540
Let's create a new includes folder inside the admin folder

01:20.350 --> 01:25.530
and then move the form include into this new folder.

01:29.060 --> 01:35.080
Well also copy the h.t. Access file.

01:37.040 --> 01:41.520
To restrict direct access to the files in this folder.

01:43.960 --> 01:51.770
Now if we click on the new article link that page works and we can create the new article.

01:52.690 --> 01:59.920
When I click save though we are redirected to the show page outside of the admin area.

02:02.560 --> 02:09.800
To fix this we need to add the admin folder to the path we're redirecting to like that.

02:12.820 --> 02:15.190
Now when we create a new article

02:17.730 --> 02:22.850
we're redirected correctly to the show article page in the admin folder.

02:23.440 --> 02:27.820
When we moved to the article farm include into the admin folder.

02:27.830 --> 02:32.450
However we broke the edit article page.

02:34.440 --> 02:41.460
This is because previously we changed the edits article script to include the file in its original location

02:42.210 --> 02:44.470
so that's changed this back.

02:48.570 --> 02:52.590
And now the edit page is working again.

02:52.590 --> 03:00.720
So now to administer articles we have an admin area that is only accessible if a user is logged in on

03:00.720 --> 03:07.340
authenticated users can only see the list of articles and the individual article pages.
