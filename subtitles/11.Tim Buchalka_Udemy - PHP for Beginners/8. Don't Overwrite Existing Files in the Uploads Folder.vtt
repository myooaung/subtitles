00:05.780 --> 00:14.340
The uploads folder currently contains one file and note the last modified time.

00:14.810 --> 00:18.010
If I upload a file with the same name.

00:20.680 --> 00:24.200
Then the existing file with the same name is overwritten.

00:24.400 --> 00:27.400
Note how the time has changed.

00:27.400 --> 00:33.970
We don't want this because someone could upload a file with the same name as an existing file overwriting

00:33.970 --> 00:35.130
its contents.

00:38.660 --> 00:43.630
The move uploaded file function overrides any existing files.

00:43.730 --> 00:48.560
So before we do this we need to check if the file exists.

00:49.130 --> 00:51.700
We can do this using the file exists.

00:51.700 --> 00:53.040
Function.

00:55.010 --> 01:01.790
If the file does exist instead of changing it to something random Let's add a numeric suffix to the

01:01.790 --> 01:07.490
original file name we'll add this before the file extension.

01:07.520 --> 01:13.350
This file could also exist however so we need to keep checking if these files exist.

01:13.520 --> 01:20.000
Adding in incrementing numeric suffix until we find a file name that doesn't exist so that we can use

01:20.000 --> 01:22.620
that to move the uploaded file.

01:25.890 --> 01:32.990
We can do this using a while loop this checks to see if the file exists.

01:33.180 --> 01:39.750
If it doesn't then we don't enter this while loop and the file is moved to the uploads folder with the

01:39.750 --> 01:42.040
original file name.

01:42.150 --> 01:48.230
If it does exist we need to add to the numeric suffix to the file name.

01:48.630 --> 01:51.310
We're creating the original file name but here.

01:51.540 --> 01:58.060
So let's copy this line and paste it inside the while loop.

01:59.260 --> 02:05.210
Before we enter the loop will initialize a variable to the integer value of 1.

02:05.470 --> 02:11.680
Then when we create the file name inside the loop will insert a hyphen and this value to the end of

02:11.680 --> 02:17.610
the file name before the period and the file extension.

02:18.820 --> 02:23.350
Then we create the full path to the destination as before.

02:23.470 --> 02:26.210
And finally in comments the counter.

02:29.730 --> 02:36.000
Let's give that a try starting with this file in the uploads folder.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.010
If I upload a file with the same name.

02:44.170 --> 02:51.660
The file has been loaded with a numeric suffix and the original file hasn't been overwritten.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.280
If I upload it again.

02:58.420 --> 03:02.140
Then again it's saved with a different file name.
