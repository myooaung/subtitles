00:05.220 --> 00:11.820
When we load the delete article script we're calling the get article function which is in the article

00:11.880 --> 00:19.170
include here we also call this function in the script that shows an individual article and the script

00:19.200 --> 00:28.910
for editing an article this function uses this Eskew L. select star from the article table.

00:32.760 --> 00:38.210
As we learned earlier so that star selects all the columns from the table.

00:40.890 --> 00:48.540
We want to do this when we view an article when we edit it as we need all the columns.

00:48.540 --> 00:53.860
However when we're deleting an article we dont want all these columns.

00:53.880 --> 01:00.870
In fact we only want to check that the record exists with that I.D. So its enough to select only the

01:00.870 --> 01:02.580
I.D. column.

01:05.260 --> 01:10.140
Instead of selecting all the columns with an asterisk are a wildcard.

01:10.450 --> 01:14.220
We can specify a list of columns in the select statement.

01:17.580 --> 01:24.630
So let's add an argument to the get article function that will take a list of the columns we want to

01:24.630 --> 01:30.250
select so that we don't have to change the code where are we calling this.

01:30.330 --> 01:39.090
Let's add a default value to this argument which will select all the columns then let's replace the

01:39.090 --> 01:46.390
hard coded asterisk in the esky you Al with the value of this argument.

01:46.440 --> 01:53.010
So if we don't supply a value for this third argument it will default to selecting all the columns as

01:53.010 --> 01:54.320
before.

01:55.080 --> 02:02.330
Finally let's add this argument to our p-h HP duck comment block like that.

02:07.300 --> 02:13.280
So now in the delete script when we call this function we can pass in the third argument.

02:13.870 --> 02:22.480
So were only selecting the idae instead of all the columns now that were only selecting the idea column

02:22.960 --> 02:25.850
as were not using these variables anyway.

02:26.200 --> 02:29.880
We can get rid of them like that.

02:33.110 --> 02:43.340
In the browser viewing and editing an article still work as before and so does delete.

02:43.340 --> 02:50.720
However this time when we load the delete script we're not retrieving unnecessary data from the database.

02:53.470 --> 02:59.350
You'll probably come across some people who think select star should never be used but you should always

02:59.350 --> 03:02.410
list the columns you want in a select statement.

03:02.410 --> 03:04.930
This is mainly because of performance.

03:05.080 --> 03:12.070
Unless you want to use all the columns select star will be retrieving data you don't need getting data

03:12.070 --> 03:18.040
from the database uses network bandwidth and server memory so you could be slowing your script down

03:18.220 --> 03:20.770
by using resources you don't need.

03:21.310 --> 03:23.750
However I don't think it's all bad.

03:23.920 --> 03:29.500
If you're going to select all the columns anyway then there's no performance difference with using select

03:29.510 --> 03:33.460
star select and a list of all the columns.

03:36.470 --> 03:41.780
Now that we've completed the script for deleting an article we've implemented what's known as krudd

03:42.140 --> 03:47.650
ARE create read update and delete on our article table.

03:48.560 --> 03:55.790
We can create a new article with the new article script read articles with the index and individual

03:55.820 --> 04:03.050
articles scripts update with the edit script and delete with the delete script.

04:03.410 --> 04:09.700
These are the four basic operations that a website normally carries out on tables in the database.
