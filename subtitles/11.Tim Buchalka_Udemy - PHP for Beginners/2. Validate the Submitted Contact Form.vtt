00:05.580 --> 00:07.620
Now we have the contact farm.

00:07.620 --> 00:11.840
We need to add code to process the farm when it's submitted.

00:14.240 --> 00:20.310
As with other farms we're submitting using post and not specifying the action.

00:20.510 --> 00:23.250
So the farm is submitted to itself.

00:23.810 --> 00:31.670
So let's check with this at the top and then let's validate the values from the farm.

00:31.970 --> 00:34.270
Let's get them into variables.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.040
Then initialize an array to hold the validation error messages.

00:42.140 --> 00:50.000
Then we can validate the values we'll use the filter method with the email filter to validate the email

00:50.000 --> 00:51.430
address.

00:52.100 --> 00:54.530
Adding a message to the errors array.

00:54.620 --> 00:56.360
If it's invalid.

00:57.870 --> 01:05.060
Will validate that the subject isn't empty and the same for the message.

01:07.870 --> 01:14.720
Then if there are no validation errors we can send the email.

01:15.250 --> 01:20.710
First though we need to display the validation error messages if there are any.

01:21.400 --> 01:24.750
So before the form in the astm l..

01:24.970 --> 01:27.530
If the error is array isn't empty.

01:29.200 --> 01:37.530
We can loop around the errors in the array and display each error message inside an ordered list.

01:42.370 --> 01:50.400
Now if I submit an empty farm we see the validation error messages and if I enter some values.

01:53.150 --> 01:57.740
The field is validated correctly when the farm is redisplay.

01:57.740 --> 02:02.850
However the previously entered values aren't re displayed.

02:06.600 --> 02:07.650
To fix this.

02:07.680 --> 02:14.090
First let's initialize these variables to empty values at the top.

02:14.340 --> 02:18.590
Far when the page is first loaded and hasn't been submitted yet.

02:20.460 --> 02:21.320
Then in the.

02:21.320 --> 02:31.890
Value attributes of the e mail and subject fields we can display this value making sure we escaped the

02:31.890 --> 02:39.020
value using the astm special chars function as these could contain values entered by the user.

02:40.560 --> 02:44.380
Will do the same inside the text area element.

02:49.820 --> 02:58.880
Now if I enter a couple of values but leave one out when I submit the farm we see the validation message

02:59.240 --> 03:02.990
and the previously entered values I remembered.

03:07.530 --> 03:11.420
We always need to validate data on the server like this.

03:11.520 --> 03:15.720
But let's also do it in Javascript instead.

03:15.720 --> 03:20.640
First let's identify the farm by adding an idea.

03:23.470 --> 03:29.880
We'll use the j query validation plugin just as we did with the article farm.

03:30.040 --> 03:38.930
We'll start by calling the invalidate method on the form element and then we add validation rules.

03:39.070 --> 03:45.020
The email is required and should also be a valid email.

03:45.100 --> 03:51.090
The subject is a required field and so is the message.

03:56.110 --> 04:05.650
Now if I submit an empty farm we get the validation in the browser as I enter valid values.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.420
The farm is validated

04:10.900 --> 04:16.940
and the messages disappear when all is valid.

04:18.040 --> 04:23.720
We can submit the farm and the server side validation passes too.
