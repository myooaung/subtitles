00:05.530 --> 00:09.690
Once we load a file to the server we can process it.

00:09.880 --> 00:15.340
First let's restrict the size of files that can be uploaded.

00:16.950 --> 00:21.620
Before we check the size of the loaded file once it's on the server.

00:21.840 --> 00:29.890
P HP has a couple of settings that restricts the maximum size of data that can be sent to the server.

00:29.910 --> 00:35.920
If we add the P HP infeld function to the top of a script like this.

00:38.050 --> 00:44.030
When we view that page in a browser we're shown all the data about the server.

00:44.140 --> 00:48.330
There are two settings we need to look at.

00:52.590 --> 00:58.770
Post max size is the size limit for a farm submitted using the post method.

00:58.770 --> 01:06.480
This includes the contents of all input controls including text inputs file inputs and so on in a single

01:06.480 --> 01:16.070
farm upload Max file size is the size of the MIT for single files in a file input control.

01:16.350 --> 01:21.140
We're interested in the value in the first column and here for example.

01:21.140 --> 01:24.650
They're both set to 128 megabytes.

01:25.450 --> 01:27.080
If you need to change these.

01:27.240 --> 01:29.370
The best place is in the p h product.

01:29.370 --> 01:35.460
Any file itself and that is located here on the server.

01:35.460 --> 01:39.400
This will be different depending on your system.

01:39.420 --> 01:45.030
Bear in mind that these limits are for the entire server so you might not want to change them.

01:45.030 --> 01:47.500
If you are running more than one site.

01:49.980 --> 01:53.830
You probably have access to this file on your local machine.

01:53.880 --> 01:57.100
However on a life server you might not.

01:57.120 --> 02:01.290
There are a couple of options for changing this setting on a life server.

02:01.470 --> 02:05.110
If you don't have access to change P HP does any.

02:05.790 --> 02:14.700
Firstly you can do it in an ace to access file by putting p p value are P P Flag for the by the name

02:14.700 --> 02:18.600
of the setting and its new value.

02:18.600 --> 02:26.190
The second is to call the any set function from your P HP code again passing in the name of the setting

02:26.490 --> 02:28.980
and the desired value.

02:28.980 --> 02:31.470
I don't recommend this second method though.

02:31.580 --> 02:34.320
I asked changing server settings in p s p.

02:34.320 --> 02:39.890
Code can be difficult to debug when moving between servers.

02:42.510 --> 02:48.420
For example let's add an HD access file to the roots of the site.

02:49.410 --> 02:59.310
And in here put the p h p value directive to change the upload Max file size setting to 2 megabytes

03:01.260 --> 03:06.780
then before we try this in our upload script let's remove the P 8 p.

03:06.810 --> 03:09.870
Info line like that.

03:13.000 --> 03:22.510
So if I select a file that's greater than 2 megabytes and submit the form we get a message saying an

03:22.540 --> 03:26.790
error occurred and the error code is one.

03:29.140 --> 03:33.010
The error code being one corresponds to this constant.

03:33.130 --> 03:38.310
The uploaded file exceeds the value we just set in the P P.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.200
Any settings.

03:42.680 --> 03:50.620
So we can add a case for this error in the switch statement and throw an exception with a custom message.

03:54.530 --> 04:02.210
So now when I upload a file that's too large we get that message.

04:05.460 --> 04:10.990
Now earlier on we looked at two settings that restrict file upload sizes.

04:11.070 --> 04:18.210
We just changed the upload Max file size in an 80 access file to two megabytes and we cart the error

04:18.210 --> 04:20.780
that occurs if we upload a file.

04:20.850 --> 04:23.390
Bigger than this value.

04:23.430 --> 04:31.120
Watch what happens there when I upload a file that's bigger than the post max size value of 128 megabytes.

04:34.870 --> 04:45.820
If I select a very large file and submit the form we get a warning error an empty array which is the

04:45.820 --> 04:52.060
files away we're dumping out and an error saying there's an undefined index.

04:55.020 --> 05:00.600
Unfortunately we can't trap this error in our code in the same way as the other.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.770
Any setting.

05:02.100 --> 05:06.900
In fact we can't trap this error at all.

05:06.990 --> 05:13.370
This error is displayed because this setting display start-up errors is enabled.

05:13.400 --> 05:17.290
However this isn't normally disabled in production environments.

05:17.310 --> 05:18.800
Online servers.

05:18.990 --> 05:23.410
So all we have to worry about is the files array being empty.

05:26.340 --> 05:33.470
We can switch this setting off in the h.t. Access file like that.

05:33.470 --> 05:38.820
Then all we need to worry about is the files of a being empty.

05:38.820 --> 05:48.300
So before we start to use the array let's check it's not empty and if it is throw out an exception.

05:52.030 --> 05:58.050
So now if I try to upload a file that's bigger than the post max size value.

05:58.720 --> 06:03.050
We get the invalid upload message like that.

06:06.390 --> 06:13.680
I'll leave this h to access file here so that it's available in the downloadable code but in the rest

06:13.680 --> 06:14.370
of the lectures.

06:14.370 --> 06:20.910
In this section I'll remove it as I prefer to rely on the settings in the server's configuration file

06:21.270 --> 06:23.850
rather than setting them in here.
