00:05.180 --> 00:11.340
One of the most common database management systems used in web applications is my esky well.

00:12.140 --> 00:18.290
Traditionally this has often been the first relational database management system that web developers

00:18.290 --> 00:27.010
learn to use and there's still a lot of material available online on how to program HP with esky Well

00:28.500 --> 00:29.770
at the beginning of the course.

00:29.780 --> 00:32.290
We installed the exact package.

00:32.540 --> 00:39.800
This used to come with my esky well but nowadays the movie DV database management system is included

00:39.800 --> 00:41.850
instead.

00:42.230 --> 00:48.460
Maria dbe is a backwards compatible drop in replacement for my escudo.

00:48.500 --> 00:56.150
This means that all the miniscule databases software and HP code written to work with my esky well are

00:56.150 --> 00:59.770
a hundred percent compatible with me ADP.

01:00.440 --> 01:07.070
It was created by the original developers of my esky well as a fully free and open source alternative

01:07.340 --> 01:09.000
to my escudo.

01:12.260 --> 01:18.590
Before we can access the database server we need to make sure it's running in the access control panel

01:18.590 --> 01:19.820
in Windows.

01:19.820 --> 01:23.920
Which says my esky well even though it's actually miria d.b..

01:24.110 --> 01:27.800
They just haven't changed this label in the application.

01:27.980 --> 01:32.270
We need to make sure that this is green which means that it's running.

01:32.600 --> 01:41.600
If it's not you need to click on the start button to start it in Mac OSX the control panel looks something

01:41.600 --> 01:42.610
like this.

01:42.740 --> 01:49.780
And again it says my esky well but it is in fact miriad be and this icon needs to be green.

01:50.030 --> 01:55.360
If it's not running you need to click on this database line and click the start button.

01:57.760 --> 02:00.440
And it's the same in Linux.

02:04.290 --> 02:08.690
To administer my esky Well arm a vdb We're going to use p h.

02:08.700 --> 02:08.980
P.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.460
My admin.

02:10.560 --> 02:18.540
This is a free software package written in P HP that runs in a browser it comes included with x cemp

02:20.610 --> 02:24.690
to access a local installation of p p my admin.

02:24.750 --> 02:30.780
We go to the eurail local host slash thp my admin

02:33.570 --> 02:34.200
on the right.

02:34.200 --> 02:39.540
We have some details about the computer that this is running on and this will be different depending

02:39.540 --> 02:40.820
on your computer.

02:41.220 --> 02:44.020
But one thing to note is that we're running.

02:44.530 --> 02:51.780
Maria B even though the exempt control panel says my esky Well they are a hundred percent compatible

02:51.780 --> 02:55.260
though so this is nothing to worry about.

02:57.410 --> 02:58.010
On the left.

02:58.010 --> 03:05.600
Here we have a list of all the databases on this server a single installation of memory idb can contain

03:05.870 --> 03:07.610
more than one database.

03:07.610 --> 03:11.180
In fact you can have as many as you like.

03:11.180 --> 03:14.120
These databases here are created by default.

03:14.240 --> 03:21.160
When X is installed and are used internally by the database server and by HP my admin.

03:21.260 --> 03:23.320
So we won't touch these.

03:24.080 --> 03:28.670
Let's go ahead and create a new database to do that.

03:28.670 --> 03:35.670
We click on databases here at the top and first we need to supply a database name.

03:36.230 --> 03:39.890
You can put anything you like in here but it's a good idea to keep it.

03:39.890 --> 03:43.850
Lower case use underscores instead of spaces.

03:43.910 --> 03:46.880
And of course make it meaningful.

03:46.970 --> 03:55.940
For example if it's a database for my blog I might call it daily blog.

03:57.990 --> 03:59.490
Offer an online shop.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.940
I might call it my store.

04:02.100 --> 04:03.300
And so on.

04:03.840 --> 04:09.300
As we're developing a content management system let's call ours c m s.

04:11.340 --> 04:14.060
Next we need to choose a collation.

04:14.400 --> 04:17.210
There's a very long list to choose from here.

04:17.220 --> 04:20.730
So which one do we choose.

04:22.380 --> 04:29.850
The colation is basically a set of rules for how the database server compares strings of text string

04:29.850 --> 04:33.940
comparisons are used when you search the database for specific data.

04:34.200 --> 04:38.360
For example searching a user database for all users.

04:38.430 --> 04:46.460
Dave there is a detailed explanation of how it works here in the my esky Well documentation.

04:49.760 --> 04:53.540
So the reason for all this choice depends on the character set.

04:53.540 --> 04:59.440
You are using the main language that text in your database is going to be in and so on.

04:59.990 --> 05:02.510
However if you choose this one.

05:04.330 --> 05:12.430
This uses the utf 8 M.B for a character set which contains all the characters for our most all modern

05:12.430 --> 05:19.840
languages and the Unicode version of it includes a more complete comparison algorithm for comparing

05:19.840 --> 05:21.150
Strings.

05:21.190 --> 05:27.610
So unless you have a specific reason to use another one I recommend you choose this one.

05:27.730 --> 05:31.230
Then we click on Create and that's it.

05:31.240 --> 05:36.100
We've created our database.

05:36.610 --> 05:43.470
The next step is optional but I highly recommend that you do it to access a database for mph.

05:43.460 --> 05:45.490
P As will see shortly.

05:45.520 --> 05:48.640
You need a username and password.

05:48.900 --> 05:55.500
The root user has access to all databases including the new one we just created.

05:55.600 --> 06:00.680
However in x samp by default this user has no password.

06:01.240 --> 06:04.290
This is a bad practice to be used to.

06:04.390 --> 06:12.370
So instead of using the root user to access our database will add a new user account for this database.

06:12.370 --> 06:14.740
First we enter the user name.

06:14.740 --> 06:20.670
This can be anything you like but as we we're going to be using this user account to access the database

06:20.680 --> 06:26.420
from our website I'll collect c s w w w.

06:30.320 --> 06:36.650
Next we'll change the hostname to local as were only going to be accessing this database from the same

06:36.650 --> 06:45.140
computer and for the password we'll generate one by clicking the Generate button and this gives us a

06:45.140 --> 06:48.490
nice secure password.

06:48.590 --> 06:55.010
You could argue that this isn't really necessary as the database is only accessible on your own computer

06:55.460 --> 06:58.360
but it's a good practice to get used to.

06:58.850 --> 07:04.460
Before we continue you need to make sure you've copied and saved this password somewhere as we'll need

07:04.460 --> 07:05.660
it later.

07:12.360 --> 07:17.620
Once we've created this user there's no way to view what password we used.

07:17.790 --> 07:23.130
So if you forget it you'll have to come back in here and change it.

07:25.360 --> 07:32.560
The check box grant all privileges on database see mass is already checked which means that this user

07:32.650 --> 07:36.570
will be allowed to do anything without a database which is what we want.

07:36.910 --> 07:46.350
So all we need to do now is scroll down and click go at the bottom and we've created it our user.

07:46.450 --> 07:50.700
So now our database is ready to start storing data.
