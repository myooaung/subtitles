We are already learnt how to select data from the database and how to insert data into the database

00:11.520 --> 00:16.470
using keywell to update data that are already in the database.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.760
We use the update statement.

00:22.370 --> 00:29.270
We start an update statement in esky well with the stop date key word followed by the name of the table.

00:30.140 --> 00:36.900
Then we add the set word followed by a column name and the value we want to set it to.

00:37.640 --> 00:44.450
We can update several columns in one statement by listing several columns and then new values separated

00:44.450 --> 00:46.940
by commas.

00:46.950 --> 00:53.990
Finally we optionally add a weather condition to only update records that match this condition.

00:53.990 --> 01:00.110
This condition is specified in the same way we add conditions to a select statement.

01:03.520 --> 01:12.130
Let's give this a try these other current records in our article table.

01:12.300 --> 01:17.870
Let's update the title of the rijkaard with an idea of sex.

01:21.260 --> 01:28.220
One row was affected and there we can see the updated rijkaard.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.680
We've got two cards with the same title of an interesting post

01:36.980 --> 01:42.590
the update statement Will update any rows that match the WHERE clause.

01:42.620 --> 01:48.800
So with this esky Well the where clase will match those two records.

01:49.850 --> 01:52.210
So those will be updated.

01:52.850 --> 01:56.170
And there we can see the updated records.

02:00.350 --> 02:01.180
Dont forget.

02:01.220 --> 02:03.180
As with the select statement.

02:03.350 --> 02:07.300
Any columns that you use in the WHERE clause should have an index.

02:07.470 --> 02:11.910
Otherwise they could take a long time to execute.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.570
One more thing about the update statement.

02:17.740 --> 02:24.460
If you don't include aware class every single row in the table will be updated.

02:24.460 --> 02:30.760
So unless you actually want to do this make sure you always include a WHERE clause to only update the

02:30.760 --> 02:32.960
records that you want to change.
