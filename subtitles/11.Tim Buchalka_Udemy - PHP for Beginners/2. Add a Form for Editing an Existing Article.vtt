00:05.230 --> 00:11.230
Now that we're retrieving the article that we want to edit we need to display the farm so that we can

00:11.260 --> 00:14.230
edit the articles details.

00:14.230 --> 00:21.190
We've already got a farm for adding a new article that contains all the articles fields so we can use

00:21.190 --> 00:23.130
that again.

00:23.140 --> 00:25.450
We dont want to repeat ourselves.

00:25.450 --> 00:32.260
So let's extract the code for the farm out into a file that we can share between adding and editing

00:32.260 --> 00:41.040
an article let's create a new file in the includes folder and call it Article farm.

00:41.420 --> 00:44.720
Doug P. HP.

00:48.800 --> 00:52.130
We want to include the code that displays errors.

00:55.530 --> 01:01.770
So we'll copy everything from here to the end of the FOB.

01:04.220 --> 01:09.460
We'll then paste that in the new file.

01:09.490 --> 01:13.010
Now at the moment the button to save the farm says that.

01:13.250 --> 01:15.460
So let's change that to save.

01:16.070 --> 01:17.440
Which is valid for both.

01:17.450 --> 01:25.600
Adding a new article and saving changes to an existing one back in the new article script.

01:25.790 --> 01:28.490
We can now replace what we've extracted

01:32.240 --> 01:36.230
with a require of the file we extracted it to.

01:40.050 --> 01:40.870
In the browser.

01:40.920 --> 01:50.070
This still works including the validation and re displaying values with our ready entered when we submitted

01:50.070 --> 01:51.080
the farm.

01:55.100 --> 02:01.640
Now we can do the same in our edit article script will copy this including the header and footer

02:04.700 --> 02:06.580
and paste it here.

02:09.490 --> 02:15.060
All we need to change is the subheading to say edit like that.

02:19.050 --> 02:26.010
If we open the edit page in a browser we see the farm but we're getting error messages inside each of

02:26.010 --> 02:28.320
the controls.

02:30.450 --> 02:39.750
This is because the farm is expecting variable's called Title content and published out.

02:39.870 --> 02:47.370
However the data coming from the database is in an associative array so let's assign values to the expected

02:47.370 --> 02:48.360
variables.

02:48.360 --> 02:52.670
Once we've got the article like that.

02:57.020 --> 03:04.150
Now in the browser we see the form with the values of the article we are editing inside the input controls.

03:07.260 --> 03:09.350
Going back to the article page.

03:09.360 --> 03:12.450
If we supply an idea of an article that doesn't exist

03:15.210 --> 03:19.240
we get a message saying article not found.

03:20.490 --> 03:27.370
However if we do the same with the edit article script we get an empty farm.

03:31.120 --> 03:39.800
If the idea isn't passed in the query string let's output a message and exit the script for now.

03:39.820 --> 03:48.970
Likewise if the get article function returns NULL which the If statement will understand as false will

03:48.970 --> 03:51.060
do the same thing.

03:51.510 --> 03:54.620
Outputting a message and exiting the script.

03:57.440 --> 04:02.080
So this still works if we pass in a valid I.D. in the query string.

04:02.420 --> 04:10.760
But if we pass in the idea of an article that doesn't exist we get one error message and if we remove

04:10.790 --> 04:16.570
the idea from the query string all together we get the other error message.
