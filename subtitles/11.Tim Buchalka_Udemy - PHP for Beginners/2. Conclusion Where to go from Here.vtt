Congratulations on reaching the end of the course.

00:09.380 --> 00:11.680
So where do we go from here.

00:13.990 --> 00:20.530
First I recommend using an editor that helps you to cold for example in atom.

00:23.090 --> 00:29.270
The arto complete plus package will suggest cold for you as you type.

00:30.580 --> 00:33.060
We switch this off at the start of the course.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.910
But with it switched on as I start to type

00:40.090 --> 00:48.240
it suggests the code that you might want to type which lets you code much faster and with fewer errors.

00:51.020 --> 00:58.130
I also recommend that while you are coding you make use of the excellent P HP documentation as we've

00:58.130 --> 01:04.700
been doing throughout the course along with sites like Stack Overflow and Dev docs.

01:06.820 --> 01:11.340
As for the course look out for course announcements in your inbox.

01:11.680 --> 01:16.900
And please don't hesitate to ask a question inside the course if you need help.

01:16.900 --> 01:20.030
For example something explained in more detail.

01:20.140 --> 01:22.240
Help debugging your code.

01:24.040 --> 01:28.240
And finally I just want to say thank you for taking this course.

01:28.240 --> 01:29.940
I really appreciate it.

01:30.130 --> 01:32.670
I hope you found it useful.

01:32.680 --> 01:35.320
I look forward to seeing you on the next one.
