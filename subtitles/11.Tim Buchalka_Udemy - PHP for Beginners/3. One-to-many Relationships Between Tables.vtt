More useful than one to one relationships are one to many and many to one relationships.

00:12.010 --> 00:19.990
This is the most commonly used type of relationship in a one to many relationship a rijkaard from one

00:19.990 --> 00:25.430
table can be related to one or more records in another table.

00:25.840 --> 00:34.300
In our cmf Example This means a category can belong to more than one article one category can have many

00:34.300 --> 00:40.640
articles hence the one to many relationship in the opposite direction.

00:40.660 --> 00:46.680
Many articles can belong to one category which is a many to one relationship.

00:51.640 --> 00:58.870
In the database in the article table we currently have a unique index on the category idae far in key

00:58.870 --> 01:03.110
field to model a one to many relationship.

01:03.160 --> 01:07.670
We need to change this index to a non unique index.

01:15.670 --> 01:16.540
Like that.

01:16.780 --> 01:21.830
This will now allow duplicate values in the category idees field.

01:25.620 --> 01:34.040
If we look at the current Ricardos in the database we can see the first rijkaard has a category of one.

01:34.080 --> 01:38.770
If we add it to the second rijkaard and select the same category.

01:42.250 --> 01:44.960
Now we can save this successfully.

01:45.460 --> 01:50.530
An article can only be related to 0 are 1 category.

01:51.860 --> 01:55.290
But a category can be related to 0 1.

01:55.330 --> 01:57.000
Are more articles.
