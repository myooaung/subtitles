00:05.440 --> 00:10.230
To send an email in the contact page were using an S M T P server.

00:10.690 --> 00:19.250
The settings for this server and the host username password and so on are in the contact page script.

00:19.780 --> 00:26.620
When we connect to the database we also need credentials such as the host user name and password and

00:26.620 --> 00:29.940
these are currently in the Database class.

00:30.130 --> 00:36.430
When we copy our cold live to a production server these credentials will no doubt change.

00:36.640 --> 00:41.570
It would be easier if we had all the values that change in a separate file.

00:43.610 --> 00:50.370
That creates a new file in The Root kalid config up HP.

00:53.330 --> 00:54.080
In here.

00:54.140 --> 01:00.770
Will store any configuration settings that change between different environments developments on your

01:00.770 --> 01:05.440
local machine production on your life server and so on.

01:05.450 --> 01:10.610
This way we only need to change this one file when moving between servers.

01:12.560 --> 01:17.970
We learnt early Iran how to define global constants using the defined function.

01:18.020 --> 01:21.490
So this is what will use for each conflict setting.

01:23.260 --> 01:25.610
Let's start with the database settings.

01:25.840 --> 01:31.720
We have four settings for the host database name using name and password.

01:32.260 --> 01:37.080
Let's create for equivalent constants for those values in the Conficker script.

01:39.900 --> 01:47.770
Now as these constants are globally available we could just use them inside the Database class here.

01:47.880 --> 01:54.240
However that would be making this class dependent on those global variables which is generally a bad

01:54.240 --> 01:55.270
practice.

01:56.580 --> 02:02.700
Whenever we want to use the database connection we are creating a new database object and calling the

02:02.740 --> 02:06.480
get conned method in the includes dbe file here.

02:06.690 --> 02:10.110
So let's use the global constants in here instead.

02:12.380 --> 02:17.860
The database credentials make sense as properties of a database object.

02:17.870 --> 02:22.480
So first let's add properties for each of these to the class.

02:24.620 --> 02:29.500
Then we can set these properties when we create a new database object.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.700
So let's add a constructor method.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.640
With arguments for each property.

02:38.160 --> 02:44.270
Then in the body of this method set the property values to the values of the arguments.

02:46.690 --> 02:56.650
Then in the get conned method we can remove these variables and use the property values instead.

02:57.250 --> 03:03.380
When we create the DSN variable and the new P.D.A object.

03:06.070 --> 03:14.460
Then when we create a new database object we pass in the constants we created in the new config file.

03:17.660 --> 03:21.800
Finally we need to include the config file in our code.

03:23.370 --> 03:26.970
We're including this init script in all our scripts.

03:26.970 --> 03:28.970
So let's do it in here.

03:33.970 --> 03:35.690
Let's give that a try.

03:36.100 --> 03:40.620
The index page is still working and this is reading from the database.

03:40.750 --> 03:45.710
So the database credentials are being read successfully from the config file.

03:47.540 --> 03:50.820
It seems we've broken the admin page however.

03:53.240 --> 04:00.200
This is because we need to require this file relative to this one as we did with requiring classes in

04:00.200 --> 04:01.600
the ATA louder.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.030
So let's do the same for the config file.

04:08.900 --> 04:12.990
And now when we go to the addleman area it works.

04:16.630 --> 04:24.580
Let's also take these mail server credentials out of the contact page let's create constants for the

04:24.610 --> 04:27.730
host username and password.

04:29.590 --> 04:36.790
Then in the contact page use these constants instead of the values directly.

04:39.270 --> 04:46.110
If there are other values in here that you want to change between servers for example the port are the

04:46.140 --> 04:54.390
sender address then you can put those in the config file to in the same way the same goes for any values

04:54.390 --> 04:56.880
that you want to differ between servers.

04:56.970 --> 05:00.820
So there are all in the same place in one configuration file.
