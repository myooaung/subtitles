WEBVTT

00:03.940 --> 00:06.180
So let's continue working with their Francia.

00:06.190 --> 00:13.020
Now you can see that we are showing the Canton in the front page of the content that we have in these

00:13.020 --> 00:20.760
charcoal so mega-watt are going necklet and arguments and Youmans very well what I said this to Ray

00:21.870 --> 00:23.710
and we can clear the way.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.030
So for example the ground balls per page.

00:26.300 --> 00:29.250
And here is the amount of products that you want to display.

00:29.520 --> 00:37.160
This is going to be 10 so what are the bowls type and the post-Iowa that comes from all the products

00:37.220 --> 00:39.450
you clicked on Kummer broke here.

00:40.350 --> 00:45.380
An avenue you can see on the top and says post-fight equals the brother.

00:45.800 --> 00:54.980
Cingular So next we up the thing with this is what I sample to start working during what we're going

00:54.980 --> 01:04.990
to like their brogues equals to new WP and we pass these arguments and then we have.

01:05.420 --> 01:13.740
While it's like other products post this is the standard whether you that obviously WordPress products

01:14.690 --> 01:29.420
they post they cost and we have in the white and white and though to be a set cost data so before these

01:29.420 --> 01:37.490
while I'm going to have a nickel in we're going to create an all northerlies with the glass slider brokes

01:39.600 --> 01:46.770
and right here right after this in Wilens I'm going to close at least right here I'm going to close

01:46.770 --> 01:47.660
BHB.

01:47.970 --> 01:49.660
And another lie.

01:50.190 --> 01:55.750
Each of the balls that we live in is going to be NLI.

01:56.110 --> 02:05.460
And then we have an anchor and we're going to add a BHP link up pitch block and we're going at the permalink

02:08.280 --> 02:15.530
and right here inside we're going to have the title of the of the broke.

02:15.710 --> 02:17.850
And when I grab this and say that I need three

02:21.340 --> 02:30.000
grossing each three and for example for the size of the of the balls and I use BHP again.

02:30.130 --> 02:36.810
That dominated the size that I went to these players shop underskirt got a little.

02:36.850 --> 02:41.260
So these will display the size of the product.

02:41.380 --> 02:44.840
This is a size that is great starting with commerce.

02:45.040 --> 02:52.090
So let's open these into reload and then you can see we have essentially you said you

02:55.000 --> 02:58.090
and we have someone that Brodies.

02:58.150 --> 03:00.330
So this is working nice.

03:00.400 --> 03:09.870
So the gwet is working bad in the next video we're going to see how we can access the bases like that

03:09.880 --> 03:13.050
or metal's to make this work.
