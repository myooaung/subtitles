00:04.010 --> 00:12.370
The previous videos we added up and said it's and Shippen shipping songs.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.120
Where did the shipping sands.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.530
And so we added some shipping methods.

00:17.460 --> 00:24.170
In this video I'm going to show you two other live raids and we're going to be using the USPS service

00:24.360 --> 00:30.030
the United States Postal Service So we're going to have some nice libraries so use it against the leg

00:30.060 --> 00:34.680
from the friend Fromelles is the shipping method.

00:34.760 --> 00:40.000
They want to use in a web site so visual going up and blogging is right here and we're going to install

00:40.000 --> 00:51.270
a new in the New going to make a search for USPS United States Postal Service and we're going to take

00:51.290 --> 00:53.500
these when you can see what's up there.

00:53.570 --> 00:54.700
One week ago.

00:54.950 --> 00:57.850
So we can install these grantees instead.

00:57.890 --> 01:06.500
What I want to activate the Brillion so and here what I've gone up and work Mars and then settings and

01:06.500 --> 01:08.520
what are going up and shipping.

01:08.700 --> 01:11.570
And you can see we have a new job right here.

01:11.820 --> 01:16.450
USPS basic don't like this one.

01:16.520 --> 01:23.010
So now you can see that we have real down rates and we can enable these and you can add the title where

01:23.070 --> 01:26.500
going and live USPS.

01:26.500 --> 01:30.980
So if you want to make this available for all of the countries you can select these or make these are

01:31.010 --> 01:34.640
specific to any country in the postcode.

01:34.670 --> 01:43.650
What are one of the most popular post Alco that we have in United States and Canada then and show rates

01:43.740 --> 01:51.020
whenever the subway level of course you can see here that we have seen up in the United States Postal

01:51.020 --> 01:58.550
Service website and you can create an account right here or you can use that for.

01:58.930 --> 02:04.630
If you try to if you are planning to use these in real web site.

02:04.670 --> 02:10.070
I recommend that you create an account right here and use the idea that they keep right here.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.200
So everything is going to be fine.

02:13.300 --> 02:19.350
All the rest is going to keep the falls at the bottom and I'm going to click on Save changes.

02:20.130 --> 02:27.870
It's important also to change the general rule in general the best location should be United States

02:27.870 --> 02:36.060
because this is a service from the United States and it's going to make the calculations based on the

02:36.330 --> 02:45.960
base location which in this case is California to the city or country where they Usera or visitors Lipp.

02:45.990 --> 02:52.170
So now we have everything ready we're going up in the check out and reload.

02:52.240 --> 02:59.470
So now you can see it there it goes into our United States and you can see that we have a bunch of different

02:59.470 --> 03:00.340
options.

03:00.730 --> 03:09.370
So we had the priority mail made library email media another priority and they use that against the

03:09.370 --> 03:10.150
leg.

03:10.150 --> 03:12.720
They said that they want to hire.

03:12.820 --> 03:19.900
And so if you make the change here for example it's Switzerland right here you can see that we have

03:19.960 --> 03:29.930
the friend Bryce and so if they said something like Romagna Romania and you can see that we have something

03:29.930 --> 03:31.780
like these so definitely this is working.

03:34.540 --> 03:36.650
One final there's lots of Mexico.

03:39.990 --> 03:42.580
And you can see we have something that these.

03:42.620 --> 03:43.830
So this is working.

03:43.860 --> 03:52.620
And this is how you set up live rates in the United States Postal Service Maybe you live in another

03:52.620 --> 03:53.160
country.

03:53.160 --> 04:01.740
For example in Mexico you can check out the service the postal service of your country costs something

04:01.740 --> 04:02.390
like this.

04:02.490 --> 04:04.530
You can integrate something like that in Europe.

04:04.590 --> 04:08.780
So you will have similar functionality in your website.
