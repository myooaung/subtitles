WEBVTT

00:04.310 --> 00:08.980
So let's have the prizes for the location that are not covered right here.

00:09.140 --> 00:16.100
You can see we set up some ship in the United States Canada and Mexico but maybe someone is trying to

00:16.130 --> 00:20.080
buy something and they live in other country that we don't have right here.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.550
So this one is going to be added by the fall.

00:22.730 --> 00:27.590
So we're going to click here on Menashe shipping methods and procure one of them are actually been met

00:28.130 --> 00:30.040
in this case is going to be flat rate.

00:30.090 --> 00:32.080
So it's like these in the shipping.

00:32.420 --> 00:38.250
So let's add something like You don't need something like 25 to St..

00:38.260 --> 00:46.420
The rest of the war of course you have to make the decision and make some research.

00:46.420 --> 00:50.660
How much it's going to cost you to send items through rest of the work.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.310
Well again I say that changes.

00:52.480 --> 00:58.300
And I was going up in the checkout so you can see previously we added it here and we have there are

00:58.300 --> 00:59.420
no shipping methods.

00:59.500 --> 01:05.710
So what are all these and you can see we have fly the rails 25.

01:05.800 --> 01:12.160
So now I know if you said this is from the United States you can be here and we're going to have Ratri

01:12.160 --> 01:16.220
are shipping free shipping also fees for Mexico.

01:16.390 --> 01:17.900
We're going to change.

01:17.920 --> 01:19.950
You can see a flat rate of 20.

01:20.170 --> 01:27.510
Can either 20 and maybe we have some clients for Argentina.

01:27.510 --> 01:29.330
And you can see we have 25.

01:29.610 --> 01:31.500
So that's something really nice.

01:31.500 --> 01:36.000
And of course for example let's say that you don't want to sell to the rest of the war.

01:36.120 --> 01:42.150
You can and comers sardines and from here you can select the general option.

01:42.150 --> 01:49.740
The fear is when you consider we have locations and we have sales to all countries and you can specify

01:49.740 --> 01:53.130
the countries where you want to sell something.

01:53.130 --> 02:00.410
So for example to all the countries all the countries except for if you add these you have to provide

02:00.410 --> 02:03.790
a list of the countries where you don't want to said.

02:04.230 --> 02:11.540
And that's all set to specific countries that say that you only want to sell in the United States Mexico

02:11.540 --> 02:16.710
or in Ghana you've got something like these.

02:16.840 --> 02:21.380
That's something nice and you going outside the shipping location and you will have really similar menu

02:22.020 --> 02:28.110
shit to all the countries specific countries are they serve the shipping and ship all something like

02:28.110 --> 02:28.480
that.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.190
Something nice.

02:30.190 --> 02:37.990
You have these options here on the general of the sitting single combers So in the next video we're

02:37.990 --> 02:45.220
going to see to that live live right using the USPS service.

02:45.300 --> 02:47.230
So let's continue working in the next media.
