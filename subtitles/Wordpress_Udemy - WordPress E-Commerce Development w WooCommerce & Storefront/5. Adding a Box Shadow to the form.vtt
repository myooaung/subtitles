This video we're going to have as my book show these fall one of the nicest tools I will find on the

00:11.360 --> 00:13.350
Internet to create something like this.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.160
This year says mantic.

00:15.380 --> 00:17.640
They have a bookshelf generator.

00:17.640 --> 00:24.080
One of the nicest Teano of these tool is they you cover as a preview on the right of the opening of

00:24.080 --> 00:32.960
the Koran book Shadow that you're a building on the left for example you can use these controls to create

00:32.960 --> 00:40.760
the bookshop so as the way that you need to for example for this example and when I see you it's going

00:40.760 --> 00:44.230
to be a line that very subtly and then we're going to have the vertical length.

00:44.240 --> 00:48.300
So when we're not on the road we're going to make these bigger two verticals.

00:48.310 --> 00:55.940
We had a bookshop on the bottom and then you can use the blue gray use because you can see it this doesn't

00:55.940 --> 00:57.220
have a lot of allure.

00:57.230 --> 01:05.280
So what I mean is that you can see if you increase this it's looking more blue you like that.

01:06.150 --> 01:11.390
And then you can just spread this crazy amount off of that radius.

01:11.430 --> 01:15.820
Can men make this a little too that there might be something like that.

01:16.890 --> 01:19.860
You could use a vertical like that.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.210
Nice.

01:21.400 --> 01:28.410
Then you can change their bow got box color for example I got these two white this one example is white

01:28.410 --> 01:29.940
so you can see a nice preview color.

01:29.950 --> 01:33.410
This is going to look from the past.

01:33.410 --> 01:35.570
You can increase or decrease it.

01:36.740 --> 01:40.760
Maybe something like these will work.

01:40.870 --> 01:47.520
And one of the nicest things about this is that you can for example copy these preview in your project.

01:47.800 --> 01:52.680
And if you don't like how it looks you can you can really really easily make the change.

01:53.280 --> 02:01.400
Sort of when I use luggin form that's the selector and when the these and I'm going to paste they the

02:01.550 --> 02:02.630
code that we generated.

02:02.630 --> 02:04.460
France uses map.

02:04.940 --> 02:06.890
Then what are these.

02:07.430 --> 02:11.480
And then you can see we have the far right here and he's looking nice.

02:11.510 --> 02:16.840
It gives like perspective of some depth in these screens is great.

02:18.020 --> 02:25.210
And this is I agree to that you can use something like a bookshelf which it requires the disco then

02:25.270 --> 02:31.190
it may be a little tricky to understand but using one of these tools you can create a shallop more visually.
