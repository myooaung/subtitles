It's really come on that for example when you have something like this online store the client doesn't

00:11.490 --> 00:13.690
have any image to display.

00:14.610 --> 00:22.550
So let's see how you can add a placeholder image in case that the the owner of the store doesn't as

00:23.320 --> 00:24.160
much.

00:24.290 --> 00:29.780
So I'm going to click it on products and I'm going to have new Ankita on going up and my brother at

00:29.790 --> 00:37.740
least look for the essential oils right here we have this title essentially what do when I copy and

00:37.740 --> 00:43.620
paste right here then we're going to copy these in the description.

00:44.020 --> 00:46.360
They get on the product description as well.

00:46.360 --> 00:49.520
What are these and what are to be a new category called essential.

00:50.530 --> 00:51.520
All yours.

00:51.840 --> 00:58.280
And I think what the here we're going at a price you can see we have 50 years or even at 50 what are

00:58.290 --> 01:05.100
going to we're not going to add the metric here or when actually publish.

01:05.370 --> 01:09.240
And you're going up in the front end and we don't.

01:09.390 --> 01:16.770
So you can see that there were just as these emerge which in my opinion looks really weird.

01:17.060 --> 01:19.970
It's like a or something or four.

01:19.970 --> 01:21.210
I can.

01:21.210 --> 01:23.930
So let's say for example there's is no match to the JPEG.

01:24.070 --> 01:30.280
We're going to display the law where the user doesn't have a feature image.

01:30.300 --> 01:33.970
So we're going up in a commerce Web site to be content.

01:34.120 --> 01:39.910
Teams aren't as bad LMG and I'm going to copy this page right here.

01:41.480 --> 01:50.010
So next we're going to open up a door in Oregon to another common display place called there the match

01:50.190 --> 01:58.540
when feature match is added and what are going on a function what are going to call these when Caterina's

01:58.790 --> 02:02.890
underscore no feature match.

02:03.420 --> 02:06.340
I think we're going to have that filter right here.

02:06.990 --> 02:08.300
I feel that.

02:08.740 --> 02:10.800
And we're going to use all comers.

02:10.810 --> 02:13.720
This is the name of the commercial placeholder.

02:14.920 --> 02:20.290
I am yes or see maybe you are asking where are you getting these values.

02:20.380 --> 02:26.580
Well all these values exist on the commander's blue.

02:26.620 --> 02:35.200
They call them like this and all of these are a collection of the most common hooks that my clients

02:35.260 --> 02:38.520
ask when I'm developing an online store.

02:39.410 --> 02:41.770
So that's why I know how they are go.

02:43.020 --> 02:48.690
And what is going to us right here the image you read and remember that you can pass whatever it is

02:48.720 --> 02:50.970
that you won and the name will work.

02:52.390 --> 02:54.590
And then let it go.

02:55.060 --> 03:06.650
So for example I'm not sure what I'm going to go Bre echo Bre and what are going to buy up these emet

03:06.690 --> 03:08.200
you rather bearable.

03:09.250 --> 03:16.590
So you can save these and reload again and you can see we are using the place called the rematch right

03:16.590 --> 03:22.430
here and is printing that image to match with the icons.

03:22.830 --> 03:24.390
So we're going to change that.

03:24.430 --> 03:26.750
We don't have a measure of red right here.

03:26.750 --> 03:31.600
This is going to be equals to get it stat sheet directory.

03:31.600 --> 03:32.290
You are right.

03:32.460 --> 03:35.060
This is the current theme.

03:35.210 --> 03:39.910
Then we need glasses this fall that we're gonna adopt the concatenate the value G.

03:40.250 --> 03:41.220
Then we're going to use.

03:41.250 --> 03:51.820
Now imagine that JP and we're going to return the at around.

03:51.830 --> 03:59.210
So now you can save these and are no different in and you can see that we have got to win this battle

03:59.210 --> 04:00.140
right here.

04:00.590 --> 04:03.970
So pretend that the client doesn't have any match.

04:04.010 --> 04:05.600
This one is going to be this play.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.440
And that's looking nice.

04:07.460 --> 04:07.970
I think.
