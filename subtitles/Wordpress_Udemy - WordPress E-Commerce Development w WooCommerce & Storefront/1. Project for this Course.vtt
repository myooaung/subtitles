00:11.070 --> 00:17.110
When you are learning on line so what are building this Web site for these Catalina's by Salloum.

00:17.300 --> 00:25.220

00:33.530 --> 00:35.960

00:36.070 --> 00:43.630
We have the column about all the shop with the categories the blog and the Contact Us page.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.400
Then we have the cartoon on the right.

And that's all we have.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.040

01:01.650 --> 01:08.060

01:08.060 --> 01:10.730
that have this is going to be printed right here.

01:11.640 --> 01:13.960
