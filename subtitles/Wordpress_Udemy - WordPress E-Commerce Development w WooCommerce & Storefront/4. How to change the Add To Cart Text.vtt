So let's see if you can make changes in this article or text.

00:08.560 --> 00:16.450
Maybe you have said in services or reservations you want to add something like higher service or make

00:16.520 --> 00:18.100
reservation.

00:18.250 --> 00:22.170
Do you want to display a different message right here.

00:22.550 --> 00:28.320
We're going to up in the fortunes that BHP ingratiate I'm going to write the hook.

00:28.370 --> 00:34.980
Are going to fund John gutturally inspire change to guide it.

00:36.570 --> 00:45.080
Xed and then we're going to use a field that feel the in this field that is called combers

00:47.820 --> 00:57.020
underscore rollock underscore that got dicks on top of this it cannot you in the name of the function

01:02.640 --> 01:13.670
then we only get the worm in we out and maybe make a celebration does make up these matrices each and

01:13.680 --> 01:14.920
say these and we know

01:17.710 --> 01:20.210
now you can see if we can make a reservation.

01:20.610 --> 01:23.130
So this is working fine.

01:23.230 --> 01:28.240
So let's say they opened this one this Prell and you can see here we have to cut it.

01:28.330 --> 01:38.070
So we need to make it a hook or I dysfunctioning to two different hooks filter and these are going to

01:38.070 --> 01:42.660
be really similar to these when you can see this is a single view of the product.

01:42.690 --> 01:50.820
What we're going to use with commerce pro underscore Singler And what we're going to use the same function

01:54.520 --> 01:55.810
so save and reload

01:58.950 --> 02:01.700
and you can see we have made restoration.

02:01.880 --> 02:08.630
And this way you can change the decks instead of having two cards you can have a little more you can

02:08.630 --> 02:15.450
make something more related to the broke or servies that you are selling or giving.

02:15.830 --> 02:18.830
So now and so this was really nice and you can see how to make these.
