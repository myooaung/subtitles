00:04.060 --> 00:10.050
This we are going to see how we can add these icons and these text.

00:10.150 --> 00:16.110
And again we're going to use advanced custom feeds to achieve something like these so.

00:16.120 --> 00:21.850
I'm going up and blue yins and we're going to instill a new blue.

00:21.900 --> 00:24.570
You can see that previously where it is better fun.

00:24.600 --> 00:25.410
Awesome.

00:26.370 --> 00:34.050
We want to help nguyá»…n that will display their awesome icons with us Vansickle some feels it's quite

00:34.070 --> 00:39.810
likely you don't have new and again what are going to make us search for advanced custom fields.

00:41.840 --> 00:46.330
And you're on the right you can see if we can advance because some fields or some of these will have

00:46.320 --> 00:52.020
the functionality to display the awesome feel.

00:52.940 --> 00:56.780
So I can activate these.

00:56.920 --> 01:04.030
So I to get up and custom fields or Quicken up and these stacks are we can reload and I'm going to have

01:04.030 --> 01:05.140
a new field.

01:05.420 --> 01:10.520
So in this case we're going to have future icon.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.300
We're going to have one number right here.

01:13.380 --> 01:18.120
So it's going to be the icons who are going to change the field type and you will find that we have

01:18.120 --> 01:18.450
fun.

01:18.450 --> 01:23.210
Also Mike and Ray here.

01:23.430 --> 01:30.360
So from here you can change the icon from here you can select the I can that you want to show us the

01:30.360 --> 01:32.580
full or four for were playing.

01:32.880 --> 01:36.930
This will display a similar interface right here.

01:37.650 --> 01:39.910
So it's going to read during their on element.

01:39.960 --> 01:40.930
That's fine.

01:41.170 --> 01:42.610
And we're going to close the field.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.240
So next we're going to create another one.

01:45.270 --> 01:47.290
It's going to be feature on.

01:47.340 --> 01:54.960
Guan and in this case we're going to change EASTOE Yeah I think text is fine.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.330
We're going to keep the.

01:57.360 --> 02:03.990
So we need to or three more you can see that we have 1 ratio of and three Daisey's ways to duplicate

02:03.990 --> 02:04.340
this.

02:04.350 --> 02:07.410
We're going to duplicate and we're going to make a change right.

02:07.410 --> 02:09.800
It's going to be two and two.

02:10.140 --> 02:12.670
So we're going to close these again.

02:12.710 --> 02:13.790
We're going to duplicate.

02:13.870 --> 02:17.950
It's going to be three and three here.

02:19.060 --> 02:28.700
They in the future and I'm going to duplicate three and three and pick it I is going to be two and two

02:31.760 --> 02:37.840
so close the fields and then you can see him have three icons and three features.

02:37.900 --> 02:45.180
So one of the nicest things about advance has some features that you can always reorder the elements.

02:45.430 --> 02:52.240
So for example I went to this play feature and I can't fit your icon and features can't fit your icon

02:52.240 --> 02:53.210
in content.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.900
So in this case I'm going actually interact with.

02:55.940 --> 02:57.530
All right.

02:57.850 --> 03:03.070
So now we have it your second one if it should contain one then we have a feature I can too.

03:03.430 --> 03:06.510
And we're going to rearrange.

03:06.520 --> 03:11.140
Is going to be I two and then two and I can contain three.

03:11.480 --> 03:12.080
So that's nice.

03:12.090 --> 03:14.350
We're going to update these.

03:14.550 --> 03:15.680
And again are going.

03:15.710 --> 03:20.970
I'm going to close this and click it on a page so this will open the back end of this page

03:24.950 --> 03:31.280
and you can see that we have page fills and then we have this banner on the bottom up front and it is

03:31.850 --> 03:37.430
at the moment looks like a mess right because you can see that we have are like on line and this is

03:37.430 --> 03:41.040
mixed with the banner and everything.

03:41.070 --> 03:46.360
So here's an advanced custom fields we're going to add a new feel and we're going to use that top.

03:46.410 --> 03:48.010
We're going to stop right here.

03:49.490 --> 03:58.930
And we're going to have minor comp page then we close a few ranges in them and I looked up then we're

03:58.930 --> 04:07.040
going to get these and I'm going to make homepage features because the fear.

04:07.090 --> 04:14.620
And then when I raise these right here so we have the at home page is going to be at that is going to

04:14.620 --> 04:17.800
wrap these two legs in the match.

04:17.830 --> 04:21.070
Then we have features and we're going to grab these.

04:21.100 --> 04:30.390
The rest of the contents of the these open again the welcome page and you can see we have banded homepage

04:30.390 --> 04:35.630
right here and then you can click on page features and you will have something nice right here.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.350
So definitely this is looking great.

04:39.340 --> 04:45.820
So in the next video we're going to add the correct features and icons and we're going to have the content

04:45.820 --> 04:46.210
right here.
