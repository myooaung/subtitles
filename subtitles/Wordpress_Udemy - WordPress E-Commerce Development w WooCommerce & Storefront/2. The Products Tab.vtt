00:04.490 --> 00:06.510
The next stop is the broke stop.

00:06.770 --> 00:10.460
And you can see we have some other four sections right here.

00:10.460 --> 00:15.320
So if you're on the measurements you can see we have kilogrammes in centimeters.

00:15.320 --> 00:19.770
This is really similar to the currencies that we saw in the previous VDU.

00:19.900 --> 00:25.960
If you make a change here for example a probe is two kilograms and then you decide to make the change

00:25.960 --> 00:26.970
to lips.

00:27.310 --> 00:33.240
You have to make the change manually you know the brokes commanders won't make the change for you.

00:33.250 --> 00:39.040
So make sure that you are the kilograms and the dimensions correctly.

00:39.170 --> 00:44.510
Then for example if you at the bottom we have reviews and we have a neighbor program use that's something

00:44.510 --> 00:47.570
nice especially if you're trying to make some marketing.

00:47.660 --> 00:53.750
So it's important when people is trying to buy something from the internet to see some real reviews

00:54.140 --> 00:58.520
on that page so you can enable or disable that.

00:58.700 --> 01:02.480
The reviews I recommend that you add these is going to be important.

01:03.010 --> 01:06.940
Then show the fight or nerd label on the customer reviews.

01:07.100 --> 01:13.640
So this way for example if you enable these if you set up really make the purchase for a brother.

01:13.790 --> 01:20.070
And they may reveal a special label is going to be printed out so you can see we have reviews can be

01:20.070 --> 01:27.660
only left by verify corners there's only persons that fat butchers are broke and they purchased a drug

01:27.700 --> 01:35.250
for no restore are going to be able to create a review of course you can decide if you want to sell

01:35.270 --> 01:36.170
this or no.

01:36.270 --> 01:40.420
Then we have the product ratings and you can see we have a neighbor list that rating on the reviews

01:40.420 --> 01:42.540
so you can enable that or not.

01:42.720 --> 01:49.880
Or you can add a star rating should we require not optional and you can say if that's required or not.

01:50.180 --> 01:55.620
So then we have a display of the second option and you can see for example you can change the name of

01:55.620 --> 01:59.190
the page for the shop when you.

01:59.260 --> 02:00.330
With commerce.

02:00.780 --> 02:02.580
It creates for the front pages.

02:02.610 --> 02:04.740
One of them is a shop page.

02:04.740 --> 02:08.820
So for example you can see we have a sample page that is right on the pages

02:11.680 --> 02:13.320
we have sample page right here.

02:13.750 --> 02:20.220
If you've got if you want to make changes to the shop page you can change their page right there.

02:20.330 --> 02:25.010
Then you have Shar-Pei display and the full a display you can make some changes here.

02:25.860 --> 02:27.410
Why don't we cover the images.

02:27.420 --> 02:31.240
And of course you can make some changes in the sizes.

02:31.290 --> 02:40.410
So for example the catalog images if you're Penshoppe out of the sizes that we can for you and of course

02:40.410 --> 02:47.560
you can make the changes RESPETO to the Sysyphus inventory and Fromkin you can manage the stock.

02:47.750 --> 02:52.780
If you remember we saw already these in previous videos.

02:52.990 --> 02:59.660
And for example you can email where you are going to receive the notifications when I broke or when

02:59.660 --> 03:06.790
you have our lowest doc for my specific product then we have the downloadable products.

03:06.990 --> 03:12.610
And for example you can see we have filed metal's on what you can for so long what or the deck on.

03:12.750 --> 03:17.720
Normally this is fine the default is OK.

03:17.770 --> 03:25.660
So this is it for these products that you can see that we have a lot of different options to make changes

03:25.690 --> 03:26.750
in commerce.

03:27.160 --> 03:29.200
So let's continue with the next one.

03:29.210 --> 03:29.780
Taxus.
