WEBVTT

00:04.390 --> 00:09.850
So let's continue working with this page and we're going to load.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.320
We will fund.

00:11.740 --> 00:15.210
You can see in design What do you see in these phone calls.

00:15.310 --> 00:25.570
Laro on the bottom I have another Google fund if I scroll a little bit right here what are you seeing

00:25.580 --> 00:28.820
another fun this one is called Laura.

00:28.900 --> 00:35.970
So one of the advantages of using Google fonts is that you can use any phone for free in your website.

00:36.160 --> 00:38.960
On the left you can see we have left ladder right here.

00:39.020 --> 00:44.880
So and then I click on the plus sign and you can see we have one family select.

00:44.890 --> 00:48.030
So we're going to make a search right here.

00:48.350 --> 00:51.990
I'm working for Laura then and when I click on the plus sign.

00:51.990 --> 01:00.370
Also by the way one of the really cool things about the Google phones is that for example if I have

01:01.700 --> 01:08.790
a text like this one this boy yourself with these high quality products you can add something here or

01:08.850 --> 01:17.860
you sell with these like why did the brokes.

01:18.220 --> 01:24.000
And you can see a nice preview how this text is going to loop with these fun.

01:24.160 --> 01:29.890
Or you can copy here and paste and you can test several phones you can see that we have a candidate

01:29.890 --> 01:31.380
for the one available.

01:31.750 --> 01:35.400
And they are in new phones every time.

01:35.470 --> 01:40.290
So this is one of the one of my favorite features of Google phones.

01:40.360 --> 01:43.510
These live preview.

01:43.590 --> 01:50.250
So I have decided to use these two phones and I'm going to click on customize in the case of the phone

01:50.250 --> 01:56.640
call that Laura we're going to load this record in this blog and that so for the latter we're going

01:56.660 --> 02:05.100
to use these regular board but I'm going to use these black then I'm going to click on embed and I'm

02:05.100 --> 02:12.180
going to keep is you read only there part or only that you are relatives inside the quotes so Couple

02:12.270 --> 02:21.800
these and then we're going out in or 8 or going up in Cairo and that's better than going up in the functions

02:22.520 --> 02:29.990
right here I'm going to have on and I'm going to study sheets or scripts.

02:30.170 --> 02:36.310
This is the function that we're going to use to load different CIRCE's libraries so maybe you find that

02:36.300 --> 02:40.630
a really nice library that you want to use you can use this function.

02:40.690 --> 02:51.980
So we're not going to spot underscore scripts and then we're going to hook these into a p and q scripts.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.310
So this is a way that you communicate your functions with wordpress if you really have some experience

02:57.310 --> 03:00.600
working great a pristine development.

03:00.890 --> 03:04.540
This function is going to be very familiar for you.

03:04.810 --> 03:11.300
And this is the same function that you use in Normile or a standard WordPress elements the same.

03:11.350 --> 03:16.650
So that's one of the advantages of using all comers.

03:16.680 --> 03:19.680
So then I'm going to have this fun show right here.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.260
So these and these should be the same.

03:22.400 --> 03:26.660
And then I'm going to use a function called Dolby on Q style.

03:27.200 --> 03:33.590
And from here I'm going to have Google funds then we are combating the second parameter which is going

03:33.590 --> 03:37.290
to be their path for that Fornes that we added.

03:37.570 --> 03:38.820
So we got something like this.

03:38.840 --> 03:46.770
You can save and now you can see it on the bottom we'll have it specify in SEUS is so are going up in

03:46.770 --> 03:48.740
the study that's Jasus right here.

03:48.750 --> 03:54.190
I'm going to scroll a little bit and rage maybe on the top.

03:54.260 --> 04:02.410
It's going to be more about what we're going to have when you do these three and we're going to use

04:02.410 --> 04:12.870
these lotto fund that's going to be these when and this is going to be a new section so we can use something

04:12.870 --> 04:13.470
like

04:17.020 --> 04:20.330
each to Banner and then we're going to have fun finding.

04:20.350 --> 04:24.310
Of course at the moment this doesn't exist but this one inch to an inch three.

04:24.340 --> 04:26.370
They do exist right now.

04:26.620 --> 04:29.360
So now we can save these up in the browser.

04:30.280 --> 04:35.000
And reload and you can see that we have something de-friend right here.

04:36.040 --> 04:44.550
So next in this case for example this Kerins reducing the ball size of bald weights or going out for

04:44.590 --> 04:45.940
weight.

04:46.090 --> 04:53.320
So in Canada of and also we're going to change this to uppercase text form uppercase So we're going

04:53.310 --> 04:56.940
to apply to all the Karin's is one inch two and it's three.

04:56.940 --> 04:59.000
These are style and what we're going to make this bigger.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.610
And so we're going to reload.

05:00.810 --> 05:04.210
And you can see this is working.

05:04.330 --> 05:08.000
And if it's a good sign we have these separator right here.

05:08.930 --> 05:12.740
In this case I'm going out reichlich and these the code.

05:12.980 --> 05:18.720
And you can see this is an edge to so we can add something like an h to a right here.

05:18.840 --> 05:27.000
After this decisive element and then we're going to content always when you're working with these elements

05:27.450 --> 05:33.830
you have to use this content and then we're going to display block and we're going to the mat again

05:34.010 --> 05:35.060
zero out.

05:36.460 --> 05:38.910
What we're going to have at its height.

05:39.230 --> 05:48.950
The two big SUVs and I width of six the big soles of cars you can change these two aims if you want.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.740
And then we're going to have a background color background color.

05:51.770 --> 05:56.130
If you take a look here in the design is this pink color if you take a look here on this diagonal of

05:56.130 --> 06:02.420
a color guide we're going to copy these color and page right here.

06:03.530 --> 06:12.300
So save these and reload and then you can see that we've had these separators.

06:12.330 --> 06:18.270
So for example right here you can see that this is our supplier in the categories in the products and

06:18.270 --> 06:21.600
everything.

06:21.650 --> 06:28.000
So you can see for example this one is using the two commerce loop broke title and right here we're

06:28.000 --> 06:35.190
using the section titled right here where you see that small section that we're going to target the

06:35.480 --> 06:37.630
specific glass.

06:37.670 --> 06:45.390
So instead of having to afterworld now to dot and then section title after so now you can reload and

06:45.390 --> 06:50.410
then you can see that we remove the line from these products and apply it right here.

06:50.610 --> 06:57.690
So right here instead of Madigan's zero out or not some Aspasia can see is really close to having more

06:57.690 --> 07:02.370
separation and going out Margene is going to be dead pixels.

07:02.420 --> 07:09.510
All zero and now reload again and you can see he's looking better.

07:11.230 --> 07:16.560
So now we have something better we have got as we call font and this is looking nice.

07:17.590 --> 07:21.330
So in the next video we're going to continue developing this campaign.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.530
So let's continue with this section.

07:23.550 --> 07:25.070
It's on the top.

07:25.210 --> 07:29.380
This feature the man we're going to be in the future right here and we're going to remove the section

07:30.100 --> 07:31.150
in the next video.
