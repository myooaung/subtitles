00:04.310 --> 00:06.410
You can see that here we have the home kit.

00:06.710 --> 00:13.130
And for example we have this message on the tablet sale and that's on the one with you the fifty dollars

00:13.160 --> 00:15.240
and they use the $10.

00:15.680 --> 00:19.100
So we're agreed in our special offer for these broke.

00:19.280 --> 00:29.400
But let's see for example some tricks that you can apply to display the discounts in your website search

00:29.420 --> 00:29.950
review.

00:29.960 --> 00:39.530
The rule of one candidate the idea of these is to show the most significant discount to your customers.

00:40.880 --> 00:45.800
So for example if your broke is less than $100.

00:47.120 --> 00:53.750
And let's say that you have a brother that you're selling $60 and you have a special offer selling this

00:53.800 --> 01:01.530
and selling this broke at $45 don't use say $50.

01:01.550 --> 01:04.720
That doesn't seem very significant.

01:05.470 --> 01:14.850
Instead you can use say 25 percent in the other hand if your brother is more than $100.

01:16.510 --> 01:23.560
And you're selling or broke at $600 and you have a special offer selling the same broke for a hundred

01:23.560 --> 01:25.810
and fifty dollars.

01:25.840 --> 01:30.210
I recommend that you use save one hundred and fifty dollars.

01:32.840 --> 01:38.240
Try to avoid U.S. and say 25 percent in this case.

01:38.250 --> 01:43.820
One hundred and fifty seems to be more significant than 25 percent.

01:45.510 --> 01:49.450
So let's apply that rule of 100 you know restore with some called.
