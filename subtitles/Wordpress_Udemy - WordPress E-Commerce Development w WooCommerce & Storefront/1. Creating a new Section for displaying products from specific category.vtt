WEBVTT

00:04.460 --> 00:10.710
So before we continue working with the section and something I forgot if I may.

00:10.700 --> 00:19.040
This is Malad you can see the categories have not explain properly what are going to happen again or

00:19.040 --> 00:19.930
later.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.530
And we need to wrap these.

00:21.570 --> 00:30.630
They are these section right here for the school intermediate where the media on your screen and I mean

00:30.630 --> 00:39.920
with 760 pixels and I cut these pages right here inside the ME equity.

00:40.020 --> 00:45.130
And when you resize a window this is going to display really nice.

00:45.570 --> 00:48.150
So something I forgot in the last beat you.

00:48.540 --> 00:54.380
So next we're going to see how you can display products from this specific category and answer that

00:54.380 --> 00:55.490
description.

00:55.780 --> 01:01.020
So for example in this case we went to these play the kids were going up and I ended up back in wordpress

01:01.710 --> 01:07.900
and we're going up and brotherless categories and we're looking for home kits please don't come kids

01:07.960 --> 01:15.970
and eat and you can see that will come and provide the description or Wordpress we can out of my descriptions

01:15.970 --> 01:22.920
of what we're going up and that some web site but it will not generate Inkley can generate and generate

01:23.670 --> 01:25.220
some.

01:25.440 --> 01:31.180
So for example a small portion of the text and page right here we're going to simulate that this is

01:31.180 --> 01:35.680
the description for this product and we're going to update.

01:35.730 --> 01:42.950
So we need to write this malfunction in the functions that the bees are going up in again or later in

01:43.070 --> 01:52.530
the insurance and right here we're going to display comfits in the home page.

01:52.600 --> 02:00.590
So what are going to function with and s back underskirt home page underscore

02:05.030 --> 02:07.580
and then we're going to add action.

02:07.820 --> 02:10.150
Again if you remember this is from the home page

02:13.670 --> 02:20.350
and what are going to copy these function and then we can set the priority if you take a rookie saying

02:20.380 --> 02:25.050
we went to these ladies right after the category's.

02:25.120 --> 02:30.290
So if I click on simple show looks and click on show action.

02:30.340 --> 02:34.660
So this is before nguyá»…n And right after the categories.

02:34.690 --> 02:42.550
So if I click on one page or Harvard page you can see that the categories are used in priority 20 and

02:42.550 --> 02:45.820
the products are you seeing priority or of the 50.

02:46.000 --> 02:55.150
So we can write something like 25 and then we can have a go.

02:55.250 --> 03:01.250
Hello Ankita stop showing Quick's and you can see yellow Reiki

03:04.430 --> 03:10.040
and everything from here this home page and this priority everything you can find is some Caterina's

03:10.040 --> 03:12.890
back up and start from there.

03:13.220 --> 03:15.420
The main the parent team.

03:15.980 --> 03:22.260
And then on the bottom you will find these template homepage and here for example you would find these

03:22.260 --> 03:27.780
get there then we have the the primary the main You can see that we can do action.

03:27.780 --> 03:36.240
This is home page you will find a list of all the functions that I can hook into the page with the priority

03:37.860 --> 03:45.620
and maybe you will see what is in these functions so you can ask the doc and here you to find the site

03:45.620 --> 03:47.090
and see for that.

03:47.320 --> 03:55.910
I mean this is bigger you will find the system a storefront that hooks and from if I scroll a little

03:56.120 --> 03:58.600
you will find this home page right here.

03:58.600 --> 04:08.080
Here is where I started from as these categories for example these homepage contain if you template

04:08.180 --> 04:12.330
paid for insurance and you may a search you will find the answer right here.

04:13.400 --> 04:18.040
So any function that you're looking for is to be added in these fine.

04:18.100 --> 04:21.270
So that's more or less how Hooke's work.

04:21.450 --> 04:25.500
They are only functions that exist in other files.

04:26.280 --> 04:34.620
In this case when you're working with a child team you almost always you are functions in these functions

04:34.620 --> 04:36.440
that BHB of the child.

04:36.780 --> 04:42.090
We're going to have some markup right here we're going to close the BHB and we're going up in BHB again

04:42.090 --> 04:47.960
right here and we're going to use an estimate instead of echoing in a lot of the lives we're going to

04:47.970 --> 04:57.690
add of the money going to the classic home page and these crises in the area of the goal of this class

04:58.390 --> 05:05.760
Sunday to grab all the categories brokes the product categories that we have in the come get so use

05:05.760 --> 05:14.640
these carafes to style the content that is inside come keep they the don't want to give out another

05:14.650 --> 05:16.590
report and I call these Wincanton.

05:16.600 --> 05:23.980
But I don't know how deep these when it's going to be columns the next we're going to go write some

05:23.980 --> 05:32.100
PH BE RIGHT HERE Bubi and I'm going to have to come equals and we're going to use a function called

05:32.100 --> 05:37.240
Get underskirt then get them takes two parameters.

05:37.710 --> 05:44.110
So if you open the back in here we can see we have come kits and we have the idea right here.

05:44.460 --> 05:55.480
In this case is 17 so you have to open the category and the staff the copy the savey it may be a little

05:55.480 --> 05:56.730
different on your website.

05:58.060 --> 06:02.320
Then you have the category or the taxonomy.

06:02.320 --> 06:09.650
Where does the balance in this case is the section that says taxonomy equals broke.

06:09.700 --> 06:15.240
Got some inside single got what you got.

06:15.330 --> 06:20.160
Then you can edit the air parameter in this case is how you want to return the data.

06:20.160 --> 06:29.960
In my case I found a re a for Aria socity they see as a way to read this their surveying what they're

06:29.960 --> 06:33.260
going to have to eat that.

06:33.410 --> 06:40.790
And then what are going to use a function call BHB and what function called by the dump and we're going

06:40.790 --> 06:51.400
to send discomfit to the bottom so save these and Angelo and thanks to these bar dome in this great

06:51.420 --> 06:58.230
access we had something nice for right here for example you can see that we have the name of this lock

06:58.940 --> 07:03.860
that taxonomy had the description so we can bring these data.

07:03.970 --> 07:06.200
Now we can to the movies.

07:06.410 --> 07:14.510
So this is going to be added in the column 1:03 Saray here we're going to have and here I'm going to

07:14.510 --> 07:22.770
have things at the bedside we're going to have an H2 and we're going to use some of the commerce classes

07:22.860 --> 07:26.850
or a storefront KLISE classical section Dayrell

07:29.790 --> 07:38.380
and I'm going to be again eco come get this Tikal name will display does this come get.

07:38.390 --> 07:40.290
You can see here in the same cab.

07:40.620 --> 07:50.150
Kip so we can add square brackets were called and then that GHI to display the complete story after

07:50.150 --> 07:51.410
the H-2.

07:51.650 --> 07:54.950
We're going to that paragraph what on not be again.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.600
Next in the sand you can see.

07:57.600 --> 08:03.670
We need to display the description the description that we come out of earlier.

08:03.930 --> 08:07.690
This one is Racheal in the description.

08:07.810 --> 08:17.870
So what I'm going to be home and what we're going to add description.

08:18.020 --> 08:25.270
So next if you take a look again you can see that we have our link to this play of the brokes right

08:25.280 --> 08:25.530
here.

08:25.540 --> 08:34.660
And another anchor and inside the H reffer will not be quailing in in this case.

08:34.670 --> 08:43.270
We're going to use a function called get the link and this function takes two parameters.

08:44.660 --> 08:46.270
This function takes only one parameter.

08:46.290 --> 08:53.340
There is a D if you take a look here you will find that we have there taxonomy Id ought to be up there.

08:53.440 --> 09:01.720
Both are using the same ideas so we can add something like.

09:01.760 --> 09:14.940
And then we pass their IVI inside the inkers right here I'm going to add or brogans.

09:14.980 --> 09:21.010
So now you can save these and relo and you can see Wickiup come kids.

09:21.340 --> 09:22.090
They are.

09:22.110 --> 09:27.550
We need to align these a little to Kinsey's another and into the center description.

09:27.820 --> 09:29.860
And we have all Propes.

09:30.080 --> 09:32.740
If you take kit in the side we have this are responding to.

09:32.750 --> 09:33.960
Right.

09:33.980 --> 09:45.650
We're going to either estimate anti-Tea like these rockwool and say these and relo and you can see that

09:45.650 --> 09:54.240
we have two arrows pointing pointing to the right and the next we we're going to continue working with

09:54.240 --> 10:02.120
this section and then I show you how to display these three Proulx in the section of a Web site.
