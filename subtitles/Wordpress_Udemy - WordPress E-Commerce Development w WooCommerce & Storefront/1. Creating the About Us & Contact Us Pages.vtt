00:06.570 --> 00:12.160
These callowness by what you and I use the right team we're going leave that child in use in the Patent

00:12.270 --> 00:13.440
Office storefront.

00:13.710 --> 00:18.490
I'm going to show you a lot of customizations that you can make in your store.

00:18.570 --> 00:27.700
Some templates hooks and also Sancy assist that we can make into a storefront to create an amazing store.

00:27.990 --> 00:32.520
So first we're going to open pages and you can see that we have some pages right here.

00:33.290 --> 00:39.770
And in order to use something more real world we're going to create pages page what are going to wow.

00:39.970 --> 00:46.010
For example about us and we're going to use the Web site.

00:46.130 --> 00:52.250
We're going to create three paragraphs and we're going to go now and check these and what have they.

00:52.260 --> 00:57.700
So on a lot of MIPS and so we're going to copy these and you can base from here.

00:58.060 --> 01:00.560
You can see some content on that right.

01:00.850 --> 01:03.730
You can see that we can add a feature rematch.

01:04.100 --> 01:11.770
So it's up and find that you can use any images of these that we have available to us that these one.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.010
Number 10

01:15.650 --> 01:23.490
and said If we truly match then I'm going to publish these page and we're going to do what I going to

01:23.490 --> 01:32.920
create another one I'm going to contact was and again maybe in the contact goes you will either a contact

01:32.920 --> 01:38.620
form what we're going to have another image some race you and then a change that then we're going to

01:38.620 --> 01:50.570
use for width and said the feature the much may be another match that like these one yet it's just one

01:50.570 --> 01:58.400
of these and said If you truly match foolish.

01:58.450 --> 02:06.140
So now for example you can view the page right here at and the main difference between the full width

02:06.180 --> 02:08.890
is that you can see we don't have any sidebar right here.

02:09.150 --> 02:16.400
And if you open these for example the about us view it will contain the sidebar right here.

02:16.410 --> 02:22.440
So that's the main difference in these templates and these temper's you will find the templates in the

02:22.440 --> 02:24.110
store from Deam.

02:24.330 --> 02:28.750
You will find the Reiffel then the full width in the home page.

02:28.760 --> 02:34.960
So now we have some images so we can create the menu and everything.

02:35.120 --> 02:40.200
And we're going to start with we're going to start customizing these in the next media.

02:40.570 --> 02:45.100
First we need to create the child theme of a storefront.
