00:04.410 --> 00:11.550
So let's finish broke into or Istar in the course materials you will find these products fall there

00:11.720 --> 00:17.690
and need to contain several images that we can use to add some products into the website.

00:18.730 --> 00:28.580
Also there is a product list that the XTi and I have added some titles or description and time line

00:28.620 --> 00:31.950
for each Brugge also the price is right here.

00:31.980 --> 00:35.890
So we're going to start working with these and we're going to add some products.

00:36.150 --> 00:40.690
You were then a lot of these interface you can see is really different.

00:43.530 --> 00:51.220
So this means this means all of these because you are now there and everything in these cores so we're

00:51.230 --> 00:53.690
going to add a product name.

00:53.690 --> 00:59.380
So in my case and when I start with these 00 it's going to be that that was so from here.

00:59.380 --> 01:06.090
I'm going to copy's name with that with something like this.

01:06.090 --> 01:13.060
This company's stock line in page right here so it is a little bit you can see we have the right price.

01:13.470 --> 01:15.970
And in this case it's going to be nine.

01:15.980 --> 01:19.070
That's at 9:00 right here on the right.

01:19.070 --> 01:24.420
You can see that we have the product match and you can set the payload right here and you can see that

01:24.440 --> 01:28.220
the interface is really similar to that.

01:28.670 --> 01:35.140
And when we are creating a post or a page I'm going to select this first image.

01:36.650 --> 01:45.990
And then when I said the match from here we have set up the title tag line the price and also the image.

01:46.020 --> 01:47.460
So I'm going to click it on Polish

01:50.810 --> 01:52.580
and from here you can see pro-police.

01:52.630 --> 01:59.460
And you can click it on your brother and now you can see that we have something like this.

01:59.520 --> 02:06.050
We have the tower we have the price and you have the quantity and you can add these to the card.

02:06.090 --> 02:12.780
If you remember in the previous video we enable the installation and activation of a storefront but

02:12.780 --> 02:14.570
looks like it didn't work.

02:14.640 --> 02:21.990
If I open managed teams you can see that with a storefront installed in the case that storefront was

02:22.050 --> 02:25.850
installing your working site.

02:26.260 --> 02:33.460
You can continue working with the course using a storefront or you can activate 20:17 if you're actively

02:33.610 --> 02:39.650
20:17 you will find the same user interface as I have.

02:40.110 --> 02:45.480
But of course you can continue with the star from by that's OK.

02:45.560 --> 02:53.910
And this is the output of you seeing the 2017 theme in your Wordpress installation that's fine.

02:54.720 --> 03:00.720
So for example you can click on that the at and you can see to what has been added to the car.

03:00.990 --> 03:04.800
You can view the car and you can see we have something like this.

03:04.950 --> 03:10.620
You can apply a coupon right here we're going to create coupons in upcoming Beadle's and I'm going to

03:11.610 --> 03:17.490
change the quantity of the cart and you can see we have something like this funky you can process the

03:17.520 --> 03:20.850
checkout and feel this information.

03:20.850 --> 03:25.530
You can see with Paypal ash and the liberty and direct bank transfer.

03:25.650 --> 03:31.830
So we have added the first brother and everything is working fine in the next videos we're going to

03:31.830 --> 03:38.100
continue working with this interface so you can get more familiar with the broken.
