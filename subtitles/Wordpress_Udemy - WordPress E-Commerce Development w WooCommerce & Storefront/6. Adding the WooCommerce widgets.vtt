WEBVTT

00:04.420 --> 00:11.380
So before we move on into another section let's see what other articles customisations we can make into

00:11.380 --> 00:15.430
this shop page and this one is more related.

00:15.460 --> 00:21.100
Well the friend the French the place that we have in this page if you remember in previous videos we

00:21.100 --> 00:28.590
added these photos and we saw that start from provides the friend Gilgit area and actually killing a

00:28.590 --> 00:30.140
pigeons widgets.

00:30.540 --> 00:32.140
We have these cyber.

00:32.350 --> 00:39.810
You can see that the side about is printing a lot of stuff that is more related to the block.

00:39.820 --> 00:48.950
So what all of that is and I'm going to show you they will combers widgets you can add into your web

00:48.950 --> 00:56.390
site remove everything.

00:56.420 --> 00:59.010
So if you scroll a little you will find these will.

00:59.330 --> 01:05.350
All of these that will combers our widgets that will enhance your website.

01:05.380 --> 01:09.920
So for example my favorite is this one commerce league get a nap.

01:10.040 --> 01:17.770
It's already going up and these into this Aiwass you can change the title to this US Title Fight right.

01:17.930 --> 01:20.330
Then we have this attribute size.

01:20.600 --> 01:29.330
If you remember those attributes we added as size for the bed that was same size.

01:29.330 --> 01:35.930
And you can edit these sorry Wes on the other page configure terms.

01:36.320 --> 01:44.930
You can see that we have added large medium or song and I say these end up in the front end.

01:45.130 --> 01:49.740
You can see that we have the right and we can filter by large medium or small.

01:50.200 --> 01:57.020
So if you have more arms and more attributes you will have more of the bands feel they are mettled right

01:57.150 --> 01:58.160
on the right.

01:58.330 --> 02:03.080
And that's something really nice something that will comer's really provides for you.

02:03.880 --> 02:04.900
You can make some changes.

02:04.900 --> 02:11.170
For example this is that if you have more attributes you will have the ability to change between different

02:11.170 --> 02:12.070
attributes.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.640
But as you can change from my problem.

02:14.890 --> 02:21.840
So you can save these are low lit up language Look ladies.

02:21.890 --> 02:23.450
So this is something nice.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.530
This is by far my favorite.

02:25.880 --> 02:29.480
Where did that come seam with commers.

02:29.520 --> 02:32.130
So what are going to collapse these.

02:32.160 --> 02:38.750
And for example you can either cut open a widget and you cannot got up and caveated the cart is empty.

02:38.790 --> 02:44.310
If you when you can say this and reload and you can see that we have the cart right here.

02:45.850 --> 02:51.080
So for example you can reorder these Housel and load.

02:51.140 --> 02:58.680
You can see now the god is on the top so this functionality is added by all comers.

02:58.680 --> 03:04.060
Again that's another one is for example at the product categories like this one and then say button

03:04.090 --> 03:05.310
at the widget.

03:05.490 --> 03:12.200
You can see why both categories save these and reload categories right.

03:13.410 --> 03:14.980
So let's have another one.

03:16.470 --> 03:17.770
We have the probes search.

03:17.770 --> 03:23.740
If you wanna search on only you can use these when I do on the top.

03:25.270 --> 03:28.970
And Bruhl search.

03:29.210 --> 03:37.220
There is something nice about this search is that let's say these up in these if you have a ready in

03:37.220 --> 03:39.520
their blood we are at three entries.

03:39.920 --> 03:44.650
So for example this one space is final word this word no.

03:44.750 --> 03:54.780
For example web Nolla and you can see that we didn't find any results but if I open this search that

03:54.780 --> 03:57.590
comes with we'll come up with wordpress.

03:57.720 --> 04:08.170
It's up and is one in same these relo skilless Shubham.

04:08.190 --> 04:12.400
Now you can the search and product set and you can make a set for moonlight.

04:12.410 --> 04:16.600
Again this will find the right for the block.

04:16.750 --> 04:23.480
But using the product search search only for brokes in my opinion if we had in there in the shop page

04:23.750 --> 04:29.410
it's a good idea to only display the products that you can control these cutesy essays and I'm going

04:29.410 --> 04:33.200
to show you in upcoming medius.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.300
So let's.

04:34.480 --> 04:41.790
And you can see that we can add drugs pro-tax newcomer's brogues you can add these to the widget use

04:41.850 --> 04:42.260
here.

04:42.260 --> 04:48.170
You can select day are many pros you want to print and show the ropes and everything.

04:48.240 --> 04:55.140
And I think what we're going to use these about in there for food out at the in England that I can still

04:55.290 --> 05:05.340
write up roadblocks and everything what going to save these and reload and then you can see that will

05:05.340 --> 05:06.940
cause some problems right here.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.010
So this is looking nice.

05:10.580 --> 05:15.140
Thanks to these widgets you can have more functionality to your online store.

05:15.350 --> 05:16.910
So let's see how you can hide this.

05:16.910 --> 05:23.290
For example I went to high search and you can expect this and you will find this is search for.

05:23.330 --> 05:27.720
So you can copy these I.D. on the style.

05:27.860 --> 05:34.770
You can have something like search for and we're going to display non.

05:35.040 --> 05:42.310
And that's when I have a comma and then when I hide the other one by default both are going to be added

05:43.840 --> 05:47.490
companies in either Gomer's products.

05:47.820 --> 05:48.750
And then relo

05:52.020 --> 05:54.540
so you can see that we remove both of them.

05:54.840 --> 05:58.480
If you take a look here we can see in the body we have a bunch of different classes.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.480
So for example you can use one of these.

06:00.510 --> 06:06.150
You can see that we have this page so we can copy these and Basie's right here.

06:07.610 --> 06:12.220
And then we can copy these the display.

06:12.220 --> 06:13.210
Block.

06:13.480 --> 06:20.550
Save these and reload and then you can see we have the products that each If you click one of these

06:20.550 --> 06:27.300
products you can see that we have product search because also this one is just in this class with commerce

06:27.300 --> 06:34.290
page all the pages that commerce creates are going to be use in this class and you can see that we're

06:34.290 --> 06:36.160
printing these.

06:36.170 --> 06:43.230
So for example if I open the block I want to grab the sanctuary here and is one the search.

06:43.320 --> 06:52.590
So you can greatly inspect and you can see that we have what would you can see we can use this block

06:53.030 --> 06:56.090
so you can not comment right here.

06:56.460 --> 07:02.670
BLOCK And search for and display block.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.290
These And you can see we have the search.

07:07.360 --> 07:16.270
So this is how you can control the BCBG of the widgets and also just so how you can work with widgets

07:16.600 --> 07:17.940
in your web site.

07:18.250 --> 07:21.560
They are really powerful and they come ready the comer's.
