00:03.830 --> 00:08.640
So in the video I show you how you can remove these stop non-OS like everything.

00:08.750 --> 00:14.480
And then when I come in these lines are when I get everything I read and the comments next.

00:14.470 --> 00:18.240
And then I show you how you can change these.

00:18.320 --> 00:25.100
For example the description to know that name got a fun show on midsouth something here.

00:25.470 --> 00:34.980
Change the title for the description that we're going to function in what we're going to call this one

00:34.980 --> 00:44.340
Corineus by underscore Dayrell that description and what are you getting what are going to run these

00:44.910 --> 00:45.910
in the same field.

00:45.910 --> 00:53.280
That is what I call these Beys right here and what are going to change these function.

00:53.450 --> 01:03.420
We need buzz right here the saying When the buzzer taps and again what do I use a Capri.

01:04.140 --> 01:10.100
And they call Bre and what are going about of dump these steps.

01:10.290 --> 01:19.740
So know these and you can see for example if I went to change the title descript the title IX from description

01:19.740 --> 01:24.530
to another one you can see that we have description and the title.

01:24.540 --> 01:33.340
So with these we can DAPs in we have a description and then we have Dayrell.

01:33.340 --> 01:42.490
This is a way that you access an array in BHB the contents of an array and then I'm going at new title

01:44.820 --> 01:48.960
new ones that are here and then what do an article and apps.

01:49.020 --> 01:56.230
So we override that and then with it on the ballot you know these and then you can see if we have not

01:56.230 --> 01:59.110
died or here we're missing this description.

01:59.140 --> 02:01.730
This one is you see now de-friend hook.

02:02.140 --> 02:09.190
So when I continue we're going out another field or formation gathering in a spa underscore Dayrell

02:09.800 --> 02:15.470
that Gunton description really not long name.

02:15.670 --> 02:20.860
In this case I need to pass the title because we want to remove this title and then we're going out

02:20.860 --> 02:31.430
of the filter the filter for these is where we will combers underscore broke underscore description

02:31.600 --> 02:38.200
on that score heading this is they will commerce function where this is running and this is my function

02:38.210 --> 02:49.010
you can see this is a real long hook in then for example I can have a gay Nicco free and close with

02:49.050 --> 03:01.350
a Capri and then the value that title so save these and reload and you can see that we have this clip

03:01.350 --> 03:02.160
from here.

03:02.490 --> 03:09.790
So again we can use Dayrell equals to new title and then read through on that title.

03:09.930 --> 03:18.450
So the way we can operate this value is and imprint on so many kids who have knit that are here and

03:18.450 --> 03:19.410
yet they are here.

03:19.620 --> 03:20.480
You can click here.

03:20.550 --> 03:25.020
This will open up the second that you can go back.

03:25.050 --> 03:26.590
So this is looking nice.

03:27.630 --> 03:32.410
But the idea here is to display the name of the probe essentially.

03:32.760 --> 03:36.610
And then we are going to show you out essentially right here and right.
