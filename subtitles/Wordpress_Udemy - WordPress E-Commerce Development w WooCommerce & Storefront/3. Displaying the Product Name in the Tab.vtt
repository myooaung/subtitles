00:03.860 --> 00:09.520
In the media I show you how you can change the title of the topic right here and right here in this

00:09.520 --> 00:15.570
video I'm going to show you how to pray in the name of the blog so you can see that we have this new

00:15.670 --> 00:16.820
title here.

00:16.820 --> 00:23.350
And Rachel I'm going up Global Post and you can see that at one of their boys you buy it just by adding

00:23.410 --> 00:24.410
Bree again.

00:25.160 --> 00:36.030
Bree and Boddam that post you will see the contents of this global variable reload and you can see that

00:36.160 --> 00:41.640
up everything you have there the you have the post count and everything that is inside there the door

00:41.640 --> 00:44.290
is going to be in the post content.

00:44.610 --> 00:46.290
And then you can see that the post-Idol.

00:46.290 --> 00:48.060
And of course we have more information.

00:48.930 --> 00:56.290
This case we're going to copy his boss Boston and we're going to remove these and right here and go

00:56.290 --> 00:57.980
into that post.

00:58.150 --> 01:01.270
And this is an object so we can use a different notation.

01:01.270 --> 01:04.450
So to me this post-Idol This is the way you access an object.

01:04.510 --> 01:12.160
And this is the way that you access an array so now you can save these and reload and you can see we

01:12.160 --> 01:15.980
have essentially saying goes right here.

01:16.100 --> 01:22.820
We're going I copy these Global Post and then we're going to copy these in one way or another place

01:22.820 --> 01:25.930
these solder again.

01:26.940 --> 01:30.180
You can see we have essentially you have essentially overheat.

01:30.710 --> 01:33.330
Now that looks better than in description.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.630
So it's been this brokes.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.660
And let's open some products right here we're going up in these.

01:38.750 --> 01:44.960
Maybe these men these one and this one used to test these.

01:45.020 --> 01:47.830
You can see that we have got inspired right here and this is working fine.

01:47.830 --> 01:48.830
Let's close this one.

01:49.660 --> 01:50.420
Censure Lloyd.

01:50.480 --> 01:55.270
Well this was the previous example then that should not throw out a bar.

01:55.350 --> 01:57.680
You can see if we have it we'll be back with three.

01:57.710 --> 02:02.590
And you can see that we don't have a mat nothing here and we're printing these.

02:02.710 --> 02:07.940
So here for example one of the fixes that you can make is to out on the first day stateman

02:10.770 --> 02:20.340
you can use if DAPs and then check for the prescription then you can run these and then you.

02:20.350 --> 02:30.280
And if you so you are checking you there is a description if not you skip this part and are on the taps.

02:30.410 --> 02:38.390
So you know these and you can see that we don't cover that up in case the administrator doesn't.

02:38.410 --> 02:40.260
Those are not any content.

02:40.560 --> 02:45.430
If you remember that that is going to be filled if you add something here.

02:48.530 --> 02:53.930
Update and you can it again to be said the product

02:58.290 --> 02:59.370
and you can see we have that.

02:59.370 --> 03:01.840
We're back with the.

03:02.070 --> 03:02.880
So that's nice.

03:02.880 --> 03:03.690
One of the

03:07.220 --> 03:08.560
and you can see everything is working.

03:08.740 --> 03:13.930
Rick I have to read all these to make change just taking nothing.

03:14.280 --> 03:16.660
I you can see simple codes.

03:17.240 --> 03:21.550
And our Web site is looking better every time in every way.

03:21.950 --> 03:24.000
So let's continue working in the next video.
