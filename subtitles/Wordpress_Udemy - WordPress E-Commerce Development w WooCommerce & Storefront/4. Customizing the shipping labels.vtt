00:04.060 --> 00:06.920
So Latika you can customize these messages directly.

00:06.940 --> 00:10.650
You can see we have lottery system dollars and we have free shipping.

00:10.810 --> 00:18.160
So maybe you want to display something like free shipping three days and flat rate one great one day

00:18.160 --> 00:19.870
of shipping something like that.

00:20.110 --> 00:26.700
So let's up in the United States this year on every and frankly to what are going to be the flat rate.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.380
And this is a mismatch that you can see right here.

00:30.180 --> 00:41.240
So we're going out flat rate you receive your products in the said something charterers maybe when they

00:41.250 --> 00:48.900
ship in something like that save changes and then the free shipping we're going add something like three

00:48.900 --> 00:57.490
day shipping shipping save these and now you can open the checkout and then you can see we have flat

00:57.500 --> 01:02.320
rate one day shipping and $10 and the free shipping three days.

01:02.320 --> 01:09.080
So maybe a person is trying to buy these and they don't mind to spend $10.

01:09.130 --> 01:12.410
In the case that they received they're probably in the next day.

01:12.850 --> 01:15.280
So it's nice to have both options.

01:16.110 --> 01:20.970
So finally in the next video we're going to start working with the other ship in essence here you can

01:20.970 --> 01:25.370
see we've set up North America sort of started working with those in the mix media.
