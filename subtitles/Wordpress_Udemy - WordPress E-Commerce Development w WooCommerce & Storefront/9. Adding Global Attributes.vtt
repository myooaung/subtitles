00:04.070 --> 00:10.760
In the previous videos read these by relations with colors but you can have all the variations that

00:10.760 --> 00:11.500
you want.

00:11.750 --> 00:16.870
So for example let's say that we want to sell different sizes of towels.

00:17.150 --> 00:23.500
So we're going up and here on the left we have attributes and from here on out size it's sort of an

00:23.510 --> 00:26.760
add something called our global attribute.

00:27.290 --> 00:31.740
And this is going to be revealed that you can use on different products.

00:31.830 --> 00:33.750
The sizes really come on.

00:33.980 --> 00:42.000
That is a global attribute because for example you can see we have all of their thousands and you can

00:42.000 --> 00:44.150
use their attributes right here.

00:44.670 --> 00:53.050
So they have the same capital that if I were here maybe they home kids are also sell on different sizes

00:53.460 --> 00:55.340
they candles and everything.

00:55.360 --> 01:02.510
So we're going to create global attributes to be size in the type you can see Salei or text.

01:02.560 --> 01:08.530
We're going to select select option and then when added attribute then we are the dreams.

01:08.530 --> 01:10.300
So we're going to configure configured there.

01:10.330 --> 01:11.790
You're on the right.

01:12.020 --> 01:25.010
And I'm going to have small size me to you know size and lache So your size and they can have large

01:25.370 --> 01:26.760
medium and has more.

01:26.990 --> 01:28.330
So let's open in the well.

01:28.340 --> 01:29.840
And then when I click here on April

01:32.730 --> 01:40.170
and you can scroll up and attributes right here and you can create or load these attributes.

01:40.280 --> 01:47.660
They do a lot but actually with that we kept hearing that it's going to be size and not for a kid you

01:47.660 --> 01:48.810
can select or that.

01:48.830 --> 01:56.330
So for example let's say an up and attributes let's say that we have set in these towers.

01:56.460 --> 02:02.040
I'm going I click you don't go for your terms only on large and small so you can add something like

02:02.760 --> 02:11.240
large and this morning and of course if you wanna meet them you can meet them right here by the fire

02:11.470 --> 02:13.690
and I'm going to remove these.

02:13.690 --> 02:14.980
You can click it on select all.

02:14.980 --> 02:17.700
And this will load all that there is.

02:17.900 --> 02:22.600
And you can actually use these for variations and say attributes

02:26.880 --> 02:34.010
So for example if I update these and relo the front end.

02:34.110 --> 02:42.570
Now you can see if we have size right here and you can select a large medium or a smile towel with your

02:43.160 --> 02:43.890
right here.

02:46.330 --> 02:52.910
So for example you can also add different prices so you can type in variations.

02:52.910 --> 03:01.320
You know another variation you can click here and create variations on the attributes and go.

03:01.350 --> 03:08.910
So now you can see Wickiup yellow in the small and medium Jell-O large red and the different sizes.

03:08.910 --> 03:15.720
So for example when I click on the triangle and the Jell-O in this mall and I'm going to select these

03:16.410 --> 03:19.010
these one said variation.

03:19.280 --> 03:25.180
And for example Jell-O on this more it's gonna cost three and collapses.

03:25.420 --> 03:28.690
And of course I'm not going to have all these sizes.

03:29.700 --> 03:32.740
So click here with this one.

03:32.950 --> 03:38.800
Maybe this one is going to be five and four of the larger version.

03:38.800 --> 03:44.720
I'm going to have so the much and maybe it's going to be seven right here.

03:45.790 --> 03:54.360
So you can update these and you can see I edited the Jell-O color.

03:54.550 --> 04:04.370
So now you can reload the front and and you can see them Jell-O and you can select lache and you can

04:04.370 --> 04:07.470
see seven medium is five.

04:07.700 --> 04:09.540
And there's more work on these study.

04:09.550 --> 04:17.480
So this way you saw the power of creations and how easy you can manage different sizes and colors for

04:17.480 --> 04:21.680
your brogues and this interface is really really flexible.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.830
So attributes in variations are really really powerful.

04:24.850 --> 04:33.770
So and instead of adding a bunch of products using the same name and sharing the same description and

04:33.770 --> 04:35.930
everything you can use have creation.
