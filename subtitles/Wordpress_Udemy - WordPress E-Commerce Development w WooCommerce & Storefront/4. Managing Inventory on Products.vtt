WEBVTT

00:04.280 --> 00:07.060
So let's see some other options that we have right here.

00:07.160 --> 00:12.900
You can see we have these stops and every time you click here you will see that we have different options.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.710
So let's see this in action.

00:16.710 --> 00:23.500
So for example again what I can say is something that we have had already work in.

00:23.510 --> 00:29.460
You can see for example you have the tax status you can you can tell with combers if these broke will

00:29.470 --> 00:31.990
pay taxes or not or not only the sheep.

00:32.080 --> 00:34.190
And so you can clear tax class.

00:34.180 --> 00:39.910
We're going to see tax glassine upcoming because then we have the mentary in front here for example

00:39.910 --> 00:44.040
your Kanab is Esky you.

00:44.240 --> 00:50.840
So for example you can add something like a key that you can use to identify these.

00:50.880 --> 00:58.240
So a Nazi is be a workout in us and then we're going out 0 03 because if you remember this is just in

00:58.240 --> 01:00.910
the 03 it's not something like this.

01:01.060 --> 01:06.430
And I'm going to update saw reload.

01:06.530 --> 01:10.190
Now you can see we have the S-K you and me right here.

01:10.430 --> 01:16.630
So that's something important especially if you are managing the image story.

01:16.790 --> 01:23.930
Now we have here amatory So now you can see we have Menashe stock so you can enable these and then you

01:23.930 --> 01:25.970
can add this stock quantity.

01:25.970 --> 01:33.140
So for example let's say that you are selling or broke something that is really really hard.

01:33.710 --> 01:34.640
You get more.

01:34.640 --> 01:40.170
So for example let's say that you are selling 10 tv's and it's really hard but you get new TVs.

01:40.580 --> 01:49.200
And for example you want to add then and this way we make sure that you are not selling more TVs that

01:49.200 --> 01:50.450
the ones that we have.

01:50.670 --> 01:52.240
So we're going out there and right.

01:52.650 --> 02:00.460
And I'm going to update these and real over the Froment and you can see we have them in stock.

02:00.750 --> 02:09.460
So these Way For example if I try to have 11 you can see that I don't have the king can the more browser

02:09.520 --> 02:10.120
here.

02:10.730 --> 02:17.100
If I have 11 right here using the numbers and not the card you can see that we have an elevation or

02:17.100 --> 02:19.380
right here that's important.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.660
And so for example you can see that we have the image story here.

02:23.870 --> 02:30.340
You can up and combers and then settings and here you will find some options.

02:30.370 --> 02:37.620
So if you can open for other X-ray here and then you have the inventory right here that and for example

02:37.620 --> 02:45.460
you can enable this management if you want to enable or disable the stock management is going to be

02:45.470 --> 02:50.240
right here and you can make some other changes here.

02:50.260 --> 02:57.470
So for example you have the notifications and you can enable low estopped notifications or office notifications

02:57.560 --> 03:06.870
of this will send you a notification saying that this or some brawl broke doesn't have an end of a stock.

03:07.180 --> 03:11.280
So it's going to tell you that if you enable notifications.

03:11.350 --> 03:17.650
So let's say for example if I had three right here and I'm going out to the car you can see every have

03:17.760 --> 03:19.380
in a stock.

03:19.380 --> 03:22.580
If you open a camera you can see that we have called this dog.

03:22.950 --> 03:25.980
And you can see all this stock for on pay orders.

03:26.340 --> 03:34.370
This is the amount of minutes that you are given into they use they use air or the B-story recite before

03:34.370 --> 03:36.200
you cancel the order.

03:36.350 --> 03:39.040
And this stock is going to be added again.

03:39.350 --> 03:43.470
So for example in this case it's going to be then I added three.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.470
It's going to be seven on the stock.

03:45.710 --> 03:54.600
But if I don't finish the purchase in 60 minutes is it going to cancel the order and he's going to have

03:54.960 --> 03:56.410
then again right here.

03:57.510 --> 04:03.050
So that's important especially if you plan to run a sale or something.

04:03.210 --> 04:10.510
Or maybe increase mass where people is more and more stuff these like that you can control everything.

04:10.960 --> 04:15.670
And so this is important you have the lowest dropout rates and you can take it on or you can cover in

04:15.730 --> 04:22.040
here and there the question mark and you can see when pro stock reaches this amount you will be notified

04:22.050 --> 04:27.960
by email if you're selling something that you can get from one day to another you can add these two

04:27.960 --> 04:35.070
two or three and this one effect your Web site of course this will depend on the kind of products that

04:35.070 --> 04:39.450
you're selling and you can see we have all of our stock price fall.

04:39.530 --> 04:43.870
You can see if I again over here you will find more information.

04:43.890 --> 04:52.670
So when the stock breaches this amount this stock is Daddles will change to all of its stock.

04:52.980 --> 05:01.750
So for example once you are in zero is going to tell the users that we don't have enough stock and that's

05:01.930 --> 05:07.960
important especially for example some of my clients decide that they want to have two or three because

05:08.020 --> 05:14.950
it's really common that some of the products that they are selling out of that match or something in

05:15.100 --> 05:21.270
this way they ensure that they can send all the products to their clients.

05:21.550 --> 05:27.670
Finally you can see we have this display on the bottom you can see that we have always show quantity

05:28.360 --> 05:29.200
to alienness stock.

05:29.200 --> 05:33.480
If I open the break you can see that we have Dandini stuck right here.

05:33.550 --> 05:39.340
We'll Gomer's again I'm going to select the second option only show quantitive remain in stock when

05:39.340 --> 05:40.260
lo.

05:40.720 --> 05:45.580
So when I select these I'm going to change the numbers here are going on low stock five.

05:45.580 --> 05:47.620
So why don't I save changes.

05:49.080 --> 05:54.070
They even 30 and they're not three right here are they.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.280
And really the front end and I you can see we have only three left in this stock.

06:01.370 --> 06:08.180
So this is where you control these only two and the lowest stock price will.

06:08.180 --> 06:16.130
So finally if you want to show any of these you can never show you the quantity and reload and you will

06:16.130 --> 06:19.050
find that it's based on only in in a stock.

06:19.310 --> 06:23.210
So this is how you can control the display of the inventory.

06:23.210 --> 06:27.670
We've had these calmer settings and of course we're going to continue working with these taps.

06:27.680 --> 06:34.460
This was only a small example of something that can be done in commerce the management of the minatory.
