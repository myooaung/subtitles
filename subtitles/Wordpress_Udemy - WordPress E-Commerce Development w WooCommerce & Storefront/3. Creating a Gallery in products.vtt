WEBVTT

00:04.600 --> 00:06.510
So we're going to have another program.

00:06.590 --> 00:13.510
They the activities that we have more products the more pros you have the better today.

00:14.460 --> 00:21.090
This thought is going to look good and so we start working with a team and a store front and so they

00:21.100 --> 00:32.020
goes in upcoming medius if you went on another pro you can click on produce we will find the least of

00:32.230 --> 00:33.330
our products.

00:33.410 --> 00:38.600
You can see we have a stock we have in stock that categories and tags and all of those.

00:38.680 --> 00:44.280
So on the top you can click here are not new and you can create and you broke in this case.

00:44.290 --> 00:45.640
We're going to add this 03.

00:45.640 --> 00:49.740
You can see we have some good and we have four different images.

00:50.020 --> 00:51.920
So we're going at home cued right here.

00:53.350 --> 00:55.360
And I'm going up and their product list.

00:55.490 --> 00:58.030
You can see we have backup kit right here.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.970
And we have these short descriptions.

01:00.970 --> 01:02.770
We're going to copy these.

01:02.770 --> 01:05.720
Scroll to the bottom and we're going at these right here.

01:05.830 --> 01:13.140
The price is going to be 15 So we're going at 15 here and we're going to add a new category one at home

01:13.160 --> 01:24.560
gets it's right here and we're going to add pro-tax or something like pamper yourself and these.

01:24.630 --> 01:27.140
So next on the right you have produce a match.

01:27.150 --> 01:33.420
So by the way for example if you're one that broke imagine you can do arrange these in the right.

01:33.460 --> 01:34.320
Pull it up.

01:34.320 --> 01:39.060
In my case I think this is a better place sort of this year on the top.

01:39.390 --> 01:46.540
And I'm going I said the future truly much and I'm going to select these fears match so they can track

01:46.820 --> 01:47.500
right here.

01:47.560 --> 01:57.300
It's going to be a bladder to the server and you can set the match and polish so from here we can click

01:57.300 --> 02:03.690
here on these and up and these in that open season on your top.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.580
So now you can see we have the come.

02:05.650 --> 02:10.840
We have the price and we have the description and we think they were received we have the match.

02:10.980 --> 02:14.080
So that's nice as well we have done so far.

02:14.100 --> 02:19.290
So for example if I go back to the April page you can see that we also have the gallery so you can click

02:19.290 --> 02:24.260
here on that gallery and from Keary you can add all the images.

02:24.270 --> 02:28.110
So going out to three and four and click and drag right here.

02:30.590 --> 02:32.940
So you can see that these when you select.

02:33.110 --> 02:41.510
So and then when I see like these on I select all these images and that to the gallery and then you

02:41.510 --> 02:48.380
can see they got it because for you much so that you can rearrange the images in everything or you can

02:48.380 --> 02:54.200
remove any match if you don't want to show that the match or if you select the green you can remove

02:54.200 --> 03:01.700
the straight you song on a click you don't update and then going up in the computer.

03:03.290 --> 03:05.370
And you can see how they got gravity.

03:05.510 --> 03:10.760
And of course these may be a little different based again on the gameplay that you're using.

03:11.240 --> 03:17.330
So the game here you can click on the magnifying glass and you can see that we have the match on the

03:17.650 --> 03:23.150
show and you can click on these arrows and you can see that we're got the.

03:23.380 --> 03:27.150
So that's something nice that you have these images available.

03:27.190 --> 03:30.240
You can see that in I added four images right here.

03:30.320 --> 03:33.660
And should we have fight he's taking the feature emerged as.

03:33.690 --> 03:40.820
So we're going to remove these if we use the match and update reload.

03:40.850 --> 03:44.550
So now we have only four images and it's working great.

03:45.780 --> 03:51.660
So for example if I open again you can see that we have the regular price and we also have the same

03:51.660 --> 03:52.170
price.

03:52.170 --> 03:56.400
For example let's say that this is the regular price is 15.

03:56.640 --> 03:57.760
And we have a sale.

03:57.810 --> 04:00.540
And this is $10.

04:00.900 --> 04:05.400
We're going to play these and reload.

04:05.420 --> 04:11.450
So now you can see that we have 15 and you can see that we have these on the line.

04:11.450 --> 04:13.990
And then we kept in.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.090
So that's something that you can really easily add the regular price and the sale price.

04:20.420 --> 04:25.390
And for example you can eat on a schedule and you can select this sale price.

04:25.490 --> 04:31.640
So let's say you have a big sale on the weekend and you can ask for example here.

04:32.040 --> 04:38.600
19 And then you can at the end of the sell maybe on Monday 21.

04:38.650 --> 04:46.680
So the sale price is going to be applied only on those dates from the 19th to any one of our goods in

04:46.690 --> 04:47.860
this way.

04:47.860 --> 04:55.730
For example you can prepare your sale in the week and once a week and you don't have to do anything.

04:55.900 --> 05:04.840
Well commerce will handle the sale price and the sale price Zahed And once that's over it's going to

05:04.840 --> 05:05.980
remove that.

05:06.430 --> 05:07.890
That sale price.

05:08.230 --> 05:09.830
So that's something really nice.

05:09.990 --> 05:15.070
So you don't cancel something really nice and that you can make a year younger am I going to cancel

05:15.070 --> 05:17.600
these and I'm going up that

05:21.690 --> 05:26.950
so in the next video we're going to continue working with these and we're going to have more products.
