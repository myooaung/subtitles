In the previous video I show you how to that they pile into your website.

00:08.900 --> 00:15.070
But for example if you open the extensions in commerce you will find payments and you will see all the

00:15.070 --> 00:19.870
different plans that you have available in combers.

00:20.110 --> 00:27.360
You've got to make sure for example you can see Pay-Pal this one is free but there is a different version

00:27.380 --> 00:35.820
of PayPal which costs $79 they credit got payments directly into your account.

00:35.870 --> 00:37.560
You've seen people bro.

00:37.940 --> 00:40.090
We have another paper right here.

00:40.220 --> 00:41.370
We also have a stripe.

00:41.380 --> 00:46.350
We have a square and other Paypal extension right here.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.950
You can see the prices are from zero to 79.

00:49.980 --> 00:54.070
So I must say is free to rise up man.

00:54.110 --> 01:00.120
This one has a an and everything you can see here we have a bunch of different options that you can

01:00.120 --> 01:04.090
use say a spade a spade and everything.

01:05.150 --> 01:09.650
Of course covering all of these cards is going to be really really tedious.

01:10.070 --> 01:15.650
And as you can for example make the surge based on the country that you are living in.

01:15.650 --> 01:21.580
So for example and that said something like well it's on my country Mexico.

01:21.680 --> 01:24.490
And then you can see in my country when they have this available.

01:24.560 --> 01:32.180
So you've got to make sure you check out fares your your country and check that this payment gave rates

01:32.180 --> 01:37.000
are valid in your country and then you can decide which ones you want to take in your website.

01:37.070 --> 01:44.180
Of course you can also create your own but you will need to know some BHB in javascript to work with

01:44.200 --> 01:46.180
these bad.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.330
My recommendation is to use one of these.

01:48.340 --> 01:49.540
They are secure.

01:49.540 --> 01:52.360
They are the Bellot by the creators of newcomer's.
