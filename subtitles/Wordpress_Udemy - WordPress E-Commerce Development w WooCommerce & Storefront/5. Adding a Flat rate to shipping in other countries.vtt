00:04.160 --> 00:09.000
Sort of start working with the other ship and so on that we have set up you can see we come North America

00:09.510 --> 00:11.730
and the regions are Canada and Mexico.

00:11.730 --> 00:19.480
So let's get here on Mary and from here we're going to have on the flat rate so will flat rate and other

00:19.530 --> 00:21.080
sheet metal.

00:21.140 --> 00:22.860
So that's it.

00:23.270 --> 00:29.990
And maybe you want to have $20 in the case that we have some clients from Mexico or Canada because sending

00:29.990 --> 00:34.680
probes to those countries is more expensive if we're living in the United States.

00:34.680 --> 00:43.550
So remember the codes that I showed you previously you can have quantity to charge 20 times the quantity

00:43.550 --> 00:46.490
of the product or you can also add the cost.

00:46.700 --> 00:54.980
The cost of the current times a percentage of something in my case rental at any say changes and you

00:54.980 --> 00:56.600
can see we have flat rate.

00:56.750 --> 01:03.920
So that's up in or check out relo and you can see we have United States and we have flat rate one day

01:03.920 --> 01:04.980
in free shipping.

01:05.270 --> 01:10.050
So maybe that's where we change the country to Canada.

01:10.370 --> 01:16.080
Now you can see we had flat rate of 20 in knots and we made the change to Mexico.

01:16.520 --> 01:20.250
We are going to have the same result flat rate 20 that's fine.

01:20.550 --> 01:28.470
So let's say that we want to buy something from a country that say that you don't lead right here.

01:28.470 --> 01:31.380
You can see that there are more shipping methods.

01:31.610 --> 01:32.730
So that's nice.

01:32.850 --> 01:40.010
You can see the power of shipping sands and shipping methods and how you can charge different prices

01:40.610 --> 01:43.630
if your clients are from different countries.

01:43.850 --> 01:49.060
So the next we were going out the price for the rest of the war we're going to use these location not

01:49.070 --> 01:52.300
covers by your songs in the mix media.
