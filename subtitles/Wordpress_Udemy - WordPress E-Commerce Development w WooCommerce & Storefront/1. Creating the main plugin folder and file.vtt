00:04.280 --> 00:12.100
So let's see how you can create what Oprah's or communist blue yin that will display.

00:12.100 --> 00:17.630
I like that here on the front end instead of printing this coupon we're going to see how you can print

00:18.110 --> 00:24.310
some brokes Sarmast Bashar brokes that we want to display as a feature prose in the front and we're

00:24.320 --> 00:28.280
going to be x' like library is a responsively equity continents like that.

00:28.550 --> 00:33.890
I'd really like to use these blue Union unmuzzled of my web sites that I'm developing irresponsive is

00:33.890 --> 00:35.570
free and is equerry.

00:35.660 --> 00:40.610
So that means it's fully compatible with different browsers.

00:40.610 --> 00:48.790
So first we're going to create a new file on we're going to navigate to the content Ankita and billions

00:48.830 --> 00:55.460
we're going to create a new folder what we're going to call this WC is like the new comers layer and

00:55.480 --> 00:57.060
we're going to create new files to keep the name.

00:57.070 --> 01:05.090
This is the four letter which is dated to that be next is going to be right here and we're going to

01:05.090 --> 01:14.320
add some extra information on about the so whether or not these blue you name ROOYEN name soon to be

01:14.310 --> 01:22.580
ex like they're for will come as they were going that blue when you arrive you have a Web site you can

01:22.870 --> 01:32.040
add these right here at my web site you see what I'm doing we're going to add the description if you

01:32.040 --> 01:40.620
submit these into the Wordpress report this is the way that people can find your plan X X either into

01:40.980 --> 01:46.330
commers finally or makes or not version 1.0.

01:46.740 --> 01:52.840
It's going to be a new version that we're working day out or you can add your name Mangwana mine re

01:54.310 --> 02:00.520
And then we're going to lay out of you are right in this case we're already highlighted the Web site

02:00.520 --> 02:09.200
so you cannot leave this blank and I'm going to add that this is a man and we're going to use commers.

02:09.270 --> 02:14.370
So with these NSA these and up and they back in employees

02:17.090 --> 02:25.300
scroll to the bottom very dry here you can see we have the X slider for newcomers and we have a blue.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.080
So we're going to activate these.

02:28.320 --> 02:32.280
Now that it's activated we're going to add something here.

02:32.750 --> 02:39.010
Or if someone opens these directly.

02:39.070 --> 02:47.240
So for example let's say that we have a variable or the EU for equals to the name something like that

02:48.400 --> 02:53.690
and let's say that someone is trying to up in these directly into the red.

02:53.970 --> 03:02.560
So we're going to add something like Dolby content means the U.S. is Leider the loosies like that that

03:02.590 --> 03:03.280
BHB

03:06.170 --> 03:08.870
you can see that we've had divi named right here.

03:09.290 --> 03:14.600
So right away something like these are probably like these we need to add something on the top where

03:14.620 --> 03:26.830
we're going to define what are going to use constantly is that or would they we're going to have a as

03:26.990 --> 03:31.630
go away so save these and know they can see we can go our way.

03:31.640 --> 03:38.270
This is the way that you can prevent people from log in your Bruijn like these because most of the trillions

03:38.270 --> 03:43.570
have sensitive data and such as these that have his name.

03:43.970 --> 03:51.190
And this is a way that WordPress provides to secure our little your and rescue.

03:51.440 --> 03:55.790
And then as we do we're going to continue developing these were commerce Blouin.
