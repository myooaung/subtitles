00:04.210 --> 00:10.840
So in the next three videos I'm going to show you one modification you Cynthia says grand you in the

00:10.900 --> 00:12.010
template.

00:12.250 --> 00:20.470
And the last one is going to be using books so you can see the difference motiveless in and the limits

00:20.800 --> 00:22.080
of each one.

00:22.540 --> 00:30.190
So for example I have these images and I want to I've asked you if dig into these images.

00:30.670 --> 00:36.370
So first I'm going to Right-Click in the big the Elliman and you can click on these.

00:36.570 --> 00:42.350
I can the first one and click right here in the match so you on the right you can see that we have selected.

00:42.350 --> 00:51.600
So what I'm going to copy these AM Basie's into or just dodge so fearless I went I wept.

00:52.390 --> 01:00.600
And then when I feel this when gonna have a great escape and I'm going out 100 percent then.

01:00.630 --> 01:09.960
And when I feel that and it's going to be the same is going to be grayscale that's all 100 percent then

01:09.960 --> 01:13.190
I'm going to copy and paste right here.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.540
And I'm going get it right here.

01:16.690 --> 01:27.910
So it is going to be when I put the mouse about the much when I add the mouse into the match.

01:27.910 --> 01:35.260
So this is going to be the Harbor event we have Colver in we're going to change the greyscale from 100

01:35.260 --> 01:37.870
percent to zero.

01:39.260 --> 01:48.040
Save these and reload and you can see that we have the grayscale at 100 percent.

01:48.200 --> 01:54.900
If I covered you can see we have these with zero percent.

01:54.930 --> 02:00.360
So this is a nice effect that you can achieve with some CSSA you can see that we are not in the order

02:00.360 --> 02:02.240
there or anything.

02:02.490 --> 02:12.670
And this is good and this is a good example where you can use Jasus to change color or sizes and margins

02:12.700 --> 02:14.580
and everything in your design.

02:14.620 --> 02:17.690
So let's add another one great here I'm going out.

02:17.860 --> 02:19.790
That's form.

02:19.990 --> 02:21.560
And I'm going up rotate.

02:21.820 --> 02:25.560
And you can pass a number of degrees and then at seven.

02:25.780 --> 02:32.260
Well the A-G degree degrees and then I copy these and I'm going to add some prefixes you can see you

02:32.260 --> 02:36.990
here the web kid web kid is for Chrome but not other ones.

02:37.000 --> 02:45.650
Emir's for Microsoft's Internet Explorer edge and then I'm going out with colossal sun and at 71 degrees.

02:45.750 --> 02:52.030
So you can say these adult you can see the maturity or rotate it rotated and then when I got these and

02:52.030 --> 02:59.060
I'm going to add these two to the hardware Angwin we are in not a model.

03:00.230 --> 03:04.420
It's going to be Cyril so low.

03:04.520 --> 03:11.670
And when they come out you can see it rotates in that so applies a different color Well you can see

03:11.670 --> 03:13.050
this looks a little weird right.

03:13.050 --> 03:21.090
You can see that we don't have any more transition so we can add something like Nancy shoon all that

03:21.100 --> 03:33.330
five seconds is so say these hand reload and I can see that we have a nice animation you.

03:33.450 --> 03:37.250
So this is where CSX is really handy.

03:37.500 --> 03:45.640
So let's have one final transmission right here and then open my 84 and race and I'm going to transform.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.910
And in this case I'm going to use this.

03:48.190 --> 03:57.550
One buoying one is going to scale in 10 percent you can see how wonderkid and 1.1 This is the X and

03:57.550 --> 03:58.940
this is on the Y.

03:59.080 --> 04:00.900
So Rouleau.

04:01.140 --> 04:07.130
And when I quote You can see the much bigger if you want to apply it rotate.

04:07.130 --> 04:11.180
In this case you can cut these in and page right here.

04:12.780 --> 04:13.890
And remove these.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.970
So we only have one transformer you can see what a brilliant rotate in this game.

04:18.080 --> 04:19.890
So save these and reload again.

04:21.670 --> 04:23.040
And you can see up there.

04:23.050 --> 04:26.230
And he says scaling.

04:26.300 --> 04:33.410
So this is where CSSA is really handy if you want apply these kind of transition transforms animations

04:33.640 --> 04:34.710
change color.

04:34.880 --> 04:36.490
The special effects.

04:36.500 --> 04:39.160
This is where this is going to be really helpful for you.
