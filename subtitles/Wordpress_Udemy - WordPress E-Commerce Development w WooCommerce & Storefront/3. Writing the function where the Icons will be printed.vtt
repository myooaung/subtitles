00:03.950 --> 00:11.280
So let's continue working in this video we're gonna have this section with the icons.

00:11.300 --> 00:17.740
So again we're going to use some partial hooks and what are going on over here on the home page.

00:17.990 --> 00:24.830
You can see that the coupon has some priority then and because they will resign or on priority 20.

00:24.830 --> 00:29.110
So we need to have a number between these two.

00:29.150 --> 00:38.050
So right here I'm going to have brain features with icons and we're going to have a function.

00:38.060 --> 00:44.350
Good or bad that underscore is play on our features.

00:45.630 --> 00:55.140
And again we're going to have an action to impeach and then we're going to companies based here and

00:55.140 --> 01:06.240
that really maybe we're going to add something like 50 or pagers and sameas and that's remove these

01:06.270 --> 01:11.060
stop shall we hooks and you can see it's looking great feature.

01:11.250 --> 01:13.140
So we can add that.

01:13.170 --> 01:16.870
So next we're going to make something tricky right here.

01:17.360 --> 01:25.230
If you take a look at the site you can see that this section will expand to the edges.

01:25.410 --> 01:31.210
It's going to take all of the weight that is available similar to this bar that we have right here.

01:31.680 --> 01:36.770
You can see right there right here that keeps the Canton center.

01:37.360 --> 01:44.860
But the bar expands to the edges and we need to have something really similar.

01:46.140 --> 01:52.560
And in order to do something like this we need to close the demand right here if we inspect the code

01:54.450 --> 02:02.320
and let's pick these right right here you can see that we have these men Condon's who need to close

02:02.320 --> 02:04.220
these millennia.

02:04.240 --> 02:11.140
When it was so close the main attack and the primary so close in these three tags.

02:11.200 --> 02:19.130
And we also need to close these the we call for the colorful is the one that I saw in this container.

02:19.210 --> 02:29.430
We need to close these main these primary and this golf ball then we need to have the the icons.

02:29.710 --> 02:33.550
So we're going to again we're going to close the beach be blog right here.

02:34.500 --> 02:35.770
In a big speech.

02:35.980 --> 02:38.080
So here's what we're going to close them.

02:38.150 --> 02:41.400
The main three main

02:44.350 --> 02:48.480
main is going from the top then we're going to close the

02:51.370 --> 02:53.390
primary so we have another common.

02:55.140 --> 02:57.160
Primary.

02:57.220 --> 03:02.010
And finally we need to close the call for this one race.

03:06.940 --> 03:11.110
So that we can at something like features here.

03:12.470 --> 03:18.940
And now this feature here is going to be added in the left so we're going to be pushed to the left.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.480
And you can see it's looking great.

03:20.480 --> 03:27.930
We have features here right here so we close these thing we need to find a way to have or continue working

03:27.930 --> 03:34.320
because you can see from the feature here to the bottom all the content is missed out.

03:34.440 --> 03:42.990
So we need to add something else so fierce I'm going to have a db with the class called for.

03:43.370 --> 03:48.170
So now if you take a look here we're going to add these classes again so we're going to restore what

03:48.170 --> 03:53.760
we have close we need to have only the opening because the closing are already there.

03:54.590 --> 03:57.490
So we to they call the fool.

03:57.780 --> 04:02.580
Then I have another one called content area.

04:02.580 --> 04:09.660
If you take a look here in the design we have this primary but this is using an ID called primary and

04:09.660 --> 04:11.750
you only have one ID per page.

04:11.850 --> 04:17.430
So are you going to use that class at the end the the class is the one that contains all the styling

04:17.820 --> 04:20.530
you can see that we can be selected for here.

04:20.750 --> 04:23.920
Or do why not use content area.

04:23.950 --> 04:27.690
And finally what are going out there when it is called site.

04:27.700 --> 04:31.600
The main site main ads is right here.

04:31.780 --> 04:36.470
This means that an answer contains some select or so we need to close the straits.

04:37.210 --> 04:41.630
So you can see we close three packs and then we open 3.

04:41.770 --> 04:45.740
You know that we have ahead is going to be added insights here.

04:46.150 --> 04:54.910
So first I'm going to add a theme that we have home features features is going to be the selector that

04:54.910 --> 05:02.380
we're going to use throughout these color then if they can in the design this section is inside the

05:02.380 --> 05:07.210
container so we're going to write another one that's going to be called for.

05:07.510 --> 05:13.330
So this is going to have the inside of the container.

05:13.440 --> 05:24.860
So now we got something like feature Skeeter say these closes and reload.

05:24.910 --> 05:30.370
So now you can see that we have features here and now we continue when we scroll.

05:30.370 --> 05:39.600
We continue covering everything as we did before so inside this golfball with home features is where

05:39.600 --> 05:43.380
we are going to have the call to display the icons.

05:43.500 --> 05:46.500
So let's see if you can do that in the next video.
