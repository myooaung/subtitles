Search really come on that a lot of e-commerce Web site have a built on Raheel that is cleaner or empty

00:12.430 --> 00:13.280
their car.

00:13.670 --> 00:18.920
And then I show you how to simulate what Andre something really simple.

00:18.920 --> 00:26.880
And what when I click it on simple hooks and on the bottom we have these are there buttons you can see

00:26.880 --> 00:29.530
that we have these combers actions.

00:29.540 --> 00:30.760
Why don't I copy these.

00:30.880 --> 00:39.900
Cook and we're going up in the fashion that BHB site display on to live.

00:39.960 --> 00:40.650
They got

00:43.910 --> 00:48.410
another function where they're going to call these when we got our back.

00:49.470 --> 00:50.240
Empty.

00:50.350 --> 00:54.790
Got a and what going to have this action

00:57.900 --> 01:01.290
Commander Scott action saying what are going to Kabui these in-phase right here.

01:03.800 --> 01:07.240
So here we're going to print and they boot onto clear.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.000
They got it.

01:08.120 --> 01:14.380
So I'm gonna close BHB and up in BHB again so we can add some issue.

01:14.410 --> 01:20.670
And I when I have an anchor in I'm going to add a class fears when at last the class is going to be

01:20.670 --> 01:22.950
built troops who are in this class.

01:22.970 --> 01:25.840
But aren't we willing carry these.

01:25.930 --> 01:30.910
And then the we really carried this style in for the buten the Wooten's that we have here.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.680
So this is a glider resupply.

01:33.950 --> 01:41.360
And Kiran daj Rev I'm going to ask this question mark and we're going to have mt

01:44.350 --> 01:51.720
equals two through and Grace I'm going to out empty.

01:51.960 --> 02:01.960
Got it sameas and relo these so you can see we have mt got right here.

02:02.950 --> 02:06.800
If you click here nothing is going to change because you can see when the up empty car right here.

02:06.820 --> 02:13.430
But you can see the contents out of there when it will ride the function that will read this empty Garforth

02:13.430 --> 02:14.150
at the top.

02:15.290 --> 02:18.480
So what I would write another fire engine would not function.

02:20.510 --> 02:24.870
And we're going to call this one and that's bad in this case I'm going I've got to ask but I'm thicker

02:25.080 --> 02:31.350
than and in this case I'm going at these right here.

02:31.640 --> 02:36.270
So this is going to be the fashion that we actually believe.

02:36.460 --> 02:39.330
Got one of the live action in this case.

02:39.330 --> 02:40.940
I'm going to use a need.

02:40.950 --> 02:44.890
So we have access to some variables that we having newcomers.

02:45.570 --> 02:52.680
And then what happens he says the second argument of the function and what we're going to use if you

02:52.680 --> 02:53.260
said.

02:53.430 --> 02:57.250
So you can see here on the dub we've had these empty empty Gartrell.

02:57.330 --> 03:01.560
So we're checking that this actually sees.

03:01.630 --> 03:09.920
So what if you set in what are going to use get empty in case that these.

03:13.100 --> 03:16.390
We're going to have global commerce.

03:16.390 --> 03:25.610
So using global commerce you have access to for example Scott and we're going to use commerce.

03:26.650 --> 03:32.600
And here we have come out and we cover our special metals call empty.

03:32.820 --> 03:37.130
Got to clear the Scott.

03:37.350 --> 03:45.310
So we make that so let's remove these some of these hands on you were right that got you can see the

03:45.310 --> 03:50.720
contents right here and we have these empty cart we can appreciate an empty cart Megan we have empty

03:50.750 --> 03:51.620
carry is through.

03:51.730 --> 03:55.390
And you can see your card is currently empty.

03:56.520 --> 04:01.430
So the way with this simple code you're going to have an empty cart.

04:01.530 --> 04:02.040
Bottom.
