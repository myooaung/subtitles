00:04.130 --> 00:07.940
So let's study save the amount less of what I call PBS.

00:07.940 --> 00:11.770
And I went up on the my stage.

00:13.590 --> 00:18.580
Save a mount and we're going to ask.

00:18.860 --> 00:23.330
Sufficient I'm going to change the color I'm going at 3 3 3 is going to be a great color so we're kind

00:23.330 --> 00:26.180
of low in.

00:26.250 --> 00:33.050
Well says might change we're going to have our cell phone size wind going to him.

00:33.050 --> 00:35.980
So say the center line.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.920
Now you can see the same amount is bigger.

00:39.790 --> 00:46.450
And for example you can use a phone wait seven candidate and reload.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.000
You can see that it takes.

00:49.200 --> 00:54.450
So we telling the user that they are saving $5.

00:54.500 --> 01:02.750
Then we're going out the padding point three m and Gwen them and I'm going to show you why I did these

01:02.750 --> 01:03.300
by.

01:03.450 --> 01:10.280
So you can see for example if I want to change is the same color takes in these different colors.

01:10.410 --> 01:15.260
I can inspect these and you will find soon or there's Hispan response.

01:15.590 --> 01:21.520
So for example here I have the same amount and it only has the same but as we have these will commerce

01:21.590 --> 01:25.990
trace amount will commerce price Gorin symbol.

01:26.120 --> 01:29.920
So what going to this is what has caused this amount collapse.

01:29.920 --> 01:36.110
What I to use these glass say amount and then save the amount.

01:36.110 --> 01:37.040
Sorry.

01:37.400 --> 01:44.870
Then what going out and what are the chances 2 3 3 3 4 in size we're going to change it to one them

01:45.940 --> 01:48.630
in the fun way we're watching these two.

01:49.620 --> 01:55.790
So save these low and you can see the same.

01:56.110 --> 01:58.790
They seem walled off one.

01:59.370 --> 02:00.630
And this one is normal.

02:03.520 --> 02:16.390
So for example right here in I went to either my decoration for example nice big color and race it I'm

02:16.390 --> 02:24.500
going to copy these and right here I'm going up to the bottom to pixels solid.

02:25.160 --> 02:26.730
And then that color.

02:27.150 --> 02:34.020
So save these and read all the Froning and you can see we can say maybe we got something like water

02:34.020 --> 02:42.760
there you know the directions or maybe you can either green color or.

02:42.820 --> 02:45.580
So for example you can use it on the browser.

02:45.590 --> 02:55.710
You can make these I can play cricket and you can use this color picker to select a better color to

02:55.710 --> 02:57.160
display the same amount

03:01.600 --> 03:03.210
so maybe these one will work

03:10.610 --> 03:12.310
and then we're going to have a margin.

03:12.350 --> 03:20.660
So for example Rachida Madigan top of one am these play inline block

03:24.170 --> 03:30.490
so maybe as Mother number point five m Yeah something like that.

03:30.660 --> 03:34.900
So what I'm going to copy these groups and page right here

03:38.120 --> 03:46.930
now you can close and reload and you can see because say us $5 maybe this looks bigger than these one.

03:46.930 --> 03:47.590
Right.

03:47.950 --> 03:56.560
So we can make something like 8 AM and reload something like these will work better I think.

03:56.860 --> 04:01.860
And so the sale of the cell message is hard to see.

04:02.010 --> 04:10.810
And this is big these is back and right here you can see that we have this Hispan class on sale so we

04:10.810 --> 04:14.220
can add something here on sale.

04:14.800 --> 04:29.430
And I'm going to add a background color color really good for C and E for C and save these and reload.

04:29.480 --> 04:34.420
You can see that we have these including what are going to change the color of the text to white collar

04:34.440 --> 04:35.380
white.

04:35.990 --> 04:37.430
And finally I'm going to

04:40.290 --> 04:48.630
border on this is when I remove that blackboard that so now you can see we can sail and of course the

04:48.970 --> 04:50.050
font size.

04:50.050 --> 04:55.000
So we're going to get something for one size right here 1.2 M for example.

04:55.240 --> 04:56.810
This blade is a little bigger.

04:58.040 --> 05:06.600
So what I'm saying is 1.2 M we can close these and reload and then you can see we can say it and then

05:06.600 --> 05:18.760
we have save the and we can at some I think is say because save is if they really add this into the

05:18.840 --> 05:26.670
cut so we can save you for example you can click here on the shop and this way for example you can see

05:26.670 --> 05:32.100
we have Saybrook here and we can you can see here is this is really really small and I think that we

05:32.100 --> 05:37.860
can make this a little way or a little bigger maybe one of them.

05:37.950 --> 05:41.130
All these see is looking better.

05:41.450 --> 05:49.300
And now we have the same message in all the products and also the ones that have some savings.

05:49.400 --> 05:54.260
We are displaying these say $5 that's looking nice.

05:54.260 --> 05:57.650
So for example this double back with three we can open these.

05:58.250 --> 06:11.540
And indeed the pro and he had lots of special offer and maybe 25 an update these reloaded thrown in.

06:12.280 --> 06:19.090
And then you can see we can say and then we've had this message say you crazy ten dollars and this is

06:19.090 --> 06:19.980
looking nice.

06:21.140 --> 06:27.750
So in the next video let's see how you can print a percentage say instead of the dollars.
