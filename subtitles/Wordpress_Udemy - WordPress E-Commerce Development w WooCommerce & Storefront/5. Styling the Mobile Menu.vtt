00:04.380 --> 00:11.300
So let's have some success for the movie menu for these men and men are going to have another common

00:12.130 --> 00:13.300
movie menu.

00:15.210 --> 00:22.500
And for example I'm going to beg the call again but and of course in this course we're not going to

00:22.500 --> 00:24.740
inspect everything.

00:24.830 --> 00:32.700
We really started working with this CSA and this is the way that you can find the CSA that is.

00:33.240 --> 00:34.770
So you can override it.

00:35.250 --> 00:38.100
But also you can see the selectors right here.

00:38.130 --> 00:40.200
That's is a really powerful tool.

00:40.230 --> 00:43.610
I use this every day when I'm working.

00:43.610 --> 00:48.590
We then played the comparison or there were produced templates.

00:49.580 --> 00:55.470
So for example if Waynesburg right here you will find the mobile menus using these handheld navigation

00:55.490 --> 01:03.700
so we're going to copy these page right here and we're going to the background color that they can look

01:03.700 --> 01:05.480
at on their color guide.

01:05.500 --> 01:12.280
Are going to use this color Basie's and save these and reload.

01:12.330 --> 01:17.030
Now you can click on the menu and you can see we have a lot going on like this.

01:17.040 --> 01:19.470
And of course you can select a different color right here.

01:19.470 --> 01:25.330
And so for example on gray call or reload.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.160
Here you can see something like these.

01:28.200 --> 01:37.560
Or you can select this color of the Pink or we can reload menu and you can see something like this.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.890
In my opinion this color looks better using these

01:44.800 --> 01:48.010
sort reload and clicking on menu.

01:48.010 --> 01:49.780
Now you can see we have something like this.

01:50.150 --> 01:59.980
So next for example if I happened they you add all these menu items to use in the list list.

02:00.070 --> 02:09.740
So we're going to copy these and we're going to have you with Ally in we're going to take a line center.

02:10.200 --> 02:14.040
So we're going to center the elements in the menu.

02:14.370 --> 02:17.450
You can see something like this and that's fine.

02:17.570 --> 02:22.680
And some of them will have an example these that I use in this sub menu.

02:22.820 --> 02:25.760
You can see that with a Maryan added to the left.

02:25.760 --> 02:33.260
So we're going to again we're going to call these Cantillon menu CPI-M based.

02:33.320 --> 02:42.890
Why don't I use you and Gwede the class menu and I going at Madigan left zero.

02:43.270 --> 02:46.420
So we're writing these Madigan left we're going to remove that

02:49.240 --> 02:49.880
on the menu.

02:49.890 --> 02:53.680
Now you can see everything is center that looks fine.

02:54.120 --> 03:05.960
So next we're going to copy these and I'm going to get in line these we have you will apply a for the

03:06.050 --> 03:11.570
anchor and we're going to change something here when we get another caller what are going on change

03:11.700 --> 03:22.250
to white and sediment are important so we can apply the white color you can see looking nice.

03:23.230 --> 03:28.880
Then we're going to transform in this case I want to display the.

03:29.030 --> 03:33.550
That takes us uppercase and then I'm going to add the form.

03:33.580 --> 03:40.110
Wait say and and maybe seven candidates are going to be a little bored.

03:40.400 --> 03:50.220
One thing that's that's what I've got these so you can get on the menu and you can see we have the items

03:51.650 --> 03:57.270
you may have been in so we kind of do these little better so those looking nice

04:01.120 --> 04:10.480
the problem is that in my opinion these men is really really big really tall men who of course we can't

04:10.480 --> 04:18.230
remove the categories for example the scandals guys and PTF come kids and towers bad for example.

04:18.230 --> 04:26.030
We can also make some tweaks to these men you see right here we're going to inspect these

04:29.530 --> 04:32.560
and you can see that this a lie.

04:32.610 --> 04:42.900
So right on the air like where going to go with 50 percent and then we're going to float to the left.

04:43.770 --> 04:44.880
So reload

04:47.640 --> 04:54.280
man you and I you can see we have something nice to have him and about us sharp and block but you can

04:54.280 --> 04:59.890
see we have a problem right here and this is happening because we are using this other menu right here.

04:59.890 --> 05:03.510
So the menu is a plain 50 percent right here.

05:04.220 --> 05:11.930
Then the child's instead of being 50 percent they are now 25 percent.

05:11.960 --> 05:16.070
So in that case it's something that can be easily fixed.

05:16.070 --> 05:23.050
For example if I open menus and the mobile Fadhil I remove some items.

05:25.170 --> 05:31.140
And say the menu then low on menu.

05:31.180 --> 05:36.360
So now you can see that we have in each line we have two items in the menu and that looks nice I think

05:41.100 --> 05:45.990
now the menus are a little smaller you the person that is going out there and if you're happy with these

05:45.990 --> 05:47.380
are not.

05:47.590 --> 05:50.580
So finally the final adjustment that I want to make.

05:50.980 --> 05:57.870
You can see the logo and the body they are really they are really close together.

05:57.990 --> 06:04.750
So we're going to miss page right there and they can spec these is the side branding that is pushing

06:04.750 --> 06:08.950
these is the selector that we can use to push these to the bottom.

06:09.710 --> 06:13.390
What are going to copy these and Raissi it.

06:15.200 --> 06:22.830
This is the second site to say branding and what are going to look at my bottom line Im save these and

06:22.830 --> 06:28.530
reload and I can see capstans operations here as looking nice if I may.

06:28.520 --> 06:34.090
This is Malheur the hero menu.

06:34.150 --> 06:39.430
I went to carve out some more separation here and you can see that I added this in the media so we kind

06:39.430 --> 06:42.820
of got these and that these outside of the ME equity

06:45.920 --> 06:50.680
menu and you can see hacen separation and I can close these.

06:50.900 --> 06:53.210
And we also have the separation here.

06:53.420 --> 06:57.170
So you only have the gold in the equity.

06:57.320 --> 07:05.570
When you went to target specific sizes in the case you went to apply some rule to all the sizes you

07:05.570 --> 07:06.380
can add.

07:06.560 --> 07:18.610
This is outside of any media query and this will work for a large the desktop and also for Moabite.

07:18.710 --> 07:26.260
This is really nice and really nice menu that we have right now.

07:26.300 --> 07:32.130
So in the next video we're going to see you can have a Google for on your website if you think of a

07:32.140 --> 07:40.120
kid in the saying we're using our phone right here is called Laro and also here at the bottom of this

07:40.120 --> 07:44.210
carrier instead of using the same phone Laro is not the same.

07:44.590 --> 07:47.310
And right here we are using another phone.

07:47.380 --> 07:54.940
This one is called Laura and she is on the board and we are sort using Laro and also one is using larum.
