00:04.420 --> 00:11.800
This video I'm going to show you a quote to save Pay Pal payments in your website so visually going

00:11.800 --> 00:13.910
up and comers settings.

00:14.320 --> 00:21.110
And then what are going up and checkout here we're going to ask people express checkout to make sure

00:21.110 --> 00:23.240
they have the blue you know reading style.

00:23.270 --> 00:32.280
When Greenstein newcomer's the beginning where did these people express checkout gateway and also Stryper.

00:32.450 --> 00:39.200
If you have these things that you can copy these name and start this blooey and then we have people

00:39.200 --> 00:43.840
express check out and from here you can see that we have our picture inches.

00:43.990 --> 00:50.740
So for a hittable Let's see for example some of that just means that we can make your god save the environment.

00:50.850 --> 00:56.460
Always when you are developing your Web site make sure that you have a sandbox right here.

00:56.630 --> 01:01.240
Some books I can you can make some things without real money.

01:01.260 --> 01:08.830
You can make all the process you're buying something in the store and everything with fictional money.

01:09.070 --> 01:15.270
So when I use the sandbox for a kid we're going to set up or cleaning an existing.

01:15.840 --> 01:20.650
So I already have my account and I'm going out right here in order to have a paypal account.

01:20.670 --> 01:29.100
You have to first create a Paypal account then verify the paypal account and you can create this sandbox

01:29.100 --> 01:36.600
icon that you can see like a sandbox that people that come are you an kid on next.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.580
And for a kid we're going to add the password.

01:38.580 --> 01:43.700
You can see that this is asking us for authorization so we're going to actually get you up to Rassi

01:43.800 --> 01:44.650
of the rising.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.540
And you can see we had successfully installed these.

01:47.550 --> 01:49.980
We're going to go back to that page

01:53.310 --> 02:01.500
and you can see that we have you just authenticated the sandbox so we can redirect you to our Web site

02:04.710 --> 02:07.800
and we have the sandbox already added.

02:07.890 --> 02:09.980
That's something really nice.

02:09.990 --> 02:12.560
So from here you can see this is a sandbox.

02:12.570 --> 02:20.190
And once you perform all the best in everything you have to make the change to live.

02:20.560 --> 02:26.310
But you have to make sure when you make the change to live you have to link again the paypal account

02:26.940 --> 02:30.720
because the other one was a sandbox account.

02:30.790 --> 02:32.080
So now everything is ready.

02:32.080 --> 02:42.140
So for example up in some books again save the changes and it's up in the front and for web site

02:46.360 --> 02:53.860
you can see that we have these really nice Cziko with paper you can proceed to check out.

02:54.090 --> 02:56.910
And for a kid with cancer like they bought it right here.

02:56.940 --> 03:00.310
So this is how you in-style baby in your website.

03:00.480 --> 03:04.670
The same process goes for a stride or all that you have to worry.

03:04.740 --> 03:05.500
They are the same.

03:05.530 --> 03:07.480
Let's continue working in these videos.
