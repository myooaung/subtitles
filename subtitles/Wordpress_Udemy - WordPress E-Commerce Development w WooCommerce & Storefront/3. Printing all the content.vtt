WEBVTT

00:04.110 --> 00:11.190
So let's continue working with these goes to display the letters three entries in the home page of a

00:11.250 --> 00:12.530
storefront.

00:12.710 --> 00:19.520
So we have this Deiter and if taken a hit in the design field we have these images of what we're going

00:19.520 --> 00:23.890
to use BHB again and we have those images.

00:24.790 --> 00:30.230
And then when I click in one of these post you can see that they are added he didn't feature he mentioned

00:30.260 --> 00:37.590
why don't they use a function called the The Boss Thomond and say these and up in the front and again

00:39.170 --> 00:45.950
you can see that we have this image where you can see this image is really really be recreated in the

00:45.950 --> 00:46.310
spec.

00:46.300 --> 00:55.640
The element here on one of these images you can see that we're printing really image and we can print

00:55.640 --> 01:00.490
that Rismiller Bertran this way our Web site is going to run faster.

01:00.850 --> 01:06.840
So we're going up and again these edit posts and Ngwenya routines.

01:09.100 --> 01:13.350
The discipline that will help us when you are developing a WordPress theme.

01:13.540 --> 01:22.090
So for example if you open the media you can see that now we have several images and if you want to

01:22.180 --> 01:28.250
make a change in the sizes of the images you have to do two things.

01:28.330 --> 01:30.340
First is to write some BHB code.

01:30.360 --> 01:36.340
What can happen when I scroll to the top and I'm going to have a cold call and rehear function or in

01:36.400 --> 01:46.270
a underscore Serap and we're going to have decent live action out there said Tim.

01:46.350 --> 01:51.890
Then when I come in with these so these are the functions that are going to be executed.

01:51.970 --> 01:57.690
For example when you activate the deam and I went to I've asked size.

01:57.740 --> 02:03.200
So for example if you want to add more menus you can add the Frenchman right here.

02:04.800 --> 02:12.740
In this case I went up and the match sites said whether you register as size for these emerges so another

02:12.780 --> 02:21.580
image size and fears you pass the names or an entry then you are there with 400 pixels than the height.

02:21.650 --> 02:25.540
Two hundred and sixty two hundred fifty seven pixels.

02:25.980 --> 02:30.040
And then if you want to grab the match you pass through or falls.

02:30.130 --> 02:38.420
So now we have this image register this image size and for example if you open the break you don't know

02:38.470 --> 02:43.950
plot's 2017 you will find that we have some different sizes.

02:44.910 --> 02:54.010
So we need to we need to create these new size right here two that were present in wordpress will create

02:54.070 --> 03:01.090
a new version of these images with the sizes in their discipline call and I'm going to focus on new

03:01.930 --> 03:09.920
drug that dominates this way we don't have to reapply the images is going to be called regenerate dominates

03:11.060 --> 03:15.260
these brilliant and we're not done now.

03:18.730 --> 03:22.300
And then when I click with the brain you can see it has one million active installs.

03:22.310 --> 03:23.440
Really popular.

03:23.440 --> 03:29.640
And so once you install and activate the plan you have to get the kid on tools and regenerate them.

03:30.570 --> 03:31.740
And then you only have these.

03:31.830 --> 03:35.220
So you could be here and now what happen in.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.400
So let's continue working with this example.

03:38.820 --> 03:47.890
Scroll to the bottom and then for example I'm going to continue writing these doc there types to regenerate

03:47.890 --> 03:50.100
the tongue and he's going to continue running.

03:50.620 --> 03:57.490
So for example here I'm going to give a class and three title something like that.

03:57.710 --> 03:58.940
Then we can have another one.

03:58.940 --> 04:01.840
We're going deep it's going to be called anti-condom.

04:01.910 --> 04:10.580
All these classes of these we establish and we see a then for example if you take a look here on the

04:10.580 --> 04:16.120
side we have these died or we have these and that is right here.

04:16.320 --> 04:22.670
But we have the same theory by and the one of the would have been by

04:28.320 --> 04:35.030
BHP and we're going to use a function called the outer that's going to bring the outthought and then

04:35.030 --> 04:38.230
what I the.

04:38.720 --> 04:44.330
And we're going to the east and then we're going out to these play dates and then going to yourself

04:44.630 --> 04:52.690
all the time and then when need to bus get option and we're going to use that for my.

04:52.730 --> 04:58.330
So now for example I can save these up in the browser or.

05:00.130 --> 05:06.580
And I can see we can buy and then we have I mean and then we've had to date the display of the date

05:07.130 --> 05:11.280
is going to be controlled by WordPress for clicking on settings general

05:14.390 --> 05:19.310
at the bar and you can see that we have the formats so you can select phone de-friend data formats right

05:19.310 --> 05:23.000
here and you can see this is the thing that we have here.

05:24.540 --> 05:29.190
If you're up in the region 800 stars you can see now it's just 100 percent.

05:29.460 --> 05:36.940
So we can now use that size and you can see that we have some Sysyphus for candidate and two candidates

05:37.260 --> 05:44.510
two hundred fifty seven and so now that size has been raised they're going to scroll to the top to copy

05:44.510 --> 05:51.600
the name block entry scroll to the bottom again and rake it on the bottom and then I'm going to pass

05:51.600 --> 06:01.400
the size inside single quotes block entry so save these and up in the front and then Rudel and you can

06:01.400 --> 06:07.380
see we have live images and that's better especially to know the Web site faster.

06:08.710 --> 06:13.590
So let's continue working with these we these three share.

06:14.270 --> 06:17.230
And then I want to clear the glass to share.

06:18.680 --> 06:21.310
But instead of being idea it is going to be a.

06:21.860 --> 06:24.200
So you can have multiple vendors.

06:24.620 --> 06:30.750
In this case for example we have an entry and the top section is going to be using whatever carrier

06:30.800 --> 06:33.660
class for that attack.

06:33.820 --> 06:39.000
Then if you take a look here there is saying we need to bring this content in we're going to use that

06:39.000 --> 06:47.810
BHP function BHP that is in a way and we can use Wordpress function.

06:47.900 --> 06:54.290
For example you can use the EXOR Deandra services mount a portion of the world content.

06:54.410 --> 06:59.840
So we're going to see these up and these and reload you can see we have the text right here.

07:01.880 --> 07:07.970
Bath for example you can add on to the content and the content will display all the content that is

07:07.970 --> 07:09.450
available in that entry.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.190
You can see that's a lot of code.

07:12.770 --> 07:14.100
So I'm going to remove these.

07:14.300 --> 07:20.270
And then when I create a variable called content equals two and I'm going to use a function called Dolby

07:20.300 --> 07:30.270
underscore DreamWorks and then when I get the content as a parameter and the second is the number of

07:30.270 --> 07:34.040
letters the second one is the number of words.

07:34.160 --> 07:37.670
Do you want to dream what you want to trim the content.

07:37.800 --> 07:48.070
So I mean at any rate you so next thing when I have a cool content save these and reload and then you

07:48.070 --> 07:54.720
can see how my lower portion that you can see that we have these three dots if we want to keep these

07:54.720 --> 08:02.860
three dots you can buy some of that aren't there and you can these and the hello and I you can see that

08:02.860 --> 08:05.670
we get rid of these three dots.

08:05.910 --> 08:12.680
You can use had other Rachida for example know and you can see right here.

08:12.700 --> 08:18.130
So this is the connives with Capri into the much tighter the outer date.

08:18.210 --> 08:25.250
And these contain So we need to have one final piece is these read the more text and right here I am

08:25.270 --> 08:31.300
going to add an anchor and they're going to be in England.

08:31.370 --> 08:38.170
The permalink the permalink will create different links to the Fernet that is.

08:38.170 --> 08:43.330
So for example if you click here this will open the content of this entry if you click here it's going

08:43.330 --> 08:48.820
to load this entry or if you click here it's going to load the entry so we're going up Azeez.

08:48.840 --> 08:59.860
And then going to have a class on a class and again what I'm going to use and the link and right here

09:00.110 --> 09:04.150
the text says Read more read more.

09:04.490 --> 09:11.150
And again we're going to use an entity drak so save these and Rouleau

09:13.880 --> 09:22.060
and you can who have Pridmore you and now for example if we click here it's going up and the entry and

09:22.060 --> 09:28.090
if you click here it's going to bring in now these Hindery.

09:28.230 --> 09:31.930
And finally victory here is going to bring in this one.

09:32.310 --> 09:35.900
So what Almazan with this example you can see is looking great.

09:35.940 --> 09:43.230
We only need to have some success if we needed this example and we're going to try this.

09:43.230 --> 09:45.850
Says in the next video.
