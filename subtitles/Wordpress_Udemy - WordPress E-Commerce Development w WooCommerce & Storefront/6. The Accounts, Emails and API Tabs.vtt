00:04.230 --> 00:10.320
Send this video we're going to review the last three items I can e-mails in the.

00:10.530 --> 00:12.380
They are really really easy.

00:12.390 --> 00:16.190
So for example the my account was really similar to the others.

00:16.290 --> 00:18.650
You can change the page for the count.

00:20.190 --> 00:25.650
And then for example you can see that we have customer registration and you can enable the customer

00:25.650 --> 00:28.420
and registration in the checkout or my account.

00:28.590 --> 00:38.370
You can add the the form that the user can feel to become the registered user and you can see that we

00:38.370 --> 00:44.170
have also the login display that are at the main customer Rhodian reminder on the checkout.

00:44.190 --> 00:47.480
Everything almost everything is going to keep that evil right here.

00:48.750 --> 00:54.720
So if they can create showing you can see that we are dramatically getting a username from customers

00:54.720 --> 00:56.950
e-mail that's fine Ormandy that's OK.

00:57.360 --> 01:03.460
And as you can see that we have automatically generate customer Bazil or and here you have to think

01:03.500 --> 01:05.170
really well about these.

01:05.270 --> 01:12.650
Chances are that if you keep these uncheck the user is going to be password like 2:59 or something like

01:12.660 --> 01:13.020
that.

01:13.970 --> 01:20.870
And if you for these WordPress it's going to generate a really really strong puzzle or a really puzzle

01:20.870 --> 01:21.870
or Kassa.

01:21.880 --> 01:27.000
Don't side with the clients if the puzzle is really really strong.

01:27.290 --> 01:34.190
Maybe they you said we forgot password or they will find some problems logging in and the way they are

01:34.190 --> 01:38.970
going to they are going to cancel the purchase in the web site.

01:39.230 --> 01:43.930
So you have to keep in mind is really really when you couple the importance not what it does.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.110
OK.

01:45.470 --> 01:51.600
So then we have the mess and we have the emails and you can see for example you're going to hit on all

01:51.600 --> 01:56.580
of that and you will have the minute for the new order that everything is going to be added right.

01:56.590 --> 02:03.460
You can change the subject the recipient the person who is going to receive these and everything.

02:03.710 --> 02:06.000
And I'm going to show you two.

02:06.140 --> 02:09.080
You can click it on your template you can see right here.

02:09.470 --> 02:15.500
I'm going to show you the cost of my customized e-mails in upcoming media's magic and see here we have

02:16.100 --> 02:17.990
a lot of different e-mails.

02:18.010 --> 02:25.430
One thing that I can give you here is that you check out that these are working ones you launch your

02:25.500 --> 02:32.580
website because for example you can see we have a new order right here and I had it to my e-mail.

02:32.690 --> 02:39.530
If I open my e-mail every day and I don't find these new order I will think that there are no orders

02:39.530 --> 02:40.590
right.

02:40.840 --> 02:48.380
But the chances are that the visitors are either in or that is but you are not receiving the e-mails.

02:48.400 --> 02:56.810
That's really really important because if someone's perform an order they're And then you see or you

02:56.820 --> 03:02.420
logging into Wordpress and you find an order from two months ago.

03:02.890 --> 03:09.840
Well the customer is going to be really really angry at that time.

03:09.840 --> 03:15.750
So it's really important that you test all these e-mails are working.

03:15.960 --> 03:21.510
And that's it's really important that you keep logging into Wordpress and see if you have any orders.

03:22.550 --> 03:28.370
So for example you can see we have all the e-mails that you can receive D.S.O. up is for the day I have

03:28.370 --> 03:30.220
mine and these are for the customers.

03:30.260 --> 03:32.340
You can see we have a of them on call.

03:32.370 --> 03:36.080
Process is not complete or that her phone or that and everything.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.520
So maybe you want to disable these.

03:38.570 --> 03:45.530
You can do it on the right configure and you can enable or disable this you mean.

03:45.540 --> 03:51.680
Same goes for all the humans that you go on the wall and you can make some changes in the color and

03:51.680 --> 03:52.820
if decks.

03:53.150 --> 04:01.660
And that's another key that you match finally you have the API and you can enable the rest API.

04:02.040 --> 04:10.090
This is going to be important especially if you want to create and man Droid or a US app using these

04:10.160 --> 04:17.810
store you can create that using the rest API and the rest API is outside of the scope of this course

04:18.340 --> 04:21.250
but is something rooted in Nice.

04:21.600 --> 04:29.600
So this is it for the settings page in the next video is going to continue working with this store and

04:29.620 --> 04:31.430
what are going to have more features.
