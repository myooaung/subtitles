To ensure the success of your business you've got to be aware of how to receive payments.

00:09.580 --> 00:12.330
This is going to be one of the most important things.

00:12.420 --> 00:19.490
So for example to receive payments in your store you will need an ominous store of course and that's

00:19.510 --> 00:23.620
where you will need at least one payment gateway.

00:23.770 --> 00:29.930
In this case could be Pay-Pal stripe or there are several options available.

00:31.230 --> 00:38.710
You will need also a medical account and a bank account where you are going to withdraw their money

00:38.710 --> 00:40.760
from these payment gateways.

00:41.660 --> 00:43.120
So they own the store.

00:43.130 --> 00:47.300
This will allow the visitors to have products into the shopping cart

00:50.210 --> 00:57.260
allow visitors to submit payments for that items in the shopping cart with credit card or another payment

00:57.260 --> 01:09.270
gateway payment gateway will check that the user has founts before performing the purchase some options

01:09.270 --> 01:10.990
are paid by the stripe.

01:11.310 --> 01:16.750
I mustn't pay Apple pay or pay you.

01:16.850 --> 01:23.350
This isn't really important because almost all of them will charge some fees or commissions.

01:23.490 --> 01:30.030
Double check these before selecting a payment gateway and select one that suits your needs and when

01:30.100 --> 01:34.860
and where you feel comfortable with the fees that they are going to charge.

01:37.240 --> 01:43.540
Payment methods or options depending on the payment method that you want to set.

01:43.600 --> 01:48.150
Is the coffee ration that you should perform in the payment methods.

01:49.190 --> 01:53.580
So for example we have Paypal we have a strike.

01:53.720 --> 02:02.610
We have convenience stores and we are also bank transfers and cash and the liberi you can either one

02:02.610 --> 02:09.150
or two or all the payment methods that you want at the end of the check process.

02:09.160 --> 02:13.580
The user will choose the most suitable option for them.

02:15.840 --> 02:22.410
Other considerations are if you want to receive a recurring payment that say that you want to charge

02:22.410 --> 02:30.360
monthly or every three months or yearly You have to check that the payment gateway that you say to use

02:31.080 --> 02:33.700
supports this.

02:33.780 --> 02:40.940
And so if one neighbor reference you should check if their payment gateway support these features.

02:40.940 --> 02:47.920
Not all of them support both of these considerations that are showing so to enable the payment gateway

02:47.970 --> 02:58.960
in combers Paypal Express is 70 billion on commerce stripe is free to at least apply in some platforms

02:59.050 --> 03:02.180
are really Kapleau to receive payments with all comers.

03:03.160 --> 03:06.180
And some others doesn't support all comers.

03:06.420 --> 03:11.320
And you have to pay a developer for the plugin or you can create your own.
