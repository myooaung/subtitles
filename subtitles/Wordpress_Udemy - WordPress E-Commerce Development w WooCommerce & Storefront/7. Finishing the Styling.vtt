WEBVTT

00:04.740 --> 00:10.890
Solidified some styling in the section in order to finish this example so you can see that we have a

00:10.890 --> 00:14.520
bunch of the fan that we have a lot of Maryan right here.

00:14.840 --> 00:21.600
But I think it's a good idea to actually build this website and going up and incognito mode and page

00:21.600 --> 00:22.250
right here.

00:23.350 --> 00:30.220
So you see in incognito mode you can see their web site without being logged in because when you log

00:30.220 --> 00:36.670
in and you see these butan and other options so you can see now we have something like this and we have

00:36.670 --> 00:38.250
a lot of this basically on the top.

00:38.260 --> 00:41.820
And that's the law is basically on the bottom.

00:41.920 --> 00:43.600
So let's inspect these right here.

00:43.600 --> 00:50.020
You can see if the cover here on the main You can see that we have a lot of Palin on the top and also

00:50.020 --> 00:55.060
margin on the bottom of the McCabe's copy everything from here.

00:55.620 --> 01:03.210
And this is it's uses page right here and this is the Palin upswell and that Palin topped 0.

01:03.340 --> 01:09.580
We can remove that Palin had zero here you can see the live preview and right here you can see that

01:09.580 --> 01:18.600
we have these Pay Day page and you can see by the bottom outhaul we're going to a camera right here.

01:19.230 --> 01:20.580
Basie's and reload

01:23.310 --> 01:30.210
Yes but in borrowing these ones and create a new selector.

01:30.320 --> 01:35.140
And by the end bottom Cyril so save these and reload now.

01:39.060 --> 01:44.920
And I is looking better writing that we have a little office space than the bottom yet.

01:45.030 --> 01:56.590
What are these yet race you know you can see that we have margin in each and the so we can either them

01:56.660 --> 02:06.230
page plate them template one page each entry and they're going to have another set like the rescue.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.450
You can see that is 4 am.

02:08.450 --> 02:11.210
So maybe you can dig these in here.

02:11.240 --> 02:22.920
We're going to mark in ball to AM Sordello these and yet if any of this is looking better we'll come

02:22.930 --> 02:25.350
Morris bays right here in space right.

02:26.500 --> 02:29.950
And also the belove these images.

02:29.980 --> 02:39.230
We have somebody in submarine on the bottom so why don't I copy these when I've bought them again.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.900
We can cut this fall.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.790
Maybe that 8 am

02:46.590 --> 02:50.690
is looking nice and we're going to make this H-3 a little smaller.

02:50.740 --> 02:58.940
We're going to use these being selective so we can use for example this is like their products.

02:59.010 --> 03:07.050
Neither approach is very and we're going to have one size maybe 1.2 some Dina's mother

03:09.940 --> 03:12.860
is looking fine I think maybe one is going to be better

03:15.860 --> 03:17.600
yet if this is looking better.

03:18.770 --> 03:21.480
And you can click here and know everything is working.

03:23.610 --> 03:24.510
So this is great.

03:24.510 --> 03:30.260
We have the feature probes right here and we have done our fearless plan for newcomers.
