00:04.720 --> 00:11.280
So you can see in our fortunes that BHP almos in all the cars we have a bunch of different formations

00:11.980 --> 00:21.150
and we're making Cuck into commerce and maybe you have the question How can I find the right hook to

00:21.210 --> 00:29.780
write my own code or write with combers and how to find the right hook can be a little tricky but there

00:29.780 --> 00:33.680
is a really cool blogging that we can use going up and bludgeons

00:37.140 --> 00:40.090
and right here I'm gonna as new and brilliant.

00:40.200 --> 00:46.800
This one is called Money thought and this is a really useful Brillion what are going to search for monitoring

00:46.810 --> 00:48.310
what are going to install this.

00:48.430 --> 00:54.880
Dan we're going to activate the blueing and Gwazi activate the blue when you open the front in and reload.

00:55.260 --> 00:58.790
And you can see here I have the word they will combers template.

00:58.890 --> 01:02.430
I'm going to deactivate this blue and I'm going to reload again.

01:02.580 --> 01:07.230
You can see it on the top of this new area in orange.

01:07.470 --> 01:09.950
So this is why the monitor.

01:10.350 --> 01:15.380
So what you are now over right here and you can see these new dropdown menu.

01:15.480 --> 01:18.490
This one has a bunch of different useful stuff.

01:18.510 --> 01:24.270
So right here you can see that we have the qualities all the Kuwaitis that are executed in commerce

01:24.270 --> 01:29.880
are going to be race mirroring WordPress coquetries by color by component.

01:29.890 --> 01:36.250
One of the things that I really like about the monitor is this template you can see here you will find

01:36.250 --> 01:42.960
the template that is being used in this page grey here you can see it's a storefront template homepage.

01:43.060 --> 01:49.950
So if you're up and about also for example and covered in the bar you can see that the template is started

01:49.990 --> 01:50.970
from page.

01:51.050 --> 01:55.570
So it does have a lot of useful information in these Vohra.

01:55.590 --> 01:59.760
Again I'm going to have it right here and you can see that we are also have the scripts and the styles

02:00.480 --> 02:05.910
by the way how Aalto the hooks in actions we're going to click here as well here on the web and you

02:05.910 --> 02:14.650
can see we have some conditionals so we have these front page page page template or is singular if you

02:14.650 --> 02:20.590
open about us you can see this one is this page or the singular.

02:20.820 --> 02:25.600
So you can also see the conditional ties that you can use in these pages.

02:27.170 --> 02:32.240
One of the most useful botanists in this monitor is that Cook's in action.

02:32.260 --> 02:33.410
And I'm going to click here.

02:35.860 --> 02:41.380
So for example in this panel on the left you have the hooks in the middle and you have the functions

02:41.420 --> 02:43.320
that hook into this hook.

02:43.690 --> 02:52.200
And then if this is our core function or if this is of using a blue ribbon or a team so right here on

02:52.200 --> 02:57.690
the top you can see the action and you can click here and that's so you will find these dropdown menu

02:57.690 --> 03:06.480
you can see that you can are the hooks and actions by child team by the Biden team or if you want a

03:06.480 --> 03:09.660
field there are these hooks by a priori.

03:09.660 --> 03:16.500
So for example you can click here combers and this will bring only the hooks that are used by comers.

03:16.830 --> 03:22.050
So one of the things that I really like about this plan is that the kid on the left for example you

03:22.050 --> 03:29.280
have the hook and then you have their function that is hook and you will find out to the fight.

03:29.610 --> 03:33.740
The name of the file and the line where you will find this function.

03:34.950 --> 03:40.040
So for example if your scroll a little here on the left you will find all the cogs.

03:40.040 --> 03:45.750
For example you will find that we need and you will find the right file where you will find these Fondren

03:46.530 --> 03:48.090
and answer some other information.

03:48.090 --> 03:53.790
So for example let's say that we want to check which hooks are available in a storefront and you can

03:53.900 --> 04:00.730
get them by the end team so here on the left you can see that we have a set of demons and here we have

04:00.730 --> 04:04.340
some four inches you can see here we have got a really nice set up.

04:04.550 --> 04:06.790
You can see for example if you're an atom

04:11.130 --> 04:15.830
you can see that we are in a set up and it says Don't pick on 10 teams.

04:15.900 --> 04:23.180
Then the name of the team which is Caterina's back and then Funches that BHB on line 19.

04:23.190 --> 04:29.660
So if you're pretty you already thought you will find that on the line 19 with correctness and is correct

04:29.670 --> 04:35.390
you can see the name of the function in the file name and the line are correct.

04:35.760 --> 04:44.210
So this is really useful proof that you can use to identify which file is in a function.

04:44.210 --> 04:49.410
So for example right here you can also filter right hook or another actions.

04:49.410 --> 04:54.320
For example you can see here we have the the blue in the wheel well.

04:54.610 --> 05:00.850
So let's say that we're working on the welcome page or the page if you scroll right here by the way

05:00.850 --> 05:06.670
here is Esther from Canada for example you will find the home page right here and you will find for

05:06.670 --> 05:10.380
example here we have the fortune that we created earlier today.

05:10.380 --> 05:16.000
Now this play features NICAM they compare Chaum kits and some others.

05:16.420 --> 05:24.800
So for example it's up in the new computer here.

05:24.990 --> 05:30.600
And if you scroll a little you can see that we have these new EON right here.

05:30.640 --> 05:36.280
So let's open let's see if we find something similar here you can see that we have started from bress

05:36.280 --> 05:37.270
and brokes.

05:37.690 --> 05:45.740
So for example you can see that these function because then the teams started from then I can see what

05:45.740 --> 05:47.030
went up in that file.

05:47.320 --> 05:55.070
So as the hidden teams start from them I can see for their eye and see they were Kavis thought of front

05:55.080 --> 05:56.760
them played Fanchon's.

05:57.160 --> 06:01.120
So we kind of started from the play right here.

06:01.280 --> 06:06.840
So this function that recent brokes is on line six hundred six hundred and two.

06:07.160 --> 06:14.000
So what are going to scrotal the bottom and re here we have this from Gresson prose.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.470
So this is something really important right here.

06:16.490 --> 06:21.190
They can see that we have apply filters so you know play filters.

06:21.190 --> 06:25.870
You will find the information that you can change using a filter.

06:25.900 --> 06:30.040
So what I want to make out there is using CDs and you can see this is the name of the filter so we can

06:30.040 --> 06:31.750
copy the name.

06:31.990 --> 06:38.350
And I'm going to open gallery in a spa Funches at BHP and right here I'm going to write a fun show for

06:38.500 --> 06:49.640
you and we're going to have Caterina's new brokes and we're going to open the curly braces and remember

06:49.650 --> 06:56.550
this is a filter so we're going to have that filter and then you can see that we can apply filters and

06:56.550 --> 07:00.930
this is the filters we're going to copy this page right here.

07:00.970 --> 07:07.070
Then grab a comma in the second argument is going to be these right here so you can see that this field

07:07.070 --> 07:09.280
there has this array.

07:09.420 --> 07:12.850
And we have these arguments of what we're going to pass this argument right here.

07:14.180 --> 07:17.480
So right here you can see that we have the keys that you can change.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.990
So for example in this case you can change the limit.

07:21.110 --> 07:26.810
This this is the number of products that you can display in the front and then you cover the columns

07:27.020 --> 07:27.680
in the title.

07:27.680 --> 07:31.220
So we're watching this trip arguments.

07:31.340 --> 07:37.880
First we're going to change the limits we're going to companies and right here I'm going to have X then

07:37.880 --> 07:38.690
the square brackets.

07:38.700 --> 07:40.090
And what are we to that limit.

07:40.280 --> 07:49.210
We're going to have equals something like 8 angry or to the arguments because we're overriding these

07:49.840 --> 07:53.860
so save these and reload right here.

07:56.710 --> 08:00.950
Now you can see that we have a new lead and we have a brokes.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.800
So this is looking nice.

08:02.940 --> 08:05.120
Then we're going to make a this with the columns.

08:05.140 --> 08:09.710
So we have columns and we have four you can see one two three and four.

08:09.790 --> 08:17.490
So we're going to have the arguments we're going to call loose and you can.

08:17.560 --> 08:27.320
So for example you cannot something like two and reload and you can see we have two columns.

08:27.690 --> 08:34.900
So all the values that you find in the supply fielders is something that you can override with a filter.

08:35.130 --> 08:42.180
So for example if you want to change something here and you find the filter but you can see right here

08:42.300 --> 08:48.380
we only have these these three options and you cannot find what you want to change.

08:48.380 --> 08:53.960
My recommendation is that you try to override that template.

08:53.990 --> 09:00.370
That's why in the previous video I show you how to use complex yinz.

09:00.420 --> 09:09.000
So for example let's say that we want to use or we went to this place explodes in columns of three and

09:09.000 --> 09:12.420
finally we're going to change the title.

09:12.420 --> 09:19.440
We're going to add something like 20 or something like Jewish released and save these and reload

09:22.240 --> 09:30.130
and now you can see that we have just really hitting of the six products in columns of three.

09:30.150 --> 09:32.060
So this is really nice.

09:32.460 --> 09:38.460
So you'll see this play in the monitor you will find a lot of useful information when you are working

09:39.120 --> 09:41.980
with a blue Yian or a team in wordpress.

09:42.270 --> 09:49.710
Finding the right hook can be a little tricky but you'll see in the monitor this is going to be a more

09:49.710 --> 09:51.040
simple task.

09:51.450 --> 09:54.640
So hopefully your friend is really interesting and helpful.
