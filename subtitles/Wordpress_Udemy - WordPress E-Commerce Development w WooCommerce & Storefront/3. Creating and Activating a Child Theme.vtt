00:04.630 --> 00:09.790
So let's create a chart of dream of a storefront and then I'm going up and find that I have the installation

00:09.790 --> 00:15.100
of Commerce I'm going up and to be content themes and here I'm going to create a new form that you can

00:15.100 --> 00:20.000
name this whatever you want I'm going to name this cartoonist back and I'm going up and this fall there

00:20.010 --> 00:27.160
in the I'm going obviously not done for the rest of the videos and I'm going to create the fights that

00:27.160 --> 00:27.740
we need.

00:27.910 --> 00:33.880
So when you carrying the child and you need to create a wonderful for the team and then you have to

00:33.880 --> 00:41.140
create this that that's the essence and the functions that BHB these are the fires that you need to

00:41.170 --> 00:42.510
create a child.

00:42.510 --> 00:45.340
The what are going to start working with this.

00:45.380 --> 00:46.620
That's yes.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.600
So here's going I come in the same way.

00:49.900 --> 00:53.550
If you really have experience will happen what Brazilian's you get.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.180
Some extra information in the header.

00:56.200 --> 01:05.340
So for example you can add a team name and what are going to call these when asked by combers then we're

01:05.350 --> 01:07.080
going to that then you're right.

01:07.100 --> 01:11.570
You can for example if you're selling this theme you can either you or Rothera right here.

01:12.370 --> 01:20.050
Then cannot description description is going to be really careful if you submit your team into the water

01:20.050 --> 01:29.180
Bresch repo so people can find your team to establish sort of an anchor in a spa with commerce and then

01:29.180 --> 01:35.650
we're going out child of stuff from there and we're going to the outdoors.

01:35.650 --> 01:39.790
You can add your name right here and I'm going my name is Tori.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.200
And then we're going out.

01:41.270 --> 01:42.130
They outlawed you.

01:42.170 --> 01:42.740
Right.

01:42.890 --> 01:44.550
So for example you can at your website.

01:44.550 --> 01:52.180
In this case so people can visit your website if you decide to submit this into the word pre-poll or

01:52.190 --> 01:57.330
if you're really nice for a client and everything then this is going to be de-friend so you can add

01:57.330 --> 02:01.300
a template template is the name of the party in theme.

02:01.310 --> 02:04.490
In this case the storefront is what another storefront.

02:04.700 --> 02:10.460
This is the way that you made the connection between the Palin team and the writing name were going

02:10.510 --> 02:14.170
out there virtually in this case it's going to be one point zero point zero.

02:14.590 --> 02:16.650
And then we're going to have a license.

02:16.660 --> 02:19.470
We're going to have a license.

02:20.140 --> 02:27.670
And you General Public License version 2 or later.

02:27.970 --> 02:36.700
Then you can either license your rights and people can actually read the license you the DP slash you

02:38.020 --> 02:47.930
and you that or Nashe license Brora GPL dash 2.0 that is in the mail.

02:48.830 --> 02:51.220
And then we're going to and some tax.

02:51.650 --> 03:00.910
People can find your Widenius in the description or it tax so we're going out with combers spam and

03:01.240 --> 03:07.120
just poncey lifeboat right sidebar and all this.

03:07.120 --> 03:16.610
Finally what are the main So we're going to start from that the main So now we can save these up the

03:16.610 --> 03:18.140
ranking of all comers.

03:18.970 --> 03:24.730
We're going up in Iberians themes and you can see how we can get to witness combers.

03:24.810 --> 03:30.450
You can click here and you will find all the information that we added in this that that's your sense.

03:30.450 --> 03:36.220
For example we have the name the Bircher and the out or the description and you can see that we have

03:36.240 --> 03:40.530
this is a child of a from as we call it that's right here.

03:40.650 --> 03:46.660
So we're going to activate these activate and we're going out over the front end result right here.

03:47.630 --> 03:56.390
And you can see everything looks the same because we added We created a child team that is you see in

03:56.390 --> 03:59.190
a storefront as the patterned theme.

03:59.280 --> 04:06.450
So we carried all the functionality and the style sheets into these new team bad.

04:06.450 --> 04:11.310
For example you can override them instead and you can add something like a body bag the background color

04:11.430 --> 04:19.220
and that's something like No save these and reload and you can see we have the blue collar.

04:19.650 --> 04:27.040
So in this case for example next time that a new version of a star for one is added you can update your

04:27.150 --> 04:30.320
stuff run and your changes are going to be saved.

04:30.340 --> 04:36.510
And since we created these new fall there Daddy's side of us are from.

04:36.630 --> 04:41.100
So these where you can overwrite all their files are you having a sort run.

04:41.490 --> 04:47.140
And in any update one heart your child.

04:47.520 --> 04:52.600
So what are going to start with you Dean or Brinig with these babies.

04:52.860 --> 04:59.180
Remove these so they start working in the next video with these Web site.
