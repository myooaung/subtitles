Maybe you want to add some fields to make the section more dynamic.

00:08.490 --> 00:14.650
At the moment you can see if I open the functions we have this functionality in the Funches that beach

00:14.670 --> 00:20.080
B maybe you went to add some functionality so your client can make the changes right here.

00:21.020 --> 00:24.860
Or in that case the match mentioned everything.

00:25.080 --> 00:33.970
And if you click here on a page you will find that we have welcome and we have the section of the great

00:33.970 --> 00:42.390
here of this content and we can use these by in my opinion is better if we use a different approach.

00:43.360 --> 00:49.510
In this case where the east teleplay or at Bansko Stone feels one of the most common questions that

00:49.510 --> 00:58.390
I have found in forums on Facebook is how I can integrate my commerce Web site with some extra files

00:58.390 --> 01:02.350
from my land scores and fields and I'm going to show you how to do that in this video.

01:02.560 --> 01:08.460
So what went up and prurience and if you don't have any experience with advanced custom fields it's

01:08.460 --> 01:16.520
a really powerful blow in that will allow you to create some extra fields right here by the for word

01:16.520 --> 01:23.320
press on the at this Tyronne and this content but with a pro like Advance custom fields you can add

01:23.320 --> 01:29.080
more fields on the bottom or in the top if you want here's a cup jeans.

01:29.080 --> 01:29.970
And then we have a.

01:30.050 --> 01:34.590
And we're going to add the last custom fiend's.

01:34.690 --> 01:40.820
It's a really popular pro and you can see it contains 1 million active installs.

01:41.310 --> 01:46.600
And we're going to install these and then we're going to activate the broken

01:49.920 --> 01:54.280
so we have advanced custom fields and you can see it on the bottom we have a new tab called Bansko some

01:54.280 --> 01:56.010
features are only custom fields.

01:56.010 --> 02:03.890
It's one of the custom fields and we're going to have new so let's dive right here what we're going

02:03.890 --> 02:13.550
to add home page fields in the bottom for example on the rules is what you define where these fields

02:13.610 --> 02:17.170
are going to be showing in the back end of wordpress.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.620
Of course in the front end you can print whatever you want.

02:19.620 --> 02:20.830
Using the code.

02:21.140 --> 02:26.740
So are you going to use page is equal to and whether or not you're welcome.

02:26.750 --> 02:30.650
So we went to use we went to the fields right here.

02:32.210 --> 02:38.750
So you know and this is a special preference on the style I'm going to have the standard to be mega-bucks

02:40.070 --> 02:46.840
So you're you can start out in the field so you want to display and then when I feel and that you can

02:46.850 --> 02:48.460
see by yourself.

02:48.570 --> 02:59.010
So we're going out but never text God's word when I use text and we can get to the folds close the field

02:59.640 --> 03:01.340
then we can have another field.

03:01.450 --> 03:04.600
And what not you match.

03:04.600 --> 03:09.640
So in this case we can change the field time in this case it's going to be a file or an image you can

03:09.640 --> 03:11.430
decide whatever you want.

03:11.430 --> 03:12.860
I think much better.

03:13.930 --> 03:17.030
We're going to use image that required a yes or no.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.650
You can read to the value.

03:19.180 --> 03:23.370
You can use the match of the match to arrange the match ID in this case I think.

03:23.380 --> 03:29.740
And when I use the match you are right and I'm going to close the field then we're going to use these

03:31.520 --> 03:38.820
then I'm going up in the home page here and the word coming in and when I blow and I can see that we

03:38.820 --> 03:42.340
have the two fields that we'd register previously.

03:42.390 --> 03:47.190
So first thing and I copy these and paste Ray.

03:47.300 --> 03:53.600
So the next thing when I click it on the match and again I'm going to click and drag these banners back

03:55.220 --> 03:56.380
into the match.

03:56.420 --> 03:59.470
So this way or client can change the match.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.070
Will this play another one.

04:02.520 --> 04:04.300
Now we have something more dynamic.

04:04.330 --> 04:11.520
That's what I said about this one and so much of the.

04:11.730 --> 04:14.680
So now we kind of lost and everything is going to be the same.

04:14.680 --> 04:19.310
We need to change this text to display the fields.

04:19.520 --> 04:23.830
You don't want to use B it's Ben Wedeman on the field.

04:25.220 --> 04:33.040
And in this case we need to out banners this it's going to be the name of the few and this companies

04:33.490 --> 04:35.610
and right here we can't remove these.

04:37.190 --> 04:38.460
Base everything.

04:38.780 --> 04:43.360
And then we're going to change the field name something like this.

04:43.420 --> 04:48.130
Now you can do and you can see we have this and wrestle.

04:48.530 --> 04:55.830
But the really cool thing about it is that we can remove these at a different image like this one and

04:55.900 --> 05:03.340
so like the match of the reload and you can see we covered the frontier much.

05:03.680 --> 05:14.180
So now the client can decide which match they want to play or what decks should be in the intersection.

05:14.380 --> 05:19.080
And of course the more examples you see in advance custom fields are coming in these Web sites.

05:19.510 --> 05:24.930
We're going to use Hadron's because one feels at least two or three times more in these.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.870
But definitely you can see that this is looking really nice.

05:30.110 --> 05:37.400
So next we're going to scroll to the top and we're going to continue working with the section that says

05:37.400 --> 05:46.020
free shipping on orders sober 100 secure payments and reduce our refunds and we're going to create some

05:46.020 --> 05:47.880
fears use in advance coastal fees.
