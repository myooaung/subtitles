00:03.940 --> 00:10.010
So let's continue working with this forum and going up and Matre.

00:10.150 --> 00:16.470
So you're seeing these Where are seeing hook up and the front end where are you seeing the whole building

00:16.460 --> 00:20.380
will display these you know the website in the pages of the website.

00:20.490 --> 00:26.620
So if you click here scroll to the bottom you can see that it's hansol right here.

00:26.710 --> 00:30.830
So when it go on the display DS in the front in.

00:30.900 --> 00:39.700
So here I'm going to have a function or a conditional with a function called e-space.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.410
We're going to use welcome if you remember this front page.

00:44.450 --> 00:49.390
In fact you don't edit.

00:49.490 --> 00:51.210
It's called Welcome.

00:51.210 --> 00:55.060
So we're going to pass the adenine and at the bottom right you don't that.

00:55.070 --> 01:03.060
And if so these will check on that is we'll check that we're in the welcome page and in that case is

01:03.060 --> 01:06.980
when I displayed the form if I had rules here.

01:08.500 --> 01:13.630
You can see it's working directly frankly having one of these entries they form is not being printed

01:15.450 --> 01:18.840
so let's continue working next.

01:18.860 --> 01:25.270
You can see that we have these sustaining we can remove everything from here and we can remove and so

01:25.270 --> 01:27.450
these with these comments.

01:27.460 --> 01:29.430
In this case I'm going to

01:32.330 --> 01:36.450
then the code that little to format this a little better.

01:36.450 --> 01:39.520
You can see that we have this we have this is a shill for MailChimp.

01:39.560 --> 01:40.530
That's fine.

01:40.610 --> 01:47.270
The woman I'm going to show you have Dober right this is so fierce going on.

01:47.580 --> 01:52.660
I'm going out on the deep end I'm going to call this one MailChimp form.

01:52.670 --> 01:57.420
So with this way we can test these witnesses always.

01:57.430 --> 01:59.670
For me it's easier to create that.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.450
And then there are studies with Jasus.

02:02.860 --> 02:10.180
So I'm going to copy these and I'm going to open these on the right scroll to the bottom and that's

02:10.180 --> 02:10.850
how I come in

02:15.300 --> 02:19.030
Meechie farm.

02:19.090 --> 02:21.270
So we're going to use these matching form.

02:21.310 --> 02:24.040
And if you remember we have this is stylize.

02:24.400 --> 02:28.100
This case is being called R-squared when I use background color.

02:28.100 --> 02:37.690
That color save these up in the front end reload and you can see it's taking the fool with the collar.

02:37.720 --> 02:46.770
That's why we hope this stuff from before for snipets better and then we're going to have some more

02:46.790 --> 02:47.450
restyling

02:50.940 --> 02:52.370
for example right here.

02:52.800 --> 02:58.700
I'm going to increase that by and you can see that the these bodies really is more than they will that

02:58.760 --> 03:00.660
somebody on the top.

03:00.780 --> 03:10.640
Well when I mean when I'm by the top and bottom my all I mean bottom line.

03:10.970 --> 03:18.210
So save the central load now you can see the bodies looking better here.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.370
We're going to copy.

03:19.450 --> 03:25.960
We can also have that color wide right here to display the contents on White Collar.

03:26.890 --> 03:30.640
So next for example you can see that we have the subscribe to the newsletter.

03:30.940 --> 03:34.850
And then we have these on the right so we can create two different columns.

03:35.030 --> 03:37.340
They say is way is too much.

03:37.420 --> 03:45.670
They call that MailChimp give give us in the previous medius song when scroll to the bottom

03:50.610 --> 03:54.530
and break it would I have these MC imbeds sign number scroll England.

03:54.800 --> 03:55.910
They call for.

03:55.910 --> 03:59.500
So what you call food.

03:59.570 --> 04:01.290
And then I'm going I could eat any of these.

04:01.780 --> 04:08.660
And I'm going to call these when called looms six and I'm going I could do another one with the same

04:08.660 --> 04:09.640
class called

04:12.110 --> 04:13.780
Sikh's.

04:13.790 --> 04:18.010
So in this case for example this one is going to be these that lead the label.

04:18.020 --> 04:25.840
So I did and I got this page right here and then we're going to cut the rest and it's going to be added

04:25.840 --> 04:26.700
right here.

04:28.550 --> 04:31.220
So now we have two different sections.

04:31.270 --> 04:36.370
Then you can see that we had these subscribe to a newsletter right here and we are missing the second

04:36.370 --> 04:36.780
part.

04:36.790 --> 04:39.660
Access to exclusive deals.

04:39.740 --> 04:48.480
Have another name a name that would display AXS to exclusive deals.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.190
So now we can say this is malheur.

04:51.260 --> 05:00.100
There is nothing wrong with modifying the MailChimp code there to make the things easier for us.

05:00.170 --> 05:04.510
That's why we're using these and in some classes and moving some candids.

05:04.880 --> 05:12.020
So now we can't reload and I can see we had subscribe to a newsletter accessed through exclusive deals.

05:12.520 --> 05:21.930
So next we're going to add the CSA is for that to column for the columns and then going to the media

05:22.020 --> 05:32.760
on the screen and mean grid 768 B-cells and Rachida and going to copy these.

05:33.270 --> 05:34.230
You can see snidey

05:36.810 --> 05:38.550
and we have called them Sikh's

05:42.260 --> 05:46.580
and I'm going to have that with 50 percent and a lot left.

05:46.780 --> 05:50.440
Again when you are using floats you have to clear the balance.

05:52.070 --> 05:56.500
So what are going McCabe's.

05:56.650 --> 06:07.700
And then when after and again not contain the standard read Fiesco display block and cleanable.

06:08.060 --> 06:11.080
So save these and reload

06:14.130 --> 06:19.740
and you can see we had to subscribe to the newsletter on the left and the form on the right.

06:19.760 --> 06:27.640
So this is looking great in the next video we're going to finish these this year says for example.
