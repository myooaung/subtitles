00:04.280 --> 00:09.890
So in the previous videos and I'm going to click here and go back next year we added the first blog.

00:09.950 --> 00:13.670
So we have something like this and this is fine and you can see we have the right.

00:13.670 --> 00:15.130
Everything is looking red.

00:15.350 --> 00:19.300
And of course this will change based on the theme that you are using.

00:20.720 --> 00:23.360
So let's continue working with these.

00:23.360 --> 00:25.740
You can see we have a lot of Norris's here.

00:25.820 --> 00:26.900
You can close these

00:31.540 --> 00:33.970
and everything is going to be like this.

00:33.970 --> 00:34.980
We can close these.

00:35.040 --> 00:43.430
So that our warming is telling us that we need to configure other things but at the moment it's OK.

00:43.930 --> 00:50.230
So from here for example you have that thought Well we have the description of it you will find the

00:50.230 --> 00:56.170
brochure description and maybe the description that we have here is more suitable right here in the

00:56.170 --> 01:00.320
short descriptions of what I call the East End page right here.

01:00.790 --> 01:05.080
And if you open a door you'll find that we have these long descriptions.

01:05.100 --> 01:09.040
We're going to copy these ideas and paste right here.

01:09.160 --> 01:15.320
So when not remove these and you can see something like this you can click on update and then up and

01:15.360 --> 01:17.910
broke on the front end.

01:19.170 --> 01:21.370
So now you can see we have something different.

01:22.840 --> 01:27.940
Now you can see we have so much we have the prize and we have the short description right here.

01:28.180 --> 01:32.450
And so if I scroll you can see that this clip shown right here.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.610
So this is nice.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.890
I think this is better.

01:36.030 --> 01:38.010
Kevin nice man description right here.

01:38.400 --> 01:44.410
And at the description here on the bottom it's a front here in case you have some great you can click

01:44.440 --> 01:51.030
here and you can see the words the show and other sections of the page.

01:51.070 --> 01:52.430
So that's looking nice.

01:52.570 --> 01:59.990
So for example here on the right you can see that can categories this works exactly like categories

02:00.030 --> 02:05.770
that you have in posting Wordpress or you can have a new category and from here you cannot for example

02:05.880 --> 02:08.640
always an

02:11.620 --> 02:20.490
the new cut or you can see you know there was an update reload the front and and under it you can see

02:20.490 --> 02:23.490
that we have these breadcrumb comm Thorwaldsen global.

02:23.670 --> 02:28.790
So you can go on towels and this went on display all the that you have in this category you can see

02:28.820 --> 02:31.110
her brother categories right here.

02:31.110 --> 02:33.390
And that's a look you find the towers.

02:33.590 --> 02:37.250
And it's showing the single resolute.

02:37.310 --> 02:40.650
So for example you can add so that you can add something they

02:44.020 --> 02:54.900
spa at home something like that clicking on at an update and reload up and these and you can see that

02:55.090 --> 02:56.440
they were on the top.

02:56.490 --> 03:00.570
And we also have the categories right here and right here we have the task.

03:00.600 --> 03:06.870
So this is going to be important once you launch your site because these categories and tags will help

03:06.870 --> 03:12.800
you a lot with the search engine optimization for your web site.

03:12.830 --> 03:17.420
So in the next video we're going to add another pro and we're going to learn more stuff about these

03:17.480 --> 03:18.160
interface.
