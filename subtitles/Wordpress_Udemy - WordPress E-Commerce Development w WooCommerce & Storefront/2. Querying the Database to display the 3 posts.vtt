00:03.880 --> 00:09.760
So let's grade a function that will display that three different post in the bottom of in the bottom

00:09.880 --> 00:11.410
of the website.

00:11.530 --> 00:17.380
So if you're saying and actually can do one simple show hooks and I'm going for a lot sometimes it you

00:17.380 --> 00:24.800
have to reload these in order to make these low low aspected.

00:24.850 --> 00:32.340
So for example take up the page and you can see that this special banner boil by nature is taking the

00:32.340 --> 00:41.690
priority of a so we can add the functions are up in the functions in going at some space you can see

00:41.690 --> 00:43.760
the goal in the center of the screen.

00:45.310 --> 00:46.480
And when I come in.

00:46.480 --> 00:51.360
So that said something like these Blee that he posed in that speech.

00:52.570 --> 00:58.940
Knowing what are going out function and as far and that's going to be called a comp H.

01:00.750 --> 01:06.940
Underscore blog underscore entries then we're going to add an action.

01:06.940 --> 01:08.480
Remember this is a home page.

01:08.600 --> 01:15.360
And what I'm going to copy these and maybe we can add something like 90 something like that.

01:15.540 --> 01:24.140
And they don't have a go and threes here to save these up in the browser.

01:25.250 --> 01:30.500
Now we can just stop showing the hook so when I click here and they stop showing Cookes scroll to the

01:30.500 --> 01:32.890
bottom you will find entries here.

01:32.990 --> 01:33.950
So that's nice.

01:34.040 --> 01:39.800
And next you can see that we have this title the latest from the blog and the three post.

01:40.160 --> 01:44.330
So we're going to remove these and I'm going to add a V.

01:44.930 --> 01:49.510
And then when I close BHB we're going to the beach close right here we're going to close this thing

01:49.550 --> 01:50.520
up and raise.

01:51.140 --> 01:57.360
Then I'm going add the in I'm going to call is welcome page blog entries.

01:57.710 --> 02:05.060
And when I use this class to study this section with Jasus and then for example I'm going to have before

02:05.060 --> 02:13.340
these going to add an edge to the class section titled This is a class that exist in a storefront.

02:13.340 --> 02:17.540
So what are the latest blog entries.

02:18.750 --> 02:24.490
So save these hand or Loek and I can see the latest blog entries

02:28.800 --> 02:30.550
we need to center these.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.900
And I was thinking that we had already sent at least in the previous years

02:39.080 --> 02:48.500
when it sent dirties we're going to copy these based and I think Solomonson or so reloader again you

02:48.520 --> 02:57.440
can see the latest blog and that is I think we can cut these and at least inside the leaps because everything

02:59.050 --> 03:01.960
doesn't change anything but we have letters blog entries.

03:02.380 --> 03:10.270
So if you really have experience working with Wordpress and you went to the Getty the database there

03:10.270 --> 03:18.330
is a class or a function or a way to get the database that is called pick where it is a word when I

03:18.370 --> 03:20.650
write the arguments.

03:20.970 --> 03:22.780
And we're going to add an array.

03:23.200 --> 03:26.510
So first we want to read the post.

03:26.760 --> 03:28.510
The pause that we have added right in.

03:28.530 --> 03:35.320
For example if you want to add if you want the database to display both you need to have post on the

03:35.390 --> 03:43.080
score type and then you have a post where that comma because we want to add more content to this array

03:43.080 --> 03:45.660
in we're going to post per page.

03:45.840 --> 03:51.130
You can see that we only went to display three different posts and this is the way that you tell WordPress

03:51.220 --> 03:52.780
many polls that you want to print.

03:53.060 --> 03:58.520
In this case we passed three if you will not bring more post you can pass a different number right here.

03:59.010 --> 04:01.680
So next we're going to order this order by.

04:01.970 --> 04:05.260
And we're going to order them by date.

04:05.610 --> 04:07.160
What do not use order by.

04:07.300 --> 04:10.530
And the latest post is going to be displayed right here.

04:10.530 --> 04:19.430
So now that's all they're And we use the send and so this is going to be the arguments for the sunray

04:19.610 --> 04:27.780
and then we're going on the variable called entry's equals new Querrey.

04:27.910 --> 04:35.360
And when we pass those arguments be ready and these arguments are going to be passed right here.

04:35.370 --> 04:38.850
So next the next we have these H-2.

04:39.100 --> 04:45.380
And inside these I'm going to Ireland or at least and then we're going to have a huge block.

04:45.390 --> 04:47.520
I mean what are going to use.

04:47.530 --> 04:53.280
Why entities have post.

04:53.390 --> 04:56.140
This is the way that WordPress checks.

04:56.300 --> 05:02.760
Now we have some post in the database and this is going to continue running these function then we use

05:02.850 --> 05:12.400
entries depost and since we are acquiring the database in wordpress we need to add to the friend section

05:12.400 --> 05:13.470
right here.

05:13.590 --> 05:18.910
First we're using while it's more than I use and why I'd finish this execution.

05:18.910 --> 05:24.760
And then since we're using the Olympic way always when you're working with Olympic ready to use the

05:24.850 --> 05:31.780
underscore reset was the next I'm going to have a light right here.

05:32.740 --> 05:34.570
And I'd say that I want to bring in that title.

05:34.580 --> 05:45.130
So we're going to have an itch to be what you and I use that Deiter so save these and up in the front

05:45.170 --> 05:52.030
and you can see that will cover titles of course the titles sort of song.

05:52.370 --> 05:55.840
Some bad they are imprinted here.

05:55.860 --> 06:02.110
So next for example you can see in the design that we have here we have also they imagine we have the

06:02.130 --> 06:09.810
styro we have the outer of the entry that date Gunton and then we have these really more butan in the

06:09.810 --> 06:12.190
next video we're going to finish this.

06:12.210 --> 06:17.680
This is my piece of code to display all the different areas that are based.
