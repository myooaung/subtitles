00:04.040 --> 00:10.040
So let's say you can you can customize this single brokes are going up and these are the and you can

00:10.040 --> 00:11.560
see that we have these steps.

00:11.930 --> 00:14.010
We have the description and we'll have the reviews.

00:15.480 --> 00:18.280
So for example in this case let's see how you can remove these clips.

00:18.280 --> 00:24.910
Maybe your client doesn't want to display the description and see how you can do that.

00:24.920 --> 00:31.860
So I come in removes a tap in there single page broke.

00:32.870 --> 00:34.710
We're have it up for once again.

00:35.950 --> 00:41.140
And you can see that when you're working with will come on it's really common that you create these

00:41.140 --> 00:43.050
kooks for insurance.

00:43.060 --> 00:44.150
This was a must.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.690
This is the most powerful way.

00:45.730 --> 00:51.780
Well it was a Prius will combers website site and we're going to turn it back and remove underscore

00:51.930 --> 00:59.990
description and we're going on the field there at the Field there in this field that is called combers

01:00.800 --> 01:06.900
underscore broke underscore that's what going to come out.

01:06.970 --> 01:11.110
Then we pass these Gomar again.

01:11.440 --> 01:17.730
And what we're going to run this up to any so and when it does it does because we want to remove one

01:17.730 --> 01:24.690
of the steps you can up against and so Bri Bri you can see that.

01:24.700 --> 01:31.710
And so these pretax embattled bomp are going to be your best friend when you're working with these cougars

01:31.740 --> 01:34.430
and see what what's the content of the variable.

01:34.860 --> 01:43.040
So a lot of these and you can see that we have an array with the description and the reviews and we

01:43.040 --> 01:48.310
have the title and then we have the priority that we have the callback callback is a function that is

01:48.310 --> 01:52.300
Iranian to display these product description.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.110
So we're going to remove these.

01:57.110 --> 02:03.840
And you can see that we want to remove this description so we can use a BHB function call on set this

02:03.840 --> 02:06.450
will remove a portion of an array for example.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.980
Bus onset DAPs.

02:10.550 --> 02:15.940
And then the position in the array is the description.

02:15.980 --> 02:24.400
So we remove that and then we're to throw in that that's so save these and reload and you can see that

02:24.400 --> 02:31.160
we get rid of these description and of course in the same way that we're working here.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.110
You can't change the name of the top.

02:33.140 --> 02:36.830
You can add more taps or you can add more functionality.

02:36.860 --> 02:43.220
So let's see in the next video card you can make some changes in these steps.
