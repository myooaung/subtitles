00:04.080 --> 00:09.840
In the course materials for this course you will find in the fall there you will find two finds and

00:09.840 --> 00:12.950
you have to audition them for a little thing.

00:13.360 --> 00:24.310
One call biggie that jetpack and also other Waikoloa that Binjie the same logo is fully white fears

00:24.370 --> 00:30.540
we're going to bore you erase your body and up in the curly braces and we're going to add the background

00:30.550 --> 00:32.950
you match your red.

00:33.420 --> 00:37.740
And since we are in these this fall there are loads in this file.

00:37.950 --> 00:45.540
We need to go back on a level what used to dots and then we're up in the AM before that and they find

00:45.540 --> 00:53.170
that we want to display as the background is this B.G. that J-P save these and all.

00:53.290 --> 00:55.700
And you can see we had the background image.

00:55.900 --> 01:01.360
You can see that we have a problem in race here because race is starting to repeat the image by the

01:01.360 --> 01:05.250
fall and their backgrounds are and use her background.

01:05.800 --> 01:12.990
But we can fix this using background science and we're going to use color code where we will make the

01:13.020 --> 01:20.250
much bigger to fully go where the light and the width of the space that is available.

01:20.250 --> 01:25.200
So for example framing this week as you can see the match also is making bigger looking nice.

01:26.270 --> 01:30.150
So next we're going to see how you can remove these logo.

01:30.360 --> 01:36.260
These workers low in order to have our logo right and then inspect the code right here and I'm going

01:36.260 --> 01:38.560
to use this button and I'm going to click you.

01:38.930 --> 01:44.600
So you can see that we have an ID login then we have an issue 1 and then we have this stinker the logo.

01:44.600 --> 01:47.840
The word no is being printed using these anchor.

01:47.960 --> 01:50.390
And you see background image.

01:50.390 --> 01:57.130
So I'm going to copy the selected page right here and then going to replace that logo with mine.

01:57.140 --> 01:59.560
So we're going out background image again.

01:59.590 --> 02:04.100
We're going to use your read in the two dots at the beginning.

02:04.720 --> 02:12.450
We're going to use Logo that the N.G. save these up in the browser and reload.

02:12.470 --> 02:14.710
You can see that we have our logo right here.

02:14.900 --> 02:21.420
It's really really is Mallin that's because we have a lot of different uses.

02:21.560 --> 02:29.510
So you can see that we are about around size right here and the program size is set to 84 pixels.

02:29.630 --> 02:31.250
Then we have this kite.

02:31.490 --> 02:38.560
So the way it is set to 84 pixels and so there is has Maryan right here at Mardin zero hour.

02:38.560 --> 02:46.580
So if I were right here on the anchor you can see that that orange area is because of the margin and

02:46.580 --> 02:52.650
the area that is on Bluecoat or is the only area that is available to bring in the match.

02:52.970 --> 02:55.030
So we're going to fix that first.

02:55.040 --> 02:58.230
I'm going to remove the aldermanic and so work on an emergency room.

02:58.520 --> 03:04.950
Say these are low on the anchors you can see now we have the green area.

03:05.090 --> 03:07.150
Now we have the orange area to the right.

03:07.160 --> 03:14.000
So we're going to out with 100 percent so it's going to take all the space that is available over here

03:14.000 --> 03:17.070
and you can see now everything is blue.

03:17.170 --> 03:21.040
Next we need to change the background size to make the law a little bigger.

03:21.070 --> 03:28.100
We're going to use background size and I'm going to set these two two camera pixels say this and reload.

03:28.160 --> 03:36.320
Now you can see the logo is looking a little bigger but you can see that we're on the the only section

03:36.320 --> 03:39.650
that is available is the upper section of the law.

03:39.650 --> 03:45.960
So we're going to add something like height and we're going I said to one hundred and twenty pixels.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.320
Reload.

03:47.550 --> 03:51.750
You can see now we have got a really nice pass along.

03:51.750 --> 03:54.250
The logo is printed just fine.

03:55.160 --> 03:59.970
So you can see here if I can get here the blue area is looking nice.

04:00.350 --> 04:07.620
So next I want to change the color of the label so you can use these to inspect these in a login label

04:09.160 --> 04:18.030
on at login labor and you can see that is using a great color I want to change this to black color black

04:18.500 --> 04:26.340
envelope you can see that we have the labels on black and so on the bottom we have these laws your password.

04:26.490 --> 04:27.900
And back to or in a spat.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.630
So we're going to inspect these.

04:30.660 --> 04:35.800
So for example this one they lost your password you've just seen a pattern up with an I.D..

04:35.810 --> 04:38.670
Not if they click on this dangle.

04:38.940 --> 04:45.270
You can see it using an anchor and right here is the selector effect where a little more.

04:45.360 --> 04:52.230
You can see that we have another program for the back to the Caterina's by our online store link and

04:52.230 --> 04:55.000
that's if I click on this tangle you can see selling.

04:55.330 --> 05:02.170
So here is the selectors who can copy these chains that one the record or work when I use color.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.530
White and reload.

05:05.810 --> 05:11.560
So the color has changed to white but you can see if I over here is printing out blue collar.

05:11.990 --> 05:16.980
So I'm going to cry after the come on going out and to create a new light.

05:17.400 --> 05:26.250
We we're going to copy these days this again but I'm going to out right after the anchor it right here

05:26.260 --> 05:30.850
call it on so save these and reload.

05:30.950 --> 05:35.350
Now if I go over here you can see the color of the link is white.

05:35.900 --> 05:42.450
Finally went to center these so I'm going to add a reference to the balance the paired up with the knot

05:43.040 --> 05:45.870
and the paragraph with the bat to block.

05:46.130 --> 05:56.050
So we're going to copy these and right here maybe before the inkers and right here and there.

05:56.630 --> 06:04.330
And England takes that line why don't I send these reload again.

06:04.330 --> 06:06.250
Now you can see it's looking nice.

06:06.460 --> 06:08.990
Maybe we can make the font a little bigger.

06:09.070 --> 06:15.470
We can change these to font size 16 pixels and I'm going to make some the space race.

06:16.420 --> 06:22.730
So reloading is and then you can see this takes is a little bigger and it's looking nicer.

06:27.070 --> 06:32.170
So they're looking is looking great in the next video we're going to start working with this button

06:32.710 --> 06:38.590
in order to make the vote on this one looks more like these ones that we have here.
