00:04.140 --> 00:07.350
So let's see how you can add variations to your brokes.

00:07.590 --> 00:14.110
So for example if you're in the towers you can see we have little maybe we also have these brown green

00:14.490 --> 00:22.030
being red yellow and of course if you want to add this style was it really come on that so mistaught

00:22.440 --> 00:25.740
create one broke their color by.

00:25.740 --> 00:30.840
You can use variations and only the variation with the color.

00:31.110 --> 00:37.660
So we're going out right here and I'm going to click on any and the first color red you can see that

00:37.690 --> 00:41.210
we have all the data at the moment we have simple.

00:41.210 --> 00:44.870
So we're going to click here and it's going to be buried we're broke.

00:46.250 --> 00:48.680
So from here you can see we have relations right.

00:48.710 --> 00:55.100
So we're going to click here and there you can see before you add a variation you need to have some

00:55.100 --> 00:58.730
variation attributes in that that would stop.

00:58.730 --> 01:03.750
So it's up in these and from here you can click here you can see that we have anything.

01:04.100 --> 01:10.020
And I'm going to add a new variation or a new attribute in this case I'm going to call this one color.

01:11.050 --> 01:15.190
And for example you can see that we have the car is going to be blue maybe here we have the bad news

01:15.700 --> 01:22.160
and it says and there are some things and some attributes and using that pipe to separate the bodies.

01:22.270 --> 01:27.550
So we're going to have blue navy then we a bite.

01:27.550 --> 01:33.840
Second one is brown then where the bite did when it's green bite.

01:33.910 --> 01:40.630
And we have a big bite and then we have red and yellow red type in general.

01:41.020 --> 01:47.350
And from here you use for variations and save they added it's.

01:47.450 --> 01:52.510
So now you're going up in variations and you can add a variation.

01:52.510 --> 01:56.480
You can go here and from here you can select the color.

01:56.620 --> 02:02.790
So for example in this case I'm going to select blue navy and I'm going to click on this triangle here

02:03.080 --> 02:04.210
and you can see we've had these.

02:04.250 --> 02:05.810
I can see it here.

02:06.630 --> 02:08.580
And whether it be cabernet be applauded.

02:08.580 --> 02:09.170
All right.

02:09.170 --> 02:12.250
And actually he did and said that bearable too much.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.920
And I'm going to collapse these.

02:16.060 --> 02:19.420
You can see we have out variation number 19.

02:19.420 --> 02:20.460
Blue navy.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.330
That's nice.

02:21.330 --> 02:23.530
So we're going to create another one.

02:23.630 --> 02:30.700
So go and it's going to be brown clicking on the triangle.

02:30.950 --> 02:31.880
And click here.

02:32.230 --> 02:37.020
And we're going to upload all of these images.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.600
So this one is brown.

02:38.600 --> 02:42.630
You can see.

02:42.790 --> 02:47.600
And now that the image is how to apply it I'm going to ask you match.

02:47.770 --> 02:52.460
So and then I collapse these what can I go back to these men in the next video.

02:53.660 --> 02:58.750
So now we have brown in the Navy and you can click here and you can read these.

02:59.110 --> 03:00.000
That's nice.

03:00.140 --> 03:02.030
So what I'm going to either know that variation

03:04.810 --> 03:15.670
go and then we have green on the triangle and said we need much collapses and not another one.

03:17.100 --> 03:25.280
This case is going to be pink triangle because from the match being and we're going to have all the

03:25.370 --> 03:33.450
colors and it's going to be right on the triangle and they can read.

03:34.110 --> 03:44.480
And the last one is going to be yellow.

03:44.620 --> 03:46.450
So now you can see we have all the variations.

03:46.480 --> 03:53.310
Now you can click on Save Changes and on the right you can see we have six variations.

03:53.340 --> 03:56.630
You can expand these and you will see the variations.

03:57.060 --> 04:03.420
So now you can update these and up and the was up and these broke would be a Brul

04:08.350 --> 04:10.530
and you can see if we can color right here.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.800
And you can select different colors.

04:13.150 --> 04:20.470
So for example you can real maybe or you can select Brown or you can sell a being and you can set a

04:20.470 --> 04:25.100
green green and you can see that the match has a change in.

04:25.140 --> 04:33.600
So instead of having a bunch of brokes call it the same you can use variations in your can that sizes

04:34.110 --> 04:36.970
colors and other attributes.

04:37.050 --> 04:41.470
And this is the way that you handle these combers.

04:41.580 --> 04:46.770
So in the next video we're going to continue getting familiar with these variations.
