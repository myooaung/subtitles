00:04.260 --> 00:06.400
So let's see if you can add extra fields.

00:06.450 --> 00:17.880
So for example here on the billing details one of the functions I'm going to create a new function is

00:17.970 --> 00:21.510
that there are fields.

00:21.550 --> 00:29.080
Check check out what are going to use and the same that we copy it this is what it is.

00:29.260 --> 00:30.070
And these

00:34.140 --> 00:41.480
and I'm going to change the scatter nest by Chilcote's for years and then I got a nice Chiclets Viens

00:42.860 --> 00:43.370
school.

00:43.460 --> 00:57.040
They function here for example if you remember we we use Bre enclose breed that we bought them the is

00:57.040 --> 00:59.880
for fields.

00:59.980 --> 01:07.580
So if you say these and relo you couple all the are cute but you can see here we have the building.

01:07.650 --> 01:14.210
So in this building we can out there and the new fields are going to make something simple here.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.510
Fields meaning.

01:18.040 --> 01:24.200
And then they're going to create a new element of that not just a peach that you can create and you

01:24.190 --> 01:26.820
wear them it's really really easy.

01:27.080 --> 01:40.850
You know right now the I d I n numbers and we're going to am in a great race you know Ray what can I

01:40.860 --> 01:41.740
use.

01:41.750 --> 01:45.040
SS We're going out again.

01:45.740 --> 01:49.310
This is going to form grow white.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.690
So we're going to create a new field that will take the full week.

01:53.240 --> 01:55.070
And then you create the label.

01:55.220 --> 01:56.690
In this case Vintry

01:59.310 --> 02:13.730
I mean who That's Bayer even defecation number so let's say that you went to collect these for your

02:15.060 --> 02:15.710
Lions

02:18.380 --> 02:20.830
and then you are literate on these fields.

02:22.140 --> 02:23.590
Rid the world.

02:23.880 --> 02:32.060
Fields so you can save these and Rouleau and you can see them than you feel.

02:32.160 --> 02:37.950
So now the users when they fill this form is going to be added in.

02:37.960 --> 02:46.470
Check out information you can see that some of these are mandatory an again you're going at something

02:46.470 --> 02:49.790
like Echo free

02:56.810 --> 02:59.960
and you can see for example if it's required.

02:59.990 --> 03:01.260
True or false.

03:01.280 --> 03:08.960
For example if you want to make these require that you have required through and save these and reload

03:10.980 --> 03:12.370
What are these

03:16.340 --> 03:23.140
can you can see now we have these these sign that it's saying that this is requited so that you can

03:23.140 --> 03:25.720
see these are really simple fields.

03:25.930 --> 03:28.120
You can have a more complex one.

03:28.150 --> 03:33.260
So Rachel I'm going to put things in in this case I want to add something here.

03:33.670 --> 03:35.990
This is the order.

03:36.100 --> 03:46.580
And again if you have something like the RE and reload you can see if you remember we have a bean at

03:46.590 --> 03:51.930
the bottom we have all of our right here and you can add some extra foods right here so you can add

03:52.050 --> 03:55.300
extra features whatever you want in the array.

03:55.770 --> 03:57.150
So we're going to fields.

03:57.240 --> 04:03.140
What about all of that and you got an idea here about us.

04:04.310 --> 04:09.730
You would have another another RE know it's going to be that type.

04:10.020 --> 04:16.260
We're going to change that type here we did not that type because by the fall the tide this text input.

04:16.630 --> 04:23.100
But here we're going to select then we use this says And again we're going to copy these line

04:26.500 --> 04:28.340
knowing we're going to have the label.

04:28.670 --> 04:32.260
How did you hear about us

04:35.390 --> 04:39.020
ending what are going to add the options options.

04:39.170 --> 04:49.450
To be I say single quotes an array also and you can use the default selection for this select.

04:49.830 --> 04:53.290
It's going to be shoes.

04:53.660 --> 05:01.690
And then for example you can pass them by Stevy they'll be shown in case you arrange some special promos

05:01.690 --> 05:03.310
for that delusion.

05:03.460 --> 05:10.340
Radio and press radio Raissi and you can also use newspaper

05:19.490 --> 05:21.130
you can have internet

05:25.640 --> 05:32.190
or let's say that you want to use Facebook Halsall.

05:32.210 --> 05:41.080
So with these you can save these and low and if got to the bottom you can see that you have called Did

05:41.080 --> 05:42.180
you hear about all these.

05:42.180 --> 05:48.230
And you can select some options and you can have really much in the field that you want.

05:48.230 --> 05:53.200
For example you can either an extra feel for a special knowledge because we have one magic another all

05:53.200 --> 05:57.010
that is in this is a code to add something like these.
