WEBVTT

00:04.090 --> 00:10.600
So let's continue working with these left section and you can see that we have these ideas and I use

00:10.600 --> 00:11.970
this ID.

00:12.310 --> 00:17.840
And then we're going out to label them the label language the font size.

00:17.860 --> 00:23.250
We're going to make these bigger one point for him and I'm going to like these with important Fronde

00:23.610 --> 00:25.320
here to the end of this.

00:25.330 --> 00:29.890
Making a sample I'm going to use a lot of important flags.

00:30.170 --> 00:32.770
That's because we are using this link right here.

00:33.330 --> 00:36.610
And the way that it says works.

00:36.690 --> 00:39.720
This one is going to load later.

00:39.720 --> 00:49.590
This one is going to be the the this this stash is going to be the one that is going to load at the

00:49.590 --> 00:50.310
end.

00:50.880 --> 00:56.780
And that's why we need to write important for most of the selectors.

00:56.960 --> 01:02.010
That's fine them no not be brought in from family so why don't I use lotto.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.420
My son sorry.

01:04.720 --> 01:06.040
And we're going out of form.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.390
Wait.

01:07.390 --> 01:08.720
This is going to be set in Canada.

01:08.780 --> 01:13.470
And so I'm going to flag these with important save these and are those

01:16.270 --> 01:19.790
and you can see he's looking bigger and better.

01:19.790 --> 01:20.680
So next we're going to

01:24.060 --> 01:27.810
McCabe's and then going there to get the

01:30.550 --> 01:37.620
so the idea of them back is that we have the friend in the front line and of course you can have for

01:37.620 --> 01:41.970
example right here instead of having this and you can either be or back

01:50.110 --> 01:55.240
save these and RDO you can see he's working great bad.

01:55.420 --> 02:05.870
So you can use for example at amstaff and then you can use display table you don't and you can see some

02:05.870 --> 02:09.480
of Zong would need to also Center these margin out though

02:12.510 --> 02:19.850
now you can see Center either like he rated length might want him to decrease the light height right

02:19.850 --> 02:20.570
here.

02:21.050 --> 02:24.410
So last night was looking better.

02:24.510 --> 02:31.240
And when you're using the MTI you can see that we have these this kind of like that look we're going

02:31.250 --> 02:33.710
to remove that fun style.

02:33.800 --> 02:37.740
But again our Grosset these two regular

02:41.860 --> 02:47.920
snowman sort of old looking great.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.540
And what Almazan

02:52.990 --> 02:54.620
if they keep looking the same.

02:54.630 --> 02:57.820
This one is in uppercase and the other one is lowercase.

02:57.910 --> 03:01.560
The one on the top is bigger than the one on the bottom.

03:01.560 --> 03:05.390
What do I extract from uppercase here.

03:05.400 --> 03:10.800
We're going at this last fall none so save the central

03:13.400 --> 03:14.780
and you can see he's looking better.

03:14.780 --> 03:18.020
What I want to make this a little bigger maybe 1.8 m

03:21.740 --> 03:29.080
is looking better and we need to make this one and I use one size point eight AM Angua are going off

03:29.090 --> 03:30.900
like these are so important.

03:33.060 --> 03:35.320
Now you can see he's looking better.

03:35.430 --> 03:39.470
That these of course we have a lot of padding right here.

03:39.470 --> 03:40.980
We're going to fix that.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.730
Yeah maybe we can add a second class right here.

03:43.730 --> 03:49.770
Sign up for copy copies just Beys right here.

03:49.830 --> 03:55.450
Then we have input and we're going to add a height of three AM and we have enough.

03:55.480 --> 03:59.220
Again these are important and save these and reload.

03:59.290 --> 04:04.690
This will increase the size of the input and you can see bigger.

04:04.810 --> 04:08.990
And we went to remove these discoloring we can see a great color.

04:09.010 --> 04:14.590
So what are going on the water there non in well enough like these are important.

04:14.960 --> 04:19.050
Cirilo and you can see this looks a little better.

04:19.270 --> 04:21.490
What Almazan we need to style this butan.

04:21.520 --> 04:30.750
You can see you can see we have this class button so we can use sign up form button Ngwe composite color

04:30.870 --> 04:34.590
with the color coding the same is using this color.

04:34.620 --> 04:43.920
So we're going to copy these from the from the color guy working out background color an important

04:46.930 --> 04:48.180
say this and close

04:51.570 --> 04:57.690
now you can see the color has changed and we're going to have that padding to make the about the bottom

04:57.690 --> 05:02.870
of the boat on a little bigger around a certain piece of steel that picks and important.

05:02.940 --> 05:05.400
Maybe you are asking why are you using pixels.

05:05.530 --> 05:06.800
Well you see NEMS.

05:07.230 --> 05:11.270
Well you can also you can mix the values there is no problem with something like that.

05:12.740 --> 05:15.030
And this would make it a little bigger.

05:17.130 --> 05:25.180
Then we're going to change it to out are important that's because we have this simple treat him bad

05:25.260 --> 05:28.640
so this one is using the input types of meat.

05:28.890 --> 05:31.360
So we're going to change these two cried out.

05:31.620 --> 05:34.910
This will make the size a little different the height of the tongue.

05:35.490 --> 05:40.230
And if you take a look at the sign we need to make this ball there and uppercase.

05:40.240 --> 05:50.950
So we're going to transform uppercase again I have to two important are going to form weight so any

05:50.990 --> 05:55.460
candidate and important I mean save this and reload

05:59.550 --> 06:09.380
and the final step is to make the font size bigger 1.4 and an important alot of importance right here.

06:10.250 --> 06:11.870
So you can see he's looking great.

06:12.040 --> 06:24.190
And you can see that we have my page right here where we can either query screen and mean and get 768

06:24.940 --> 06:25.970
big cells.

06:26.140 --> 06:32.950
And we're going to copy these bage right here and we're going to use Hartrick another Merioneth and

06:33.020 --> 06:37.020
we're going to use mine or stem cells and I'm going after I mean it's important.

06:38.130 --> 06:40.260
Ryno these.

06:40.340 --> 06:45.830
Now you can see it now it's close to the limb for me.

06:45.830 --> 06:48.520
This is Mother.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.350
You can see it is looking great.

06:51.300 --> 06:57.020
But the scene where we have a lot of padding on the bottom of a lot of margin.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.040
We need to inspect the color and you can see it right here.

07:00.040 --> 07:07.100
We have this orange area and you can see we have this form right here so we can remove the bottom to

07:07.120 --> 07:07.800
zero.

07:10.300 --> 07:20.590
It's going to be matched against zero so we're going to scrub and we have these made form and then we

07:20.590 --> 07:23.070
have to form a bottom.

07:23.100 --> 07:26.270
Cyril save these and reload

07:29.450 --> 07:31.440
and you can see now he's looking great.

07:32.710 --> 07:40.650
So maybe we can add we can remove that some more more body than you can see here in the form we have

07:40.650 --> 07:43.370
somebody in.

07:43.450 --> 07:46.340
So we cannot by the bottom zero as well.

07:47.890 --> 07:50.120
God maybe he's going to be the final

07:54.570 --> 07:56.670
and I'm going to important right here.

08:01.980 --> 08:04.700
You may be an important class right here.

08:04.960 --> 08:12.420
And we're on so we can close this relo and you can see we have six that I subscribe to the newsletter

08:12.480 --> 08:16.070
and then we have the form and they would subscribe.

08:17.100 --> 08:26.560
So it was a little tricky but that's how you can customize matching use by writing SS and you can change

08:26.560 --> 08:27.510
the markup.

08:28.640 --> 08:35.060
So let's start working with the future of this Web site before we start working with the internal pages

08:35.690 --> 08:37.230
of this online store.
