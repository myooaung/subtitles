00:04.540 --> 00:08.910
So let's see how you can display the Sabin's in dollars right here.

00:09.720 --> 00:22.740
So what is going on on this page right here and we're going to create a new common display Sabin's dollars.

00:22.870 --> 00:33.420
So we're going to create a fun show on what I call these 113-A spa underscore safe prize donors get

00:33.490 --> 00:41.910
the best price and the the prize the carbon pricing their sale price and the look that this belongs

00:41.910 --> 00:42.610
to.

00:43.050 --> 00:52.880
So what going to hook these into FIELDFARE and they hook this call with commerce underskirt to get on

00:52.880 --> 00:53.510
the score.

00:53.600 --> 01:01.930
Price demand then we pass this function to communicate these and we're going around the priority of

01:01.930 --> 01:03.790
telling we're passing through arguments.

01:03.800 --> 01:13.610
These two arguments that we have here so that for example you can use again echo free and they call

01:13.790 --> 01:18.440
Bre and you can buy them dump the price.

01:18.440 --> 01:24.600
For example save these and relo.

01:24.770 --> 01:28.600
So now you can see we have the price right here.

01:28.760 --> 01:32.210
And if you pass product you will have additional information.

01:33.470 --> 01:35.350
With everything about the brother.

01:35.690 --> 01:40.740
So you can see we have a bunch of information right here that you can use for different customisations

01:40.820 --> 01:42.370
you want to make.

01:42.380 --> 01:44.510
So we're going to remove everything from here.

01:47.990 --> 01:54.810
And we can use for example something like a Neve we're going around these Fondation only if we have

01:54.810 --> 02:02.040
our special price and we're going to pass Brul.

02:02.240 --> 02:07.640
And then what do you know we're going to use a function called Go get cell rights in case that we are

02:07.640 --> 02:10.430
running our special offer.

02:10.670 --> 02:20.680
These metals will return the sale price and we're going to return rights.

02:20.890 --> 02:22.710
So we cannot seem to make a call.

02:22.830 --> 02:32.190
Just there is this Gunt just that there's that this is working and relo these and you can see that we

02:32.190 --> 02:42.700
have just recently gone and we can move these and we're going to have this day because it's what you

02:42.740 --> 02:47.710
and I create a new variable called saves equals 2 broke.

02:48.750 --> 02:55.790
And we're going to use another method to get regular price so therefore insurance and get set price

02:56.350 --> 03:02.610
will display these $10 in the regular price it will display just $50.

03:02.900 --> 03:08.300
So in order to say to the brain they say we need to do some math here.

03:08.420 --> 03:15.010
So for example we have 50 minus this product surprise.

03:15.100 --> 03:26.130
The same variable will have a value of $5 and we can use a function called the underscore price.

03:26.160 --> 03:34.240
So this function will cumbered any number into commerce price.

03:34.260 --> 03:43.030
So with something like this we can create another line of code and then we can do it on the price of

03:43.040 --> 03:44.800
an adult aspirin.

03:45.110 --> 03:51.720
So we can use a format of the string and then we can add something like something like this and say

03:51.720 --> 03:57.710
that it is present so is going to say and you say well say

04:02.890 --> 04:05.000
and Grace you don't get to that percentage.

04:05.040 --> 04:05.660
It's.

04:05.800 --> 04:10.610
So here is where the same variable is going to be added.

04:10.860 --> 04:16.890
This way I'm using this spring of this speech before action that you can use for example the string

04:16.890 --> 04:21.560
inside the function in a variable outside.

04:21.580 --> 04:27.120
So right here I say of these parentheses and go into a coma and say.

04:27.220 --> 04:32.270
So the body of save is going to be injected in right here.

04:32.290 --> 04:41.380
That's one of the advantages of using an aspirin and right here we can coma and commerce whereas in

04:41.420 --> 04:49.420
the Zomi and rescue so you can save these and we're no different in.

04:49.510 --> 04:56.760
And you can see that we can save and we have use the $5 you can see here we have say and you can it's

04:56.970 --> 04:58.530
the men for example.

04:58.960 --> 05:02.060
So it's either A B or attack b error.

05:02.630 --> 05:05.430
Brady's new line.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.030
So that's real low.

05:07.130 --> 05:09.760
And you can see how the price on the top.

05:09.760 --> 05:18.920
And then you have saved you the $5 $5 and we're going to have for example on this ban with the class

05:20.520 --> 05:22.460
same amount.

05:22.470 --> 05:25.190
So with these glasses we're going to start these would see it says

05:28.810 --> 05:34.880
and right after these percent that is what we're going to close this ban so you can save these up and

05:34.880 --> 05:43.890
I end the browser and if I right click here and this big recall we the man you came right here and here

05:44.240 --> 05:50.290
is a man with the same amount glass that we can see see this.

05:50.310 --> 05:59.190
So now we have the the original price the set price and where this plane does say in dollars.

05:59.720 --> 06:05.150
In upcoming years I'm going to show you quote what percentage buy.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.890
This is one of the tricks that you can apply on your websites.

06:09.170 --> 06:15.410
So in the next video we're going to write some C assist studies span with the class save a mild.
