00:04.280 --> 00:06.650
So let's don't be like that.

00:06.710 --> 00:11.540
I think you on that and I'm going to click it to the compress file once.

00:11.630 --> 00:12.800
I love it.

00:13.160 --> 00:19.210
And I'm going up and piquant in blue jeans and we're on up and the Lucy is lighter.

00:19.510 --> 00:26.090
We're going up and this folder first and then I create two folders see SS Angie is sorry.

00:26.230 --> 00:30.360
That's a good idea to have this organization in your presents.

00:30.830 --> 00:32.340
So we're going to open that.

00:32.470 --> 00:33.080
Yes.

00:33.140 --> 00:34.630
But again I'm one of these.

00:34.940 --> 00:36.750
You have two options there.

00:36.890 --> 00:37.530
Yes.

00:37.610 --> 00:45.340
In the mean if UK version of this yes are they ask if I were going to move these they were up in this

00:45.580 --> 00:48.620
another folder and you have two options.

00:48.710 --> 00:52.830
The CSA is and there are many many fire services version.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.760
Again we're going to move the fight better.

00:54.770 --> 01:00.530
And so they just thought there is going to be a huge You can ignore the other fives.

01:00.530 --> 01:03.290
They are not needed to work with me like that.

01:04.330 --> 01:11.170
So we're going to Lowe's scripts and styles.

01:12.180 --> 01:21.020
So loading these scripts and it does it's really simpler than doing the same in our pristine Rumack

01:21.030 --> 01:27.380
we have a function where we're going to see is like there underscore scripts and then you hook these

01:27.490 --> 01:33.950
in I'm going at add action and Rohit then you get this and that will be on scripts.

01:34.930 --> 01:42.560
Then you pass these function and you're going to have this year sets in javascript files right.

01:42.580 --> 01:43.320
Right.

01:44.560 --> 01:52.700
But first define About find a path to the Greens to the Bruijn.

01:52.720 --> 01:59.520
So for example you cannot define and you can add something like WCAC like there underscore but in the

01:59.520 --> 02:01.850
second parameter is going to be the value.

02:01.930 --> 02:08.560
So you can have something like blue jeans your red and then for example you can echo these value

02:16.800 --> 02:23.310
and up and the website give them that I'm going to reload now you can see that we have they are right

02:23.320 --> 02:31.280
here local cause we're combers all the content in brogans so it compiles right here five to the current

02:31.300 --> 02:38.720
five and reload and you can see that we have something different because we have the right and we have

02:38.710 --> 02:42.840
allocations manage the logs and everything.

02:42.840 --> 02:48.650
This one looks better but you can see that it's adding a bunch of extra information.

02:49.470 --> 02:58.530
In my case I think that a function called the blue in your red green day or your red is better for these.

02:58.650 --> 03:05.930
So you can say these entered old you can see that we have that cauldron for.

03:06.910 --> 03:11.970
So we have this back and we can now know their style sheets and everything.

03:14.890 --> 03:18.550
Be on cue style.

03:19.160 --> 03:26.460
And we're going to call this one I come we're commanding we use that the despite that we have at it.

03:26.560 --> 03:31.750
This is Leider but we are looking at any value and then we see a.

03:33.160 --> 03:41.320
And we're going to be in D.C. assess whether or not these name Jake worry that mistakes like that that

03:41.330 --> 03:47.970
mean that's Jasus you can save these and up in the route and indifferent on it.

03:49.910 --> 03:54.610
And when that right click means pick open the console and check that there are no errors.

03:54.630 --> 04:01.260
Rohit So I mean that this has added correctly.

04:01.560 --> 04:10.600
Next we're going to add though on on you scrape in we're going to explain that Jay is really similar

04:10.600 --> 04:10.910
to these.

04:10.910 --> 04:23.940
We're going to copy these anguish are that is and rice it the fine for these quirky mixes like that

04:24.000 --> 04:33.110
that mean that G is so save this again and reload and you can see the problem that is required is not

04:33.110 --> 04:39.920
the fine it's really come on that for example you create a plugin that requires equerry but also it's

04:39.920 --> 04:44.370
really common that another plug in that is already installed.

04:44.550 --> 04:47.010
I was really on Tuesday.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.680
So you can use an if statement right here.

04:50.120 --> 04:57.600
You can use or be scrip is in your check for the record remember the query is not really are adding

04:57.610 --> 04:59.210
WordPress.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.770
Then you check their state.

05:00.770 --> 05:06.810
For example if it's on Qs you Fiesole radio and you this pallidus it should be there.

05:07.280 --> 05:13.650
You can read on this and just keep this statement in case that is not being.

05:13.670 --> 05:15.980
You cannot though to be on cue.

05:18.800 --> 05:21.550
Scrip and you can on cue.

05:21.650 --> 05:28.170
Jake Querrey so fills your check if another plane or that team radiologic work on.

05:28.170 --> 05:36.740
Q You are Estep these in case are not Napoleon or not him is a has the aquarium gear your own cueist

05:36.780 --> 05:39.060
grip and your boss.

05:39.070 --> 05:45.620
Jake wari So now you come to these and you can see that we get rid of that message.

05:45.660 --> 05:53.800
So in this video we created this path to the core employee and then we added Jake wari B AXS like they

05:53.930 --> 06:00.780
are dangerous clepe and this Jasus fine so brilliant looking nice in the next video.

06:01.050 --> 06:08.160
Let's continue working and we're going to create charcoal to display this information using astronautical.
