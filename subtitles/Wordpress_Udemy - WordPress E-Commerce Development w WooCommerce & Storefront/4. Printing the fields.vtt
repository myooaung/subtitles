So let's continue working in this video we're going to print the icons.

00:08.720 --> 00:13.660
So we're going to leave anybody in these when we have columns for.

00:13.680 --> 00:19.110
So we're going to print four of the three of these babies based on race.

00:19.760 --> 00:27.200
So next we're going to teach people to be there field and we're going to bring the comperes So we're

00:27.200 --> 00:35.270
going up and the group and Rachel like her future and what sort of an inside single quotes that Barlu

00:36.810 --> 00:46.920
ending what are going to happen and what do these play these copy these.

00:48.760 --> 00:56.440
Embraced the mix and I think we can copy these here right here and here.

00:56.570 --> 01:06.860
So we're going to change the numbers to two and three and three save these and reload it's got to add

01:06.860 --> 01:07.660
up.

01:07.910 --> 01:16.260
And you can see we have free Shippen secure payments and retros and refunds and a D.A. in every part

01:16.270 --> 01:18.890
of their we need to have that.

01:18.990 --> 01:25.750
You don't call them features on are reforms in every order.

01:26.280 --> 01:30.580
Something was missing right there Cirilo.

01:31.040 --> 01:33.290
And you can see this is looking nice.

01:33.350 --> 01:34.570
We are printing these.

01:34.640 --> 01:39.040
For example let's say that our client wants to add something else.

01:39.410 --> 01:50.070
Maybe they found or they want to display a special brochure free shipping or there's over 50 and the

01:50.100 --> 01:54.260
the they feel and the Boston Globe.

01:54.750 --> 01:56.730
And you can see we have 50.

01:56.820 --> 01:59.310
So definitely this is looking nice.

01:59.370 --> 02:05.470
This is something that we can make really easily thanks to advance custom fields and all comers.

02:05.880 --> 02:11.700
But in the next video we're going to see how we can use this section with some success.
