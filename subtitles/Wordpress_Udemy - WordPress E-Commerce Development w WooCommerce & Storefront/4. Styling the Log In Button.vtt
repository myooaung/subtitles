WEBVTT

00:03.740 --> 00:05.790
So the screen is looking great.

00:05.900 --> 00:12.770
Now it's time to sign this book and you can see this what is really de-friend to these ones.

00:12.980 --> 00:18.990
This one is the same gluten that you will find in the school of Wordpress or in the back in appears.

00:18.990 --> 00:25.670
And when I inspect these and right here you are in times like these you can see that the are of this

00:25.900 --> 00:31.440
is here on the table you grab the Picardie why you don't go to lunch.

00:31.680 --> 00:36.730
So we have to because you can get at the bottom we have the low bottom primary.

00:37.110 --> 00:38.910
So we're working with the Longinus screen.

00:38.920 --> 00:46.940
And when I use these bays right here we're going to change the color of the now used background color

00:47.720 --> 00:57.250
and in this case I mean I use one of these called or all these these will come together the color copies.

00:59.290 --> 01:04.710
Impales rice and say these and reload.

01:04.840 --> 01:10.830
Now you can see because the color is looking nice but there are some problems here because fears are

01:10.840 --> 01:14.100
considered that he says Malberg radio was this.

01:14.170 --> 01:20.280
There is a bluebottle there and at the bottom you can see this is my show and that's so cute on the

01:20.520 --> 01:24.080
letters and then he says In shall write that.

01:24.160 --> 01:29.390
So what you cannot remove everything is and will not remove the border what are going to border known

01:29.890 --> 01:32.630
what when or remove that can see.

01:32.650 --> 01:40.560
We get rid of the border then we're going to have shadow zero.

01:42.280 --> 01:49.040
And no I think it's going to be there reset value for the picture it is going to win.

01:49.050 --> 01:54.350
I know you can see he's looking better looking then we're going to add book Shadow.

01:54.520 --> 01:58.670
So what going I said these numb reload.

01:59.210 --> 02:00.480
And we get rid of that.

02:00.480 --> 02:06.450
But finally we're going to outboard their radios to hear what are going on to remove them or their radios

02:07.070 --> 02:08.960
of the boot of.

02:09.030 --> 02:14.560
So next you can see here for example if I take a look inside a little bigger.

02:14.730 --> 02:16.580
So what are going to change that.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.190
What are going out of my body.

02:18.510 --> 02:28.490
Well we're not buying them B-cells and top and bottom and maybe if the pieces left and right and left

02:28.490 --> 02:29.430
and right.

02:29.840 --> 02:36.560
So say these and renos and you can see nothing happens because here on the top we have these on the

02:36.620 --> 02:40.240
Picower UI butan with a large.

02:40.310 --> 02:44.910
This one is a bigger selector and also has a bigger weight on your system.

02:45.000 --> 02:52.130
You can see we have padded race you and our selector is not that specific as this one.

02:52.520 --> 02:53.390
So we can fix that.

02:53.400 --> 03:01.780
You've seen an important important say this and reload and you can see that we have the pattern but

03:01.790 --> 03:06.370
you can see that the button looks like the button he's been dreaming.

03:06.380 --> 03:09.050
The prosecutor can see OK it's incomplete.

03:09.080 --> 03:14.270
If you take a look here in this section you can see that we can't be called you UI and this White House

03:14.810 --> 03:17.120
kind of picks and set.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.940
So the only stake in that not right.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.820
That's why it looks like it's been three minutes.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.640
So we're going to change up too high.

03:25.930 --> 03:31.340
And we're going pluck out or in we're going on so important like Cirilo these.

03:31.670 --> 03:34.730
And you can see there with his Louisville looking better.

03:36.270 --> 03:41.530
The last thing that I want to make is to make this bigger So we're going to have to get 100 percent

03:41.540 --> 03:45.690
to make a bigger route on a wider.

03:45.740 --> 03:47.280
Now is that nice.

03:47.720 --> 03:51.790
And I went through some separation between there remember me and the lawyer.

03:52.290 --> 03:53.990
So what is another matter though.

03:54.200 --> 04:00.590
Maybe any pixels something like that save these and reload and I you can see that we have the separation

04:00.590 --> 04:00.970
ratio.

04:00.980 --> 04:02.640
So this is looking nice.

04:03.020 --> 04:06.990
So for example if I look over here you can see it's print in the blue color.

04:07.250 --> 04:12.650
If I go over here you can see that we have a different variation of this color so fierce I'm going to

04:12.740 --> 04:17.590
inspect one of these some of these one on the top.

04:17.820 --> 04:23.100
You can see that because we have these golden Hopkins where when I click on behavior

04:26.560 --> 04:33.470
that will activate this Wooton and then you can see have the a color which is a little darker.

04:33.970 --> 04:44.840
So we're going to lug in book on primary and then we're going to have the background color which is

04:44.840 --> 04:49.240
this one sort or more of these seines And.

04:51.610 --> 04:59.950
Now when I wear I forgot were color so say these are love again.

05:00.470 --> 05:06.050
Now when I go to you can see that we have the color variation ratios in Nice.

05:06.170 --> 05:13.030
So here on day one I select day the Joe Cobb I'm going back to you.

05:13.610 --> 05:17.280
And I'm going to activate a different estate of for example the hacktivism.

05:17.510 --> 05:22.530
You can see when they activate the active code obviously different.

05:22.850 --> 05:32.350
So what are going to companies that call my race you actually say these and relo.

05:32.500 --> 05:36.340
Now you can check active again you can see how we get rid of the blue color.

05:36.790 --> 05:41.590
And when I click on covariances working fine for cause you can see we have the same problem.

05:41.590 --> 05:47.250
So we're going to go for those results again.

05:47.760 --> 05:50.100
So you can see is working.

05:50.110 --> 05:51.720
And finally did.

05:51.820 --> 05:53.300
We don't have any problems.

05:54.140 --> 06:00.710
So in this video we style is what I'm looking nicer I think in the next video Latika we can either Chido

06:00.860 --> 06:04.680
into this form that we have here to login into work press.
