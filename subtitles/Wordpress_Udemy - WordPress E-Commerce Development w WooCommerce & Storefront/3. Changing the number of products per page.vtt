00:04.310 --> 00:11.130
So this was one of the examples that I showed earlier code to change the number of brogues bill page.

00:11.270 --> 00:19.980
So we're out and on the hook change then that approach is there page.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.900
By default they will command the shop page will display them brokes.

00:27.960 --> 00:32.830
So what are going to see how you can make a change in the numbers who are going to to go back.

00:34.220 --> 00:43.710
Or in this underscore what or when I call these when brokes the page what are going on Pascrell books

00:45.230 --> 00:54.090
that filter in there who are these these low underscore shop on got fair wage.

00:54.260 --> 01:00.030
So you can see this is really seeming up these days what no Chupke columns and these these little shop

01:00.080 --> 01:03.320
or page what are going up as these function

01:07.550 --> 01:11.610
and what have I said the priority of Duane.

01:11.710 --> 01:20.050
So here for example we have these brokes and I'm going to brokes equals to let's say four and then we

01:20.050 --> 01:21.250
read it on the brogues.

01:21.460 --> 01:28.840
The amount of probes that we went to play in each page you can say these up and they're running again.

01:30.300 --> 01:32.090
And then you can see every car on the floor brokes.

01:32.080 --> 01:37.990
And we have these major will would generate these pager based on the amount of problems you got and

01:37.990 --> 01:44.380
answer them on the probes that you're printing began to get onto and you can see the rest of the products

01:45.670 --> 01:48.130
are really simple and really simple hook.

01:48.300 --> 01:54.550
But sometimes their clients want to display behind images especially if they have Mile amounts of produce.

01:54.570 --> 02:01.320
Maybe they went to these play for produce put a page in columns of two or something like that.

02:01.320 --> 02:05.640
Now you have the coats to achieve something like that in wool combers.
