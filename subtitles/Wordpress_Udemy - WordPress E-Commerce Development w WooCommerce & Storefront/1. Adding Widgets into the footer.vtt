WEBVTT

00:04.020 --> 00:07.080
So let's start working with the future of the Web site.

00:07.230 --> 00:11.180
You can see that we have these three sections on the bullet on the bottom.

00:11.250 --> 00:13.630
We have some content for the about outdoors.

00:13.890 --> 00:20.540
We also have some categories for the different categories of the pros and we also have the menu.

00:20.660 --> 00:27.640
So we're going up and Crome and then going up in the back in and then going up in obedience deems periods

00:27.650 --> 00:29.950
we get.

00:30.190 --> 00:37.300
So in a storefront you will find that we have for the friend Forder we did songs.

00:37.340 --> 00:43.980
So for example it's the dextro here these when I read or write it takes you can use that to text.

00:44.330 --> 00:48.990
It's going to be something like in the newest version of what was we have these manually something nice

00:49.910 --> 00:57.000
and we're going out about Ole's about was and what we're going to pick up stakes.

00:57.070 --> 01:03.170
So let's say that we went to either mild description of the business one that's the and now you're going

01:03.170 --> 01:08.250
up in the front end level and you can see we have about those.

01:08.380 --> 01:15.330
So this is this banding you know they can't an area because we only have one widget is currently active.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.660
So we're not close these.

01:17.690 --> 01:20.620
So for example you can see that we have categories right here.

01:20.810 --> 01:28.050
And if you happen again in the back in you can see that on the bottom we have a lot of different widgets

01:28.280 --> 01:31.040
specially designed for commerce.

01:31.300 --> 01:34.020
And you have the average rating field there.

01:34.020 --> 01:40.320
The guard in Korea will find these commercial brother categories so you can read here and add these

01:40.320 --> 01:41.240
to the.

01:41.360 --> 01:45.660
Now the widget and you can see that we have some different options.

01:45.660 --> 01:50.420
These are the options where you can customize how these is going to be this play.

01:51.590 --> 01:55.850
So you can see if we could get the words right here and then when I leave that title of the categories

01:55.850 --> 01:58.030
I mean this is really a descriptive name.

01:58.030 --> 02:00.990
So what do you say android of the phone.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.660
And again you can see them a couple of categories.

02:04.910 --> 02:06.730
And we have candle's guide.

02:06.870 --> 02:11.300
Else come cutes and tightwads you can change the scene.

02:11.360 --> 02:18.000
For example am active these done with these one and say reload.

02:18.100 --> 02:23.330
You can see that we have these number with the amount of probes that we have available.

02:23.520 --> 02:31.810
We can check these one show this is a drop down say and reload the front and and then you can select

02:31.810 --> 02:34.050
from these drop and you may have been in another.

02:34.100 --> 02:37.590
We finally have these seen in many years so on.

02:37.630 --> 02:48.740
Check these and for me it does show Iraqi save and reload is going to be the one that I want to use.

02:48.780 --> 02:56.360
So next for example you have a menu and we come for example Greek You don't cause the menu and from

02:56.360 --> 03:03.890
here you can have and we're going to use for column for a widget and for if you can select the many

03:03.890 --> 03:05.580
that went to the play.

03:05.810 --> 03:08.360
My opinion I'm going to use the main navigation.

03:08.510 --> 03:14.020
This is the same menu that we have on the top and I'm going to use this in the food.

03:14.210 --> 03:14.630
So what.

03:14.700 --> 03:16.660
What are you on at the menu right here.

03:16.970 --> 03:17.990
Save these.

03:18.100 --> 03:25.440
And you know the front in and you can see we have these menu and we have something like this.

03:25.530 --> 03:29.880
So we said we can't remove For example this because we're ready have these on the right on the left

03:31.440 --> 03:41.320
and we'll kind of studies but you have a bunch of different widgets and we get songs to play with when

03:41.320 --> 03:44.760
you're customizing your combers store.

03:44.980 --> 03:50.290
Once we're in the shop page I'm going to show you how to work with all of these and the different options

03:50.440 --> 03:54.120
that each of these idiots has.

03:54.220 --> 03:56.040
But now you can see this is looking better.

03:56.990 --> 04:01.810
So the don't we have this by and we have everything in this stuff from the sign will combers.

04:01.810 --> 04:05.080
We're going to see how we can add these decks only.

04:05.510 --> 04:10.160
And we're going to add this Jasus to have something like this.

04:10.310 --> 04:14.400
You can see I'm using the search and that is search.

04:14.390 --> 04:20.670
When did updateable when I click hit is going to be a column for the widget.

04:20.950 --> 04:24.830
And I said Sure I hear something that I was missing.

04:24.910 --> 04:28.780
So the front in and I you can see we have the search.

04:29.100 --> 04:31.510
So it's Gandini in the next video.
