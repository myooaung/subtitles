WEBVTT

00:04.390 --> 00:10.160
So let's review some of the options that we have here in the newcomers settings that you can see that

00:10.180 --> 00:14.130
first we have the general and Frank if you can change the location of this store.

00:14.180 --> 00:20.560
You can see at the moment is United States California but you can change anytime the location of your

00:20.560 --> 00:21.160
store.

00:22.660 --> 00:27.940
Then we have to send in locations from here you can select the countries where you want to sell your

00:27.940 --> 00:35.530
brokes you can select all the countries all said to all countries except for you cannot some countries

00:36.140 --> 00:37.470
where you you want to send.

00:37.570 --> 00:44.930
Maybe you find trouble sending products to that countries or something.

00:45.160 --> 00:50.020
Then you have said specific countries if you only want to sell to some specific countries you cannot

00:50.140 --> 00:51.160
live right here.

00:52.470 --> 00:58.740
You can ask for example the hour our Jerry hour or something like that in this day countries the only

00:58.740 --> 01:01.870
countries where you can sell your brogues.

01:02.040 --> 01:06.460
So let's get all the countries name we have the shipping locations.

01:06.460 --> 01:09.620
These waters really really seem that.

01:09.680 --> 01:17.780
So for example you are maybe selling digital and physical books you can sell to other countries but

01:17.780 --> 01:23.810
maybe you want to sell only digital prose to some specific countries so you can play with these values

01:24.380 --> 01:29.000
to sell the other countries by ownership to some specific countries.

01:29.030 --> 01:32.700
That's something really nice about commerce.

01:32.850 --> 01:37.910
Then you can see that we have the default customer location and you can see that we have your locate

01:38.640 --> 01:42.620
so you can see for example we have some products here on the cot and I'm going to remove these of the

01:42.630 --> 01:43.730
the card number.

01:43.910 --> 01:45.380
Now the card is going to be empty.

01:45.390 --> 01:49.880
So are you going to get them to shop and leftside for example.

01:51.140 --> 02:03.120
These are said what about where and what have the brown whether new Navy in each and they were playing

02:03.120 --> 02:10.230
with gello and meet you at the card you can see we have $5 and you can get them you got a

02:16.340 --> 02:18.750
so you can see the customer match.

02:18.800 --> 02:30.440
So on United States and said check out and for example using the geo locate in reading the IP of the

02:30.440 --> 02:34.860
user will change these right here and live in Mexico.

02:34.940 --> 02:37.700
Will the United States buy.

02:37.730 --> 02:40.220
Maybe it's because I changed the law right here.

02:40.360 --> 02:47.990
But you can use your locate and this will at least feel the value for the country your readers.

02:48.020 --> 02:55.550
So now you have and they will DOCSIS if you want to charge taxes you can enable or disable you have

02:55.550 --> 03:00.770
to make sure that the products that you're selling maybe they are tax free or you have to make sure

03:00.800 --> 03:02.250
if you have to pay taxes.

03:02.340 --> 03:07.310
So make sure that you make some research about the products that you're selling.

03:07.460 --> 03:10.980
And if you have to pay taxes this one is not is.

03:11.030 --> 03:12.410
This is really really nice.

03:12.410 --> 03:19.430
For example you can enable these and you can create a method of sort of going at something like Bichette

03:19.460 --> 03:20.740
for the weekend.

03:23.080 --> 03:33.870
20 percent off in all your plans use the coupon when percent of weaken something like that.

03:34.800 --> 03:42.220
You can save the changes in open the front end of your site and you can see on the bottom we have these

03:42.240 --> 03:44.810
Notice special for the weekend.

03:44.810 --> 03:49.220
Twenty percent of you know they are they're using coupons 20 percent all weekend.

03:49.370 --> 03:57.920
So that's something nice if a hobby a big sale or if you are trying to make some maintainance on your

03:57.920 --> 04:02.450
Web site you can send a notice using this option that's something really nice.

04:03.220 --> 04:05.000
Then we cover the currency options.

04:05.020 --> 04:15.010
You can change dollars and the position left or right in the space or without the space separator and

04:15.010 --> 04:17.190
the number of decimals.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.300
Something really important here is the currency.

04:20.310 --> 04:23.920
So for example let's say I have a brother right here at.

04:24.140 --> 04:25.520
So that's up in these from.

04:25.750 --> 04:31.770
You can see at the moment the company in it's $50.

04:31.950 --> 04:37.300
Maybe you want to change these to make a Mexican pestle.

04:37.520 --> 04:42.950
If you change it to Mexican peso you have to make the changes right here because if you change the Mexican

04:42.950 --> 04:49.700
peso and you live this is going to charge fifty pesos which is less than $1.

04:49.820 --> 04:55.370
So if you decide to make a change in the currency remember you have to make changes in all the products

04:55.370 --> 04:56.710
of your store.

04:56.990 --> 05:00.290
So you have to make the changes in other shipping methods and everything.

05:00.680 --> 05:07.010
So make sure that you have the correct currency before adding the products and everything.

05:09.130 --> 05:15.360
So this is it for the general section in the next video is what are going to continue working with these.

05:15.460 --> 05:21.760
And then I show you each of these dives that we have in the Settings tab of Commerce.
