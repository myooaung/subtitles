00:04.510 --> 00:07.720
So finally let's see how you can work with shipping classes.

00:07.750 --> 00:12.030
The only tab that we have is the shipping classes.

00:12.390 --> 00:19.410
Q And for a kid what are going to select next year on that shipping class on that right.

00:20.450 --> 00:30.750
And it said something like insurance insurance and that's how insurance for your brother or something

00:30.750 --> 00:36.690
like that and save the shipping as he considers LARC is generated by the Bruijn.

00:36.720 --> 00:44.350
So now you can shop in the shipping sun's in the United States but not the.

00:44.430 --> 00:51.340
For example let's say that we want to have an insurance if the user pays dollars in the flat rate.

00:51.350 --> 00:56.630
We're going to get some insurance or we're going to click on it at the bottom we have shipping class

00:57.460 --> 00:58.500
cost.

00:59.010 --> 01:07.490
So from here you can see that we can add the insurance so that Satine dollars some extra to the shipping

01:07.580 --> 01:13.760
and the pros and you can see that we can make the calculation better class and you can see we can also

01:13.760 --> 01:18.790
make that the calculation that in this case I went to use better class.

01:18.830 --> 01:25.250
So we're going to save the changes then you need to specify which brokes are going to have this insurance.

01:25.460 --> 01:31.340
So we're going up and the products and let's say that we want to offer the insurance in the company.

01:31.590 --> 01:37.950
This looks like approach there can be mass in the shipping so we're to open the kid and Rachel at the

01:37.950 --> 01:43.370
bottom we have shipping and procured you cannot ship in class and you cannot get insurance.

01:43.410 --> 01:50.600
So this way for example you can create your class and then you decide which products will have this

01:50.610 --> 01:51.280
class.

01:52.070 --> 01:58.880
So lots of ladies there are of course some products where there is no reason to have an insurance.

01:58.880 --> 02:05.420
So for example the towels they want break in they in the shipping or something.

02:05.440 --> 02:11.570
So we have to come get and see if we have a good right here.

02:11.610 --> 02:15.250
You know we're going to remove that thought which received one of them and see a run up there they cut

02:18.360 --> 02:20.610
in again what we're going on at the checkout

02:27.280 --> 02:31.810
and you can see if we had a flat rate in now we take 20.

02:31.810 --> 02:41.680
So in the case for example if I opened the shop and let's say that we had these bycatch Rohit Bukhara

02:41.770 --> 02:45.210
you can see that flattery is true anywhere in the United States.

02:46.200 --> 02:50.150
And if I remove these these won't cause the insurance.

02:50.160 --> 02:55.610
And this one does not can I update and open the checkout again.

02:57.540 --> 02:59.090
And you can see the captain.

02:59.100 --> 03:04.760
So where are you in the next $3 to the pros that you decide to have the insurance.

03:05.100 --> 03:07.050
And that's something nice.

03:07.050 --> 03:16.050
Some clients will ask you to add some extra fees for handling and everything and that's the way that

03:16.050 --> 03:19.600
you can make these U.S. glasses.

03:19.620 --> 03:25.150
So this is it for the shipping so you can see shipping methods are really really powerful in commerce.

03:25.290 --> 03:30.570
So hopefully you found these chapter headful and that's continue in the next media.
