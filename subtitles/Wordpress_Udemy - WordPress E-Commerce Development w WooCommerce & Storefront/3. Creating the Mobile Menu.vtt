00:04.440 --> 00:06.540
So let's clear the menu.

00:06.890 --> 00:09.350
Are you going to click it on Menashe locations.

00:09.780 --> 00:16.240
And for a kid what are going to become hillmen what are going to use new menu and for a kid going out

00:16.310 --> 00:20.430
more with menu and create the menu.

00:22.040 --> 00:28.700
You can see some of the kind of kids menu always Ceglia you attach them and you like these.

00:28.830 --> 00:30.810
And then you're going to start in some.

00:32.110 --> 00:35.300
For example on page isn't going at all.

00:35.620 --> 00:43.670
In this case I went to the farm there those block and I'm going out to the shop and the conduct goes

00:44.490 --> 00:48.750
is the same pages that I added in the main menu bar.

00:49.360 --> 00:51.870
I didn't the mayor come.

00:51.900 --> 00:54.360
I'm going to show you why in just a little.

00:54.600 --> 01:01.940
So here we have welcome we're going to change this to home page home and we have about Ole's blog and

01:01.950 --> 01:02.530
what is going on.

01:02.540 --> 01:11.490
We arranged the shop right here so we have shop blog and contact us so we didn't add them my account

01:13.110 --> 01:18.030
if the kids can see my account is part of the Shub.

01:18.230 --> 01:26.180
And so let's say these and reload and I'm going to make this malheur.

01:26.390 --> 01:34.680
You can see if they open the menu we have home about Orr's shop blog and contact us but for example

01:34.770 --> 01:43.290
at the bottom we have these I can link to the My Account section so you can click here.

01:43.660 --> 01:50.850
This is going up into my account so there is no need to have these in the menu for the mobile devices.

01:51.780 --> 01:55.290
If you want you can add the categories for the shop.

01:55.520 --> 02:03.440
So let's other categories for the shop link right here on going up in GamePro categories and we're going

02:03.480 --> 02:05.310
ask you all.

02:05.310 --> 02:09.240
And then going to select all the categories and we're going out the menu.

02:10.410 --> 02:12.960
And we're going to actually come back right here.

02:16.990 --> 02:19.540
I'm Geats and that that.

02:21.340 --> 02:23.030
And we're going to save the menu.

02:24.480 --> 02:32.800
Again the first blog made this is Mandar and up in the menu you can see that we have about us shop and

02:32.800 --> 02:38.800
then we have got the words of cards it is up to you if you want to have a really big menu.

02:38.890 --> 02:45.700
You can create the categories by the if you want as many as many you can remove the categories and only

02:45.700 --> 02:47.850
display the shop that's up to you.

02:49.100 --> 02:57.520
So in this case it does look nice and you have now three menus that you can use in your break.

02:57.740 --> 03:05.200
We take a look at the them on the social media icons navigation and also their mobile menu.

03:05.240 --> 03:09.880
So let's continue working with these Brinig in the next video.

03:10.870 --> 03:14.230
Remember that we went to chips something like these.

03:14.380 --> 03:19.180
So what a green smile steps achieve these esign in our website.
