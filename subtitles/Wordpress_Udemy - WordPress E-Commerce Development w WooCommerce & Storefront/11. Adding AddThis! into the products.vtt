00:04.300 --> 00:08.510
So let's have some sherry in Wooten's right here.

00:08.770 --> 00:16.430
You and I love the stars of this website to share the brokes in their social networks Facebook Twitter

00:16.490 --> 00:19.370
Instagram any of them.

00:19.640 --> 00:26.640
And of course you can use for example if I opened the back in the preens well get back already has this

00:26.640 --> 00:34.850
functionality but I'm a big fan of the service call at these and they're really easy to install.

00:35.070 --> 00:42.930
They're buttons in your website so first thing when I click on Tools and you can for example you can

00:42.930 --> 00:52.840
close these and other new if you have some options you can use these sharable Dunscombe if you and you

00:53.030 --> 00:59.020
have some options on the left so you can see you can see they're floating has this marker found these

00:59.020 --> 01:01.090
are really annoying in some cases.

01:01.120 --> 01:06.290
I'm going to click it on line so you can see something like these a nice preview expanding.

01:06.640 --> 01:10.650
You can click over here and it will display the networks.

01:11.070 --> 01:16.460
You sharing the right here you can match my opinion this online is the better one.

01:16.630 --> 01:23.270
So we're going to select in line and continue so next year considering the number of services that you

01:23.450 --> 01:24.470
display.

01:24.470 --> 01:29.720
So for example Facebook Twitter Google Plus and more so you can click on five.

01:29.870 --> 01:35.650
You can see because something like this we have Facebook Twitter Brint the brandies in they in their

01:35.720 --> 01:39.350
printer of your business or in your home or something.

01:39.350 --> 01:45.650
Then you can send this in an email but you can click on select your own and select their services that

01:45.650 --> 01:46.720
you want to use.

01:47.890 --> 01:50.580
So in this case the thing I'm happy with these.

01:50.780 --> 01:55.770
And you can change the site right here around the corner Arison everything.

01:56.060 --> 01:57.020
It's up to you.

01:57.130 --> 02:03.630
You can see all day customisations or you can make the size of the board on their buttons and everything.

02:03.870 --> 02:07.540
Or when I click here and go back in England I save and continue

02:10.630 --> 02:12.290
and save and continue.

02:12.490 --> 02:15.200
And then you can see we got one last step.

02:15.580 --> 02:17.070
So we need to copy this.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.540
And we're going to write another function.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.620
So that's at Breanne.

02:25.180 --> 02:31.730
So Shannon sharing icons and what we're going to show right here.

02:32.520 --> 02:36.550
So we're going to call these when Caterina's by display.

02:36.790 --> 02:42.440
Sharon Wotan's and we're going to hook these field action.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.720
Sorry.

02:45.010 --> 02:52.250
And we're going to have we're going up in the front and in simple show kooks.

02:52.370 --> 02:59.320
And I want to add this right here newcomer's before I took art form and I copied it right here.

02:59.540 --> 03:02.330
Basie's Goma and they copy these

03:06.170 --> 03:09.850
and you're eating something this will work.

03:09.860 --> 03:11.360
So this is going to be the first step.

03:11.360 --> 03:19.520
We add these so we can copy these wanted to have another fun show on the first step is going to be this

03:19.630 --> 03:20.630
function.

03:20.930 --> 03:30.900
So we're going to have curliness include these underscore scripts so you can see that we have these

03:30.990 --> 03:34.260
screen right here and you can use those to be on cueist creeps.

03:34.710 --> 03:43.920
But in my case I'm going to copy these and I'm going to hook these function into those before the.

03:44.170 --> 03:52.950
And then I'm going to I'm going up as this is the second argument and I'm going to copy that is here

03:53.000 --> 03:54.680
I'm going to close BHB.

03:54.800 --> 04:01.350
You know I'm going to open BHB again because this is a javascript script.

04:01.570 --> 04:03.340
Remove these.

04:03.340 --> 04:04.730
You can see this is on the screen.

04:05.020 --> 04:14.690
And of got to remember that you can also use old scripts and if you scroll it or you can see that we

04:14.690 --> 04:16.650
have this in mind share buttons.

04:16.730 --> 04:24.160
So we're going to copy these only that the app is going to be at right here but again I'm going to close

04:24.160 --> 04:26.500
BHB and up and BHB again right.

04:28.040 --> 04:32.150
Is that the way we're going to bring the social icons.

04:32.500 --> 04:41.110
So save these up and they stop showing folks right here and reload and now you can see that the icons

04:41.230 --> 04:49.440
Facebook Twitter e-mail interest and more of this is a great service and they have a bunch of different

04:49.440 --> 04:52.110
tools that you can have in your website.

04:52.140 --> 04:58.410
One of the coolest things about this is that the service is free at least for something simple like

04:58.410 --> 05:05.460
this these when they offer some premium plans with some advance for finality.

05:06.330 --> 05:08.120
But you can see this is looking great.

05:08.190 --> 05:12.610
Daughterly the friend of what we used to have in the previous years.
