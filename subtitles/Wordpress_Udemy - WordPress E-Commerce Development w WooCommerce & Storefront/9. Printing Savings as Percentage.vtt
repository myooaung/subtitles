00:04.070 --> 00:05.360
So let's continue working.

00:05.390 --> 00:12.470
And in the previous media show you have to have this same as dollars that you can print these using

00:12.470 --> 00:17.690
percentage sort of the neck and crop insurance first and then I come in come in everything from here

00:19.770 --> 00:28.560
and then I see these and Sharon I'm going to take these and you donate it and then I will commence and

00:28.610 --> 00:37.440
because we're going to run again in these in these crook and we need to do have only one cold running.

00:37.660 --> 00:44.590
And then when I show you how to improver this go to the next media so we're going to have fun.

00:44.590 --> 00:46.520
Sean gallery nights.

00:46.540 --> 00:52.990
But it's going to be really seemed that these functions are going to place these rescue and bodies that

00:53.040 --> 00:55.800
have been said Brize the last one two and a half percent patch

01:00.310 --> 01:02.250
so it could be in page right here.

01:02.450 --> 01:08.160
It's going to be the same and it's going to be really similar to these when I'm going to copy some of

01:08.160 --> 01:11.240
these and Eve also.

01:11.370 --> 01:14.260
And we also need to get the prize.

01:14.650 --> 01:20.030
And finally here were when I read the body of the function we're going to present sense that's going

01:20.040 --> 01:21.400
to be the very well.

01:21.420 --> 01:23.060
Here we are safe.

01:23.070 --> 01:25.170
What did you see percentage as a variable.

01:25.200 --> 01:29.970
So why don't I use some matte and I'm going out brother.

01:30.540 --> 01:39.100
And then I use one of the methods and get the regular price is going to be my nose brother.

01:39.860 --> 01:41.960
And we're going to use GET sale price

01:45.220 --> 01:46.920
and he's going to read about it.

01:47.830 --> 01:48.280
Brother

01:52.670 --> 01:54.520
many parentheses here.

01:57.210 --> 01:58.150
And here.

01:58.410 --> 02:05.820
So this is going to be this operation is going to be done first and then the rest of this is going to

02:05.820 --> 02:08.370
be the bited by the produce.

02:08.400 --> 02:18.860
So we have broke in we're going to get regular price then we're going to add Apprentice's and we're

02:18.860 --> 02:19.920
going to close.

02:20.240 --> 02:26.660
So fearless is to execute these this operation and then the rest of it is going to be divided by the

02:26.660 --> 02:27.980
regular price.

02:28.040 --> 02:34.860
And finally the rest of this is going to be multiply it by 100 but what are going to use a function

02:34.860 --> 02:40.620
called round to round this number this way get to an entire number.

02:40.740 --> 02:48.930
So we're going to have that percentage and we're going to finish these out in the following code.

02:49.060 --> 02:57.210
So it's going to be really similar to the other one we're going to Cubby's copy and paste in stead of

02:57.210 --> 03:04.260
printing this same rate here we're going to put in this percentage right here and now we can say BS

03:05.250 --> 03:11.330
and relo the front end and you can see we can say been in 9:29.

03:11.360 --> 03:14.120
What where we can add something here.

03:14.490 --> 03:23.160
After all these presenters we can to concatenate the value in what percentage Cirilo these and you can

03:23.160 --> 03:33.430
see we have say 29 percent so if we open the shop in these women for example you get a clear and you're

03:33.430 --> 03:37.040
going to you know we can say that the 3 percent.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.820
So that's looking nice if we went to this place.

03:39.820 --> 03:45.660
These come in dollars or if you want to display that is can you see in percentage.

03:45.690 --> 03:49.680
Now you have the code to do something like that.

03:49.720 --> 03:53.030
So in the next video we're going to apply the rule of one candidate.

03:53.260 --> 04:01.320
If the product price is bigger than 100 we're going to bring the same as dollars and if they're broke

04:01.410 --> 04:06.330
is less than one it like this one we're going on display the savings as percentage.
