00:04.360 --> 00:09.750
So getting familiar with these interface now we have shipping and you can see for example you can set

00:09.760 --> 00:16.200
the weight and the dimensions and the shipping class going to create shipping classes in upcoming ideas.

00:16.580 --> 00:21.510
But for example here you can add two kilograms and then you can add the dimensions.

00:21.550 --> 00:26.270
Maybe if it gives the centimeters the width.

00:26.530 --> 00:29.490
So the I mean then something like this.

00:29.820 --> 00:35.740
And you can update these up and the front end of your side relo.

00:36.330 --> 00:40.470
And you can see on the additional information we have this additional information that will have the

00:40.470 --> 00:50.560
weight and the dimensions setting weight and dimensions will help you when you install Aplin to make

00:50.560 --> 00:57.460
calculations on the shipping based on the size of the bycatch and also the destination that you have

00:57.460 --> 00:58.000
added.

00:58.010 --> 01:00.900
I'm going to show you how the Latino community is of course.

01:01.920 --> 01:06.030
Then we have the link at products in the next video we're going to see link at products and then Cup

01:06.120 --> 01:07.170
attributes.

01:07.170 --> 01:12.860
There is a word BVO when I'm going to show you at the meats and advance stuff.

01:13.230 --> 01:15.580
So this is a pro interface.

01:15.600 --> 01:21.300
You can see it's really easy to use and of course I'm going to show you the rest of these Studien from

01:21.300 --> 01:26.940
the next video where we're going to start working with the link brokes and that's a on Provera you can

01:26.940 --> 01:33.570
see we have some other options but we're going to continue getting familiar with the interface of all

01:33.570 --> 01:35.370
comers in the next media.
