WEBVTT

00:04.590 --> 00:11.450
Another way that we have available to customize commers Web site you'll see in a storefront is totally

00:11.500 --> 00:15.790
here on the Customize link on the bottom.

00:15.800 --> 00:25.160
So I'm going to customize here is to create an online store that looks similar to these when he does

00:25.170 --> 00:29.530
it a ferocious file I'm going to add this in the course materials.

00:29.530 --> 00:33.670
So we're going to build something like this for the rest of the course.

00:34.570 --> 00:40.630
But for example the options that you can change in the custom ricer are a little limited.

00:40.990 --> 00:42.480
What are going to make some changes.

00:42.520 --> 00:48.580
And then we're going to start writing some code to achieve something like these.

00:48.730 --> 00:51.890
If you have Photoshop I have outed this guy.

00:52.230 --> 00:55.360
This guy is a color guide for these colors.

00:55.580 --> 01:02.270
So you can select the colors and apply them in your style sheet and that's working on the customized.

01:02.680 --> 01:08.430
So we're going to start with this site identity and frankly you can apply a logo so you can see that

01:08.430 --> 01:09.840
we have Loba right here.

01:10.180 --> 01:19.250
And I'm when I click it on select low and from my course materials on products I'm going to upload these

01:19.250 --> 01:20.790
logos that DNG.

01:20.800 --> 01:21.400
I come about.

01:21.410 --> 01:25.450
The low that is B.G. by the Wordpress and support a lot.

01:25.460 --> 01:29.870
They is B.G. format in the media library.

01:29.990 --> 01:36.680
So we're going to split these and solidify from your current crop they match.

01:36.680 --> 01:43.430
For example if we went to select a small portion of the match you can use the fondlers that we have

01:43.430 --> 01:44.180
here.

01:44.630 --> 01:51.110
Or you can select all the match in case you want to select the match you can that's right you don't

01:51.110 --> 01:59.860
just keep grabbing your gun but if you will not grab the match you can use these handlers and make case

01:59.920 --> 02:02.240
want to keep the crop in.

02:02.400 --> 02:07.020
And you can see once the match is applauded I'm going to say I'm Polish.

02:07.110 --> 02:08.890
You can see that we have the logo right here.

02:08.890 --> 02:11.780
They have their customized it is that we can make some changes.

02:11.850 --> 02:18.120
You can see at the bottom we have other options like the site icon the title and the tag line and you

02:18.120 --> 02:21.540
can remove the logo and all that customisations that you can make.

02:21.540 --> 02:26.040
So we're going to click here to go back and then we're going up in the hair on the head.

02:26.040 --> 02:32.370
For example if we change the background color you can click here and from here against her leg of color

02:32.790 --> 02:39.620
in the color picker and you can see on the right we have a live preview of the changes that we're performing

02:39.620 --> 02:40.430
right here.

02:40.850 --> 02:42.290
So that's really nice.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.990
They use much of the customization.

02:45.020 --> 02:46.520
But should something like this.

02:46.760 --> 02:53.730
If you take a look here in the design the clarity is is white by the way going to change the navigation

02:53.730 --> 02:55.310
bar to different.

02:55.340 --> 03:00.520
Since this is then for example and I'm at of low rated

03:03.520 --> 03:12.370
and on the head there you can see that we have previous blood so we can either carry the match and they're

03:12.380 --> 03:13.360
going to hit or not.

03:15.070 --> 03:20.280
Know for example it's a new image for a hero.

03:20.300 --> 03:26.230
So you can grab the much that you want to play on the head or something like this for example and probably

03:26.270 --> 03:26.650
much

03:31.110 --> 03:37.040
so now you can see that we have a new match as a background that's something nice and bad.

03:37.130 --> 03:41.860
Again that saying we don't have any magic or anything about it is know that you kept something like

03:41.860 --> 03:44.120
this in your installation.

03:44.650 --> 03:52.110
And I'm going to change the background color to white Yes and the you can change the colors and everything.

03:53.840 --> 03:58.930
And see we have white and we can change this to another color.

03:59.050 --> 04:05.200
So that's really nice that we have the is they customize her in all of these.

04:05.260 --> 04:11.930
It's going to be different if you install a different theme this functionality is inherited from the

04:11.930 --> 04:18.570
team that you are things that have been your worst WordPress site so if you are going to click on the

04:18.570 --> 04:22.700
future and under-water what are going to perform some changes for you.

04:22.710 --> 04:30.680
And again social violence Grada you can see red we have these background color which in the style guide

04:30.830 --> 04:37.130
is this color that we have so we can select these copy and then up in the background color and page

04:37.130 --> 04:37.790
right here.

04:39.160 --> 04:45.910
So let's get to the bottom and then you can see we have the color then we have the headings is these

04:45.920 --> 04:46.490
colors.

04:46.500 --> 04:49.630
What it says about those categories and menus.

04:50.030 --> 04:52.440
So we're going to select this color.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.700
This is the headings.

04:54.020 --> 05:01.900
And we're going to replace these at the moment we don't have any Cherian Sunday on the here but once

05:01.920 --> 05:09.020
we have the headings or some widgets it's going to be this play so now we have the text color you can

05:09.020 --> 05:15.800
see what kind of day color is white and cheeses to white and I can see her color and that's fine.

05:15.810 --> 05:18.780
We also have building code or right here that says Come commerce.

05:19.220 --> 05:26.580
So we have some links right here we're going to change these two white and you can see what the food

05:26.590 --> 05:30.990
is it's looking nice I'm going to save on Polish.

05:31.150 --> 05:34.980
So next we're going to perform some changes in the part of the option.

05:34.990 --> 05:36.750
You can see we that part of it right here.

05:37.580 --> 05:40.600
And put a of what are going to change the heavy.

05:40.670 --> 05:47.020
It's going to be black or the hands are going to be Black use these ones like you have here.

05:47.210 --> 05:51.450
Take a look here in the design they are black but they have these lines right here.

05:51.450 --> 05:55.870
We're going out these using seeis is then we have the color.

05:56.340 --> 06:03.640
This is going to be black all the text in the page is going to be black gray here.

06:04.790 --> 06:14.570
And finally we're going to have the link go to our link are you going to be the one copy and page right

06:14.570 --> 06:15.370
here.

06:16.660 --> 06:17.550
That's fine.

06:17.550 --> 06:21.270
They we're going to add the Bruton's Wooten's colors.

06:21.280 --> 06:25.600
For example if the color can do the same you can see these moutons.

06:25.660 --> 06:29.230
You see the color right here.

06:29.230 --> 06:34.910
So what we're going to copy these it's going to be the bag and placed right here.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.220
And it's up in the home page

06:42.110 --> 06:45.470
and you can see we had have different color for the Wooten's.

06:45.610 --> 06:50.730
But again they a lot of the at the card text is going to be white.

06:50.740 --> 06:59.230
We're and has these two white we have the alternate back and I'm color we're going to keep these as

06:59.240 --> 07:03.920
the folds and we're going to go back save and Polish.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.350
So now we have something really nice right here.

07:07.250 --> 07:10.140
Of course we can make more changes for example here on the label.

07:10.160 --> 07:16.910
You can change to a cyber on the right Rosalba on the left side but on the left then you can create

07:16.910 --> 07:19.870
menus you can add widgets right here.

07:19.880 --> 07:26.600
I'm going to show you how to create menus and we did see an upcoming medius then from IKEA you can change

07:26.600 --> 07:35.930
this diary from page and also if you want to add is Mile tweeks of the essence only Asmal you can add

07:35.930 --> 07:38.210
the additional services that we have right here.

07:39.330 --> 07:46.370
In our case we are going to either of this CSA is that that's Jasus bad it's nice to know that we have

07:46.380 --> 07:50.610
an additional CIRCE's in the cost of miter.

07:50.760 --> 07:53.150
So we're going to close these.

07:53.360 --> 08:00.950
And now all of the changes that we have made I would say and we have our unionized foundation to achieve

08:00.960 --> 08:03.330
these esign.

08:03.420 --> 08:08.250
So next in the next video I'm going to show you how to start working with the menus.

08:08.280 --> 08:12.130
Start from provides three different kinds of menus.

08:12.390 --> 08:15.510
So we're going to start working with the main navigation in the mix with the.
