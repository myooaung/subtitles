00:04.390 --> 00:09.200
So let's see if you can sell the program with all comers.

00:09.220 --> 00:14.270
So from an article on pro-CPS And what are going to add new approach.

00:16.060 --> 00:21.160
So from here in the open they find there we have these guys.

00:21.430 --> 00:27.610
You can see we have these recipes great tips and your complete guide to wellness and you're going up

00:27.610 --> 00:30.310
and these guys right here in.

00:30.420 --> 00:37.070
So we have these smiled with some grace.

00:37.130 --> 00:40.520
Some can't say that we're setting the scene or website.

00:41.040 --> 00:49.560
So the description is going to be this Caterina's bad guy and maybe we can add something like September

00:51.240 --> 00:53.640
2017 or something like that.

00:54.690 --> 00:56.550
And you can copy these.

00:57.130 --> 01:02.710
And then this clip shown what I'm going to copy these newish for these Mohn includes.

01:02.710 --> 01:08.800
Well when I bought the x ray here we're going to select this thing we're going to create will at least

01:10.150 --> 01:13.700
and it's going to be next.

01:16.690 --> 01:17.830
Now you can see these

01:24.070 --> 01:24.690
like that.

01:24.760 --> 01:25.880
So what are these.

01:25.950 --> 01:34.800
Again it's going to be bullets and I have no issue for these mine includes the price is $5 so we're

01:34.800 --> 01:37.840
going up 5.

01:37.890 --> 01:42.500
So then you can see here on the payroll data we have virtual downloadable.

01:43.110 --> 01:49.980
And for example you can see if I cover here they're going to say it's downloadable brokes deep access

01:50.370 --> 01:52.470
file option purchase.

01:52.470 --> 01:54.830
So what said these.

01:55.310 --> 01:59.760
Yeah definitely one the ones the usurpers submit the payments.

01:59.940 --> 02:06.980
We want to allow them to the probably And now you can see we have visual approach in reading before

02:06.990 --> 02:13.390
trial and honorable Perabo may be something really similar right.

02:14.240 --> 02:21.530
Well you can see if I overhear them bear trial with happy little brokes are intent in intangible and

02:21.790 --> 02:22.930
not ship it.

02:23.360 --> 02:29.950
So definitely we have our PBF and this is not ship it's all we can have and you can see the ship in

02:29.950 --> 02:31.650
time is remote.

02:33.400 --> 02:40.090
So for example maybe you are asking in what case the probe is going to be downloadable but is not going

02:40.090 --> 02:41.460
to be virtual.

02:41.950 --> 02:49.990
So for example let's say that you are sitting in tutorial of course or something maybe you are setting

02:50.010 --> 03:01.590
up photography course and you have 100 videos that you want to have the ability to be part of it.

03:01.590 --> 03:05.030
No not it once the user submit the payment.

03:05.090 --> 03:11.900
Then you went on to include a book with some photography's and everything and that work is going to

03:11.900 --> 03:14.690
be scanned you'll see in the post me.

03:14.900 --> 03:20.200
In that case it's going to be downloadable but it's not going to be Bertran.

03:20.240 --> 03:26.120
Another example let's say that you are selling a game that the user can download.

03:26.360 --> 03:35.360
But as we are shown a manual where this is a physical book with some illustrations of the game.

03:35.480 --> 03:39.860
In that case is going to be downloadable and not me.

03:40.130 --> 03:47.600
So if you plan to send the product to the user is not going to be a trial in this case.

03:47.630 --> 03:49.490
Were only selling these.

03:49.670 --> 03:52.380
So we going to be worthwhile and downloadable.

03:52.700 --> 03:59.330
Then we have that on file and we can select the file that is going to be scanned once they use.

03:59.360 --> 04:03.830
So it's the payment and you can choose five right here.

04:04.570 --> 04:06.430
And you can upload this guy.

04:06.580 --> 04:12.150
That be if you can instead of the five you're around and you can see if we can find your right right

04:12.160 --> 04:12.750
here.

04:13.030 --> 04:20.230
So once the user submit the payment is going to be directed to these you read and from here you can

04:20.230 --> 04:22.090
type the name.

04:22.110 --> 04:25.870
It's going to be copy these and Page Raheen.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.940
You can have another file if you want.

04:27.950 --> 04:31.570
Make it so you only have these files going to remove these.

04:31.710 --> 04:37.670
They don't leave me leave blank for on limited read only what's in that case.

04:37.670 --> 04:39.200
Let's add something like five.

04:39.500 --> 04:44.950
We're going to allow the user to learn not these five maximum five times is really common that they

04:44.950 --> 04:46.820
use her if you have one.

04:47.150 --> 04:54.520
And if the user has a problem on that in the broke it's going to it's not going to allow the user to

04:54.530 --> 04:55.210
run again.

04:55.220 --> 04:56.450
So we're going at five.

04:56.780 --> 05:02.170
But of course you can change this to anything that you want and you have the expiration for that on

05:02.200 --> 05:03.640
love and you can see what happened.

05:03.740 --> 05:07.820
The number of days before the link expires.

05:07.830 --> 05:15.100
Maybe we're going to have seven days if one of either taxes or if when a player class is going to be

05:15.100 --> 05:16.940
right here.

05:17.080 --> 05:20.000
And again you're going outside the minatory or something like that.

05:20.870 --> 05:23.480
All this is going to be the same.

05:23.490 --> 05:32.330
So for example right here we have their broker or is working out the guides in PBF in this category.

05:32.470 --> 05:41.470
And we're going to that that's going to be IPs and that these sort of another feature rematch in this

05:41.470 --> 05:48.760
case is going to be that they're the guy that JP and said the old E match right here.

05:48.910 --> 05:49.590
Folies

05:53.110 --> 05:54.000
and then you can be sure that

05:58.210 --> 06:06.090
so now you can see her cowardness bad guy PBF September 2017 and you can see we have five dollars and

06:06.110 --> 06:07.420
one in everything.

06:07.430 --> 06:14.630
So once we install base Barling we can figure the payment Gateway's we're going to make a test and see

06:14.750 --> 06:16.100
if everything is working.

06:17.220 --> 06:24.220
But this is how you can create the honorable products you've seen with commers.
