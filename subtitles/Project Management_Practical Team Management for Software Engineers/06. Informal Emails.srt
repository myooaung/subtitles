00:00:00,124 --> 00:00:04,707
The point of talking about informal emails is to contrast the

2
00:00:04,707 --> 00:00:06,509
difference between them and the formal ones.

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:09,124
I will talk about the formal ones in the next section,

4
00:00:09,124 --> 00:00:12,624
but mostly what I want to say here is when and why you

5
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:16,124
should use or not use informal emails.

6
00:00:16,124 --> 00:00:16,553
Okay,

7
00:00:16,553 --> 00:00:21,695
basically an informal email is usually be two people who know each

8
00:00:21,695 --> 00:00:26,124
other pretty darn well and usually in a casual,

9
00:00:26,124 --> 00:00:28,124
friendly or family setting.

10
00:00:28,124 --> 00:00:34,851
So when to use, rarely and only with well known coworkers and maybe your manager,

11
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:37,760
but never customers and I would recommend never

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,791
informal emails with senior management.

13
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:44,047
Now this will all depend on your company's culture, of course.

14
00:00:44,047 --> 00:00:47,586
I mostly come from the corporate world and the consulting world.

15
00:00:47,586 --> 00:00:52,201
So I rarely use informal or causal emails with any

16
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:53,924
of my professional relationships.

17
00:00:53,924 --> 00:00:58,124
Also, I would suggest using them only for friends and family.

18
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,457
So why use them?

19
00:00:59,457 --> 00:01:01,568
They're often used to request information,

20
00:01:01,568 --> 00:01:05,124
maybe congratulate people, give advice and ask questions.

21
00:01:05,124 --> 00:01:08,586
There are a lot of similarities between an informal

22
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:10,424
email and just plain conversation.

23
00:01:10,424 --> 00:01:15,124
You may use slang or abbreviations and your grammar may suffer as well.

24
00:01:15,124 --> 00:01:19,124
And well, who cares, it's an informal email.

25
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:19,957
But again,

26
00:01:19,957 --> 00:01:23,707
I would strongly suggest only formal emails in the

27
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:25,791
workplace and use your judgment.

28
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:29,957
Now there is a risk of someone forwarding your email

29
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:34,124
to a customer or senior manager, possibly with good intentions,

30
00:01:34,124 --> 00:01:37,457
but that may not be a good reflection on you,

31
00:01:37,457 --> 00:01:41,124
possibly based on how you wrote it and what you said.

32
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:44,124
It could be the context of what you said,

33
00:01:44,124 --> 00:01:46,457
it could be used all lowercase lettering,

34
00:01:46,457 --> 00:01:50,278
your grammar could be poor, it could be just an informal email,

35
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:53,791
but somehow got forwarded to the wrong person professionally.

36
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:57,124
So pay special attention to that.

37
00:01:57,124 --> 00:01:59,207
So basically this slide, therefore,

38
00:01:59,207 --> 00:02:05,124
is a heads up on paying attention to when you might want to use informal emails.

39
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:05,488
Personally,

40
00:02:05,488 --> 00:02:14,000
I go formal all the way in the professional environment and I would suggest you do too.
