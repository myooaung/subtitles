1
00:00:01,112 --> 00:00:05,112
Now let's summarize the highlights of this module.

2
00:00:05,112 --> 00:00:10,650
One of the biggest takeaways from this module and possibly even this

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,021
course is that every single customer interaction is an opportunity

4
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:19,294
for you to manage customer expectations.

5
00:00:19,294 --> 00:00:24,497
Don't ever forget that and leverage that and you'll have a much better

6
00:00:24,497 --> 00:00:30,112
and a much healthier relationship with your customer.

7
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:33,112
Now here are some examples of opportunities I was talking about.

8
00:00:33,112 --> 00:00:37,445
It could just be walking down the hall and stopping for a quick chat with a

9
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:42,668
customer; email providing further explanations or clarifications; status

10
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:47,445
reports that succinctly talk to accomplishments; meetings for determining

11
00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:51,312
the body language and verbal communication to ascertain their feelings and

12
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:52,912
what they're thinking; agendas,

13
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:56,839
be sure you're talking about the right things that the customer wants to

14
00:00:56,839 --> 00:01:01,112
hear and listen to and cover; and steering committees.

15
00:01:01,112 --> 00:01:05,112
These are usually the guys that really have the influence in the company.

16
00:01:05,112 --> 00:01:06,497
So if you're in front of your steering committee,

17
00:01:06,497 --> 00:01:09,969
be sure you take the time to find out or gage what

18
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,112
they think about your team's service,

19
00:01:12,112 --> 00:01:15,804
maybe make it an agenda item or show the customer service quadrant

20
00:01:15,804 --> 00:01:20,612
results by steering committee member to provide an overlay and

21
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:22,385
comparison by member; presentations,

22
00:01:22,385 --> 00:01:25,112
they give you control of content and of the messaging,

23
00:01:25,112 --> 00:01:30,112
so use this medium to pull out or extract the attendees viewpoints

24
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,112
regarding your service if and when it makes sense to do so.

25
00:01:34,112 --> 00:01:34,804
You name it,

26
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:36,881
use these forms and others as an opportunity to

27
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:42,112
gage the feelings that they have, their interpretations of what you are doing,

28
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:46,112
answer any questions and calibrate any concerns you have around budgets

29
00:01:46,112 --> 00:01:50,112
or schedules or deliverables and service in general.

30
00:01:50,112 --> 00:01:52,312
If I was walking down the hall and saw my customer

31
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,862
for the ERP system I might say, oh by the way,

32
00:01:54,862 --> 00:01:58,612
Joe was out ill, what a bummer, so we'll still try and make that Friday due date,

33
00:01:58,612 --> 00:02:00,881
but if will be likely it will be on Tuesday,

34
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:02,804
will that work for you?

35
00:02:02,804 --> 00:02:07,112
Note all these behaviors and actions exemplify that you care.

36
00:02:07,112 --> 00:02:11,779
Remember no one is perfect and you'll have service issues,

37
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:14,112
that is our professional life at times.

38
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:18,041
But what is important is that you are taking actions to

39
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,343
correct and improve your service,

40
00:02:20,343 --> 00:02:27,112
your customer will greatly appreciate you and your team for it.

41
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:29,420
In the beginning of the module I gave you some

42
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,398
examples of customer expectations,

43
00:02:30,398 --> 00:02:34,112
I would like to review each one and see how some of the

44
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,112
techniques and tools we have learned will help better

45
00:02:37,112 --> 00:02:38,612
manage the customer's expectations.

46
00:02:38,612 --> 00:02:43,512
Now managing expectations does not mean that there are no

47
00:02:43,512 --> 00:02:47,112
problems or problems just go away on their own.

48
00:02:47,112 --> 00:02:50,237
Really managing expectations is listening,

49
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:53,979
communicating, planning ahead, knowing just how to convey bad news,

50
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:57,112
issues or problems in a such a way that involves them

51
00:02:57,112 --> 00:03:00,112
and you can work as a team to resolve.

52
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:05,112
Okay, you will deliver a build every 2 weeks.

53
00:03:05,112 --> 00:03:06,826
Well this could be a yes,

54
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:09,362
but… since based on your resources and the high

55
00:03:09,362 --> 00:03:11,112
amount of effort to make a build,

56
00:03:11,112 --> 00:03:13,541
you provide your customer with options to choose.

57
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:19,112
Option 1, I need to hire one person for that schedule of every 2 weeks.

58
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:25,804
Option 2, I can do a build every 3 weeks right now with no new head count.

59
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:29,958
And Option 3, after we finish project A and B,

60
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:34,112
I might be able to do every 2 weeks.

61
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:36,445
You will hold a weekly status meeting.

62
00:03:36,445 --> 00:03:37,445
As I mentioned,

63
00:03:37,445 --> 00:03:40,779
having time with a customer is a golden opportunity to

64
00:03:40,779 --> 00:03:44,612
help manage customer expectations and get a read on where

65
00:03:44,612 --> 00:03:47,112
they are at with your service.

66
00:03:47,112 --> 00:03:50,112
I recommend here that you set up the meetings,

67
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:52,779
provide the agenda, and send out meeting minutes,

68
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:55,385
which include agreements, actions and accomplishments.

69
00:03:55,385 --> 00:04:01,112
Next, you will be on call for ecommerce support.

70
00:04:01,112 --> 00:04:04,326
Okay, set up a call list with your team,

71
00:04:04,326 --> 00:04:06,112
publish it to the customer,

72
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,958
sit down with your customer and educate the customer that they can

73
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:12,112
post issues in your issue tracking system as well.

74
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:14,385
You will understand my business.

75
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:17,112
Well there are several items here.

76
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:21,112
Work with them to ensure your activities are aligned to their business,

77
00:04:21,112 --> 00:04:22,035
have weekly status meetings,

78
00:04:22,035 --> 00:04:24,881
which will enable you and your team to further get to

79
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:27,189
know the customer and their needs,

80
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:30,497
possibly a sign of business analysts to that customer with the

81
00:04:30,497 --> 00:04:33,612
job to be the main focal point into your team,

82
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:38,112
and conduct a customer service quadrant activity each quarter.

83
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,779
So here are several different items to get you to

84
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,362
better understand their business.

85
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:45,112
You will always deliver on time.

86
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:47,245
We all strive to do this, of course.

87
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,612
What this may mean when a customer says this is that

88
00:04:50,612 --> 00:04:55,112
if you pick a date for a milestone, you better make it.

89
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:58,445
So I would suggest for each date, for each milestone,

90
00:04:58,445 --> 00:05:01,512
include potential assumptions about how you are depending

91
00:05:01,512 --> 00:05:05,255
on your customer's inputs or maybe data to be available

92
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:10,112
in order to meet that date, or maybe you're waiting on an external resource.

93
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:14,299
And also this may cause you to add a little to your estimates

94
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:17,112
to ensure that you can make it on time.

95
00:05:17,112 --> 00:05:18,958
Consider using an SLA to tighten things up,

96
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:23,294
and remember too an SLA helps your team know exactly

97
00:05:23,294 --> 00:05:27,112
what's expected of them as well.

98
00:05:27,112 --> 00:05:28,987
You will never have a bug.

99
00:05:28,987 --> 00:05:32,112
Well you and I both know there will be bugs.

100
00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:34,683
But you will never say that to a customer.

101
00:05:34,683 --> 00:05:38,021
First explain about your process for creating test plans with your customer,

102
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:40,779
in other words, you're creating the plans with them,

103
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:44,237
and how your engineers use test cases to ensure that

104
00:05:44,237 --> 00:05:46,112
the software meets the requirements.

105
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:51,112
Emphasize how you need their help and inputs to test since your customer

106
00:05:51,112 --> 00:05:55,112
and his or her team are the subject matter experts.

107
00:05:55,112 --> 00:05:58,958
You may further explain how your issue tracking system will

108
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,683
log all issues and you can have regular sessions with them on

109
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:04,112
your progress to remediate them.

110
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:09,112
So you are providing an approach and building confidence in your customer

111
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:13,112
and also setting expectations about what you will do.

112
00:06:13,112 --> 00:06:16,712
Now all these are really elements of quality communications,

113
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:19,362
written communications, being realistic,

114
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:28,445
knowing your limitations, and learning just how to say no by saying yes,

115
00:06:28,445 --> 00:06:33,112
but… The first topic we covered was why manage customer expectations?

116
00:06:33,112 --> 00:06:36,574
We learned that the secret of customer satisfaction lies

117
00:06:36,574 --> 00:06:44,112
not just in what you necessarily do, but in what the customer expects you to do.

118
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,930
Next we define customer expectations.

119
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,826
We discussed the realm of worth, merit,

120
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:54,779
and importance of understanding customer expectations and why these can

121
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:58,112
make you and your team optimize your capabilities.

122
00:06:58,112 --> 00:07:02,112
Next we discussed several strategies for managing customer expectation,

123
00:07:02,112 --> 00:07:07,112
such as quality of communications and verbal and written skills.

124
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:08,035
Knowing your limitations,

125
00:07:08,035 --> 00:07:12,987
that is know what you and your team are truly capable of and

126
00:07:12,987 --> 00:07:16,112
ensuring your customer understands that.

127
00:07:16,112 --> 00:07:21,112
Also setting clear timelines, remaining practical yet still show optimism,

128
00:07:21,112 --> 00:07:24,712
and learning how to say no by saying yes,

129
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:29,512
but… or hey maybe you can choose among some options.

130
00:07:29,512 --> 00:07:33,112
Next was Service Level Agreements, SLAs,

131
00:07:33,112 --> 00:07:36,712
where expectations are specific, not fuzzy,

132
00:07:36,712 --> 00:07:42,112
expectations are in writing, and expectations can be measured.

133
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:48,112
We also deconstructed an SLA by a business attribute and gave several examples.

134
00:07:48,112 --> 00:07:48,737
Lastly,

135
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:54,930
valuing customer service or measuring customer service by using my simple

136
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,779
customer service quadrant approach to isolate each of your services or products

137
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,203
and allow the customer to rank them in each quadrant.

138
00:08:03,203 --> 00:08:07,612
This gives you valuable information to better focus your team's

139
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:12,112
efforts and reset the customer's expectations.

140
00:08:12,112 --> 00:08:13,930
Lastly, please embrace, live,

141
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:19,112
and breathe the fact that every single customer interaction is

142
00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:23,112
an opportunity to manage their expectations.

143
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:23,497
Okay,

144
00:08:23,497 --> 00:08:27,727
in the next module we will learn how to develop team

145
00:08:27,727 --> 00:08:33,000
processes that promote productivity. I'll see you there.
