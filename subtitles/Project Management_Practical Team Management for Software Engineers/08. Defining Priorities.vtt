1
00:00:01.564 --> 00:00:02.314
Defining priorities.

2
00:00:02.314 --> 00:00:04.564
Now we need to set priorities.

3
00:00:04.564 --> 00:00:04.949
Why?

4
00:00:04.949 --> 00:00:09.981
Because no IT team ever seems to have enough resources to get everything

5
00:00:09.981 --> 00:00:14.564
completed that it is asked to do in the time required.

6
00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:17.707
And it is to crucial to your success and your team's

7
00:00:17.707 --> 00:00:19.655
morale to have good solid priorities.

8
00:00:19.655 --> 00:00:22.814
So when you're out getting the business goals and

9
00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:23.814
requirements from your customers,

10
00:00:23.814 --> 00:00:26.707
you will also need to be getting their priorities,

11
00:00:26.707 --> 00:00:29.564
don't forget to do that.

12
00:00:29.564 --> 00:00:33.764
So how do you quantify a priority?

13
00:00:33.764 --> 00:00:35.564
Let's find out.

14
00:00:35.564 --> 00:00:36.256
As I mentioned,

15
00:00:36.256 --> 00:00:40.487
while you are talking with your new customers as the new manager of your team,

16
00:00:40.487 --> 00:00:44.928
you are not only talking about the business issues and requirements,

17
00:00:44.928 --> 00:00:50.102
but also how each one fits importance wise relative to each other.

18
00:00:50.102 --> 00:00:53.564
So what are your priorities, you're going to ask.

19
00:00:53.564 --> 00:00:55.641
Now a heads up, when you ask that question,

20
00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:56.564
what are your priorities,

21
00:00:56.564 --> 00:01:02.564
they will probably answer well everything or everything's a number one.

22
00:01:02.564 --> 00:01:06.564
Now you and I know not everything can be a number one.

23
00:01:06.564 --> 00:01:08.814
If you scatter your resources across all the items,

24
00:01:08.814 --> 00:01:11.487
you'll probably not get anything done at all.

25
00:01:11.487 --> 00:01:17.564
So here are a few approaches to determining priorities.

26
00:01:17.564 --> 00:01:19.164
Approaches to determining priorities,

27
00:01:19.164 --> 00:01:22.120
you will likely be getting your assignments,

28
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.102
direction, requirements, and priorities from a variety of places in your company.

29
00:01:28.102 --> 00:01:31.564
One may be business leaders, they may be CEOs,

30
00:01:31.564 --> 00:01:39.564
CFOs, CIOs or for example the VP of engineering or of manufacturing.

31
00:01:39.564 --> 00:01:41.718
Another entity may be a steering group.

32
00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:46.314
This may be a collection of two or more of the above that I mentioned or other

33
00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:51.109
representatives that get together maybe monthly or quarterly to set priorities

34
00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:54.256
and/or drive requirements for you and your team.

35
00:01:54.256 --> 00:01:57.291
It may also be a business focal point.

36
00:01:57.291 --> 00:02:01.364
Maybe a manager of customer service has provided you the requirements

37
00:02:01.364 --> 00:02:04.564
and priorities you need for a particular project.

38
00:02:04.564 --> 00:02:06.064
It may also be your manager,

39
00:02:06.064 --> 00:02:10.135
you may get most requirements possibly from him or her based on

40
00:02:10.135 --> 00:02:13.564
how you may have structured your work intake.

41
00:02:13.564 --> 00:02:14.564
Also, end users,

42
00:02:14.564 --> 00:02:19.064
you may get calls from end users or representatives of end users

43
00:02:19.064 --> 00:02:22.564
from existing applications or with new projects.

44
00:02:22.564 --> 00:02:28.564
Or maybe even IT decides, IT management itself determines what it needs to do.

45
00:02:28.564 --> 00:02:32.564
In some cases this is just fine, but don't let it go to your head,

46
00:02:32.564 --> 00:02:35.231
you should always validate what the IT leadership

47
00:02:35.231 --> 00:02:38.564
determined as viable work with one or more of the

48
00:02:38.564 --> 00:02:40.564
appropriate customers shown on the slide.

49
00:02:40.564 --> 00:02:41.814
Next, developers decide.

50
00:02:41.814 --> 00:02:45.564
This is really the worst thing you can do.

51
00:02:45.564 --> 00:02:48.189
It is not to say that developers will do the best they can do,

52
00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:52.564
of course, but it is the business that must decide.

53
00:02:52.564 --> 00:03:00.564
Also I want to talk about influence, how the priorities are influenced.

54
00:03:00.564 --> 00:03:07.564
Notice I went from top to bottom, more influence to less influence.

55
00:03:07.564 --> 00:03:09.964
Business leaders, steering group, et cetera,

56
00:03:09.964 --> 00:03:13.872
they provide more influence, they are influential in the company.

57
00:03:13.872 --> 00:03:20.564
The developer or maybe part of IT or end users are typically less influential.

58
00:03:20.564 --> 00:03:25.487
You may get your requirements from one or more of these I've listed on the page.

59
00:03:25.487 --> 00:03:28.564
But keep in mind the appropriate influence each of them

60
00:03:28.564 --> 00:03:30.746
may have in making your priorities.

61
00:03:30.746 --> 00:03:34.231
Priorities are hard to determine and hard to come by,

62
00:03:34.231 --> 00:03:37.564
that's why I've shown this list to help you decide,

63
00:03:37.564 --> 00:03:41.564
you know, one end user asking for something is not the influencer,

64
00:03:41.564 --> 00:03:43.493
the CFO or a business leader is the influencer,

65
00:03:43.493 --> 00:03:45.897
that's who you want to get your priorities from.

66
00:03:45.897 --> 00:03:49.564
And lastly, when I say the business drives the requirements and priorities,

67
00:03:49.564 --> 00:03:50.314
that is true,

68
00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:54.897
but not in a vacuum This is done in collaboration with you and

69
00:03:54.897 --> 00:03:58.897
your team providing insights into your resources,

70
00:03:58.897 --> 00:04:03.564
timing, cost, other projects, technology certainly,

71
00:04:03.564 --> 00:04:08.564
so that hopefully what you do is best for the company and your team.

72
00:04:08.564 --> 00:04:12.850
Remember for each goal you will track the source of that requirement and

73
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.993
what the priority of that requirement is to keep track of,

74
00:04:15.993 --> 00:04:17.655
who is driving that priority.

75
00:04:17.655 --> 00:04:21.179
So you can provide feedback to other people saying hey,

76
00:04:21.179 --> 00:04:24.256
so I have this requirement or that requirement and the

77
00:04:24.256 --> 00:04:30.564
priorities are driven by these particular entities.

78
00:04:30.564 --> 00:04:37.564
You may get some very challenging priorities and think - you want it when?

79
00:04:37.564 --> 00:04:41.564
Okay, they may be vague, like do what's best.

80
00:04:41.564 --> 00:04:43.897
This is just not acceptable to me.

81
00:04:43.897 --> 00:04:46.026
That is management advocating their responsibility.

82
00:04:46.026 --> 00:04:49.718
You might think you know what is best,

83
00:04:49.718 --> 00:04:53.231
but that really is the job of the business.

84
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:57.897
Next, they may be very high level, I call these macro priorities.

85
00:04:57.897 --> 00:05:02.564
An example might be improve customer service.

86
00:05:02.564 --> 00:05:03.314
Less vague certainly,

87
00:05:03.314 --> 00:05:06.837
but definitely not very specific for you to make action upon.

88
00:05:06.837 --> 00:05:08.746
Next, business unit.

89
00:05:08.746 --> 00:05:14.718
An example might be something like prioritize all work in the company to

90
00:05:14.718 --> 00:05:17.928
focus on the engineering and new product development only.

91
00:05:17.928 --> 00:05:23.439
Well that is better and easier to align your work to.

92
00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:26.564
Next specific projects, even easier.

93
00:05:26.564 --> 00:05:29.897
The company may have itemized five key projects,

94
00:05:29.897 --> 00:05:33.314
that would tell you that all your resources should be focused

95
00:05:33.314 --> 00:05:35.897
only on those five projects and nothing else.

96
00:05:35.897 --> 00:05:38.564
Very easy to prioritize your work.

97
00:05:38.564 --> 00:05:43.564
Next, operations or production, to me this is always job number one.

98
00:05:43.564 --> 00:05:46.707
If a system goes down and we have a production failure,

99
00:05:46.707 --> 00:05:49.350
well it's all hands on deck to resolve.

100
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.814
Alright, so with this list of the forms of different priority types,

101
00:05:53.814 --> 00:05:56.731
if you will, or forms of priority,

102
00:05:56.731 --> 00:06:01.564
they range from somewhat vague and fuzzy to pretty specific.

103
00:06:01.564 --> 00:06:03.278
And for me, and maybe for you too,

104
00:06:03.278 --> 00:06:06.439
the more specific you can articulate the importance of an area of

105
00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:10.231
business the easier it is for work to be aligned to it.

106
00:06:10.231 --> 00:06:13.564
So remember that for yourself as well as a manager.

107
00:06:13.564 --> 00:06:18.278
If you give vague or macro priorities to your team members,

108
00:06:18.278 --> 00:06:29.000
they will not be as effective or productive. Okay, now let's look at a technique for setting priorities.
