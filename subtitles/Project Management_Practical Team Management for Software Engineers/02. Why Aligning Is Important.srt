Why align IT to the business?

2
00:00:04,626 --> 00:00:10,555
In this section we'll see what alignment means and the effects of bad

3
00:00:10,555 --> 00:00:15,055
alignment and good alignment of IT with the business.

4
00:00:15,055 --> 00:00:17,055
According to Info-Tech Research,

5
00:00:17,055 --> 00:00:23,286
47% of business leaders feel that business goals are unsupported by IT.

6
00:00:23,286 --> 00:00:28,722
If IT fails to support the project or programs that benefit

7
00:00:28,722 --> 00:00:33,555
the organization then IT is perceived as a cost center that

8
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:36,055
delivers very little real value.

9
00:00:36,055 --> 00:00:36,912
Here's a hint,

10
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:39,769
you never want your team or group or department to

11
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:42,138
be perceived as a cost center.

12
00:00:42,138 --> 00:00:48,055
The term cost center or overhead implies no added value.

13
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:53,555
Now highly effective IT teams will realign IT with the business,

14
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:54,055
however,

15
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:58,964
a staggering 92% of IT departments surveyed claim their

16
00:00:58,964 --> 00:01:01,873
IT strategies were less than adequate.

17
00:01:01,873 --> 00:01:07,328
Many IT strategies are just too technical, both in wording and content.

18
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:11,510
Technical jargon is difficult for the business to understand and

19
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:21,000
there is very little emphasis on people or processes. So here are your challenges ahead of you.
