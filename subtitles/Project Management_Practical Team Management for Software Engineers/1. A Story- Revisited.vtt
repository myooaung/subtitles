00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.020
Hello, I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.050
I will be presenting the module summary and final words in the course

3
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.020
Practical Team Management for Software Engineers.

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.040
Now, remember our story from the overview module?

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.020
Well, let's recap.

6
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.080
Okay, there's my boss and there is me.

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.516
Hey,

8
00:00:22.516 --> 00:00:28.030
I think you've been doing a nice job and I'd like you to manage a team for me,

9
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.070
maybe about five developers or so.

10
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.040
I will need you to work with the customers,

11
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.010
figure out and document requirements,

12
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.080
determine your software development lifecycle,

13
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.090
standards, architecture, manage your work tasks,

14
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.070
you know, tie everything to the business,

15
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.327
you know, come up with all the team management stuff you think you need and oh,

16
00:00:46.327 --> 00:00:50.070
by the way, you start tomorrow.

17
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.735
I was only 26 and didn't know squat about the things I needed to manage my new

18
00:00:54.735 --> 00:00:58.060
team and I'm wondering if you reflected in the same way.

19
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.772
You've come through this course and I appreciate that very much and I

20
00:01:01.772 --> 00:01:05.020
hope it's been very helpful and productive for you.

21
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.922
And there you are,

22
00:01:05.922 --> 00:01:09.050
confronted with all the challenges of management and leadership.

23
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.000
What are you to do?

24
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.070
So, maybe you have been confronted or challenged by the same situation,

25
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.070
you know,

26
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.227
being presented with opportunities that weren't directly related to

27
00:01:22.227 --> 00:01:25.020
software engineering or software development.

28
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.050
They were management-oriented,

29
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.642
leadership-oriented and all those other things we've talked

30
00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:31.010
about in all the modules of this course.

31
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.515
You probably thought, wait a minute, what just happened,

32
00:01:32.515 --> 00:01:34.000
what did they just ask me to go do?

33
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.010
Do I even want to do that?

34
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.070
I really love software engineering and building and constructing software.

35
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.050
Not sure if I can align the activities to the business,

36
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.040
not sure I could hire and fire and things like that.

37
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.050
Can I even be a manager?

38
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.050
Do I want to be a manager?

39
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.070
Will people follow me?

40
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.060
Will I be a good leader?

41
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.090
And can I just do the job in general?

42
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.050
So, if you had any of these feelings,

43
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.280
I'm hoping that some of them have been mitigated with the

44
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.317
template approach that I've given you, the very practical,

45
00:02:00.317 --> 00:02:04.030
prescriptive approach of this course.

46
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.020
So, based on what I was asked to do by my boss' boss' boss,

47
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.030
I thought for a while and concluded that I needed two key critical

48
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.070
skill groups of expertise to succeed in my new role.

49
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.040
The first is leadership and communication skills.

50
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.870
These would include verbal skills, written skills,

51
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.020
interpersonal skills and leadership skills.

52
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.766
By the way,

53
00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:28.769
all of those are covered in one of my other courses title

54
00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.250
Leadership and Communication Skills for Software Engineers and

55
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.000
you might want to check that out.

56
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.646
The other key skill group is practical team management

57
00:02:36.646 --> 00:02:44.000
skills which of course is this class. So, let's do a quick recap of the course modules.
