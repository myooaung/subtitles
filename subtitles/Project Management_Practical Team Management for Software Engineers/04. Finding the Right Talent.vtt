00:00:00.782 --> 00:00:02.013
Finding the right talent.

2
00:00:02.013 --> 00:00:04.782
So you've done your best on retaining your staff,

3
00:00:04.782 --> 00:00:07.568
but life happens and you need to find new talent for your team,

4
00:00:07.568 --> 00:00:10.859
either people have left or your business is growing

5
00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:13.705
and you need to acquire more people.

6
00:00:13.705 --> 00:00:18.782
Okay so let's explore my approach to finding the right talent.

7
00:00:18.782 --> 00:00:21.244
So where will your new talent come from?

8
00:00:21.244 --> 00:00:23.167
Let's first look inside your company.

9
00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:25.474
It could be within IT itself,

10
00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:29.211
maybe it's a large IT organization and there's other people

11
00:00:29.211 --> 00:00:32.782
you think might be a good fit for your team,

12
00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:35.282
it could be just some other departments outside of IT

13
00:00:35.282 --> 00:00:37.964
where people may have the skills you need,

14
00:00:37.964 --> 00:00:40.182
even broader, throughout an entire corporation,

15
00:00:40.182 --> 00:00:42.182
if it's a world-wide corporation,

16
00:00:42.182 --> 00:00:45.628
maybe even an internal customer that you have a great relationship with,

17
00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:48.320
which might be a good fit inside your team now.

18
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.782
Now the benefits of going internal, of course,

19
00:00:50.782 --> 00:00:52.449
is they know the company,

20
00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.600
that might be a great growth opportunity for that person,

21
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.782
and certainly lower onboarding costs and maybe even

22
00:00:57.782 --> 00:00:59.600
lower training costs as well.

23
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.782
Alright, now if that doesn't work or in addition you may need to look elsewhere,

24
00:01:04.782 --> 00:01:10.782
let's look outside of the company, which is more typical for most organizations.

25
00:01:10.782 --> 00:01:14.353
I would suggest you look internal to your company first,

26
00:01:14.353 --> 00:01:17.964
they are a known entity and they always believe in promoting the

27
00:01:17.964 --> 00:01:20.600
growth of internal people first over outside people.

28
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.449
But most new talent will likely come from the outside.

29
00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:27.782
Okay, where are we going to find them?

30
00:01:27.782 --> 00:01:28.327
Human resources,

31
00:01:28.327 --> 00:01:31.873
this is typically the part of your company that will have the

32
00:01:31.873 --> 00:01:34.782
policy and procedures on how to acquire talent.

33
00:01:34.782 --> 00:01:38.382
Please talk to your manager and/or HR, human resources,

34
00:01:38.382 --> 00:01:40.782
first before taking any external action.

35
00:01:40.782 --> 00:01:43.873
Recruiters, there are a million recruiters out there,

36
00:01:43.873 --> 00:01:46.782
some good and well some not so good.

37
00:01:46.782 --> 00:01:51.782
There is a fee using recruiters and in some cases it may be worth it.

38
00:01:51.782 --> 00:01:55.496
What can be nice is that they can prescreen the talent and their

39
00:01:55.496 --> 00:01:58.859
resumes first to make your job a little easier.

40
00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.782
But choose your recruiter wisely,

41
00:02:00.782 --> 00:02:05.782
they can range from real professionals to those just selling snake oil.

42
00:02:05.782 --> 00:02:07.969
Want ads, this is so easy now.

43
00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.211
You can place ads on a multitude of websites at very reasonable fees.

44
00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:18.282
I use this approach all the time and have been pretty lucky over the years.

45
00:02:18.282 --> 00:02:20.782
References, I really like references.

46
00:02:20.782 --> 00:02:23.982
This gives you a leg up on the person when someone you

47
00:02:23.982 --> 00:02:26.320
know is aware of someone that might fit.

48
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.139
Never ever blame the person that gave you the

49
00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:31.996
reference if the person does not work out,

50
00:02:31.996 --> 00:02:36.327
since you will be following the solid proven process in this module

51
00:02:36.327 --> 00:02:39.320
and ultimately you are responsible for the new hire,

52
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.782
not the person who gave you the reference.

53
00:02:41.782 --> 00:02:44.782
Industry events, these events allow you to network and meet people.

54
00:02:44.782 --> 00:02:49.782
It seems I always meet many people looking for new or better opportunities.

55
00:02:49.782 --> 00:02:52.782
So come prepared with your business cards and maybe

56
00:02:52.782 --> 00:02:55.115
even a copy of the job description.

57
00:02:55.115 --> 00:02:55.449
Alright,

58
00:02:55.449 --> 00:03:01.873
now let's see how a new hire may not only fulfill a current need or requirement,

59
00:03:01.873 --> 00:03:06.782
but bringing dimension to your team.

60
00:03:06.782 --> 00:03:07.936
Bummer, they left.

61
00:03:07.936 --> 00:03:11.782
But now it is an opportunity to add new ideas,

62
00:03:11.782 --> 00:03:16.782
new skills, et cetera that maybe you did not have before.

63
00:03:16.782 --> 00:03:19.782
Let's see how we can leverage new talent.

64
00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:21.032
Replace versus retool.

65
00:03:21.032 --> 00:03:26.320
Is your goal to replace this person or possibly based on your projects

66
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.782
and plans that you have aligned to the business,

67
00:03:29.782 --> 00:03:33.115
you may also consider hiring a person to quickly retool

68
00:03:33.115 --> 00:03:35.782
your team rather than just replace.

69
00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:38.705
Portfolio transition, somewhat similar to the last item,

70
00:03:38.705 --> 00:03:42.146
but from the standpoint you just learned about some major shifts with

71
00:03:42.146 --> 00:03:45.782
the business and maybe your portfolio is changing,

72
00:03:45.782 --> 00:03:46.639
in other words,

73
00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.782
you were the manager of the sales systems and maybe now

74
00:03:49.782 --> 00:03:51.449
they're also giving you ecommerce.

75
00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:55.146
This may require a whole new set of skills for your team

76
00:03:55.146 --> 00:03:56.782
that you hadn't thought of before.

77
00:03:56.782 --> 00:04:00.782
New skills, maybe the new person has such a rich set of new skills,

78
00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:03.244
some of which you really don't need now,

79
00:04:03.244 --> 00:04:06.782
but thinking of the future you might head your bets and

80
00:04:06.782 --> 00:04:08.782
go with someone like this instead.

81
00:04:08.782 --> 00:04:12.782
New capabilities, there are skills and there are capabilities.

82
00:04:12.782 --> 00:04:15.782
Similar, but just slightly different to me.

83
00:04:15.782 --> 00:04:17.782
Maybe this person is extremely capable,

84
00:04:17.782 --> 00:04:21.146
has a personality that could be very effective with the customer,

85
00:04:21.146 --> 00:04:24.115
especially if you're having some issues with that customer,

86
00:04:24.115 --> 00:04:26.782
for the person who is leaving.

87
00:04:26.782 --> 00:04:31.782
Maybe a new face and personal disposition might be just the right thing.

88
00:04:31.782 --> 00:04:32.382
Succession planning,

89
00:04:32.382 --> 00:04:35.090
maybe you've been thinking of a new opportunity in

90
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.244
another part of the company for yourself,

91
00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:41.032
but you know your manager may not want you to take it and leave.

92
00:04:41.032 --> 00:04:43.982
So hiring someone that could in fact replace you might

93
00:04:43.982 --> 00:04:46.782
be what you have been looking for.

94
00:04:46.782 --> 00:04:50.115
Maybe he or she has good technical skills,

95
00:04:50.115 --> 00:04:53.782
but especially leadership skills, which are certainly needed to replace you.

96
00:04:53.782 --> 00:04:55.146
And lastly, diversity.

97
00:04:55.146 --> 00:04:58.782
Maybe someone with a wide range of interests,

98
00:04:58.782 --> 00:05:00.449
backgrounds, experiences, viewpoints,

99
00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.425
maybe bring a whole new emphasis to your team,

100
00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:07.671
hence this slide was to open your mind to a variety of reasons

101
00:05:07.671 --> 00:05:10.782
and perspectives on hiring that new person.

102
00:05:10.782 --> 00:05:15.782
Other than just I've got to go out, replace that person skill for skill.

103
00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:18.782
Okay now let's define the requirements that need to

104
00:05:18.782 --> 00:05:20.936
be fulfilled by the new hire.

105
00:05:20.936 --> 00:05:28.000
Treat this just like a system design, we need requirements before we can write some code.
