00:00:02.657 --> 00:00:05.112
Let's take a moment to define just what customer

2
00:00:05.112 --> 00:00:06.990
expectations are in this section.

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.657
Now defining and capturing customer expectations can be fuzzy or hard to get,

4
00:00:12.657 --> 00:00:15.657
extract or even interpret from your customer.

5
00:00:15.657 --> 00:00:18.566
Customer expectations are very unique and different for

6
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.782
each and every person and customer.

7
00:00:20.782 --> 00:00:25.657
Some can be very fuzzy like, I expect you to do good work.

8
00:00:25.657 --> 00:00:27.086
Okay not too clear.

9
00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:29.943
Or they can be very, very specific like,

10
00:00:29.943 --> 00:00:34.657
I want x, y, and z done this Friday 4:00 PM or else.

11
00:00:34.657 --> 00:00:36.811
Well I know exactly what they expect,

12
00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:41.990
and that's when it's fully articulated and maybe even fully documented.

13
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.657
Okay, let's explore further.

14
00:00:44.657 --> 00:00:46.580
So what is an expectation?

15
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.371
It's a belief that someone will or should achieve something.

16
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:58.657
So in the case of this module, the someone is, of course, you and your team.

17
00:00:58.657 --> 00:01:01.384
So what is a customer expectation?

18
00:01:01.384 --> 00:01:03.202
To continue this further,

19
00:01:03.202 --> 00:01:08.272
customer expectations is a belief by your customer that you will or should

20
00:01:08.272 --> 00:01:12.657
achieve something and that something is in fact the expectation.

21
00:01:12.657 --> 00:01:15.657
And your customers will have many expectations and each

22
00:01:15.657 --> 00:01:17.371
customer will have different ones.

23
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:21.657
Man, that is a lot on your shoulders to figure out actually.

24
00:01:21.657 --> 00:01:25.293
Remember you are providing a service which is providing business

25
00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:27.990
value and just so happens to include software,

26
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.657
not the other way around.

27
00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:34.657
Also think of potential expectations from the customer's point of view,

28
00:01:34.657 --> 00:01:35.857
not yours.

29
00:01:35.857 --> 00:01:40.657
Now let's see some examples of customer expectations.

30
00:01:40.657 --> 00:01:44.657
Here are some examples of some customer expectations.

31
00:01:44.657 --> 00:01:50.657
You will deliver a build every 2 weeks, they may expect a build every 2 weeks,

32
00:01:50.657 --> 00:01:51.990
can you deliver that?

33
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.657
How would you deliver that?

34
00:01:53.657 --> 00:01:55.657
You will hold a weekly status meeting.

35
00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:59.435
Man, I have a ton of meetings and here's another one?

36
00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:01.657
What will we talk about?

37
00:02:01.657 --> 00:02:04.202
You will on call for ecommerce support.

38
00:02:04.202 --> 00:02:05.657
This must be important.

39
00:02:05.657 --> 00:02:09.657
Is the Ecom tied to my projects aligned to the business?

40
00:02:09.657 --> 00:02:11.657
How do I handle that?

41
00:02:11.657 --> 00:02:13.657
You will understand my business.

42
00:02:13.657 --> 00:02:14.657
Wait a minute,

43
00:02:14.657 --> 00:02:18.907
I thought I was a software engineer turned manager for software engineers,

44
00:02:18.907 --> 00:02:22.657
you mean I need to know their business too?

45
00:02:22.657 --> 00:02:24.657
You will always deliver on time.

46
00:02:24.657 --> 00:02:26.657
Sure I get that, but always?

47
00:02:26.657 --> 00:02:29.514
How do I handle that if I don't?

48
00:02:29.514 --> 00:02:31.657
You will never have a bug.

49
00:02:31.657 --> 00:02:33.990
Hey that's an easy one, uh, right.

50
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.965
They'll always be some bugs of some form, how do I manage that expectation?

51
00:02:38.965 --> 00:02:41.657
So keep these in mind for now.

52
00:02:41.657 --> 00:02:44.657
We will progress in this module to learn the basic techniques of

53
00:02:44.657 --> 00:02:47.157
managing customer expectations then we'll circle around to each one

54
00:02:47.157 --> 00:02:51.042
of these and I'll give you ideas and examples on how you might

55
00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:54.657
better manage each expectation.

56
00:02:54.657 --> 00:02:56.990
You will likely be getting your assignments,

57
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.657
direction, requirements,

58
00:02:57.657 --> 00:03:02.657
and priorities from a variety of sources in your company.

59
00:03:02.657 --> 00:03:05.324
And for each of these sources of customer,

60
00:03:05.324 --> 00:03:07.768
their expectations will vary in nature.

61
00:03:07.768 --> 00:03:12.990
Managing expectations, therefore, may need different approaches by customer type.

62
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.657
So let's look at a few.

63
00:03:15.657 --> 00:03:18.657
Business leaders, such as CEOs, CFOs,

64
00:03:18.657 --> 00:03:23.740
CIOs nor the VP of manufacturing or the VP of engineering,

65
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.657
for example, may have the highest expectations,

66
00:03:26.657 --> 00:03:31.657
such as I want that done now, any questions?

67
00:03:31.657 --> 00:03:33.657
The next will be steering group.

68
00:03:33.657 --> 00:03:38.324
This may be a collection of two or more of the above even of

69
00:03:38.324 --> 00:03:39.990
other representatives that get together,

70
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.657
maybe monthly or quarterly, to set priorities and/or drive requirements.

71
00:03:45.657 --> 00:03:49.657
This group will also have very high expectations.

72
00:03:49.657 --> 00:03:51.965
Another group may be what I call business focal points,

73
00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:55.990
maybe the manager of customer service has provided you a requirement,

74
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.514
a business focal point, maybe more approachable,

75
00:03:58.514 --> 00:04:03.157
and you may be able to spend more time with this person to build

76
00:04:03.157 --> 00:04:07.657
trust and understanding when you need it the most.

77
00:04:07.657 --> 00:04:12.657
Next, your manager may have a totally different set of expectations,

78
00:04:12.657 --> 00:04:14.324
like coaching and mentoring coworkers,

79
00:04:14.324 --> 00:04:16.074
improving your software development processes,

80
00:04:16.074 --> 00:04:16.907
for example,

81
00:04:16.907 --> 00:04:21.119
more of how you write your software more than what

82
00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:23.888
you do for your customers possibly.

83
00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:24.811
End users,

84
00:04:24.811 --> 00:04:29.514
you may get calls and comments from end users or reps of

85
00:04:29.514 --> 00:04:31.657
end users about things they expect,

86
00:04:31.657 --> 00:04:33.734
such as when the sale systems may be available,

87
00:04:33.734 --> 00:04:38.157
can I call someone on the weekend and things like that.

88
00:04:38.157 --> 00:04:44.157
Okay, so in this list of customers from business leader down to end users,

89
00:04:44.157 --> 00:04:49.157
from the top you have people with higher expectations and the people lower down

90
00:04:49.157 --> 00:04:52.657
the list are what I call more reality based expectations.

91
00:04:52.657 --> 00:04:56.580
They may live more in what I might call the real world,

92
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.657
the nuts and bolts of what we're trying to do.

93
00:04:59.657 --> 00:05:02.590
They may be more forgiving and they may be able to

94
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.990
give you more succinct expectations.

95
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.657
The higher you go up, especially up in the business leaders,

96
00:05:07.657 --> 00:05:12.021
CEOs and CFOs, et cetera, they have very,

97
00:05:12.021 --> 00:05:14.943
very high expectations and don't really care about the

98
00:05:14.943 --> 00:05:16.657
nuts and bolts and just want things done.

99
00:05:16.657 --> 00:05:21.657
So this is just a heads up in terms of how you connect to your customer base

100
00:05:21.657 --> 00:05:27.657
and what you can expect yourself of their expectations.

101
00:05:27.657 --> 00:05:31.657
Expectations come in all shapes and sizes, as we know.

102
00:05:31.657 --> 00:05:36.657
Now let's circle back to your job of aligning IT to the business.

103
00:05:36.657 --> 00:05:38.790
If you are successful in doing that well,

104
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.657
you will find that you will have a better chance of managing expectations,

105
00:05:43.657 --> 00:05:48.324
especially for the business leaders and steering group staff by senior people,

106
00:05:48.324 --> 00:05:51.839
you know, the people with the highest expectations.

107
00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:55.657
Okay, so from a high level perspective,

108
00:05:55.657 --> 00:05:57.457
if you have aligned your work with the business,

109
00:05:57.457 --> 00:06:00.879
you have already come a very long way with setting

110
00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:03.657
expectations for those senior folks.

111
00:06:03.657 --> 00:06:06.514
Everybody knows what you and your team are working on,

112
00:06:06.514 --> 00:06:10.324
they can see your priority 1 and priority 2 projects and activities,

113
00:06:10.324 --> 00:06:14.349
and they can see that you have a backlog as well.

114
00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:17.021
In order to adequately manage customer expectations,

115
00:06:17.021 --> 00:06:21.426
it is important to prioritize the needs of the client or clients.

116
00:06:21.426 --> 00:06:26.657
Everyone should be on the same page with regards to what the client expects of

117
00:06:26.657 --> 00:06:29.907
the business and what the business can promise to deliver.

118
00:06:29.907 --> 00:06:33.657
Always be talking to the customer.

119
00:06:33.657 --> 00:06:35.195
Every client will be different,

120
00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:40.574
asking lots of questions is a great way to find out what the client is

121
00:06:40.574 --> 00:06:43.800
prioritizing as the most important required service or product.

122
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.990
It is also good for you to ask the customer what he or she expects from the

123
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.970
business relationship and the services that you provide.

124
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:57.220
You can see on this slide how the emphasis on a clear

125
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.930
approach to prioritizing your work is essential.

126
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:09.000
Now in the next section, let's turn to discussing strategies for managing customer expectations.
