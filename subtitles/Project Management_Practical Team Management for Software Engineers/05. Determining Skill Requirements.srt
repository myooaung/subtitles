1
00:00:00,408 --> 00:00:05,075
In the previous section we learned about the kinds or types of skills we needed,

2
00:00:05,075 --> 00:00:08,408
technical, communication, and leadership.

3
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:11,408
Now we want to determine exactly what those skills are so we can

4
00:00:11,408 --> 00:00:15,408
develop a plan to acquire and learn those skills.

5
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:18,194
As you have likely noticed in this course when we do things we

6
00:00:18,194 --> 00:00:21,793
always try and align what we are doing with the business and

7
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:24,408
determining skill requirements is no different.

8
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:29,408
Let's see an example of how we will do this.

9
00:00:29,408 --> 00:00:35,075
Now let's determine role and skill gaps or requirements needed for your team.

10
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:38,408
We're going to follow these steps.

11
00:00:38,408 --> 00:00:38,908
Step 1,

12
00:00:38,908 --> 00:00:41,158
review all of your projects and activities you identified

13
00:00:41,158 --> 00:00:44,135
in aligning your team with the business.

14
00:00:44,135 --> 00:00:47,158
Step 2, review long term requirements as well.

15
00:00:47,158 --> 00:00:49,979
You are in the technology field and it moves very fast,

16
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:53,908
so take a peek at the future and see if any technologies may

17
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:58,408
help you get your job done in the future.

18
00:00:58,408 --> 00:01:01,265
Step 3, review your team member needs, they will now,

19
00:01:01,265 --> 00:01:03,346
maybe better than you in some cases,

20
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:07,408
what they need to improve on or learn for the first time even.

21
00:01:07,408 --> 00:01:12,408
Step 4, integrate the lists into one long list and prioritize.

22
00:01:12,408 --> 00:01:16,408
Step 5, develop a plan and, well, implement it.

23
00:01:16,408 --> 00:01:22,408
And step 6, regularly inspect and adapt to the world changing around you.

24
00:01:22,408 --> 00:01:25,408
Okay now let's do an example together following the

25
00:01:25,408 --> 00:01:29,408
six easy steps I've outlined here.

26
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:33,008
Step 1, review projects and activities.

27
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:35,408
Remember our priority grid?

28
00:01:35,408 --> 00:01:37,541
We have priority 1, 2, and backlog items,

29
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:41,908
so you want to review these items with your team and determine together

30
00:01:41,908 --> 00:01:46,331
what skills you think you need to get your job done.

31
00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:54,408
Certainly focus on priority 1 and priority 2 and then lastly the backlog.

32
00:01:54,408 --> 00:01:57,158
So we're going to review the priority projects and activities that

33
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:00,741
are aligned to the business and determine what technical skills will

34
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:03,408
be needed for those priority projects.

35
00:02:03,408 --> 00:02:05,408
Some examples, bootstrap, CSS,

36
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:08,485
and jQuery may have been the three skills your team said,

37
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:11,331
hey we need those to get the job done.

38
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:15,008
Next we review the priority projects and activities that are

39
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:17,783
aligned to the business and determine what communication skills

40
00:02:17,783 --> 00:02:20,408
will be needed for those priority projects.

41
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:26,408
Some examples may be, I need some presentation writing and PowerPoint skills.

42
00:02:26,408 --> 00:02:29,135
Next we review the priority projects and activities that are

43
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:31,863
aligned to the business and determine what leadership skills will

44
00:02:31,863 --> 00:02:34,226
be needed for those priority projects.

45
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:38,331
Some examples may be project management skills and developing estimates.

46
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:43,716
So now we have a list of skills we need that are driven by the business.

47
00:02:43,716 --> 00:02:49,408
Next we're going to review long term requirements.

48
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:54,408
Step 2, review and assess long term requirements.

49
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:57,551
As an IT professional you are looking to the future and

50
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:59,658
keeping an eye on new technologies.

51
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:03,408
It will generally not be specific hands on training,

52
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:08,408
but newer technologies are trends that may benefit your company downstream.

53
00:03:08,408 --> 00:03:11,485
Also this training may be geared to business or IT

54
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:16,226
managers talking about how a new technology may be applied

55
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:18,408
to improve business performance.

56
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:20,741
Here are some examples.

57
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:25,408
Cloud, mobile apps, big data, things like that.

58
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:28,837
Typically you might be the one to go to this kind of training or maybe a very

59
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:32,408
key person on your team that has an architectural affinity,

60
00:03:32,408 --> 00:03:33,008
if you will.

61
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:36,033
You don't want to send a bunch of people since this is long

62
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:40,408
term and these technical areas may change.

63
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:44,408
It might not even happen in the future.

64
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:46,716
Step 3, review team member goals.

65
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:50,408
You want to review and assess what team members want.

66
00:03:50,408 --> 00:03:54,551
First this may appeal to their own personal goals of learning new things,

67
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:57,808
as well as maybe you just missed some skill areas and they're

68
00:03:57,808 --> 00:04:00,953
just going to point it out to you like, hey we've got to learn this,

69
00:04:00,953 --> 00:04:02,044
didn't you realize that?

70
00:04:02,044 --> 00:04:03,408
So here are some examples.

71
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:08,408
Maybe in this case it was SQL Server and database design and modeling.

72
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:10,408
Maybe you thought they knew everything this area,

73
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:18,000
but I guess not, they needed some more training. Now let's put these lists together and prioritize.
