00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.212
Now here are some challenges ahead of you.

2
00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:09.750
The business does not seem in many cases to view IT as a strategic partner.

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.750
Many CIOs or senior IT people may not invited to participate in any of the

4
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.750
organization wide strategic planning or decision making sessions.

5
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.750
The business isn't interested in strategic IT planning potentially,

6
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.750
so you will need to push and shove your way to the table.

7
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.442
Next the IT department does not have the expertise or capacity to

8
00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:34.750
develop an effective strategic plan for IT.

9
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.625
IT strategy management requires a highly specialized

10
00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:41.750
skill set and resource commitment.

11
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.750
It is rarely a success approach as a side activity.

12
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.673
So your solution,

13
00:00:45.673 --> 00:00:48.750
have a quarterly planning activity for you and your key

14
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.250
team members to develop a strategic plan.

15
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.750
Next and last,

16
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.981
IT strategies tend to focus mainly on technology and

17
00:00:57.981 --> 00:01:00.750
fail to cover other business areas.

18
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.058
IT strategies are often too technical and written in a

19
00:01:03.058 --> 00:01:04.750
language the business cannot understand.

20
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.750
Solution, it must focus and be aligned with the business.

21
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.750
Your plan must focus and be aligned with the business.

22
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.179
And now let's see an approach.

23
00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.750
Bottom line, what are you going to do?

24
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.841
Business drivers and requirements.

25
00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:25.750
When are you going to do it?

26
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.205
Priority.

27
00:01:26.205 --> 00:01:29.841
And how are you going to do it?

28
00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:30.750
The resources.

29
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.250
So this section and this whole module will focus on how I can help you put

30
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.750
together your IT strategies to align to the business.

31
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.417
Based on the challenges on the previous slide,

32
00:01:43.417 --> 00:01:44.750
here are your resolutions,

33
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.750
here's how you're going to solve those challenges from the previous slide.

34
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.750
The key is to work with the business when developing your IT plans.

35
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.750
A solid understanding of business needs combined with a mutual

36
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.386
understanding of drivers and constraints will help you create a

37
00:02:01.386 --> 00:02:03.568
very effective approach and plan.

38
00:02:03.568 --> 00:02:07.583
Creating and executing a successful IT plan will help

39
00:02:07.583 --> 00:02:10.083
drive IT into a leadership role,

40
00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:12.650
especially if the organization has not yet

41
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.750
formulated a formal strategy of its own.

42
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.250
Next,

43
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.250
articulate a clear IT strategy that aligns IT with the

44
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.212
business objectives is the most important activity you can do

45
00:02:24.212 --> 00:02:26.950
for the IT department or organization.

46
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.550
The strategic planning exercise requires that the CIO or director,

47
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.350
manager, or you, review the business environment,

48
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.288
assess the current state of IT,

49
00:02:37.288 --> 00:02:41.083
define the target state that is aligned with the organizational priorities,

50
00:02:41.083 --> 00:02:44.639
and focus efforts on IT initiatives that'll bring

51
00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.750
tangible benefits and value to the business.

52
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.673
Lastly a note,

53
00:02:48.673 --> 00:02:52.904
I use the term CIO or Chief Information Officer generically in this course,

54
00:02:52.904 --> 00:02:55.596
not every company has the formal role,

55
00:02:55.596 --> 00:03:00.212
but every company has the role of an informal fashion by default,

56
00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:03.179
someone, maybe it's you or an IT director,

57
00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:05.679
IT manager, IT team leader, et cetera,

58
00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:09.212
who is responsible to deliver IT products and services to the

59
00:03:09.212 --> 00:03:19.000
company that must be aligned with the business. So for this course I'm targeting you as my audience.
