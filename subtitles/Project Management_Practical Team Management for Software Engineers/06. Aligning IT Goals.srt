1
00:00:01,662 --> 00:00:03,849
Aligning IT team goals to business goals.

2
00:00:03,849 --> 00:00:07,912
So how do we align the work we do with the business?

3
00:00:07,912 --> 00:00:13,162
Now every company organization is likely to be different in the approach

4
00:00:13,162 --> 00:00:16,662
or capability and granularity in determining alignment.

5
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:19,309
In fact there may not be any at all.

6
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:22,462
If there is none, it'll be your job to create one.

7
00:00:22,462 --> 00:00:24,062
If there is an existing one,

8
00:00:24,062 --> 00:00:27,935
it'll be your job to learn that process and possibly evolve

9
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:32,995
and improve that process to ensure that the work you do is in

10
00:00:32,995 --> 00:00:34,662
fact aligned to the business.

11
00:00:34,662 --> 00:00:38,662
Now let's run through a complete example.

12
00:00:38,662 --> 00:00:42,662
Now let's talk about goals from fuzzy to measurable.

13
00:00:42,662 --> 00:00:45,431
When it comes to getting or extracting business goals,

14
00:00:45,431 --> 00:00:47,106
sometimes it can be challenging.

15
00:00:47,106 --> 00:00:50,662
Sometimes they are what I call very fuzzy.

16
00:00:50,662 --> 00:00:54,662
What you are looking for are goals that are more measurable.

17
00:00:54,662 --> 00:00:58,662
For example, your customer might way I want to increase revenue.

18
00:00:58,662 --> 00:01:00,571
Well, okay what does that really mean?

19
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:01,662
And by how much?

20
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,662
Or maybe I want to avoid costs.

21
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:06,862
Well, which costs and where are they and how much?

22
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:09,662
Or I want to improve customer satisfaction.

23
00:01:09,662 --> 00:01:11,662
Well that sounds great, how do I go about doing that?

24
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:14,389
How do you connect those dots?

25
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:16,662
I call these fuzzy goals.

26
00:01:16,662 --> 00:01:20,662
Okay, next might be more what I call measurable goals.

27
00:01:20,662 --> 00:01:22,508
Maybe increase product revenue by 25%,

28
00:01:22,508 --> 00:01:26,850
so now I know that the revenue is tied to the product by 25%,

29
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,844
that gives me a better handle on where to maybe put my IT resources,

30
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:37,585
or reduce non-selling inventory by 25%, oh I could run some reports,

31
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:39,287
figure out what's not selling and reduce that

32
00:01:39,287 --> 00:01:43,662
inventory from the bottom up by 25%.

33
00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:46,662
Or maybe I could rewrite the user interface to be more user friendly,

34
00:01:46,662 --> 00:01:48,745
that might improve customer satisfaction.

35
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:51,662
So when you do get fuzzy goals,

36
00:01:51,662 --> 00:01:55,508
spend more time with the business to better understand just

37
00:01:55,508 --> 00:01:58,745
what they mean by increasing revenue, for example.

38
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:03,091
So you may need some extra time to talk with the customers,

39
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:07,480
maybe you have a business analyst on your team or maybe on their team,

40
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,495
to further explore the business goals, decompose them,

41
00:02:10,495 --> 00:02:14,662
deconstruct them to be more specific so you can better

42
00:02:14,662 --> 00:02:17,662
apply those resources to make a difference.

43
00:02:17,662 --> 00:02:22,662
Now let's continue with the example.

44
00:02:22,662 --> 00:02:23,975
Now that you are a new manager,

45
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:25,962
you first need to align your work with the business.

46
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:29,495
Let the team continue their development activities they have in their cue,

47
00:02:29,495 --> 00:02:32,829
but you will need to first get out of the weeds and

48
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:35,298
get a handle on the business.

49
00:02:35,298 --> 00:02:40,412
So to determine IT activities takes business analysis effort and time,

50
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:44,200
either supplied by one or more subject matter experts in the business units

51
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,117
and/or business analysts on the IT side of the organization.

52
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:53,733
Your company may or may not have articulated and written any business goals.

53
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:57,662
Your company may do things via what I call chit chat.

54
00:02:57,662 --> 00:03:00,662
Your company may have well written and structured goals.

55
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:05,662
So whatever you company has, one or the other or both, here's what I recommend.

56
00:03:05,662 --> 00:03:07,844
First work with your manager to understand the

57
00:03:07,844 --> 00:03:11,233
broader business goals of the company, business not IT.

58
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:16,200
This will give your team a bigger picture of where the company is

59
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,662
going and what the company wants to accomplish.

60
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:19,079
Next,

61
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:23,245
work with your manager to understand how your work and

62
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,662
projects align with the business goals.

63
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:28,462
This will give you and your team a sense of value and purpose,

64
00:03:28,462 --> 00:03:32,662
key elements to support inspiration and motivation.

65
00:03:32,662 --> 00:03:34,662
Next identify who are your customers that would

66
00:03:34,662 --> 00:03:36,662
benefit from the work you will do.

67
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:39,962
This will give you an understanding of your project's stakeholders.

68
00:03:39,962 --> 00:03:40,262
Remember,

69
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,662
stakeholders are those people that have a vested

70
00:03:42,662 --> 00:03:45,579
interest in the success of the project.

71
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:49,117
Usually they are the recipients of the project's outcomes,

72
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:53,091
but also maybe the IT infrastructure team and the financial team who

73
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:55,662
will want to know the budgets or cost savings,

74
00:03:55,662 --> 00:03:56,431
for example.

75
00:03:56,431 --> 00:04:01,440
And go out and meet and talk with them, begin developing relationships.

76
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,662
These relationships will make or break your success.

77
00:04:07,662 --> 00:04:08,912
Lastly, document everything.

78
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:13,995
Write it all down since we will need it later on, of course.

79
00:04:13,995 --> 00:04:16,662
And if our company has some existing artifacts,

80
00:04:16,662 --> 00:04:18,995
write down their location, file share, URL,

81
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:29,000
et cetera, so you know where that stuff is. Okay, now let's check out an example of how you would go about doing this.
