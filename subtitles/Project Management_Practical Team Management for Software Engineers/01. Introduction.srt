Hello, I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,667
I will be presenting the module Managing Through Effective Communication in

3
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:13,000
the course Practical Team Management for Software Engineers.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,833
Maybe by this point of the course you're thinking, what did I get myself into?

5
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:22,000
We have talked about aligning our work to the business,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,357
how to structure and define the roles of our new team,

7
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:28,077
how to build their skills and how to acquire new talent,

8
00:00:28,077 --> 00:00:31,636
nowhere in there are we doing much technically.

9
00:00:31,636 --> 00:00:36,000
Are you starting to miss the technical stuff?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,308
Or are you excited and motivated to learn and broaden

11
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:39,889
not only your management skills,

12
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:43,727
but enhance your future opportunities in leadership and management?

13
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:47,417
I did make that metamorphosis, that is, my professional transition,

14
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:49,500
and have never looked back.

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,333
Okay, now for your next lesson on being the best manager you can be,

16
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:59,769
learning that effective communication will greatly help and

17
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:06,000
enable your ability to be successful as a manager.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,462
What we've got here is a failure to communicate,

19
00:01:09,462 --> 00:01:15,000
from the 1960's movie Cool Hand Luke, and that is exactly what you don't want.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,917
You don't want to fail at communicating.

21
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:21,667
So far in this course we have discussed many new

22
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:24,000
soft skills you will need to have.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,600
In this module the skill sets are only going to get softer and soft

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,000
skills are the harder ones to learn and get good at.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So first let's recap what we have done so far in this course and how quality communication is required for each.
