00:00:01,427 --> 00:00:06,427
Managing expectations for me is the single most important aspect to

2
00:00:06,427 --> 00:00:11,427
maintaining a healthy and rewarding relationship with my customers,

3
00:00:11,427 --> 00:00:13,245
my teammates, and my management.

4
00:00:13,245 --> 00:00:19,427
Now let's see why managing customer expectations is so important.

5
00:00:19,427 --> 00:00:22,427
Do you know what your customers expect from you and your team?

6
00:00:22,427 --> 00:00:26,427
Are you meeting your customer's expectations?

7
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:29,427
You might answer, well I think so.

8
00:00:29,427 --> 00:00:30,760
How do you know?

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,427
Well really not a clue, you might answer.

10
00:00:33,427 --> 00:00:36,427
Well that is what this module is all about.

11
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:39,427
We will talk about how to understand just what a customer expectation is,

12
00:00:39,427 --> 00:00:41,094
how important it is,

13
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:45,427
and how to help you manage those expectations so you

14
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:48,427
can successfully lead your new team.

15
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:50,927
Here are the steps and challenges for you to manage

16
00:00:50,927 --> 00:00:52,260
expectations of your customer.

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,427
So first, what, what is it you're going to do?

18
00:00:56,427 --> 00:00:58,336
You're going to manage your customer expectations

19
00:00:58,336 --> 00:01:00,042
and the operative word is manage.

20
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:00,350
Warning,

21
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,627
it is a moving target and you need to assess and adapt and

22
00:01:04,627 --> 00:01:07,427
we will talk about techniques for this.

23
00:01:07,427 --> 00:01:09,581
Next, just how will you do that?

24
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:13,927
By following the key principles provided in this module you will be

25
00:01:13,927 --> 00:01:16,427
successful at managing your customer expectations.

26
00:01:16,427 --> 00:01:18,427
And when will you do that?

27
00:01:18,427 --> 00:01:19,094
Every day.

28
00:01:19,094 --> 00:01:25,427
It is how you act, speak, write, interact, lead and manage throughout your day.

29
00:01:25,427 --> 00:01:36,000
Managing expectations is not just a single event you do every other week, it is the way you conduct your business each and every day.
