1
00:00:01,041 --> 00:00:03,041
Promoting to production, well we're getting close now.

2
00:00:03,041 --> 00:00:06,041
The key users have identified that the last release looks great

3
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:10,041
and they'd like to move it to production.

4
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:13,041
Okay, let's see what that entails.

5
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:17,041
Promoting to production, whereas a release identifies changes to an application,

6
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:23,041
and a build implements those changes, a promotion delivers the changes.

7
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:23,810
More specifically,

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,930
a promotion is an indication or signal that a given build has been

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,041
approved for deployment to a certain environment.

10
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:35,184
This approval can require a form be filled out in triplicate,

11
00:00:35,184 --> 00:00:38,174
or it can just occur as a result of someone deciding

12
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:41,272
to just go and deploy a build, every organization is different.

13
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:46,041
You may have a promotion from test to stage and then from stage to production,

14
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,041
or something else.

15
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:52,041
So let's explore the options in this section.

16
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:56,041
I would also like to first introduce you to this term, DevOps.

17
00:00:56,041 --> 00:01:00,708
It is a recently new term and it is used to refer to the

18
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:03,708
collaboration and communication between software developers and

19
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,405
the information technology professionals.

20
00:01:05,405 --> 00:01:07,950
As part of the collaboration, of course,

21
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,349
is the promotion of a build to production.

22
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:16,241
Again, the area of DevOps is quite large and will not be covered here,

23
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:20,041
but I wanted to give you context for where promoting to production fits in,

24
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:22,541
also Pluralsight has several courses on DevOps,

25
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,041
so you might want to check them out as well.

26
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:31,041
Okay, let's talk about the promotion process.

27
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,579
So here's the sample promotion process to kind of give

28
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,859
you an idea what I'm talking about.

29
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:38,041
The first would be approvals and scheduling.

30
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:41,041
So be sure you get the approvals to move your build into production

31
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,104
and then set the date and time that works for you,

32
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:44,898
your team, and of course your customers,

33
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:47,041
they're the most important group.

34
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:50,426
I like installing on Sundays or Mondays if possible so you

35
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:56,041
have the week to remediate if need be, otherwise you're working the weekends.

36
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:56,341
Next,

37
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:59,041
you must communicate when you're moving anything to production

38
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:03,405
and you must coordinate it with your customers,

39
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:05,041
especially your customers.

40
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,272
Also the DevOps teams, if you have one,

41
00:02:06,272 --> 00:02:11,041
and your manager and other business or IT entities as appropriate.

42
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,041
Update any documentation,

43
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:18,041
we always forget or just hate to update any documentation.

44
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:21,470
This is not allowed in my shop, so update the release notes,

45
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:26,132
user docs, help manuals, online portals like SharePoint or file shares,

46
00:02:26,132 --> 00:02:31,041
maybe you send out an email, text messages or use some special social tools,

47
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:31,641
like Slack.

48
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:32,241
Provide training.

49
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:37,041
If training is required, be sure it happens before the rollout to production.

50
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,374
Be sure everyone is ready and prepared.

51
00:02:39,374 --> 00:02:43,708
Remember the build may be perfect, the promotion to production may be perfect,

52
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,241
but if the users are confused, ill-trained,

53
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:49,841
then the perception from the user or customer base

54
00:02:49,841 --> 00:02:53,041
will be that the build did not work.

55
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:57,426
Yes, I know, the build works for you from the perspective of a software engineer,

56
00:02:57,426 --> 00:03:02,041
but not from the end user, so train and educate as needed.

57
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:05,314
Next, move and install the build.

58
00:03:05,314 --> 00:03:09,184
Now please document your process on what is needed,

59
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,041
like DLLs or scripts or files and things like that,

60
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:16,041
and how to move and install your build into production environment,

61
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:20,132
like copy files to that folder, run this script,

62
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:21,041
et cetera.

63
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,041
You may do this or it may be handed over to another team.

64
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,272
In the DevOps model,

65
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:28,586
you'll always hand it over to the DevOps team to actually

66
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:29,950
do the installation and configuring,

67
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,958
but you must first write the instructions on what to do.

68
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,041
And lastly, archive the build,

69
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,041
in case you need to go back and review what you provided.

70
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:41,241
So always keep track of that as well.

71
00:03:41,241 --> 00:03:45,541
Okay so now we are in production and we will likely have

72
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,041
some application maintenance to perform as our customers

73
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:53,000
and users use our new system. So let's check that out in the next section.
