1
00:00:00,828 --> 00:00:01,661
Walk arounds.

2
00:00:01,661 --> 00:00:03,745
So what's a walk around?

3
00:00:03,745 --> 00:00:09,328
They're an impromptu and unplanned quick visit or chat with an employee,

4
00:00:09,328 --> 00:00:11,828
team member or other person.

5
00:00:11,828 --> 00:00:15,828
It should only be a couple of minutes, maybe 3 to 5 minutes.

6
00:00:15,828 --> 00:00:20,828
This is not a meeting and is a very informal and casual encounter.

7
00:00:20,828 --> 00:00:24,757
What I am calling the walk around is also known as

8
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:27,495
management by walking or even wandering around,

9
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:27,911
MBWA,

10
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:33,606
and these refer to a style of business management which involves you

11
00:00:33,606 --> 00:00:37,828
the manager walking around in an unstructured manner,

12
00:00:37,828 --> 00:00:40,828
through the work places, at random,

13
00:00:40,828 --> 00:00:43,283
checking with employees about the status of their work,

14
00:00:43,283 --> 00:00:43,828
et cetera.

15
00:00:43,828 --> 00:00:47,495
Now the purpose is to get and stay connected with your

16
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:49,695
team at a more natural and human level.

17
00:00:49,695 --> 00:00:53,828
In order to do this you need to walk around and talk to your team,

18
00:00:53,828 --> 00:00:56,751
ask questions, and be there to help when needed.

19
00:00:56,751 --> 00:01:00,905
Now the benefits are huge, you get grass roots,

20
00:01:00,905 --> 00:01:05,828
real time feedback from a person, usually in the comfort of their office.

21
00:01:05,828 --> 00:01:09,161
You might even discover any issues early in order to

22
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:10,737
avoid bigger problems downstream.

23
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:16,710
Also you can get a pulse or a feeling of the health of a team member and

24
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,464
what I mean by health is how they feel about their job,

25
00:01:20,464 --> 00:01:24,828
their assignments, their workload, or even personal items.

26
00:01:24,828 --> 00:01:29,828
Lastly, it helps build a personal rapport with each person.

27
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:33,828
As I mentioned, they are impromptu, that is unplanned.

28
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:35,828
Now they are planned in my mind as a manager,

29
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:39,495
for example I'm going to go get some coffee from the kitchen and on the

30
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:42,257
way back I am planning to stop at someone's office.

31
00:01:42,257 --> 00:01:43,685
I don't know which one,

32
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:47,828
but I want to drop in on maybe one or two if that makes sense.

33
00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:50,136
That's the extent of my planning.

34
00:01:50,136 --> 00:01:54,257
If there are two people talking intently I will not stop.

35
00:01:54,257 --> 00:01:58,828
I will use my judgment to be nonintrusive and respectful of their time.

36
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:00,828
I don't want to bug anybody.

37
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:03,828
But just to pop the head in and say - hey how was your weekend?

38
00:02:03,828 --> 00:02:05,828
You know, are you working on that particular project?

39
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:06,828
Yeah, sounds good.

40
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:11,161
You know, there's a chit chat here and there, that's really, really good.

41
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:14,761
So throughout the day I might try to drop in on all of my folks,

42
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:16,982
at least for a couple minutes and see how they're doing.

43
00:02:16,982 --> 00:02:22,028
In fact, they may even drop in to my office and we chat.

44
00:02:22,028 --> 00:02:24,828
Here's a little more on walk arounds.

45
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:27,597
Now I have focused on the walk around for you to directly

46
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:31,059
interact informally with each of your team members,

47
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:37,828
but this could apply to anyone in your professional sphere if interactions.

48
00:02:37,828 --> 00:02:40,290
I would like you to include your management,

49
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,828
maybe each day or two drop into her or his office and just say hi,

50
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:46,695
hey I'll get that report to you, but how was your weekend?

51
00:02:46,695 --> 00:02:50,542
Or I heard you just got back from vacation, how was it?

52
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:51,828
Something like that.

53
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:55,828
That stimulates a little brief conversation and a connection,

54
00:02:55,828 --> 00:02:59,828
some a little bit around personal activities and some around work activities.

55
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:00,899
Also, your customers,

56
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:06,328
if it is possible to physically drop in and say hi without a formal meeting,

57
00:03:06,328 --> 00:03:07,828
that would be great.

58
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:10,828
Maybe something like - hey Joe, how are you?

59
00:03:10,828 --> 00:03:12,828
Is this system working okay for you?

60
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:14,828
Oh, great, I'm glad that it is.

61
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,828
Did you just get back from seeing your family in Hawaii?

62
00:03:16,828 --> 00:03:17,136
Also,

63
00:03:17,136 --> 00:03:20,520
there are what I call remote drop ins because people may

64
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,828
not be physically near or around you, and you could do a causal phone call,

65
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:30,828
maybe even Skype or some web conferencing tools to quickly just touch base,

66
00:03:30,828 --> 00:03:33,399
not in a formal setting, not on a meeting,

67
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:34,828
just hey, how are you?

68
00:03:34,828 --> 00:03:36,593
Just thought I'd give you a quick call, and again,

69
00:03:36,593 --> 00:03:38,895
it might be 3 to 5 minutes and you move on.

70
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:39,428
Of course,

71
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:49,000
you can tailor the walk around so it best fits you and your environment. Alright, now let's talk about emails.
