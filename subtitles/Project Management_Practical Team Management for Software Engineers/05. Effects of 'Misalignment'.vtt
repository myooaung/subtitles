00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.900
Let's talk about what can go wrong if the work your team

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.264
does is not aligned to the business.

3
00:00:07.264 --> 00:00:10.900
Many people think, how cares, I'm coding anyway,

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.900
I think I am doing what's important and what's the difference?

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.329
What will it really make?

6
00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:21.186
Well it might be minor, but it can affect your job or even your career as well.

7
00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:23.456
So here are some effects of misalignment.

8
00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:27.900
Your team is working on the wrong priorities.

9
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.043
So what is the right priority?

10
00:00:30.043 --> 00:00:33.445
You need a process to identify the work and prioritize.

11
00:00:33.445 --> 00:00:36.900
Your team is not helping the business achieve its maximum potential.

12
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.900
So what is the maximum potential?

13
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:46.900
You need a process to determine what the right work is from the business.

14
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.900
Your team will feel less connected to the business.

15
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.088
I think this is an important one.

16
00:00:51.088 --> 00:00:55.718
I truly believe that if you and your team feels connected to the business,

17
00:00:55.718 --> 00:00:59.438
they will feel that their contributions really mean something and

18
00:00:59.438 --> 00:01:02.900
have an effect on the business and its customers.

19
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.900
This improves morale and productivity and what the business really wants.

20
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.400
It's a win/win.

21
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.186
Lastly, mistrust and misunderstanding between the business and IT personnel.

22
00:01:14.186 --> 00:01:15.471
In my career,

23
00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:21.082
I have seen time and time again this misalignment between IT and the business.

24
00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:24.355
This results in less productivity and more organizational issues.

25
00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:28.900
So have a good process by which the business and IT get

26
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.100
together and collectively understand the business goals and

27
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.900
how IT will help them achieve them.

28
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:42.900
This builds trust and it will make your job much more rewarding and fun too.

29
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.900
Now let's recap your challenge ahead of you.

30
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.900
First the key is to work with the business when developing your IT plan,

31
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.445
a solid understanding of the business needs combined with the

32
00:01:55.445 --> 00:01:58.809
mutual understanding of drivers and constraints will help you

33
00:01:58.809 --> 00:02:00.900
create a very effective plan.

34
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.100
Next, the planning process requires that you review the business environment,

35
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.500
assess the current state of IT,

36
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.600
define a target state that is aligned with the organizational

37
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.100
priorities and focus efforts on IT initiatives that bring

38
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.285
tangible benefits to the business.

39
00:02:17.285 --> 00:02:23.567
In the previous slide and this slide I have emphasized that you need a process.

40
00:02:23.567 --> 00:02:35.000
The remainder of this module will present an example of a planning process to ensure your activities are aligned to the business.
