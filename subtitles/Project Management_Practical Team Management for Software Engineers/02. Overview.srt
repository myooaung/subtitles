1
00:00:00,358 --> 00:00:02,631
Effective communication is the foundation,

2
00:00:02,631 --> 00:00:03,540
the basis,

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,358
of success in order to be successful in the topics we have covered so far.

4
00:00:09,358 --> 00:00:11,644
The first is aligning IT to the business.

5
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:13,666
You must be able to talk, listen,

6
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:17,050
document in order for the business to even tell you what

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,204
they are doing and what they need.

8
00:00:19,204 --> 00:00:25,108
You can't align your work to something you can't understand or determine.

9
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,358
Managing customer expectations.

10
00:00:27,358 --> 00:00:29,666
You must be able to listen and understand the world

11
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,743
from the customer's point of view,

12
00:00:31,743 --> 00:00:36,358
show empathy and be able to relate with your customers.

13
00:00:36,358 --> 00:00:37,608
Building team structure and capabilities.

14
00:00:37,608 --> 00:00:41,903
Based on what you need to do by aligning your work to the business

15
00:00:41,903 --> 00:00:43,691
and understanding your customer's expectations,

16
00:00:43,691 --> 00:00:48,813
you therefore have to be able to define the right team structure and build the

17
00:00:48,813 --> 00:00:52,691
capabilities you need to perform and support the business.

18
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:55,358
Acquiring the right talent.

19
00:00:55,358 --> 00:00:58,358
Without the right people your job will be excruciatingly tough.

20
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,435
With the right communication skills you will be able to

21
00:01:01,435 --> 00:01:04,441
find and hire the right talent to, again,

22
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:07,358
meet your mission of supporting the business.

23
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:10,358
So what are the consequences of failing to communicate well?

24
00:01:10,358 --> 00:01:14,358
Well your clients and project needs may not be met.

25
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:17,358
Your customers may not respect or support you.

26
00:01:17,358 --> 00:01:21,358
Your subordinates may be confused about what is expected of them.

27
00:01:21,358 --> 00:01:24,358
You may be unable to hire the right talent.

28
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:28,358
Your goals and plans may come crashing down all around you.

29
00:01:28,358 --> 00:01:32,267
So welcome to the module that'll help you mitigate those consequences and risks.

30
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:37,994
As a manager you are required to communicate effectively to the business,

31
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:42,358
the customer, your team, and potential new hires.

32
00:01:42,358 --> 00:01:48,358
That is a talent, skill, and capability that you must have or improve upon.

33
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:54,358
Okay, let's do a quick overview of this module.

34
00:01:54,358 --> 00:01:56,281
Here are the module topics.

35
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:59,358
The course will be divided into two sections,

36
00:01:59,358 --> 00:02:03,358
the first, I'm going to talk about informal forms of communication,

37
00:02:03,358 --> 00:02:08,449
such as stand ups, walk arounds, informal emails,

38
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,358
and daily interactions.

39
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:16,775
Then on the formal side I'm going to talk about presentations,

40
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:19,903
meetings, emails, and status reporting.

41
00:02:19,903 --> 00:02:24,858
All these are key tools and methods of communication,

42
00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:28,358
so right out of the box as a manager if you use these tools

43
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:29,858
and the methods I'm going to propose,

44
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,358
you'll get way ahead of the game in terms of better

45
00:02:33,358 --> 00:02:36,358
communication with your customers, your management,

46
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:40,358
and your team members.

47
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:43,743
I'm going to divide the world of communications for you into

48
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:46,903
two types or categories of communication.

49
00:02:46,903 --> 00:02:56,000
The first, informal, and the second, formal. Now let's discuss and explore each.
