1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,450
Motivating your team.

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:06,950
When people are motivated, I think just life's grand.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:12,506
I want to relate each of the earlier modules and how each module provides a

4
00:00:12,506 --> 00:00:16,950
platform for creating or growing motivated team members.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,664
There are lots of ways to motivate people,

6
00:00:18,664 --> 00:00:19,093
of course,

7
00:00:19,093 --> 00:00:23,719
but I'm going to focus on the three earlier modules and

8
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:26,950
how they relate to team motivation.

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,950
Connect team members with your company's business.

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,617
People want to feel that they're part of something bigger than

11
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:38,796
themselves and one of the best ways for workers to experience

12
00:00:38,796 --> 00:00:43,450
this feeling is to understand and feel personally connected with

13
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,950
their organization's goals.

14
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,223
Like many managers you may not have explicitly articulated

15
00:00:48,223 --> 00:00:51,677
your goals or vision to your team members,

16
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:52,132
however,

17
00:00:52,132 --> 00:00:55,181
in my experience communicating the company's goals and

18
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:59,093
mapping your team's work to those goals is indeed a major

19
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:01,950
factor in keeping workers motivated.

20
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,367
Also,

21
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:06,117
employees who are committed to the organization's goals are

22
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:09,677
more likely to stay in their current position.

23
00:01:09,677 --> 00:01:14,950
This means lower turnover rates, higher employee satisfaction,

24
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,950
and ultimately higher productivity.

25
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,412
In an earlier module, aligning IT to the business,

26
00:01:22,412 --> 00:01:26,642
I provided you a step by step approach for aligning your

27
00:01:26,642 --> 00:01:28,950
work with the company's business goals.

28
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,950
This will not only ensure your team is working on the right things,

29
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,950
but also as a side benefit, actually increase your team's motivation.

30
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,642
Next, connect with the customer.

31
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:44,950
There are two key items to discuss here.

32
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,617
One is if you do align your work to the business in a thoughtful

33
00:01:49,617 --> 00:01:52,350
and organized approach as I have detailed,

34
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,950
your customers will absolutely love and appreciate your efforts,

35
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,950
no doubt in my mind.

36
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,950
Secondly, managing your customer's expectations as we detailed,

37
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,950
will bring you and your team closer,

38
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,586
that is you will be more connected with your customer.

39
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:12,950
So in an earlier module, managing customer expectations,

40
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,950
I provided you a step by step approach for managing your customer's

41
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,950
expectations and using the customer service grid technique for determining

42
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,950
your customer service shortfalls and correcting them.

43
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,033
Next, connect with team members.

44
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:32,181
There are many ways to connect and interrelate with your team,

45
00:02:32,181 --> 00:02:35,575
in fact, please check out one of my other courses,

46
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:39,950
Leadership and Communication Skills for Software Engineers,

47
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,412
where I talk about several topics that will create

48
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:45,335
a cohesive and motivated team.

49
00:02:45,335 --> 00:02:46,873
But in this course,

50
00:02:46,873 --> 00:02:50,450
the third element so far is providing training and

51
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,950
learning opportunities for your team.

52
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,488
Typically learning new things is a great motivator.

53
00:02:56,488 --> 00:03:01,873
Showing that you have a process that you follow to review the business drivers,

54
00:03:01,873 --> 00:03:04,181
look at the long term trends,

55
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:10,950
and also look to see what their personal skill interests are for each member.

56
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,950
This shows that you care for your team members and care about the business too.

57
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,283
Very professional indeed.

58
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:22,223
Team members who are given opportunities for professional growth are more

59
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:25,950
likely to report a strong commitment to their organization,

60
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,719
at the same time as they gain new skills and knowledge,

61
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:35,021
they are more likely to use those skills to their own benefit as well.

62
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:39,350
So in this module I provided you a step by step approach

63
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,550
for determining the skills you require and putting

64
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:50,000
together the plan to accomplish it. Okay, let's summarize this module.
