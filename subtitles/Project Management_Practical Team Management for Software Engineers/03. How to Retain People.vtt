00:00:00.724 --> 00:00:03.724
Here are some ideas on how to retain people.

2
00:00:03.724 --> 00:00:07.724
Now there is stuff, as I call it, not in your control.

3
00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:11.109
Life happens and people may leave for all sorts of reasons,

4
00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:14.224
and some very good, for example, family,

5
00:00:14.224 --> 00:00:17.109
a spouse's new opportunity, personal growth,

6
00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:18.647
those you can't control.

7
00:00:18.647 --> 00:00:22.613
But what you don't want is people leaving because of

8
00:00:22.613 --> 00:00:25.724
you and what is in your control.

9
00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:28.906
Also regarding promotions and salary and benefits,

10
00:00:28.906 --> 00:00:32.153
that also may not totally be in your control,

11
00:00:32.153 --> 00:00:35.724
but find out what influence you have in those areas so you can

12
00:00:35.724 --> 00:00:37.724
use them as tools to be more successful.

13
00:00:37.724 --> 00:00:43.724
So talk to your manager or human resources and find out more about those ideas.

14
00:00:43.724 --> 00:00:48.124
Now if you can align your IT activities to the business then people will

15
00:00:48.124 --> 00:00:51.724
feel more connected to the business and their job.

16
00:00:51.724 --> 00:00:54.724
This will create better motivation and passion and therefore people

17
00:00:54.724 --> 00:00:58.724
like to hang around and you'll retain more people.

18
00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:01.724
If you can successfully manage customer expectations you will have a

19
00:01:01.724 --> 00:01:05.724
better relationship between your customers and your team.

20
00:01:05.724 --> 00:01:08.997
People will feel appreciated for their efforts and they

21
00:01:08.997 --> 00:01:10.647
will stay and hang around longer.

22
00:01:10.647 --> 00:01:11.801
You can build team skills,

23
00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:15.502
your team will feel that they are improving their

24
00:01:15.502 --> 00:01:17.724
capabilities and growing professionally.

25
00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:22.724
All of the last three items will go a long way to retaining your team.

26
00:01:22.724 --> 00:01:26.724
Performance reviews, these allow people to know where they stand.

27
00:01:26.724 --> 00:01:28.647
If they are not sure,

28
00:01:28.647 --> 00:01:33.542
some might think they are viewed more negatively and might consider leaving.

29
00:01:33.542 --> 00:01:35.815
Also, as we have discussed,

30
00:01:35.815 --> 00:01:40.224
performance reviews also focus on professional improvement and training,

31
00:01:40.224 --> 00:01:44.391
typically we are always excited to do and learn new things,

32
00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:45.724
also good for retention.

33
00:01:45.724 --> 00:01:48.493
But don't forget about one on one, that is,

34
00:01:48.493 --> 00:01:51.542
talking with each person and more importantly listening.

35
00:01:51.542 --> 00:01:54.724
Most people tend to talk too much.

36
00:01:54.724 --> 00:01:56.542
I'm guilty of that too.

37
00:01:56.542 --> 00:01:58.724
So just try and listen more.

38
00:01:58.724 --> 00:02:00.057
And lo and behold,

39
00:02:00.057 --> 00:02:04.324
you will learn something new about a person that can help in

40
00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:06.724
nurturing and coaching of that person.

41
00:02:06.724 --> 00:02:08.224
And ask them what's frustrating them about their job,

42
00:02:08.224 --> 00:02:12.186
what they want to be doing, but aren't getting to do it.

43
00:02:12.186 --> 00:02:15.057
Be friendly, but blunt and honest as well.

44
00:02:15.057 --> 00:02:18.224
You need to understand what makes people tick and

45
00:02:18.224 --> 00:02:22.724
see if you can accommodate them, sometimes you can't.

46
00:02:22.724 --> 00:02:27.724
Now let's talk about a few more items about how to retain people.

47
00:02:27.724 --> 00:02:31.724
Here are some ideas on how to improve retention.

48
00:02:31.724 --> 00:02:33.057
Hire the right people.

49
00:02:33.057 --> 00:02:37.262
The best way to ensure employees don't leave is to make sure you

50
00:02:37.262 --> 00:02:39.724
are hiring the right employees to begin with.

51
00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:42.032
And as we've talked, define the role or roles clearly,

52
00:02:42.032 --> 00:02:44.153
both to yourself and to the candidates,

53
00:02:44.153 --> 00:02:47.724
and then be absolutely sure the candidate is a fit,

54
00:02:47.724 --> 00:02:51.109
not only for it, the role, but for your company's culture,

55
00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.339
for your department's culture.

56
00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:58.955
As we will see in this module, I have many ideas on how to hire the right people.

57
00:02:58.955 --> 00:03:01.724
Next, fire people who don't fit.

58
00:03:01.724 --> 00:03:03.724
Sometimes even when you follow the advice above,

59
00:03:03.724 --> 00:03:08.360
you'll get an employee who, no matter what you try to do,

60
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.724
just doesn't fit.

61
00:03:09.724 --> 00:03:12.724
Firing someone can be difficult and challenging to do,

62
00:03:12.724 --> 00:03:15.474
so please seek the counsel of your manager and human

63
00:03:15.474 --> 00:03:17.647
resources for the best course of action.

64
00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:23.795
But it will incumbent on you to begin taking the necessary action or actions.

65
00:03:23.795 --> 00:03:28.168
The pain of living with a bad fit will be greater and

66
00:03:28.168 --> 00:03:31.724
exceed the pain of removing them, trust me.

67
00:03:31.724 --> 00:03:35.570
Also when coworkers see others who are not a good

68
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.724
fit and maybe incompetent even, they themselves may consider leaving.

69
00:03:40.724 --> 00:03:43.524
Recognize and reward employees.

70
00:03:43.524 --> 00:03:50.391
Show your employees they are valued and appreciated by offering them immediate

71
00:03:50.391 --> 00:03:54.224
recognition that praises their successes and their hard work.

72
00:03:54.224 --> 00:03:58.724
Make it a specific and tangible reward and you too

73
00:03:58.724 --> 00:04:01.724
will be rewarded with their loyalty.

74
00:04:01.724 --> 00:04:02.974
Be flexible.

75
00:04:02.974 --> 00:04:05.474
Today's employees, especially millennials,

76
00:04:05.474 --> 00:04:09.724
really appreciate a flexible life and work balance,

77
00:04:09.724 --> 00:04:12.724
as I think we all do.

78
00:04:12.724 --> 00:04:14.807
Now this impacts retention directly.

79
00:04:14.807 --> 00:04:15.641
In fact,

80
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:20.295
a boss in College Center for Work and Family Study found

81
00:04:20.295 --> 00:04:23.724
that 76% of managers and 80% of employees,

82
00:04:23.724 --> 00:04:24.924
almost the same,

83
00:04:24.924 --> 00:04:28.974
indicated that flexible work arrangements had positive effects on retention.

84
00:04:28.974 --> 00:04:32.997
Again, you may not have this option in your company,

85
00:04:32.997 --> 00:04:37.542
so seek the advice from your manager and human resources to see if you can

86
00:04:37.542 --> 00:04:41.280
offer employees flexibility around work hours and locations.

87
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.724
Next, enable opportunities for development and growth.

88
00:04:46.724 --> 00:04:48.724
We've talked about that before with training.

89
00:04:48.724 --> 00:04:52.724
Employees place a huge value on opportunities for growth.

90
00:04:52.724 --> 00:04:55.924
There is a strong connection between lack of

91
00:04:55.924 --> 00:04:57.815
development opportunity and higher turnover.

92
00:04:57.815 --> 00:04:59.997
If you aren't developing your employees,

93
00:04:59.997 --> 00:05:04.724
then you aren't investing in them, and if you're not investing in them,

94
00:05:04.724 --> 00:05:07.724
why should they stay with you?

95
00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:09.724
Demonstrate and cultivate respect.

96
00:05:09.724 --> 00:05:13.724
Don't discount respect when it comes to creating a solid team.

97
00:05:13.724 --> 00:05:17.057
Find ways to cultivate and nurture respect in your workplace

98
00:05:17.057 --> 00:05:20.906
and it'll pay off in higher retention.

99
00:05:20.906 --> 00:05:24.724
And finally, provide an inclusive environment,

100
00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:25.339
you know,

101
00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:29.724
one key factor in employee engagement and happiness seems to be if you can

102
00:05:29.724 --> 00:05:33.724
provide them with a sense of purpose and meaning in their work,

103
00:05:33.724 --> 00:05:34.339
for example,

104
00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:38.647
we have done this through aligning our work to the business so that people

105
00:05:38.647 --> 00:05:41.724
when they do their work feel connected to the business.

106
00:05:41.724 --> 00:05:45.391
And also working closely with the customer as a team and

107
00:05:45.391 --> 00:05:47.088
managing those customer expectations.

108
00:05:47.088 --> 00:05:51.557
Both of those will really help in providing that

109
00:05:51.557 --> 00:05:55.724
inclusive environment for your team.

110
00:05:55.724 --> 00:06:01.179
Now here is a quote, "people leave managers, not companies.

111
00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:03.724
" And who says this?

112
00:06:03.724 --> 00:06:04.724
Experienced managers.

113
00:06:04.724 --> 00:06:16.000
So as you embark on a new chapter in your career, please keep this in mind. Okay, now let's find the right talent for your organization when you need to.
