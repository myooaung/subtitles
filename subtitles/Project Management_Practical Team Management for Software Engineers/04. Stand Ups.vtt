00:00:01.002 --> 00:00:04.431
Alright stand ups, so what's a stand up?

2
00:00:04.431 --> 00:00:08.288
It is a quick, informal discussion with a small team or group,

3
00:00:08.288 --> 00:00:12.189
some may call it a morning role call or even a daily scrum.

4
00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:17.002
Its purpose is to get real time feedback from the team,

5
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:22.002
to bring up any issues early in order to avoid bigger problems downstream,

6
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:27.002
and to get a pulse or a feeling of the health of the team.

7
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:28.820
Its benefits are many.

8
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.002
I believe this creates synergy, improved teamwork,

9
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:37.002
and ensures a focus on the right things are getting done for that day.

10
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:41.002
Now let's talk about Michael's standup 3 P's.

11
00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:44.079
Basically for the stand ups you're just going to be,

12
00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.002
well, standing up, and maybe it's over by a white board,

13
00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:49.002
it could even be in a conference room,

14
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:53.002
but I prefer not because I don't want people sitting down.

15
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:57.002
Alright so for Michael's 3 P's, it's Progress, Plans, and Problems.

16
00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:57.925
The first, progress.

17
00:00:57.925 --> 00:00:59.771
So you go around the room,

18
00:00:59.771 --> 00:01:03.310
maybe one day start from the left and one day start from the right,

19
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.002
make it random,

20
00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:08.002
and the person would say - hey this is what I've done since we last met,

21
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:13.002
which might be the day before, and they just talk about what they've done,

22
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:13.859
what is their progress.

23
00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:16.911
And next the same person would say - here are my plans,

24
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:21.002
here are the things I'm going to do today.

25
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:24.002
And everyone listens and they might have a few questions.

26
00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:27.002
If the questions are big or complex, you will take them off line,

27
00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:29.145
maybe with a follow up meeting.

28
00:01:29.145 --> 00:01:32.002
But they're here to discuss what they've done,

29
00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:34.402
what they're going to do and seeing if there's any issues that

30
00:01:34.402 --> 00:01:37.502
you may have or other team members might have.

31
00:01:37.502 --> 00:01:40.002
And the third P is problems.

32
00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:41.848
We want to bring issues and obstacles up,

33
00:01:41.848 --> 00:01:43.464
what are the blockers that I've encountered?

34
00:01:43.464 --> 00:01:47.002
Hey I'm stuck on this SQL proc and I need help trying to fix it.

35
00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:48.002
Oh, hey okay Joe,

36
00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:51.387
why don't you jump in and help him when we're done with the meeting.

37
00:01:51.387 --> 00:01:53.802
You really want to get the problems out too,

38
00:01:53.802 --> 00:01:57.002
that's really important because problems are typically blockers,

39
00:01:57.002 --> 00:02:01.617
they're things that are slowing up the work and you want to

40
00:02:01.617 --> 00:02:04.002
prevent anything from slowing up the work.

41
00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:06.002
Next though, of course, is logistics.

42
00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:07.669
Like what's the frequency?

43
00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:11.002
Well maybe every day, maybe every other day,

44
00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:15.002
and maybe it's by project, by team, you can decide that.

45
00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:17.814
The duration, I like to keep them pretty quick,

46
00:02:17.814 --> 00:02:20.573
you know, 5 to 10 minutes tops if possible.

47
00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:24.771
Location, again, kind of a quiet area, you don't want to disrupt other people,

48
00:02:24.771 --> 00:02:29.002
maybe over by a whiteboard or maybe in a conference room

49
00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:33.002
or maybe over in your office even, something like that.

50
00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:33.573
And who goes first.

51
00:02:33.573 --> 00:02:36.457
Of course, I like to make it random, don't always pick the same person.

52
00:02:36.457 --> 00:02:39.002
You might even go first for yourself.

53
00:02:39.002 --> 00:02:41.573
Now when everyone breaks up and goes back to their work area,

54
00:02:41.573 --> 00:02:43.335
I think they feel more connected,

55
00:02:43.335 --> 00:02:46.802
they feel they know what they're purpose is for the day,

56
00:02:46.802 --> 00:02:48.402
and what they have to do.

57
00:02:48.402 --> 00:02:51.387
They know the priorities of what they are doing and they know

58
00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:54.820
about a couple of problems or blockers that they might need to

59
00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.000
solve or help others to solve. To me this is gold.
