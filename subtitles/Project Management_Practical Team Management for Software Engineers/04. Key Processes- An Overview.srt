00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,120
In this section I have outlined several processes that I believe you

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,720
will likely need to jump start your team's activities.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,920
Maybe you only need some of these and maybe you need

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,720
others that are not listed herein.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,720
No worries, do what you have to do.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,863
I have given you a template approach in the previous

7
00:00:17,863 --> 00:00:20,387
section on how to manage your processes.

8
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:23,720
Okay, let's see what they are.

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,720
Okay here are 10 key processes to jumpstart your team.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,506
Don't forget about the other four I mentioned at the beginning of this

11
00:00:29,506 --> 00:00:33,720
module that relate to the four other module topics.

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,942
Okay the first is work intake, requirements analysis,

13
00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:45,220
estimation, design and architecture, construction,

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:51,470
user acceptance testing, promotion to production,

15
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,970
application maintenance, operational support,

16
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,320
and lastly project management.

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,951
I have shown this process underneath for supporting all of the others

18
00:01:00,951 --> 00:01:05,175
since many times you will want a project structured to own and manage

19
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:07,720
the activities shown in the other boxes.

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:14,720
Now each of these could easily be a complete class or course in their own right.

21
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,720
And in fact, three are.

22
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,220
Requirements analysis, estimation, and project management.

23
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,720
I have three Pluralsight courses on each of those three topics,

24
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,000
and I'll talk about those a little bit later as well. Okay, let's get started.
