00:00:01.072 --> 00:00:03.885
Now that we have set up a functional structure,

2
00:00:03.885 --> 00:00:07.405
we now what to layout our roles and responsibilities to

3
00:00:07.405 --> 00:00:10.072
provide more clarity to the team.

4
00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:15.072
Let's explore this in this section.

5
00:00:15.072 --> 00:00:15.890
Roles and responsibilities.

6
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.858
So now that you have a draft structure of your group or team,

7
00:00:19.858 --> 00:00:23.072
now you want to layout the roles and responsibilities

8
00:00:23.072 --> 00:00:26.345
within the context of your structure.

9
00:00:26.345 --> 00:00:32.149
A role is a description of what someone generally does in your team,

10
00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.322
someone may wear many hats and do a variety of things,

11
00:00:36.322 --> 00:00:42.799
so try and make the roles what they generally do in the course of the day.

12
00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:45.072
And for example, database administrator,

13
00:00:45.072 --> 00:00:49.303
a responsibility is a duty or collection of duties that a

14
00:00:49.303 --> 00:00:52.226
person does in the course of doing one's job.

15
00:00:52.226 --> 00:00:55.072
And again an example, the role is database administrator,

16
00:00:55.072 --> 00:00:58.572
but one of the duties would be doing database backups.

17
00:00:58.572 --> 00:01:01.072
I'll have more examples later.

18
00:01:01.072 --> 00:01:05.918
It is imperative that you define all of the roles and responsibilities

19
00:01:05.918 --> 00:01:09.501
that are required to fulfill your mission as manager.

20
00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:13.072
Let's look at some examples.

21
00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:14.501
Roles do not equal people.

22
00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:20.822
Remember a role is a function or part played by a person in your team.

23
00:01:20.822 --> 00:01:27.072
Now that does not equal a person named John Smith.

24
00:01:27.072 --> 00:01:32.072
A role may be fulfilled by a part or whole person or several people.

25
00:01:32.072 --> 00:01:36.072
And also a person may perform one or more roles.

26
00:01:36.072 --> 00:01:39.805
It is quite common for many people to associate a role with a single

27
00:01:39.805 --> 00:01:43.501
person and a single person with a single role.

28
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:46.072
We want to be very flexible.

29
00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:50.072
We may have several roles that are required to get our job done,

30
00:01:50.072 --> 00:01:53.501
and we may have several people that will have one or more

31
00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:56.380
role capabilities in each of those people.

32
00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.072
And you can then map those people skills and capabilities to the roles required.

33
00:02:02.072 --> 00:02:07.072
So it's a much more flexible approach and a cleaner way of thinking of things.

34
00:02:07.072 --> 00:02:09.072
Sometimes people will say, oh I need a new database administrator,

35
00:02:09.072 --> 00:02:10.786
oh I need another head count.

36
00:02:10.786 --> 00:02:14.610
No, maybe I train someone and they do database administration part time.

37
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.929
I still need the role, I may not need a full person.

38
00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:22.527
On the other hand, I may have so much database administration work,

39
00:02:22.527 --> 00:02:27.072
I may need three people to fulfill that single role.

40
00:02:27.072 --> 00:02:29.672
I think that's important to point out because you're going to have a

41
00:02:29.672 --> 00:02:34.072
small team and probably more roles than people.

42
00:02:34.072 --> 00:02:35.457
Here are some examples of roles,

43
00:02:35.457 --> 00:02:39.405
some very common ones that I'm sure you have seen.

44
00:02:39.405 --> 00:02:43.294
Business analyst, senior software engineer,

45
00:02:43.294 --> 00:02:45.890
database administrator, very common ones.

46
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.072
Business analyst do an analysis and design,

47
00:02:49.072 --> 00:02:52.822
senior software engineer likely writing software,

48
00:02:52.822 --> 00:02:55.572
writing code, and database administrator,

49
00:02:55.572 --> 00:02:57.072
administering your databases.

50
00:02:57.072 --> 00:03:04.072
A few more, customer manager, product manager, and service manager.

51
00:03:04.072 --> 00:03:09.072
Maybe those are roles that you may not have expected in your new team possibly.

52
00:03:09.072 --> 00:03:12.405
Notice the first three are looking more inward,

53
00:03:12.405 --> 00:03:16.190
in other words, they're all about you and your team,

54
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.072
they make sense to you and the work your team does,

55
00:03:20.072 --> 00:03:24.072
but may make no sense at all to your customer.

56
00:03:24.072 --> 00:03:27.072
The next three are a little more customer focused.

57
00:03:27.072 --> 00:03:28.272
They're more outward looking.

58
00:03:28.272 --> 00:03:31.322
These roles would be more recognizable by your customers.

59
00:03:31.322 --> 00:03:36.708
For example, I'm the product manager for the sales support application CRM,

60
00:03:36.708 --> 00:03:41.072
that title may resonate more with the customer.

61
00:03:41.072 --> 00:03:43.610
So for those people in your team that may spend more

62
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.572
time literally with the customer,

63
00:03:45.572 --> 00:03:51.572
I might suggest role names such as customer manager or service manager.

64
00:03:51.572 --> 00:03:56.822
Those that may have less interface with your customers and your users,

65
00:03:56.822 --> 00:03:58.822
maybe they have the roles of business analyst,

66
00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:03.072
senior software engineer, database administrator.

67
00:04:03.072 --> 00:04:06.764
Now I've defined roles are not equal people,

68
00:04:06.764 --> 00:04:12.072
so many times I have dual roles for the people in my organization.

69
00:04:12.072 --> 00:04:15.890
I have principle software engineer, for example,

70
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.786
a very senior lead, technical expert engineer,

71
00:04:19.786 --> 00:04:28.072
and at the same time I have him as project manager or customer account manager,

72
00:04:28.072 --> 00:04:31.072
based on the roles they're playing.

73
00:04:31.072 --> 00:04:35.872
So I like to have the roles fully defined and I may

74
00:04:35.872 --> 00:04:40.672
assign multiple roles as is typically, in my case,

75
00:04:40.672 --> 00:04:43.072
to a single person.

76
00:04:43.072 --> 00:04:45.429
Here are some samples of duties your team members may do,

77
00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:51.405
and in particular for the role senior software engineer.

78
00:04:51.405 --> 00:04:58.272
Analyze business problems, develop in both VB and C# fluently,

79
00:04:58.272 --> 00:05:02.405
design relational databases, provide technical leadership,

80
00:05:02.405 --> 00:05:08.163
perform business analysis, create and implement test plans,

81
00:05:08.163 --> 00:05:13.995
perform unit and integrated testing, meet or exceed estimates and schedules.

82
00:05:13.995 --> 00:05:19.072
Now this is just a short list, yours may be longer.

83
00:05:19.072 --> 00:05:21.215
I like a little more granularity and clarity to help

84
00:05:21.215 --> 00:05:23.322
people know what is expected of them.

85
00:05:23.322 --> 00:05:30.197
Now don't forget, you must keep this list up-to-date and evolve with the times.

86
00:05:30.197 --> 00:05:32.072
Now here's quote.

87
00:05:32.072 --> 00:05:36.358
"Divide responsibility and nobody is responsible.

88
00:05:36.358 --> 00:05:41.358
" This is a very good and insightful quote by Mr.

89
00:05:41.358 --> 00:05:41.786
W.

90
00:05:41.786 --> 00:05:44.163
Deming, a renowned business management guru.

91
00:05:44.163 --> 00:05:48.322
This is not to mean teamwork is bad, quite the contrary.

92
00:05:48.322 --> 00:05:52.872
This means always put someone in charge and responsible for things

93
00:05:52.872 --> 00:05:56.072
and then build your team around that person.

94
00:05:56.072 --> 00:06:01.072
For example, you and only you are responsible for your new team of five.

95
00:06:01.072 --> 00:06:06.072
What I mean by that is your customers and your manager are looking to you,

96
00:06:06.072 --> 00:06:08.643
and if you don't agree with me, think of it this way,

97
00:06:08.643 --> 00:06:11.358
if something does not get done or not performed to

98
00:06:11.358 --> 00:06:18.000
the level expected by the customer, would you blame a team member? I wouldn't.
