1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,327
Step 3, conduct face to face interviews.

2
00:00:03,327 --> 00:00:06,660
Now based on the candidates that passed your phone interview,

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,160
you can now schedule them to come into your office.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,160
You might need to coordinate schedules with not

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,641
only yourself and the interviewee,

6
00:00:12,641 --> 00:00:17,410
but also one or more of your team members if you want them involved as well,

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,410
and I recommend that you do that.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,160
The goal of the in person interview,

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,077
do they meet your requirements that you put together to join the team?

10
00:00:25,077 --> 00:00:29,632
If so, they will then move on to the final selection list.

11
00:00:29,632 --> 00:00:31,410
Alright, prepare interview questions.

12
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,160
Have a prepared list of questions based on the

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,410
requirements we wrote in the previous section,

14
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,410
you can prepare your list of written questions.

15
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:44,410
Here is your verbal and interpersonal skills will come in handy.

16
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,410
Your job is to ask questions to get them talking.

17
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,810
For now, I am focusing on the overall process,

18
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:49,610
my six steps,

19
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,743
but in the section following this section I will dive much

20
00:00:53,743 --> 00:00:57,077
deeper into the questions themselves and help you design

21
00:00:57,077 --> 00:00:58,410
and write those questions.

22
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,410
Write two or three questions per requirement.

23
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,948
If you have a hard time writing questions then maybe

24
00:01:02,948 --> 00:01:04,564
you're not sure about the requirements.

25
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,487
Now this does take time,

26
00:01:06,487 --> 00:01:13,410
but after you do this you will have a repository of questions to use and reuse.

27
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,473
So take a look at the demo file for this section,

28
00:01:15,473 --> 00:01:17,610
I have included a ton of sample questions.

29
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,410
Not all questions need to be asked.

30
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,410
The list is just your superset of questions.

31
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,696
You might find that after asking a question,

32
00:01:25,696 --> 00:01:29,077
a new one just pops into your head, so just ask it.

33
00:01:29,077 --> 00:01:34,077
You might want to take a note of it so you can add it to

34
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:37,410
your list for the next interviewee.

35
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,641
Provide a written test.

36
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:41,910
Now for in person interview we provide a written technical

37
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,410
test in addition to the normal interview.

38
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:50,410
This allows us to have an objective score based on their answers.

39
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,683
We also score on soft skills, such as teamwork,

40
00:01:53,683 --> 00:01:56,683
personality, attitude, motivation, and things like that.

41
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,410
Now those items are certainly subjective.

42
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,410
Document your rating.

43
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,410
Always document their answers and how you rated them.

44
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,410
Check with your manager or HR for any guidelines.

45
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,410
If HR does not require you to document, please, please do it anyway.

46
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,046
These results contain valuable information that you will help you

47
00:02:15,046 --> 00:02:19,410
pick the best candidate in the following steps.

48
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,610
Try not to be too clinical.

49
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,102
In other words, they may not get the exact right answer and that might be fine.

50
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:28,910
Some I score either correct or partially correct or

51
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,410
just write down close enough.

52
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,410
Remember, not knowing some things is sometimes not that bad.

53
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:35,660
Instead,

54
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,410
someone who knows how to find the right answers and solutions may be

55
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,410
the more practical and meaningful person to hire.

56
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,827
Prefer one on one first, that is I prefer to do the one on one interview first.

57
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:53,410
Why waste the team's time if the candidate doesn't work out?

58
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,351
Plus if the person just is not a fit at all,

59
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:57,564
then again, I don't want to waste everyone's time.

60
00:02:57,564 --> 00:03:01,410
I like to set the stage, make them feel comfortable,

61
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,839
and not just throw them in a room full of people to

62
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,210
start hammering questions away at.

63
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,877
So I prefer to do the one to one first,

64
00:03:08,877 --> 00:03:11,228
make sure everyone's fine and comfortable,

65
00:03:11,228 --> 00:03:15,102
look for any weird signs or whatever that might say,

66
00:03:15,102 --> 00:03:17,410
hey I don't even want to go with this person.

67
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,410
After that short interview, off they go for the team interview.

68
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,410
After the team interview I like them to come back and I'll talk to them

69
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,410
again and get their feedback and see how things have done.

70
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,641
Next, the team interviews.

71
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:32,077
If the person passes my first what I call quicky interview,

72
00:03:32,077 --> 00:03:34,410
I will pass them to the team.

73
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,660
I usually do not participate in that session and delegate my trust to my team.

74
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,501
The team appreciates that and will have more ownership in the selection process,

75
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:47,228
which is very important downstream if that person comes on

76
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:49,410
board and they're going to work with them.

77
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,410
When done with the interviewing I want to review the results with my team.

78
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,481
After the interview,

79
00:03:54,481 --> 00:03:58,053
I get with the team or sub-team that did the

80
00:03:58,053 --> 00:03:59,839
interviewing together for a debriefing.

81
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:06,188
At this point you are only looking for two things, are they in or out?

82
00:04:06,188 --> 00:04:08,410
No ranking yet please.

83
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:13,410
Are they a potential new hire candidate or are they just tossed out of the list?

84
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,592
Again, make sure everything is documented,

85
00:04:15,592 --> 00:04:18,948
this enables a better outcome and may prevent lawsuits,

86
00:04:18,948 --> 00:04:20,102
you never know.

87
00:04:20,102 --> 00:04:24,410
Okay so outcome of this step is a list of qualified

88
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,410
candidates that you might hire.

89
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,410
By the way, if you want some guidance on interviewing skills and approaches,

90
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,410
please check out another one of my classes called Leadership and

91
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:42,000
Communication Skills for Software Engineers. Okay let's go on to the next step.
