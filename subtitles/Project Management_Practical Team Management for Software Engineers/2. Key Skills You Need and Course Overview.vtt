00:00:02.292 --> 00:00:05.292
The first is leadership and communication skills.

2
00:00:05.292 --> 00:00:08.403
These would include verbal skills, written skills,

3
00:00:08.403 --> 00:00:09.935
interpersonal skills, and leadership skills.

4
00:00:09.935 --> 00:00:10.792
And by the way,

5
00:00:10.792 --> 00:00:15.292
all of those are covered in one of my other courses titled Leadership

6
00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:17.892
and Communication Skills for Software Engineers,

7
00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:20.292
so you might want to check that out.

8
00:00:20.292 --> 00:00:26.181
The other key skill group is what I'm calling practical team management skills,

9
00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:33.292
which is what this course is all about.

10
00:00:33.292 --> 00:00:37.292
The term practical is important and I would like to emphasize it here.

11
00:00:37.292 --> 00:00:41.907
This course is concerned with the actual doing or the use of

12
00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:44.792
something rather than theory and ideas.

13
00:00:44.792 --> 00:00:49.565
My approach and management style includes a very practical approach,

14
00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:53.677
keep your tools, processes, and approach to management simple,

15
00:00:53.677 --> 00:00:58.292
give it a try, inspect and adapt, and move forward.

16
00:00:58.292 --> 00:01:02.221
Think of this class also as a starter kit of tools,

17
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:06.019
processes and approaches to jump start or enhance your

18
00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:08.292
management role or leadership role.

19
00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:14.292
Now I'll give you a quick overview of this course.

20
00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:17.209
Here's a rundown of the course modules.

21
00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:20.446
The first: Aligning IT Activities to the Business.

22
00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:24.292
Everything you do should make a difference to the business.

23
00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:26.110
Next: Managing Customer Expectations.

24
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.565
Make sure what your team is doing is in alignment to what

25
00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:34.292
your customer thinks you are doing.

26
00:01:34.292 --> 00:01:36.292
Building Team Structure and Capabilities.

27
00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:40.754
A good manager and leader knows how to organize the team and is

28
00:01:40.754 --> 00:01:43.959
always improving their team's skills and capabilities.

29
00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.292
Acquiring the Right Talent.

30
00:01:47.292 --> 00:01:51.292
Team building is not just about building a team from the inside,

31
00:01:51.292 --> 00:01:56.292
but also from the outside through good hiring practices.

32
00:01:56.292 --> 00:01:57.892
Managing Through Effective Communication.

33
00:01:57.892 --> 00:02:02.292
To excel at being a manager you'll need good written

34
00:02:02.292 --> 00:02:04.292
and verbal communication skills.

35
00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:09.292
And lastly: Promoting Productivity Through Team Processes.

36
00:02:09.292 --> 00:02:13.292
In this module we will cover just how are you going to make software.

37
00:02:13.292 --> 00:02:19.000
Okay, so what brings you to this course? Let's see.
