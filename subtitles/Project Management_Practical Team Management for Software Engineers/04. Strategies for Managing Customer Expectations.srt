00:00:02,181 --> 00:00:05,817
The first step in meeting or even exceeding your customer's

2
00:00:05,817 --> 00:00:08,454
expectations is to know those expectations.

3
00:00:08,454 --> 00:00:14,181
So here's a collection of techniques and strategies you can use

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,181
to determine your customer's expectations.

5
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:23,181
Every single customer interaction is an opportunity to manage expectations,

6
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:25,806
every single one.

7
00:00:25,806 --> 00:00:30,181
Don't ever forget it, ever.

8
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:33,610
Whether it is a meeting, email, phone call,

9
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,181
et cetera, listen to your customer,

10
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:39,454
seek to understand and appreciate their thoughts and comments,

11
00:00:39,454 --> 00:00:44,726
and then discuss further to try and ensure you have the same

12
00:00:44,726 --> 00:00:47,848
expectations for the work that you're doing for them.

13
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:51,181
Also, you need to take the time to educate,

14
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:51,681
inform,

15
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:57,681
and even train your customers about what you do and how you do it so they have

16
00:00:57,681 --> 00:01:01,514
an appreciation of what you need to do to get the job done.

17
00:01:01,514 --> 00:01:05,714
The number one important take away from this entire

18
00:01:05,714 --> 00:01:08,514
module is this statement in front of you.

19
00:01:08,514 --> 00:01:10,514
So I will say it again,

20
00:01:10,514 --> 00:01:18,181
every single customer interaction is an opportunity to manage expectations.

21
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:26,000
So don't miss those opportunities that are so important to help you in your job. Okay now let's look at some strategies.
