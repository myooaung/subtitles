00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.836
Now we need to set priorities.

2
00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:03.144
Why?

3
00:00:03.144 --> 00:00:08.990
Because no IT team ever seems to have enough time or resources, of course.

4
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.276
And it so crucial to your success and your team's

5
00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:15.823
morale to have good solid priorities.

6
00:00:15.823 --> 00:00:19.990
So when you are out getting the business goals and

7
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.590
requirements from your customers,

8
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.865
you are also getting their priorities of their requirements and goals,

9
00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:26.990
don't forget that.

10
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.626
That is crucial.

11
00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:31.899
Priorities are so important to retrieve,

12
00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.535
figure out, understand,

13
00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:40.990
and help guide your team and your resources to successful conclusions.

14
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.445
They'll be times when you're going to be giving presentations to maybe your

15
00:00:44.445 --> 00:00:48.081
manager or your manager's manager or the influencers,

16
00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:51.490
such as the business leaders, steering groups,

17
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.990
business focal points, et cetera.

18
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.605
Just a little side bar here, remember,

19
00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:57.913
you're a manager now and you're leading a team,

20
00:00:57.913 --> 00:01:02.081
you're going to need to get out there and communicate and probably give

21
00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:04.990
lots more presentations than you've ever done before.

22
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.990
So let me tell you what executives do not want to see,

23
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.717
and what I mean by executives,

24
00:01:09.717 --> 00:01:12.990
those influencers that were higher up the food chain,

25
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.323
such as the business leaders, steering groups,

26
00:01:15.323 --> 00:01:15.990
et cetera.

27
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.590
They don't want to see this.

28
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.990
In fact, probably no one wants to see this.

29
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.461
Now again,

30
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:24.523
this may be a great tool at a low level for a project or something like that,

31
00:01:24.523 --> 00:01:25.857
that's great, use that tool,

32
00:01:25.857 --> 00:01:29.528
but they do not want to see this in terms of priorities and

33
00:01:29.528 --> 00:01:31.990
dependencies and if you can't see this slide,

34
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.990
that's the whole point, no one can see this slide.

35
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.990
So let me show you in the next couple slides just a very easy simple way

36
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.490
for executives or the senior people that influence your company to

37
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.081
understand the priorities and what your team is doing.

38
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:52.990
This is important.

39
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.836
So here's an example of prioritizing IT projects,

40
00:01:54.836 --> 00:01:57.990
and I'm first going to kind of give you the structure and

41
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.990
the approach that I'd like to follow.

42
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.605
So first I'm going to have priorities,

43
00:02:01.605 --> 00:02:05.990
here in this column will be Priority 1 projects or activities,

44
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.990
Priority 2 projects and activities, and then lastly Backlog,

45
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.144
all the other projects and activities that I'm not working on.

46
00:02:13.144 --> 00:02:16.605
We really don't need Priority 3, 4, 5, 6,

47
00:02:16.605 --> 00:02:19.990
because that's really irrelevant because we're so busy.

48
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.990
And as priority 1 projects or priority 2 projects kind of lighten up,

49
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.990
we'll go the backlog and move them forward.

50
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.204
Okay,

51
00:02:27.204 --> 00:02:30.879
then below that on the left are going to be where we list our IT

52
00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.990
projects or activities for each priority column.

53
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.990
So in the Priority 1 column there'll be all the projects and activities,

54
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.899
go here for that, Priority 2, same thing,

55
00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:41.990
and lastly Backlog.

56
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.990
The Backlog will probably have the longer list.

57
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.990
And remember, if you're into Agile and Scrum, it's always inspect and adapt.

58
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.990
So as priority 1 and 2 items get worked,

59
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.657
we're going to review the backlog list, work with the customers,

60
00:02:56.657 --> 00:02:58.990
and figure out which ones go where.

61
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.814
And how I do it in the shop is everyone's on priority 1,

62
00:03:02.814 --> 00:03:05.375
if you get stuck or you're waiting for some information,

63
00:03:05.375 --> 00:03:07.823
you drop into priority 2 and start working those.

64
00:03:07.823 --> 00:03:11.990
And usually between the two of those columns of activities,

65
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:21.000
you're team is pretty darn busy. So now let's go into a little more detail on how we're going to lay this out.
