00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.830
Now that the acquisition process is complete and we've

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.647
selected the person we want to hire,

3
00:00:04.647 --> 00:00:10.080
now we're excited to get them on board and as productive as fast as we can.

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.580
So here are some ideas.

5
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.180
I like to use a checklist,

6
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.195
so onboarding is the process by which we get someone on board,

7
00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:23.580
in the door and as productive as fast as possible.

8
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.830
Onboarding,

9
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.330
okay I'm not going to talk about any HR onboarding

10
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.580
process since every company has one, like getting a badge or where to sit,

11
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.723
and things like that.

12
00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:35.580
I want to focus on onboarding for the team itself.

13
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.080
Okay, first introductions.

14
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.580
Introduce your new hire to each person,

15
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.580
maybe in an all hands setting for quick departmental standup or one on ones.

16
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.080
Do not wait to do it later.

17
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.503
You want that person to feel immediately comfortable and welcome.

18
00:00:49.503 --> 00:00:53.125
Now I want you to go into your office or a conference,

19
00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:53.671
somewhere private,

20
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:57.580
and also then spend about an hour or two and go over the

21
00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.580
following topics with the new hire.

22
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.247
Okay first, business alignment.

23
00:01:01.247 --> 00:01:05.651
Go through your process of aligning your work to the business.

24
00:01:05.651 --> 00:01:10.780
Be sure you emphasize that your team is using IT effectively to achieve

25
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.580
business objectives that result in improved business outcomes,

26
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.980
that produce and support business value.

27
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.580
Go through your process and how you map everything to the

28
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.580
business and show your matrix of activities,

29
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.830
you know, remember, we had the priority 1 activities,

30
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.944
priority 2 activities, and your backlog.

31
00:01:27.944 --> 00:01:28.853
Next, customers.

32
00:01:28.853 --> 00:01:32.349
You want to discuss your current customer base,

33
00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:36.580
such as in this example, the sales portion of the business.

34
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.580
You want to ensure they understand exactly what the customers do

35
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.580
and how that contributes to the broader business.

36
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.380
Take the new person and introduce them to one or more customers if you can.

37
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.313
This will put a face on the customer and also your

38
00:01:49.313 --> 00:01:51.888
customer will better relate to your team,

39
00:01:51.888 --> 00:01:54.580
that is IT people are people too.

40
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.035
And lastly my mantra,

41
00:01:56.035 --> 00:01:59.580
every single customer interaction is an opportunity to manage expectations,

42
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.663
let that sink in for a moment and ask the new hire what they think that means,

43
00:02:05.663 --> 00:02:08.580
and have a good dialog around that.

44
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.580
Next, of course, is your structure.

45
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.657
Show the new person the structure as we illustrate in the last module and walk

46
00:02:14.657 --> 00:02:17.866
through all the roles and their associated responsibilities,

47
00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:19.580
all of them.

48
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.113
Give them a feel for the entire department, not just the role they'll be having.

49
00:02:23.113 --> 00:02:26.313
Now spend a little more time on the role or roles that

50
00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:28.398
they'll be playing and their responsibilities.

51
00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:33.705
Answer any questions and be sure they have a good grasp of what is expected of

52
00:02:33.705 --> 00:02:38.247
them and how they will be measured using performance reviews.

53
00:02:38.247 --> 00:02:39.580
Skill development.

54
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.580
Explain how important skill development is to the entire department,

55
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.294
not just for the new hire but for their customers in the entire

56
00:02:47.294 --> 00:02:51.580
company that benefit from the skills they'll learn.

57
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.035
Also emphasize that the technical skills are very important,

58
00:02:54.035 --> 00:02:59.580
but also communication, leadership and interpersonal skills are key.

59
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.195
Team processes,

60
00:03:00.195 --> 00:03:03.980
walk through each of the key processes that support the team and

61
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.580
how the new hire will fit into those processes.

62
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.580
This walk through of processes should be a Visio or PowerPoint or

63
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.125
something that is written and easily assessable,

64
00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:15.294
such as in SharePoint, for example.

65
00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:18.151
We will cover team processes in another module,

66
00:03:18.151 --> 00:03:22.780
but I want to make sure for right where I am now that this is part

67
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.580
of the checklist of what you want to talk about.

68
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.830
Also explain that you want and expect input into improving

69
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.580
those processes as a normal part of their job.

70
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.780
Their first assignment.

71
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.580
Okay, now and only now is it time to get to work.

72
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.580
Prepare their first assignment based on their current skill level,

73
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.413
experience and maturity, you may make the assignments appropriately for that.

74
00:03:46.413 --> 00:03:50.580
I like to make stretch assignments but keep them realistic.

75
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.349
Give them an expected estimate of the time you think it might

76
00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.965
take to do those and let them begin with some analysis to

77
00:03:56.965 --> 00:03:58.671
compare their estimate to yours.

78
00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:00.853
For example, here are 2 assignments,

79
00:04:00.853 --> 00:04:04.780
I think the first one is 8 hours and the next one is 24,

80
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.380
spend the next couple hours reviewing the assignments and what

81
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.723
estimates you think you need in order to accomplish.

82
00:04:11.723 --> 00:04:14.580
This would be a good assignment as well.

83
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.811
Mentors.

84
00:04:14.811 --> 00:04:18.380
Now that they have an assignment or two, where will they go for help?

85
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.580
It might be you or you can assign a mentor for each assignment.

86
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.580
This will give them a good feeling of support and they will know

87
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.580
it will be okay to bug or talk to someone.

88
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.118
I have seen many times people not doing any work since

89
00:04:33.118 --> 00:04:35.580
they were afraid of bugging someone.

90
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.580
In my shop, ask questions anytime you want,

91
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.580
we are a team and we are here to help each other.

92
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.151
Okay so our new hire has met the team,

93
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:49.294
understand how it fits into the broader company,

94
00:04:49.294 --> 00:04:51.580
and has their assignments.

95
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.580
Wonderful.

96
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.000
Congratulations. Alright now let's summarize this module.
