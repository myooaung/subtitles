1
00:00:01,858 --> 00:00:06,858
There is a demand for IT manager and team leaders in the market today.

2
00:00:06,858 --> 00:00:09,358
So with that growing demand,

3
00:00:09,358 --> 00:00:13,767
employment of computer and information systems managers is

4
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:18,858
projected to grow 15% between now and 2024.

5
00:00:18,858 --> 00:00:22,858
That is much faster than the average of all occupations.

6
00:00:22,858 --> 00:00:26,858
Demand for computer and information systems managers will grow as firms

7
00:00:26,858 --> 00:00:32,858
increasingly expand their business to digital platforms.

8
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:36,858
The median annual wage for computer and information

9
00:00:36,858 --> 00:00:41,676
systems managers was about $130, 000 last year,

10
00:00:41,676 --> 00:00:44,858
in 2015, that's pretty good.

11
00:00:44,858 --> 00:00:47,525
Companies that have realized that respected,

12
00:00:47,525 --> 00:00:52,040
well trained manager boost morale, and improve morale boosts retention,

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,458
well there you go, that's a cost savings as well.

14
00:00:55,458 --> 00:01:03,858
Now let's explore the value of a good manager to a company.

15
00:01:03,858 --> 00:01:07,858
I would like to end my overview with this thought provoking question,

16
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:10,550
what's the value of a good manager?

17
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,608
To you as a software engineer, you might say little or no value.

18
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:17,781
I have heard the chat at the water cooler about management.

19
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:22,858
Now what is the value of good management to a company?

20
00:01:22,858 --> 00:01:24,001
Well I say priceless.

21
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,715
If my key managers left me,

22
00:01:25,715 --> 00:01:28,676
I think my company would be greatly impacted and

23
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:30,858
would take me awhile to recover.

24
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:38,858
A great manager has enormous value, I've seen it, lived it, and breathed it.

25
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:40,572
Think about your own career for a moment,

26
00:01:40,572 --> 00:01:44,935
this is anecdotal, but I think people take jobs because they like the company,

27
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:49,858
but people leave the company because of the manager they work for.

28
00:01:49,858 --> 00:01:54,733
So don't be one of those managers and shoot from the hip,

29
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:59,287
start with a set of processes and tools in this course to get

30
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,858
your jump started quickly and on your way to becoming the most

31
00:02:01,858 --> 00:02:03,858
successful manager you can be.

32
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:09,000
What more can I say? Let's get started.
