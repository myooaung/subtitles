If as a manager you really don't like communicating with people,

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.580
well you're probably in the wrong job.

3
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.853
That is, a management job.

4
00:00:09.853 --> 00:00:15.853
So please remember the best managers always communicate.

5
00:00:15.853 --> 00:00:20.853
Gallup defines engaged employees as those who are involved in and

6
00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:23.853
enthusiastic about their work and workplace.

7
00:00:23.853 --> 00:00:29.853
And engaged employees are in fact productive and effective employees.

8
00:00:29.853 --> 00:00:34.853
Now let's see how engagement and communication are connected.

9
00:00:34.853 --> 00:00:38.453
Communication is often the basis of any healthy relationship,

10
00:00:38.453 --> 00:00:41.853
including the one between you as a manager and your team.

11
00:00:41.853 --> 00:00:45.853
So Gallup in its research has found that consistent communication,

12
00:00:45.853 --> 00:00:49.853
whether it occurs in person, over the phone or electronically,

13
00:00:49.853 --> 00:00:52.520
is related to higher employee engagement.

14
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.409
For example,

15
00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:58.853
employees who managers hold even just regular meetings with them are almost

16
00:00:58.853 --> 00:01:04.853
three times as likely to be engaged employees than those who have managers

17
00:01:04.853 --> 00:01:08.853
who do not hold regular meetings with them,

18
00:01:08.853 --> 00:01:11.853
as determined by a Gallup study.

19
00:01:11.853 --> 00:01:13.353
So great managers, such as yourself,

20
00:01:13.353 --> 00:01:16.853
will have the talent to motivate employees and build

21
00:01:16.853 --> 00:01:20.853
genuine and solid relationships with them.

22
00:01:20.853 --> 00:01:23.622
Those who are not well suited for the job will likely be

23
00:01:23.622 --> 00:01:26.253
uncomfortable with this soft aspect of management.

24
00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:31.742
The best managers understand that each person they manage is different,

25
00:01:31.742 --> 00:01:32.853
is unique.

26
00:01:32.853 --> 00:01:35.398
Each person has different successes and challenges,

27
00:01:35.398 --> 00:01:39.622
both at work and actually away from work as well.

28
00:01:39.622 --> 00:01:42.853
By knowing your employees first as people,

29
00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:46.853
managers can accommodate their employees uniqueness and diversity

30
00:01:46.853 --> 00:01:53.853
while leading their team toward higher productivity.

31
00:01:53.853 --> 00:01:56.853
