1
00:00:01,205 --> 00:00:04,205
Now let's map IT goals to the business goals.

2
00:00:04,205 --> 00:00:07,062
We're going to have the business goals on the left

3
00:00:07,062 --> 00:00:08,897
and the IT goals on the right.

4
00:00:08,897 --> 00:00:10,282
And remember from the previous slide,

5
00:00:10,282 --> 00:00:15,205
we had a goal from the business to increase revenue by 25%.

6
00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:18,282
So on further discussions with the customer we decided that

7
00:00:18,282 --> 00:00:23,872
we could also increase student sign-up by 15% and also

8
00:00:23,872 --> 00:00:27,205
increase corporate sign-up by 10%.

9
00:00:27,205 --> 00:00:29,455
So in our discussions we thought 15% for students,

10
00:00:29,455 --> 00:00:35,205
10% for corporate, maybe we'll achieve our revenue goal of 25%.

11
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:37,047
Notice the key goal was a 1.

12
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:39,416
0 and I made these underneath that as 1.

13
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:39,942
1, 1.

14
00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:41,634
2, just so they're like sub-goals.

15
00:00:41,634 --> 00:00:46,932
Then on the right I'm going to come up with what are my IT

16
00:00:46,932 --> 00:00:50,205
goals to achieve those business goals.

17
00:00:50,205 --> 00:00:54,205
So the first one I write is add 100 new courses to the on-line catalog.

18
00:00:54,205 --> 00:00:58,205
That might be a great way to entice more students to sign up.

19
00:00:58,205 --> 00:01:01,590
The next goal will be to enhance the Ecom portal to

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,455
support PayPal and multi-tender payments.

21
00:01:03,455 --> 00:01:04,288
You know,

22
00:01:04,288 --> 00:01:08,276
if we make it easier for students to spend their money or

23
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:11,705
for corporations to spend their money, we might also increase revenue.

24
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:17,436
And lastly, enable corporate account management from the admin portal.

25
00:01:17,436 --> 00:01:22,705
We to add more features for the admin portal so that the administration can do

26
00:01:22,705 --> 00:01:26,038
more things to increase and encourage corporate sign-ups.

27
00:01:26,038 --> 00:01:28,538
Now this is a simple example,

28
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:32,387
and then you could take it down different layers or maybe there's

29
00:01:32,387 --> 00:01:34,538
several other activities you'd like to have.

30
00:01:34,538 --> 00:01:38,205
I have a simple numbering system on the right as well.

31
00:01:38,205 --> 00:01:39,080
So 1.

32
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,518
1.

33
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:40,830
1 and 1.

34
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,268
1.

35
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:44,768
2 tie into the business goals of 1.

36
00:01:44,768 --> 00:01:45,205
1.

37
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,455
And the other IT goal, 1.

38
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:47,830
2.

39
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,830
1 ties into the business goal of 1.

40
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,205
2.

41
00:01:51,205 --> 00:01:53,491
So that way I can link everything up,

42
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:56,872
because remember in order to align everything to the business,

43
00:01:56,872 --> 00:02:01,405
I want all my activities to be transparently connected and

44
00:02:01,405 --> 00:02:06,205
linked to all business goals at all times.

45
00:02:06,205 --> 00:02:08,743
Now let's take it a step further and map our projects

46
00:02:08,743 --> 00:02:13,205
and activities to our IT goals.

47
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:19,205
Now let's map our IT project, activities, and goals to the IT goals.

48
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:19,405
Okay,

49
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,005
on the left I'm going to have the IT goals and on the

50
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:23,743
right IT projects and activities.

51
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:29,348
Now almost every IT group I've seen has a list of backlog items and projects,

52
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:34,072
which is great, but what I say - how does it map to the business?

53
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:36,205
Many times they say they are not sure.

54
00:02:36,205 --> 00:02:39,590
I truly believe that that answer is a major disconnect with

55
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,472
the business and now is a new important responsibility for

56
00:02:44,472 --> 00:02:48,205
you as a manager of your team.

57
00:02:48,205 --> 00:02:52,848
Okay, on the left - add 100 new courses to the on-line catalog,

58
00:02:52,848 --> 00:02:55,776
and on the right I'm going to launch two projects,

59
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:58,405
A and B, to satisfy that requirement.

60
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:03,955
Next, enhance the Ecom portal to support PayPal and multi-tender payments.

61
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:09,478
I'm going to have projects C, D, and E identify it to support that goal.

62
00:03:09,478 --> 00:03:14,872
Next, enable corporate account management from the admin portal.

63
00:03:14,872 --> 00:03:19,538
And on the right, operations task 25.

64
00:03:19,538 --> 00:03:21,538
3 and 25.

65
00:03:21,538 --> 00:03:22,205
4.

66
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:26,205
Now you've noticed I've mixed the term project and operations.

67
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:29,705
So before we jump into the next section on allocating resources and priorities,

68
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:37,205
let's talk about the differences between projects and operations.

69
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:38,705
Projects versus operations,

70
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:43,205
I characterize project activities quite differently from operational activities.

71
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:47,128
This module lends itself to the former where the

72
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:49,051
business is driving project activities,

73
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:51,919
but at times some activities may not be full on projects,

74
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,841
but just flow into the routine operational activities process.

75
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:59,205
So let's talk about the attributes of each.

76
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,705
I'm going to have project attributes on the left and

77
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:03,660
operation space attributes on the right.

78
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:08,205
First the projects, they tend to propel the company forward.

79
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:10,872
They have management's focus,

80
00:04:10,872 --> 00:04:15,205
management's keenly interested in what they're going to accomplish.

81
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:20,205
Typically they may drive new revenues, they may drive new services,

82
00:04:20,205 --> 00:04:22,705
they may drive new cost containment,

83
00:04:22,705 --> 00:04:26,296
and also drive things to improve customer service.

84
00:04:26,296 --> 00:04:33,513
Now on the right are the operations, the activities that are more day to day,

85
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:37,105
functions of the business that just happen day to day.

86
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:39,205
Keeping the lights on, if you will.

87
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:41,205
Kind of like a utility company.

88
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:45,348
And typically they're tracked in an issue tracking system.

89
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:48,205
Okay, so somewhat different.

90
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,205
Projects will have a beginning and an end,

91
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:52,872
they'll usually have budgets of focus, things to accomplish,

92
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:55,205
and on the right will be operations,

93
00:04:55,205 --> 00:05:01,205
the day to day activities to keep the business going and keep the lights on.

94
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:04,538
Typically when we do IT planning and tying all of

95
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,205
our activities to the business,

96
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:09,205
it will typically tie the projects because that's what

97
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:11,051
the business is really interested in.

98
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:11,974
In the meantime,

99
00:05:11,974 --> 00:05:15,872
you still may have a whole collection of operational activities

100
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:18,455
that you're doing because the business might say,

101
00:05:18,455 --> 00:05:21,272
yep keep that system going, I have nothing new for it,

102
00:05:21,272 --> 00:05:25,569
but in the meantime I have some new work which may drive new projects.

103
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:26,023
Okay,

104
00:05:26,023 --> 00:05:29,750
now that you have your major projects and operational

105
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,114
activities mapped to the business,

106
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:34,974
and remember we are doing this to ensure we are doing the right

107
00:05:34,974 --> 00:05:38,750
things for the business and adding value and not just playing

108
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,114
with some new technology or project.

109
00:05:41,114 --> 00:05:45,205
So the question remains, how would you allocate resources?

110
00:05:45,205 --> 00:05:53,000
Well first things first, what are the priorities? And let's find out in the next section.
