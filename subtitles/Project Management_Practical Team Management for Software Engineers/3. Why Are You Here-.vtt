00:00:01.937 --> 00:00:03.008
So why are you here?

2
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:05.651
You might be here because you're story is somewhat like mine.

3
00:00:05.651 --> 00:00:10.437
Or you may be here because you know that companies are looking for

4
00:00:10.437 --> 00:00:13.937
people with strong management and leadership skills.

5
00:00:13.937 --> 00:00:17.937
Or it could be one of the other following reasons I'm going to talk about now.

6
00:00:17.937 --> 00:00:21.937
Are you afraid of leadership or management responsibilities?

7
00:00:21.937 --> 00:00:25.937
And believe me, they can be very challenging responsibilities.

8
00:00:25.937 --> 00:00:28.870
Your team will look to you for guidance and your management

9
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.937
will look to you as well to get things done.

10
00:00:32.937 --> 00:00:39.159
Are you perplexed or unsure on just how to develop your new team?

11
00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:40.937
Well I certainly was.

12
00:00:40.937 --> 00:00:43.091
That is why I created this class,

13
00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:45.826
and my other leadership and communication skills class,

14
00:00:45.826 --> 00:00:48.937
to give you guys a head start.

15
00:00:48.937 --> 00:00:53.937
Think of this material as a starting point that you can build upon.

16
00:00:53.937 --> 00:00:56.937
Have you been asked to be a leader and not a doer?

17
00:00:56.937 --> 00:00:58.860
That was tough for me.

18
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.354
Will I be giving up some software development skills

19
00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:04.437
and fun for management duties?

20
00:01:04.437 --> 00:01:06.937
Well, yes a little you will.

21
00:01:06.937 --> 00:01:08.755
Was I okay with that?

22
00:01:08.755 --> 00:01:10.937
Well, no not quite at first.

23
00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:14.937
I grew into it or maybe matured into it.

24
00:01:14.937 --> 00:01:17.080
Are you a software engineering expert,

25
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.687
yet feel like a fish out of water when it comes to managing a team?

26
00:01:21.687 --> 00:01:26.687
Well maybe thinking of yourself as say, well a salamander and not a fish.

27
00:01:26.687 --> 00:01:30.437
Salamanders live both in fresh water, developing software,

28
00:01:30.437 --> 00:01:32.937
and on land, managing people.

29
00:01:32.937 --> 00:01:36.937
Since salamanders are amphibians, all salamanders do require water,

30
00:01:36.937 --> 00:01:38.537
developing software, for survival.

31
00:01:38.537 --> 00:01:40.937
So that is what I did.

32
00:01:40.937 --> 00:01:44.937
I became a manager, but still had a role in software development.

33
00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:47.937
Now that worked for me, and that was in the short term.

34
00:01:47.937 --> 00:01:52.937
But in the long term, I'm completely on land now, and actually I love it.

35
00:01:52.937 --> 00:01:57.937
So based on how you answered some of those questions, this class may be for you.

36
00:01:57.937 --> 00:02:04.937
Now let's see the target audience for this class.

37
00:02:04.937 --> 00:02:05.552
First off,

38
00:02:05.552 --> 00:02:08.629
anyone that answered yes to any of the previous slides

39
00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.854
questions is a great candidate for this course.

40
00:02:11.854 --> 00:02:15.322
This course targets software engineers who have reached a point in

41
00:02:15.322 --> 00:02:19.210
their career when the business is expecting them to begin managing and

42
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.937
influencing others towards a common goal.

43
00:02:21.937 --> 00:02:24.737
We software engineers have great technical skills,

44
00:02:24.737 --> 00:02:28.437
but maybe lacking sufficient and essential management skills,

45
00:02:28.437 --> 00:02:28.937
tools,

46
00:02:28.937 --> 00:02:32.537
and processes that are required to meet the

47
00:02:32.537 --> 00:02:34.537
performance expectations of your management,

48
00:02:34.537 --> 00:02:37.664
your company, and possibly of yourself.

49
00:02:37.664 --> 00:02:41.312
So this course is for technical business

50
00:02:41.312 --> 00:02:43.187
professionals considering a manager role,

51
00:02:43.187 --> 00:02:47.210
technical business professionals already in a manager role,

52
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.794
or anyone interested in developing and improving

53
00:02:50.794 --> 00:02:59.000
their manager and management skills. Now let me share with you the course objectives.
