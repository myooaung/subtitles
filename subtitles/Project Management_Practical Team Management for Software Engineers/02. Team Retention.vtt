00:00:00.448 --> 00:00:01.175
Team retention.

2
00:00:01.175 --> 00:00:02.993
As you might have surmised,

3
00:00:02.993 --> 00:00:06.115
retaining people is always a positive management practice,

4
00:00:06.115 --> 00:00:10.281
but if you can't, you'll have to acquire new talent.

5
00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:11.948
Whoops, there they go.

6
00:00:11.948 --> 00:00:19.448
So let's explore the topic of employee retention and why it's so important.

7
00:00:19.448 --> 00:00:21.294
First before we jump into acquiring new talent,

8
00:00:21.294 --> 00:00:23.948
let's look for a moment at employee retention,

9
00:00:23.948 --> 00:00:26.448
so just what is it?

10
00:00:26.448 --> 00:00:30.084
Employee retention refers to the ability of an

11
00:00:30.084 --> 00:00:31.877
organization to retain its employees.

12
00:00:31.877 --> 00:00:32.948
This is good, of course.

13
00:00:32.948 --> 00:00:35.648
You want to keep them, they are knowledgeable about the business,

14
00:00:35.648 --> 00:00:39.448
they are technically trained, and they get the work done.

15
00:00:39.448 --> 00:00:43.448
The retention rate refers to a simple statistic,

16
00:00:43.448 --> 00:00:44.448
for example,

17
00:00:44.448 --> 00:00:49.448
a retention rate of 90% usually indicates that an organization

18
00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:53.648
kept 90% of its employees in a given period,

19
00:00:53.648 --> 00:00:58.698
usually that period is 12 months, and the higher the retention rate,

20
00:00:58.698 --> 00:00:59.448
the better.

21
00:00:59.448 --> 00:01:04.448
So the closest you are to 100%, the better.

22
00:01:04.448 --> 00:01:07.721
Employee turnover is just the opposite.

23
00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:12.226
Employee turnover refers to the number or percentage of

24
00:01:12.226 --> 00:01:14.448
workers who leave an organization.

25
00:01:14.448 --> 00:01:18.115
The turnover rate is the ration of the total number of

26
00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:21.115
employees who leave divided by the total number of

27
00:01:21.115 --> 00:01:24.721
employees over the same period of time, and again,

28
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:27.448
usually that period is 12 months.

29
00:01:27.448 --> 00:01:30.448
And the lower the turnover rate, the better.

30
00:01:30.448 --> 00:01:31.281
For example,

31
00:01:31.281 --> 00:01:37.698
if your organization has 800 employees and 60 leave over a 12 month period,

32
00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:41.635
then your turnover rate is about 7.

33
00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:44.448
5%, 60 divided by 800.

34
00:01:44.448 --> 00:01:47.715
And you want a low turnover rate.

35
00:01:47.715 --> 00:01:51.448
If you can have 0, all the better.

36
00:01:51.448 --> 00:01:54.148
Turnover versus retention.

37
00:01:54.148 --> 00:02:00.448
As turnover goes down, retention goes up.

38
00:02:00.448 --> 00:02:02.781
They're just mirror images of each other.

39
00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:08.448
Low turnover means a higher retention rate.

40
00:02:08.448 --> 00:02:12.162
There are costs to hiring new people and that is why retention is

41
00:02:12.162 --> 00:02:15.448
an important factor you need to keep in mind.

42
00:02:15.448 --> 00:02:18.357
There are costs for onboarding the new person,

43
00:02:18.357 --> 00:02:20.115
including the advertising, interviewing,

44
00:02:20.115 --> 00:02:22.115
screening, and hiring.

45
00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:24.115
There's lost productivity,

46
00:02:24.115 --> 00:02:28.217
it may take a new employee 1 to 2 years of training to reach

47
00:02:28.217 --> 00:02:31.217
productivity of an existing person that may have just left,

48
00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:35.019
and in the meantime you have lost productivity of not

49
00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.448
doing what the person who left was doing.

50
00:02:38.448 --> 00:02:39.175
Lost engagement,

51
00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:42.448
other employees who see high turnover may tend to

52
00:02:42.448 --> 00:02:45.448
disengage and lose productivity themselves.

53
00:02:45.448 --> 00:02:47.048
Customer service may service.

54
00:02:47.048 --> 00:02:47.848
For example,

55
00:02:47.848 --> 00:02:52.448
new employees take longer and are often less adept at solving problems.

56
00:02:52.448 --> 00:02:53.248
Training costs,

57
00:02:53.248 --> 00:02:58.048
for example over 2 to 3 years a business is likely to

58
00:02:58.048 --> 00:03:00.948
invest 10-20% of an employee's salary, or more,

59
00:03:00.948 --> 00:03:05.448
in training, and I just don't mean classroom or internet training,

60
00:03:05.448 --> 00:03:08.448
I mean on the job training.

61
00:03:08.448 --> 00:03:10.993
And there's a cultural impact as well.

62
00:03:10.993 --> 00:03:12.084
Whenever someone leaves,

63
00:03:12.084 --> 00:03:18.448
others take time to ask why and may feel new doubts about the department.

64
00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:29.000
Okay, now that I've made you aware of the costs of turnover and the side effects, let's discuss some ideas on how to retain people.
