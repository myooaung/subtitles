1
00:00:00,441 --> 00:00:02,108
You might be asking yourself,

2
00:00:02,108 --> 00:00:05,584
well how can performance reviews have anything to do

3
00:00:05,584 --> 00:00:08,441
with building your team's capabilities?

4
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:11,108
Well I think quite a bit.

5
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:12,441
It's all interrelated.

6
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:15,441
Now let's see how.

7
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:18,870
Okay so just what is a performance review?

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:25,441
It is the process of examining and evaluating the performance of an individual.

9
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:28,298
Well, that might sound a bit like, well so what,

10
00:00:28,298 --> 00:00:29,441
I've had them before,

11
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:31,441
maybe you think they're a waste of time or other such comments,

12
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:33,841
especially if you're not a manager.

13
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:35,441
We've all been there.

14
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:42,441
But as a manger, in your new role, they are an important part of your job.

15
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:48,441
If HR, Human Resources, does not make you do them, you must do them anyway.

16
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:52,108
They're very important to the support and the growth of your

17
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:57,441
team and the success of your team as well.

18
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:02,441
Let's see how performance reviews build team capabilities.

19
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:07,441
First to identify and correct existing problems, issues or concerns.

20
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:12,012
And another way of stating that ala Agile,

21
00:01:12,012 --> 00:01:15,441
it is to inspect and adapt,

22
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:18,584
and then chart an improved path that you and your team

23
00:01:18,584 --> 00:01:22,672
member will find the best way to correct existing problems

24
00:01:22,672 --> 00:01:25,441
or issues or concerns as well.

25
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:29,641
Next, to encourage improved future performance,

26
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:35,219
possibly based on mentoring or coaching by you or

27
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:37,441
identifying additional training needs.

28
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:41,108
Therefore the performance review can make the need for training more

29
00:01:41,108 --> 00:01:45,041
urgent and important by relating it clearly to the performance

30
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:48,714
outcomes and future career goals as well.

31
00:01:48,714 --> 00:01:51,441
Next, team performance is enhanced.

32
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:56,330
Since now you have conducted all of your reviews and now you have a complete

33
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,979
picture of your team's strengths and weaknesses and areas of improvement and

34
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:04,805
from the point of view of your organization as a whole.

35
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:07,986
A consolidated view of your overall training

36
00:02:07,986 --> 00:02:10,749
requirements is now in front of you.

37
00:02:10,749 --> 00:02:14,979
Now you can adjust your training plan, as we discussed before,

38
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:19,364
and modify according to the needs of the outcomes of the reviews.

39
00:02:19,364 --> 00:02:25,108
So what a great time to revisit the six steps we have just covered,

40
00:02:25,108 --> 00:02:30,441
to determine or re-determine your team's skills needs.

41
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,774
Building your team's capabilities through reviews has

42
00:02:32,774 --> 00:02:35,108
other worthwhile benefits as well.

43
00:02:35,108 --> 00:02:37,330
Here are a few.

44
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,441
Provides recognition.

45
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:44,441
Performance reviews provide employees with recognition for their work efforts.

46
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:49,441
The power of social recognition as an incentive has long been understood.

47
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:55,441
Next, shows that the employer cares and of course you care as well.

48
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:56,595
If nothing else,

49
00:02:56,595 --> 00:03:00,841
the existence of a review program indicates to an employee that

50
00:03:00,841 --> 00:03:04,441
the organization is genuinely interested and cares in their

51
00:03:04,441 --> 00:03:06,441
individual performance and development.

52
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:13,641
This alone can have a positive influence on the individual's sense of worth,

53
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:15,441
commitment, and belonging.

54
00:03:15,441 --> 00:03:16,350
Targets needs,

55
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,986
performance reviews can target a specific area of

56
00:03:19,986 --> 00:03:24,191
weakness or area of improvement, that sounds a little better,

57
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:26,274
that needs evaluation and remediation.

58
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:31,552
It can also serve as a valuable tool for establishing goals that

59
00:03:31,552 --> 00:03:35,441
will lead to promotions and career advancement.

60
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:39,241
Using a performance review to uncover training needs allows the company and

61
00:03:39,241 --> 00:03:46,441
yourself to focus efforts on better areas of improvement.

62
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:47,441
Also charting progress,

63
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:50,774
performance reviews can be used to chart the progress of

64
00:03:50,774 --> 00:03:53,441
an individual and your team as a whole.

65
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:57,885
Comparing performance reviews from one benchmark period to

66
00:03:57,885 --> 00:04:01,714
another will provide both the company and the employee with

67
00:04:01,714 --> 00:04:06,330
measurable marks of improvement, lack of improvement,

68
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,041
regression, in the job performance areas.

69
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,584
This data is valuable for maybe salary increases or demotions,

70
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:16,441
promotions, and maybe even terminations.

71
00:04:16,441 --> 00:04:19,518
All of these elements can be tied to the progress

72
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:21,805
reflected in the performance review data,

73
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:26,056
so it's good to see the history, review by review,

74
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:29,441
to look at the progress of the employee to see how

75
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:31,441
they're progressing or maybe falling back,

76
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:34,941
in what areas, and how to help them along.

77
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,941
Employees, your team members,

78
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:41,941
will greatly appreciate your help and your mentoring to build

79
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:46,241
their skills for themselves personally, for the team,

80
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:48,641
and for the company.

81
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:50,441
Next, building relationships.

82
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:55,441
Performance reviews give the employer and yourself and the employee

83
00:04:55,441 --> 00:04:58,441
the opportunity to sit down and discuss performance.

84
00:04:58,441 --> 00:05:02,108
In these busy times where everyone is taking care of business,

85
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:06,441
periodic reviews between you and the employee allow them

86
00:05:06,441 --> 00:05:09,441
to form or strengthen a relationship.

87
00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:13,774
Developing this rapport opens as line of communication for

88
00:05:13,774 --> 00:05:17,108
the employee to use in making future suggestions for the

89
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,108
company or applying for promotions.

90
00:05:19,108 --> 00:05:19,941
Of course,

91
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:24,441
this is not the only time and way to build relationships with your team.

92
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:26,623
You'll be building relationships, of course,

93
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:29,364
every single day with everything you do.

94
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:34,774
This is just another more formal way to enhance and build a

95
00:05:34,774 --> 00:05:36,774
relationship with each of your people.

96
00:05:36,774 --> 00:05:39,066
Next, I think it motivates employees.

97
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:43,441
Performance reviews often serve as motivational tools,

98
00:05:43,441 --> 00:05:46,896
the company may offer a bonus or other perk to employees who are able to

99
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:51,441
improve their performance reviews from one period to the next.

100
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:54,997
It is important to offer improvement opportunities such as training seminars,

101
00:05:54,997 --> 00:05:58,885
mentorships or classes to employees desiring to

102
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:01,350
improve their performance reviews.

103
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:06,441
Now let's look at the review process itself.

104
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:10,441
Here are some guidelines on how to conduct performance reviews.

105
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:14,441
First, always follow company standards and policy.

106
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:18,441
Above all, you must follow the policy at all times.

107
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:20,155
Based on the size and maturity of companies,

108
00:06:20,155 --> 00:06:22,641
I have seen some that are extremely formal with

109
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:24,641
processes and procedures for reviews,

110
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:29,441
and other companies that actually have absolutely nothing.

111
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:33,108
So find out from your management how your review process works

112
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:36,168
and communicate this process to your team.

113
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:41,358
Whether it is your company's, your own, or a blend of both,

114
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:43,441
you must follow the process.

115
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:44,826
Formal versus informal.

116
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:51,584
If you have a formal process and forms, et cetera, that still may not be enough.

117
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:55,595
I have seen some forms from human resources that are just so high

118
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:58,608
level they don't apply to the technical teams at all.

119
00:06:58,608 --> 00:07:05,191
If formal, find out what latitude and flexibility you have and if informal,

120
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,441
in other words, if you're doing your own thing,

121
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:10,441
then come up with your own review template.

122
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:12,041
More on that later.

123
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,441
Because consistent, never miss a review.

124
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:17,584
We do ours on the employees on their anniversary date of

125
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:20,584
maybe you do the whole team at once.

126
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:25,241
Follow your company's standards and if you have none I like the

127
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:28,441
anniversary date the best so it is not so overwhelming on you

128
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:30,129
having to do all of them at one time,

129
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:33,155
you can kind of spread it out over the year.

130
00:07:33,155 --> 00:07:35,441
Follow a defined process.

131
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:38,441
First if your company has one, you follow that,

132
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:44,259
and if they don't have one, come up with your own process.

133
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:47,805
Next, document everything, the process, standards,

134
00:07:47,805 --> 00:07:50,350
procedures, the review forms, the review results,

135
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:56,441
and any notes you take during review must be captured and kept.

136
00:07:56,441 --> 00:08:00,441
Generally the reviews are a very positive experience with everyone,

137
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:03,870
but in some cases there may be some legal issues and you

138
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,841
better document and save everything.

139
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:12,441
Okay, let's look at the review itself.

140
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:16,441
Alright here's a little bit about the review itself.

141
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:17,979
Develop a performance review template.

142
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:22,967
If your company or HR does not have one, you must have one of your own.

143
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:25,809
I put a sample of one in the demos.

144
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:27,298
zip file for this module.

145
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,441
Please check it out.

146
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,870
Very basic, very simple, just use it as a starting point,

147
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,441
change anything you'd like to change if you need to.

148
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:35,841
Next,

149
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:39,441
your review template is based on roles and responsibilities

150
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,941
that we built earlier in this course.

151
00:08:41,941 --> 00:08:47,441
And for each skill and duty described we rate the person for each.

152
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:50,441
We want to provide positive feedback,

153
00:08:50,441 --> 00:08:53,826
everyone does do good work at least some of the time,

154
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:54,441
identify it,

155
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:57,655
provide your appreciation for it and how it has

156
00:08:57,655 --> 00:08:59,997
helped the team and the customer.

157
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:04,441
Also, you're going to provide areas of improvement.

158
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:08,441
That is the nice way to talk about areas they don't do very well.

159
00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:11,584
Sometimes it might just be the lack of training or experience,

160
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:16,441
and in that case you can provide the coaching or training they need.

161
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:22,441
If it is more along the lines of attitude and motivation or even carelessness,

162
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:23,500
don't be shy,

163
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,441
talk about it and see if you can't arrive at a plan to correct

164
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:31,441
and improve poor or inadequate performance.

165
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:38,364
Solicit the employee's feedback, always get their feedback about you, yes, you.

166
00:09:38,364 --> 00:09:42,056
Sometimes it may be your style, your approach,

167
00:09:42,056 --> 00:09:46,941
or maybe even your inexperience, remember you're a new manager,

168
00:09:46,941 --> 00:09:49,012
that is affecting their performance.

169
00:09:49,012 --> 00:09:54,986
Come to a meeting of the minds and put together a plan for both of you.

170
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:59,441
And next, what I call 360 feedback.

171
00:09:59,441 --> 00:10:05,441
It is where I get inputs on the employee's performance from coworkers,

172
00:10:05,441 --> 00:10:10,441
customers, or other important people that have work with them.

173
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:12,798
I don't see and work with my employees every single day

174
00:10:12,798 --> 00:10:17,298
and every minute so I really need their inputs for a full

175
00:10:17,298 --> 00:10:19,441
360 view of their performance.

176
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:24,441
I do keep the inputs anonymous at all times, that's very important.

177
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:29,441
They come up with an aggregate performance review based on their inputs.

178
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:38,000
Alright now let's do a little bit on motivating your employees and how it relates to this section.
