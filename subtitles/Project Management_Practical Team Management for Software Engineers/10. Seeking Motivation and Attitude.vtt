00:00:00.555 --> 00:00:00.912
Also,

2
00:00:00.912 --> 00:00:04.841
I would like you to think about and reflect on the

3
00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:07.555
following qualities an individual may possess.

4
00:00:07.555 --> 00:00:09.555
The first is motivation.

5
00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:14.698
Do you think they have the general desire or willingness to do

6
00:00:14.698 --> 00:00:18.786
pretty much anything you need done on their own,

7
00:00:18.786 --> 00:00:21.555
map and chart their own course?

8
00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:23.555
This is very important.

9
00:00:23.555 --> 00:00:25.555
The second is attitude.

10
00:00:25.555 --> 00:00:31.017
Winston Churchill said "attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference,

11
00:00:31.017 --> 00:00:33.324
" and I completely agree.

12
00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:36.555
Do they have a good, positive attitude?

13
00:00:36.555 --> 00:00:41.555
Granted these are a bit harder to determine in the interviewing process.

14
00:00:41.555 --> 00:00:46.111
That is why you need to get them to talk and while they are talking and

15
00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:50.555
telling all about themselves and sharing their experiences,

16
00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:55.555
you are also looking for examples of their attitude and motivation.

17
00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:55.805
Alright,

18
00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:58.555
now let's explore how we might design the questions for these

19
00:00:58.555 --> 00:01:04.555
interesting and very important qualities as well.

20
00:01:04.555 --> 00:01:05.138
Motivation.

21
00:01:05.138 --> 00:01:11.555
It's the general desire or willingness of someone to do something.

22
00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:13.655
You can have all the technical, communication,

23
00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:17.412
and leadership skills in the world, but if you are not very motivated,

24
00:01:17.412 --> 00:01:20.555
well, not much work will likely get done.

25
00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:23.555
Now some people are self motivated,

26
00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:27.412
that is all on their own they drive to get things done,

27
00:01:27.412 --> 00:01:28.555
and I love that.

28
00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:29.805
So there's the personal drive,

29
00:01:29.805 --> 00:01:32.555
the desire to improve or to meet certain standards.

30
00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:36.555
There's a commitment to personal or organizational goals,

31
00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:38.373
people who are committed.

32
00:01:38.373 --> 00:01:43.222
Initiative, which we define as the readiness to act on opportunities.

33
00:01:43.222 --> 00:01:44.472
I like that.

34
00:01:44.472 --> 00:01:46.555
And then of course, optimism,

35
00:01:46.555 --> 00:01:52.555
the ability to keep going and pursue goals in the face of setbacks.

36
00:01:52.555 --> 00:01:55.632
But the best way to motivate people is to first

37
00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:58.269
understand what does in fact motivate them.

38
00:01:58.269 --> 00:02:02.555
So I might ask a question something like this -

39
00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:04.222
what motivates you professionally?

40
00:02:04.222 --> 00:02:07.555
What gets you excited to come to work?

41
00:02:07.555 --> 00:02:09.841
And then sit back and let them talk.

42
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:14.017
Determine if the things they need to be motivated are things that you can,

43
00:02:14.017 --> 00:02:15.555
in fact, really give them.

44
00:02:15.555 --> 00:02:18.282
If they say I just love working with customers and

45
00:02:18.282 --> 00:02:21.412
understanding their business problems and then be able to

46
00:02:21.412 --> 00:02:24.055
design simple and easy to use solutions,

47
00:02:24.055 --> 00:02:27.555
okay is that something you can provide?

48
00:02:27.555 --> 00:02:30.555
Well maybe you can't provide 100%, but maybe 75%,

49
00:02:30.555 --> 00:02:32.198
maybe you could talk through that.

50
00:02:32.198 --> 00:02:33.912
Hey I have a new project coming up,

51
00:02:33.912 --> 00:02:37.324
I need someone to get in there and talk to the customer,

52
00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:38.555
figure out the requirements.

53
00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:43.555
I need a new requirements definition template, can you build that as well?

54
00:02:43.555 --> 00:02:45.222
And here's what we're going to achieve for the business,

55
00:02:45.222 --> 00:02:46.888
here's what you're doing that will tie to the business,

56
00:02:46.888 --> 00:02:49.863
and things like that might get them all excited.

57
00:02:49.863 --> 00:02:53.555
Remember there is the side of self motivation,

58
00:02:53.555 --> 00:02:58.198
but there's the other side of you as a manager to provide the

59
00:02:58.198 --> 00:03:02.017
environment so they can be motivated or even more motivated

60
00:03:02.017 --> 00:03:07.555
than they ever thought they could be.

61
00:03:07.555 --> 00:03:13.888
A positive or negative attitude affects how workers approach their jobs and

62
00:03:13.888 --> 00:03:17.555
attitudes can have a ripple effect on all those around them,

63
00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:19.010
and I mean ripple.

64
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.170
Bad attitudes demotivate people resulting in less productivity and can

65
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.555
poorly affect customer service and be a real morale killer.

66
00:03:28.555 --> 00:03:31.222
This can lead to less teamwork, higher turnover,

67
00:03:31.222 --> 00:03:37.555
all the things we've talked about will become unraveled right before your eyes.

68
00:03:37.555 --> 00:03:42.555
So pay special attention to the potential new hire's attitude.

69
00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:45.555
So you'll want to ask questions that may bring out the following qualities,

70
00:03:45.555 --> 00:03:46.680
let's see some.

71
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.555
We always want to look for honesty, always tell it like it is.

72
00:03:51.555 --> 00:03:56.555
Humility, someone who's modest and displays some humbleness.

73
00:03:56.555 --> 00:03:59.055
Perseverance, ability not to give up,

74
00:03:59.055 --> 00:04:02.555
in other words have that good positive attitude,

75
00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:05.555
even during tough and rough times.

76
00:04:05.555 --> 00:04:09.617
I like to even use humor in my life and my professional career,

77
00:04:09.617 --> 00:04:13.055
but I like to see that in other's as well.

78
00:04:13.055 --> 00:04:15.555
Initiative, of course, a real self starter.

79
00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:19.555
And determination, ability to overcome obstacles.

80
00:04:19.555 --> 00:04:21.555
So a question might be something like this,

81
00:04:21.555 --> 00:04:25.155
tell me about a time when it was necessary to admit to

82
00:04:25.155 --> 00:04:30.355
others that you had made a mistake, and how did you handle that?

83
00:04:30.355 --> 00:04:36.755
Again, sit back and listen, look for how honest is he or she talking?

84
00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:39.155
Any humility?

85
00:04:39.155 --> 00:04:40.355
Perseverance?

86
00:04:40.355 --> 00:04:41.555
Initiative?

87
00:04:41.555 --> 00:04:42.010
Determination?

88
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.555
You can even make a little checklist, as I do,

89
00:04:46.555 --> 00:04:49.496
and as you hear things you can just go, check,

90
00:04:49.496 --> 00:04:51.555
check, check or maybe x, x, x.

91
00:04:51.555 --> 00:04:52.666
Did I hear some humility?

92
00:04:52.666 --> 00:04:53.555
Did I hear this?

93
00:04:53.555 --> 00:04:54.555
Did I hear that?

94
00:04:54.555 --> 00:04:57.622
Because a lot of times after you've interviewed two or three or

95
00:04:57.622 --> 00:04:59.755
four people and you're back with your team,

96
00:04:59.755 --> 00:05:03.632
you may not remember all these subtle things that might make

97
00:05:03.632 --> 00:05:07.010
the big and best difference in who you pick.

98
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.155
So when you're putting together your requirements for your new hire,

99
00:05:11.155 --> 00:05:13.555
don't forget about attitude and motivation.

100
00:05:13.555 --> 00:05:15.401
These qualities, to me,

101
00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:21.341
are so very essential to their success and your success in your new job.

102
00:05:21.341 --> 00:05:28.555
Okay, now let's move on to a completely different type of question just for fun.

103
00:05:28.555 --> 00:05:32.555
You may also think of asking a really out of the box type of question,

104
00:05:32.555 --> 00:05:38.555
in this example we'll be testing for problem solving and critical thinking.

105
00:05:38.555 --> 00:05:40.709
And let's look at the following example.

106
00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:43.755
Your customer wants to hire you for 3 days,

107
00:05:43.755 --> 00:05:46.555
so you're asking this to the interviewee.

108
00:05:46.555 --> 00:05:51.555
You must be paid at the end of every day, that seems reasonable.

109
00:05:51.555 --> 00:05:57.155
Your customer has but just bar of gold to pay you with,

110
00:05:57.155 --> 00:06:01.282
now your customer can only cut the bar once,

111
00:06:01.282 --> 00:06:03.555
do you take the job?

112
00:06:03.555 --> 00:06:09.555
What you are looking for is the thought process the person is going through.

113
00:06:09.555 --> 00:06:11.117
For example, they may say,

114
00:06:11.117 --> 00:06:17.055
well I will work for 3 days and you can just pay me the full bar at the end.

115
00:06:17.055 --> 00:06:21.698
Okay, this is pretty good, a form of negotiating, I kind of like that.

116
00:06:21.698 --> 00:06:26.155
Then inform them that they must be paid at the end of every day,

117
00:06:26.155 --> 00:06:28.555
in other words, that bar's going to get cut.

118
00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:32.930
Then they may say, okay I can work 2 days,

119
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.888
12 hours each day rather than 3 days 8 hours a day,

120
00:06:36.888 --> 00:06:39.999
and that way you can cut the bar once and give me half

121
00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:43.555
the first day and half the second day.

122
00:06:43.555 --> 00:06:45.555
That's not bad, they're being creative.

123
00:06:45.555 --> 00:06:53.269
Then inform them that you really need them for 8 hours a day for 3 days.

124
00:06:53.269 --> 00:06:55.555
Hmm, they say, okay.

125
00:06:55.555 --> 00:06:56.755
They then say,

126
00:06:56.755 --> 00:07:03.093
well after the first day please cut one-third of the bar off and give it to me.

127
00:07:03.093 --> 00:07:05.555
Okay now we're even after that first day.

128
00:07:05.555 --> 00:07:11.126
Then after the second day we will exchange my third bar for your

129
00:07:11.126 --> 00:07:13.888
remaining two-thirds bar and we are even again.

130
00:07:13.888 --> 00:07:20.555
Then at the end of the third day you can give me back the one-third bar.

131
00:07:20.555 --> 00:07:21.555
Well okay.

132
00:07:21.555 --> 00:07:23.464
They thought through multiple scenarios and finally

133
00:07:23.464 --> 00:07:25.464
arrived at a solution that works.

134
00:07:25.464 --> 00:07:29.984
So think about some situational questions and let them do

135
00:07:29.984 --> 00:07:32.555
the talking or asking more questions,

136
00:07:32.555 --> 00:07:37.010
et cetera to assess what I call their critical thinking skills.

137
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.373
Also,

138
00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:48.000
I put together a sample list of interview questions to give you a head start. And it can be found in the demo's zip file for this module.
