1
00:00:00.752 --> 00:00:03.521
Step 4, conduct follow on interviews.

2
00:00:03.521 --> 00:00:06.752
This step is here more for completeness.

3
00:00:06.752 --> 00:00:10.752
You may not need follow on interviews, but here's what you do if you do.

4
00:00:10.752 --> 00:00:14.752
Now the goal of follow on interviews is to further filter the list of

5
00:00:14.752 --> 00:00:17.752
in person interviews down to even a smaller list.

6
00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:20.752
Say you have narrowed it down to two people and they are both just great,

7
00:00:20.752 --> 00:00:21.419
very equal,

8
00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:26.934
maybe a follow up interview for both would be beneficial to really be sure.

9
00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:28.570
Okay, reflect, review,

10
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.752
and discuss the results of the in person interviews with your team.

11
00:00:33.752 --> 00:00:36.752
Down select, that's the term we use to kind of reduce the list,

12
00:00:36.752 --> 00:00:39.046
I would say to about 2 or 3 at the very most that

13
00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:41.502
you'd like for a follow on interview.

14
00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:42.085
Next,

15
00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:47.352
invite and schedule the next round of interviews and this

16
00:00:47.352 --> 00:00:49.752
is what I call a deep dive interview.

17
00:00:49.752 --> 00:00:50.752
In other words,

18
00:00:50.752 --> 00:00:54.419
in this step you want to have a deeper and richer

19
00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:55.752
discussion with the candidates.

20
00:00:55.752 --> 00:01:00.530
Find a couple of topics to really dig into and help you and

21
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.752
your team differentiate each candidate.

22
00:01:02.752 --> 00:01:06.025
Maybe come up with work scenarios they might find

23
00:01:06.025 --> 00:01:08.598
themselves in and how they might resolve them.

24
00:01:08.598 --> 00:01:13.085
Now the candidates are usually more relaxed and you can discuss job duties and

25
00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:16.829
expectations in more detail and/or drill in on some of their answers from the

26
00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:19.552
first interview to better understand the candidate.

27
00:01:19.552 --> 00:01:23.752
Keep all documentation and notes, as always.

28
00:01:23.752 --> 00:01:25.906
So the outcome of this step then,

29
00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:29.252
we have qualified new hire candidates and we've further

30
00:01:29.252 --> 00:01:32.752
reduced our list to a smaller subset.

31
00:01:32.752 --> 00:01:34.038
Alright, we have all the data,

32
00:01:34.038 --> 00:01:38.934
we have all the feedback and you're ready to make your final selection.

33
00:01:38.934 --> 00:01:42.752
Let's move on to step 5.

34
00:01:42.752 --> 00:01:46.752
Step 5, now it's time to make your final selection.

35
00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:48.085
Okay selection rationale.

36
00:01:48.085 --> 00:01:52.885
Well you have documented your requirements so you know what you are looking for,

37
00:01:52.885 --> 00:01:55.444
and you have your scores if you've given any tests,

38
00:01:55.444 --> 00:01:59.466
and you have all your interview notes from the phone or face to face

39
00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:03.752
that you have taken and that your team has taken.

40
00:02:03.752 --> 00:02:07.752
So you may want to weight your scores, for example maybe technical is 50%,

41
00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:12.752
communication is 25%, leadership is 25% or something like that.

42
00:02:12.752 --> 00:02:16.752
It may be more detailed and it may not be, your choice.

43
00:02:16.752 --> 00:02:20.752
What you'll want to do now is rank the candidates based on the scores.

44
00:02:20.752 --> 00:02:22.085
So how does it look?

45
00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:24.752
You may also move people in the ranking by insightful

46
00:02:24.752 --> 00:02:27.060
comments from your team or yourself.

47
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.829
For example,

48
00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:32.752
this person would be a great fit because we really need a more assertive

49
00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:36.060
person working with our customers in the sales division.

50
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.752
I know he's a little weak technically,

51
00:02:38.752 --> 00:02:41.895
and we gave him a 50% weighting from the technical area,

52
00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:44.675
but I really think he's a good fit.

53
00:02:44.675 --> 00:02:47.752
And then follow that with a brief discussion.

54
00:02:47.752 --> 00:02:51.502
Sometimes the person ranked top numerically may later be

55
00:02:51.502 --> 00:02:54.388
downgraded based on more intangible considerations.

56
00:02:54.388 --> 00:02:59.609
I wish this was a purely objective process, but it isn't.

57
00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:04.181
It's a little bit of gut feel and leadership and experience that goes with it.

58
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:07.395
So as a team now you'll want to discuss,

59
00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:11.752
agree or disagree with rationale, you just can't say I don't like the person,

60
00:03:11.752 --> 00:03:13.314
you have to say why,

61
00:03:13.314 --> 00:03:17.952
and see if you can come to a consensus of selecting one top candidate.

62
00:03:17.952 --> 00:03:18.752
Now remember,

63
00:03:18.752 --> 00:03:24.137
you are the manager of the team and you have final say and can break ties,

64
00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:25.752
but just don't throw your weight around.

65
00:03:25.752 --> 00:03:29.137
I recommend explaining why the person may or may not be

66
00:03:29.137 --> 00:03:31.752
the best and discuss as a team again.

67
00:03:31.752 --> 00:03:34.085
The more you delegate to the team,

68
00:03:34.085 --> 00:03:38.189
the more they will buy into the new hire and not feel the

69
00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.675
person was forced on them into their group.

70
00:03:40.675 --> 00:03:42.214
Now select the top person,

71
00:03:42.214 --> 00:03:46.252
so based on the weighting if you did that or other considerations,

72
00:03:46.252 --> 00:03:48.752
you have a potential person to hire.

73
00:03:48.752 --> 00:03:53.752
Also though, keep in mind who would be number 2 in the list.

74
00:03:53.752 --> 00:03:56.252
Just because you picked your number 1 does not mean

75
00:03:56.252 --> 00:03:58.038
that they'll necessarily pick you.

76
00:03:58.038 --> 00:04:02.752
Now I like to do what I call a pretend hire.

77
00:04:02.752 --> 00:04:05.152
Discuss how this person would augment the team,

78
00:04:05.152 --> 00:04:07.570
what assignments you might give them first.

79
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.252
Sometimes this helps bring out additional questions to discuss with your team.

80
00:04:11.252 --> 00:04:16.252
It's like a use case approach you may have used when designing systems.

81
00:04:16.252 --> 00:04:18.116
Document the reasons selected,

82
00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:21.752
this is important in case there are any downstream issues,

83
00:04:21.752 --> 00:04:25.752
such as your HR department and even a lawsuit.

84
00:04:25.752 --> 00:04:31.752
Okay the outcome of this step is that you have selected the best candidate,

85
00:04:31.752 --> 00:04:34.609
the person that you would like to join the team,

86
00:04:34.609 --> 00:04:42.502
and you have selected candidate number 2 just in case.

87
00:04:42.502 --> 00:04:44.752
Okay, congratulations.

88
00:04:44.752 --> 00:04:49.752
Step 6, finalize the paperwork you need to get this person on board.

89
00:04:49.752 --> 00:04:52.752
As always follow your company's process and I will

90
00:04:52.752 --> 00:04:55.352
continue to reiterate how important this is.

91
00:04:55.352 --> 00:04:57.752
Next would come the offer letter.

92
00:04:57.752 --> 00:05:00.752
Get that offer letter out before you lose this person.

93
00:05:00.752 --> 00:05:03.060
Remember, if you think that this person is so great,

94
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.675
some other company may think so as well.

95
00:05:05.675 --> 00:05:08.752
You are not the only game in town.

96
00:05:08.752 --> 00:05:12.752
Acceptance, that is the potential new hire must accept the offer.

97
00:05:12.752 --> 00:05:14.852
Usually this involves signing an employee agreement,

98
00:05:14.852 --> 00:05:18.038
follow up with with HR or the new hire themselves to

99
00:05:18.038 --> 00:05:19.752
be sure they received the offer,

100
00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:22.752
check to see if they have any questions or concerns.

101
00:05:22.752 --> 00:05:26.752
Sometimes they really want the job but get cold feet.

102
00:05:26.752 --> 00:05:29.752
If you've picked them, don't let them get away.

103
00:05:29.752 --> 00:05:31.752
Rejection and, well, who's on deck.

104
00:05:31.752 --> 00:05:36.419
Well yes, they may reject you, if you can try and find out why.

105
00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.570
Since it may be something to do with you or your company,

106
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.752
maybe you can change their mind.

107
00:05:42.752 --> 00:05:46.388
Rejection feedback can be very interesting and also be an

108
00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:49.877
opportunity to improve your acquisition process.

109
00:05:49.877 --> 00:05:52.025
Final acceptance, well congratulations,

110
00:05:52.025 --> 00:05:55.641
your new hire has accepted and all that hard work you did

111
00:05:55.641 --> 00:05:58.752
and your team did has been rewarded.

112
00:05:58.752 --> 00:06:01.214
Figure out when their start date is and,

113
00:06:01.214 --> 00:06:06.752
well usually it's in your offer letter, and get ready to onboard your new hire.

114
00:06:06.752 --> 00:06:09.685
So the outcome of step 6 is the paperwork is complete

115
00:06:09.685 --> 00:06:11.521
and the start date is selected.

116
00:06:11.521 --> 00:06:19.752
Alright to wrap up this section, here are a couple of poignant quotes.

117
00:06:19.752 --> 00:06:23.444
"The secret of my success is that we have gone to exceptional

118
00:06:23.444 --> 00:06:27.388
lengths to hire the best people in the world.

119
00:06:27.388 --> 00:06:28.752
" -Steve Jobs.

120
00:06:28.752 --> 00:06:30.598
Hiring new people should not be taken lightly,

121
00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:33.502
in fact I take hiring very seriously indeed.

122
00:06:33.502 --> 00:06:39.752
Your new hires may make or break your department or even your career.

123
00:06:39.752 --> 00:06:42.752
So keep a sharp eye out for the best you can find,

124
00:06:42.752 --> 00:06:46.952
they will truly make your life easier.

125
00:06:46.952 --> 00:06:53.196
Here's another quote, "you need to have a collaborate hiring process.

126
00:06:53.196 --> 00:06:55.290
" Another quote from Steve Jobs.

127
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.252
As I have mentioned several times in this module,

128
00:06:58.252 --> 00:07:02.752
involve and collaborate with your team, get their inputs,

129
00:07:02.752 --> 00:07:06.752
get their feedback and get their concerns and issues.

130
00:07:06.752 --> 00:07:09.752
You can pick the best person in your eyes,

131
00:07:09.752 --> 00:07:12.877
but if they won't work well with your team,

132
00:07:12.877 --> 00:07:14.752
you may have trouble ahead.

133
00:07:14.752 --> 00:07:15.038
Okay,

134
00:07:15.038 --> 00:07:25.000
now let's look at the questions and let's figure out how you can better design and come up with the right questions to ask.
