1
00:00:01,173 --> 00:00:02,673
You've all heard of structured programming,

2
00:00:02,673 --> 00:00:05,423
now what I'm proposing to you is structured emailing.

3
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:09,537
All your emails should follow a set, high level structure,

4
00:00:09,537 --> 00:00:13,173
and well as keeping your emails on the shorter side,

5
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:15,673
and they should follow a standard structure that will also

6
00:00:15,673 --> 00:00:17,991
help you write quality emails faster.

7
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:18,900
But first,

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,173
let's look at the metadata of an email before we jump into the body of an email.

9
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:28,459
So in an email, the TO: portion is for the intended audience,

10
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:31,019
the people who must read it.

11
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,173
Do not put every Tom, Dick, and Harry here,

12
00:00:35,173 --> 00:00:39,173
only the people that must absolutely need to read it.

13
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:41,173
Think carefully and thoughtfully on who will need

14
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:43,006
to read and receive this email.

15
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:47,673
It will typically be those who must know the information or

16
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:51,173
must take action based on the information.

17
00:00:51,173 --> 00:00:54,506
Now here's the CC:, or for a little historical reference,

18
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:58,030
carbon copy, if you can believe we still use that,

19
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,173
it is for the optional audience.

20
00:01:00,173 --> 00:01:05,887
And remember, do not expect the people in this list to actually read your email.

21
00:01:05,887 --> 00:01:10,173
Okay, you're really sending it as an FYI or out of courtesy.

22
00:01:10,173 --> 00:01:11,840
So clearly know the difference.

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,360
The people in the TO: are people you want to read and take action,

24
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,006
the people in the CC: are those who are more FYI,

25
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:24,173
oh by the way you may want to read this.

26
00:01:24,173 --> 00:01:28,173
Alright next is the blind carbon copy, BCC.

27
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:30,250
It is for a very a very limited audience.

28
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,055
I really don't recommend using BCC at all.

29
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:40,096
You want no one in the TO: or CC: to know that this person or

30
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:45,173
persons is in the BCC and that also receive the email.

31
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:48,173
If that is the case, well what are you hiding?

32
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:50,840
So I believe in open and honest communication,

33
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,173
so I don't use this at all,

34
00:01:53,173 --> 00:01:55,173
but wanted to share it with you so you know where I stand.

35
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:55,590
Now,

36
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:01,055
if you think someone needs to kind of understand the email you send out

37
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:05,173
and it's more of a one on one or maybe might be a BCC,

38
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:06,173
here's what I do.

39
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:08,673
I don't use the BCC, I send out my email,

40
00:02:08,673 --> 00:02:11,973
I go into my sent email folder, find it,

41
00:02:11,973 --> 00:02:13,573
and then forward it,

42
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:18,602
say to my boss or forward it to that person with a sentence or two up

43
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:21,744
front saying by the way I wanted you to see this,

44
00:02:21,744 --> 00:02:23,173
that gives them some context.

45
00:02:23,173 --> 00:02:25,644
If you just send the BCC and they get it as a blind copy,

46
00:02:25,644 --> 00:02:27,298
they may not know the context.

47
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:29,173
Why are they getting it?

48
00:02:29,173 --> 00:02:32,173
Why did you send it to them as a blind CC?

49
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:35,423
So again, I don't like to use BCC, I recommend that you don't,

50
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:38,820
but if you want to send a one or two off special,

51
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,991
then I would go into the sent folder and do a forward.

52
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:43,900
Alright, Subject.

53
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,240
Most people haven't a clue what to put here.

54
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,673
Here is what I strongly recommend, I want you to be compelling,

55
00:02:50,673 --> 00:02:55,173
in other words, use few words that are compelling,

56
00:02:55,173 --> 00:02:59,030
which will entice them to read and open your email.

57
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,887
And you want to be clear so it's easy for them to

58
00:03:02,887 --> 00:03:05,173
understand just what the email is all about.

59
00:03:05,173 --> 00:03:07,481
And also be concise, keep it as short as possible,

60
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:10,355
not too long, not to short, no fuzzy subjects.

61
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:12,773
For example, don't just say status report.

62
00:03:12,773 --> 00:03:15,173
I have no idea what the context is.

63
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:18,173
Or meeting notes, again no context.

64
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:21,788
So it would be meeting notes, you know,

65
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:25,173
maybe it's the topic or we're talking about the polar project,

66
00:03:25,173 --> 00:03:25,923
and the date,

67
00:03:25,923 --> 00:03:28,506
maybe there's something like that in the meeting notes subject

68
00:03:28,506 --> 00:03:31,173
so people know exactly what it's all about.

69
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:38,173
Okay, now let's take a deeper look at the body of an email.

70
00:03:38,173 --> 00:03:41,173
Over time you'll develop a body structure that works for you.

71
00:03:41,173 --> 00:03:44,537
But here is a simple structure for the body for your emails to get you started.

72
00:03:44,537 --> 00:03:47,446
Now I always recommend using the template that

73
00:03:47,446 --> 00:03:49,423
you'll see below here in a moment,

74
00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:52,173
but always feel free to mold it to fit your needs.

75
00:03:52,173 --> 00:03:53,991
Okay, first a greeting.

76
00:03:53,991 --> 00:03:57,173
I always believe in a simple greeting.

77
00:03:57,173 --> 00:04:01,173
Hello Lauren, good morning Lauren, something like that.

78
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:03,423
I do not recommend Joe, Mary,

79
00:04:03,423 --> 00:04:07,923
- just add a little bit in there and it just makes

80
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:10,173
it more inviting in the greeting.

81
00:04:10,173 --> 00:04:11,736
Easy and simple to do.

82
00:04:11,736 --> 00:04:15,173
Next, I'd like to have what I call a soft opening,

83
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:16,096
maybe a pleasantry,

84
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:19,446
a compliment or a nice comment like hey I hope you

85
00:04:19,446 --> 00:04:22,173
had a nice vacation when you out, things like that.

86
00:04:22,173 --> 00:04:24,096
Only one sentence, only short.

87
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:27,558
It's not a love letter, it's a formal business,

88
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:32,173
but we're trying to just engage the reader and make it easy,

89
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:36,173
hey hello Michael, oh I like that, oh yes I did have a nice vacation.

90
00:04:36,173 --> 00:04:37,459
Okay, now we're going to get into the meat,

91
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:40,256
in other words, what is the reason for your email.

92
00:04:40,256 --> 00:04:44,030
Something like, as you requested, please see the attached status report.

93
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,173
In other words, what is the reason for the email?

94
00:04:46,173 --> 00:04:51,173
Make it very clear and make it maybe a sentence or two.

95
00:04:51,173 --> 00:04:56,173
Do not use large paragraphs, consider it something like a presentation,

96
00:04:56,173 --> 00:05:01,173
not a lot of bullets and a lot of text, keep it clear and concise.

97
00:05:01,173 --> 00:05:04,173
Alright, also there might be a call to action.

98
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:09,173
Please read and provide me with any feedback, something like that.

99
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:10,887
Next would be the closing message,

100
00:05:10,887 --> 00:05:16,173
like thank you and I will see you at our next meeting on Friday at 10:00 AM,

101
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:17,173
something like that.

102
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:22,173
Again, the closing message is short, it's one line.

103
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:27,548
And lastly a signature block, I can't stand it when someone just says Joe.

104
00:05:27,548 --> 00:05:30,548
I might not even know who Joe is.

105
00:05:30,548 --> 00:05:33,173
So I like a nice signature block.

106
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:36,173
It's going to be your name, your title, they may know your email,

107
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:40,173
but maybe it's in there, a phone, maybe a location of where you're at,

108
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:44,506
so it's very easy then for someone to read your email and if

109
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:47,306
they have any questions I know who to reply to,

110
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,526
though it might be in the email of course,

111
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:51,997
but I know who to reply to in the sense of I could pick

112
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:54,019
up the phone real quick and call.

113
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:56,173
I know your first and last name.

114
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:57,316
I know your title.

115
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,459
I have some context,

116
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:02,355
especially if you're sending it out to an external customer or client.

117
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:04,173
You want to be professional.

118
00:06:04,173 --> 00:06:07,173
So I really encourage you to have a good signature block.

119
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:11,173
Again, this section is on formal communication, formal emails.

120
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:16,306
Okay, so to recap the body, after you write your email,

121
00:06:16,306 --> 00:06:21,373
quickly glance over it and make sure is it clear,

122
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:28,840
is it concise, is it courteous, is it consistent with the way you do things,

123
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,173
is it compelling?

124
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:34,173
And you will improve the impact of your emails immediately.

125
00:06:34,173 --> 00:06:39,900
So I call these Michael's 5 C's, Clear, Concise,

126
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,082
Courteous, Consistent, and Compelling.

127
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:46,173
So you glance over your email and your subject,

128
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:49,173
does your email and your subject text meet this criteria?

129
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:51,840
If it does, great, hit the Send button.

130
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,481
If not, tweak it a little bit and then hit the Send button.

131
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:56,865
Okay,

132
00:06:56,865 --> 00:07:01,316
remember with emails you are not in the room with them reading

133
00:07:01,316 --> 00:07:04,173
it alongside them and filling in the blanks,

134
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,423
so to speak.

135
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:09,729
So to communicate effectively and to reduce or eliminate ambiguity,

136
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:14,173
having the structured template is very, very important.

137
00:07:14,173 --> 00:07:15,673
So to make your life more simple,

138
00:07:15,673 --> 00:07:18,316
come up with one or more templates that you can use.

139
00:07:18,316 --> 00:07:23,040
So maybe you can layout an email for a customer because it may be a certain way,

140
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,173
and then reuse it for your weekly updates,

141
00:07:25,173 --> 00:07:26,096
for example.

142
00:07:26,096 --> 00:07:29,788
The same approach may apply for each project,

143
00:07:29,788 --> 00:07:33,481
for your manager, so you may have different email templates that are formal,

144
00:07:33,481 --> 00:07:37,355
but they could all have a greeting, a soft opening,

145
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:39,673
a reason, action, closing, and signature,

146
00:07:39,673 --> 00:07:50,000
but slightly tweaked based on the audience you're going to send it to. Okay now let's check out formal status reports.
