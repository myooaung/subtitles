1
00:00:01,896 --> 00:00:05,896
Now let's talk about communicating with your customer with quality.

2
00:00:05,896 --> 00:00:08,674
Okay the first, consistently communicate.

3
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:13,146
Communication is key to managing customer's expectations,

4
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:19,296
providing clear and efficient ways for customers to communicate with your

5
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:22,146
business helps to continually reinforce expectations.

6
00:00:22,146 --> 00:00:25,896
Examples of communication are status emails,

7
00:00:25,896 --> 00:00:30,896
presentations, meetings, even hallway interactions and phone calls.

8
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:32,260
Next, open communication.

9
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,623
Okay, you know,

10
00:00:33,623 --> 00:00:39,665
your customer is looking to you to help them find solutions to

11
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,896
their business goals or operational issues.

12
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:45,665
You need to be well versed and able to speak to those

13
00:00:45,665 --> 00:00:50,351
possibilities or options quickly by openly discussing possible

14
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:53,896
solutions to a problem with the customer.

15
00:00:53,896 --> 00:00:57,146
By presenting alternative solutions, each with pros and cons,

16
00:00:57,146 --> 00:01:01,896
you can enable your customer to understand the complexity of a

17
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:06,396
particular problem and they may feel more involved and

18
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:08,714
committed to the solution of choice.

19
00:01:08,714 --> 00:01:12,896
Additionally, by rendering a clear picture of possible results,

20
00:01:12,896 --> 00:01:18,007
your customers won't have unrealistic expectations of how

21
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:21,896
simple or difficult the resolution will be.

22
00:01:21,896 --> 00:01:24,543
For example, there are two ways to go here,

23
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:29,078
we can build your own single sign on class library or buy

24
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:32,896
one off the shelf and configure it.

25
00:01:32,896 --> 00:01:35,039
Here are the cost differences, the pros and the cons,

26
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:37,182
and some long term effects of support.

27
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:41,896
Then recommend which one may be the best for the customer,

28
00:01:41,896 --> 00:01:47,896
not you, based on the business requirements you know he or she has.

29
00:01:47,896 --> 00:01:51,281
This gives the customer their choice to pick and at the

30
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:55,588
same time they know the pros and cons,

31
00:01:55,588 --> 00:01:59,896
which helps set and manage their expectations.

32
00:01:59,896 --> 00:02:02,146
Next is transparency.

33
00:02:02,146 --> 00:02:07,096
Now transparency is absolutely critical to managing customer

34
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:10,325
expectations effectively and will effect a client's ability

35
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:12,896
to trust you and your team.

36
00:02:12,896 --> 00:02:19,229
You want your customer to be confident in you and your team at all times.

37
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:23,753
Transparency will result in positive experiences with your customers,

38
00:02:23,753 --> 00:02:24,896
enhancing trust.

39
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:30,896
So be clear, that is to be transparent and able to be easily comprehended,

40
00:02:30,896 --> 00:02:32,496
and if I may, no BS.

41
00:02:32,496 --> 00:02:33,029
For example,

42
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:37,204
do not discuss a bunch of technical jargon to confuse your customer about

43
00:02:37,204 --> 00:02:41,039
how hard something is so you can delay your due date.

44
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,325
Instead,

45
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:46,296
tell them that the skill level in one area of your team is not sufficient.

46
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:49,896
You have to learn more than what we realize,

47
00:02:49,896 --> 00:02:53,896
maybe even pulling in a consulting company to get up to speed,

48
00:02:53,896 --> 00:02:57,896
and because of that we have to delay delivery by 5 days.

49
00:02:57,896 --> 00:02:58,967
So on the plus side,

50
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:01,182
we now have additional knowledge and this may help shorten

51
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:04,325
our schedule in other areas based on how that you're going

52
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:08,896
to be smarter and learn more, maybe partnering with the consulting company.

53
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:11,204
Be honest from the get go.

54
00:03:11,204 --> 00:03:13,127
Though it may sound counterintuitive,

55
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:17,078
I always tell potential new clients or current clients,

56
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:20,682
in our initial conversations that there are no guarantees.

57
00:03:20,682 --> 00:03:24,896
As with most things in life there are too many factors at

58
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:26,896
play to make any grandiose promises,

59
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:31,896
especially in today's very complex technical and business world.

60
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:34,896
There may be some things that you can predict estimates and schedules for,

61
00:03:34,896 --> 00:03:38,229
and others may just be too fuzzy to do so.

62
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:40,819
Although it may feel uncomfortable for you,

63
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:46,896
I think that saying this clearly and in no uncertain terms positions the

64
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:50,896
customer to understand the process behind your work.

65
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:55,127
For example, you could share how to manage your work intake,

66
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:58,623
work requests come in from the business analyst,

67
00:03:58,623 --> 00:04:02,050
it's reviewed, estimated, and placed in a backlog.

68
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,896
Then by working with the customer you review the items,

69
00:04:05,896 --> 00:04:08,896
the customer chooses their priorities, and you begin work.

70
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:12,467
In this way the customer clearly sees that the work

71
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:16,396
according to a process and plan and the customer can have

72
00:04:16,396 --> 00:04:18,896
some amount of control over the process.

73
00:04:18,896 --> 00:04:24,896
This example actually embodies honesty, transparency, and open communication.

74
00:04:24,896 --> 00:04:27,896
Now what do all these attributes have in common?

75
00:04:27,896 --> 00:04:28,896
Well trust.

76
00:04:28,896 --> 00:04:36,146
Trust is your secret weapon to not be a better manager and service provider,

77
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:39,896
but a great leader as well.

78
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:43,078
Trust leads to long lasting business relationships,

79
00:04:43,078 --> 00:04:51,896
which enables a healthy working environment and successful careers for everyone.

80
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:54,623
This talk about consistency in writing,

81
00:04:54,623 --> 00:05:01,896
you can better manage customer expectations by following up in a timely fashion.

82
00:05:01,896 --> 00:05:05,039
You do not want your customer to wonder about whether you

83
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,742
understood their need or request or requirement.

84
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:13,771
You need to always close the loop so that they know you

85
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,896
understood and are taking actions.

86
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:20,896
You should do this, more often than not, by using written communications.

87
00:05:20,896 --> 00:05:24,896
Of course there will be times you may have a phone call or a hallway discussion,

88
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:28,825
but I suggest to you strongly to follow up even those

89
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:32,229
encounters with a quick email as well.

90
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:38,532
The written word helps ensure what was said, it makes history.

91
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:43,467
Talks about what actions are required, what has transpired,

92
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:46,896
and other important and pertinent data.

93
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:51,896
It also provides an audit trail of discussions for later reference.

94
00:05:51,896 --> 00:05:54,029
We're all busy and we all forget things.

95
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:57,229
We can go back and look at written communication to

96
00:05:57,229 --> 00:05:59,896
follow that thread and that trail.

97
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:03,896
The customer really likes and appreciates that.

98
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,896
For example, if it is a bug fix,

99
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:09,682
be sure to follow up with an email stating the bug is fixed,

100
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:12,896
it will be in the next release, et cetera.

101
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:16,896
This makes the customer comfortable and prepared.

102
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:19,467
If you have a status meeting you follow up with meeting notes,

103
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:21,896
and email them out to all the attendees.

104
00:06:21,896 --> 00:06:28,563
If you are planning future projects, you provide information about each project,

105
00:06:28,563 --> 00:06:30,896
budgets, et cetera.

106
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:31,753
Next is meetings.

107
00:06:31,753 --> 00:06:36,229
I know, most of you may think meetings are just a waste of time,

108
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,896
and how knows, maybe some are.

109
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:42,896
So it is your job to make the most of a meeting with your customers.

110
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:48,039
Have an agenda, again, that is written, have an outcome in mind,

111
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:52,610
which is written so when it is over you have the information or data you

112
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,896
need to keep the projects or activities moving forward.

113
00:06:56,896 --> 00:07:02,896
Again, this is an opportunity to get a read on their expectations as well.

114
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:05,229
For example, review open activities or tasks,

115
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:08,896
ask your customer if there are any issues with each of them,

116
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:11,753
review the due dates, get a read for each item.

117
00:07:11,753 --> 00:07:17,039
At the end of the meeting ask if there's anything else you can do for them.

118
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,039
If their expectations are what you think,

119
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:25,896
then great, if they are not, then you must manage those mismatched expectations.

120
00:07:25,896 --> 00:07:26,296
For example,

121
00:07:26,296 --> 00:07:28,896
you are expecting task 12 to be done by Friday and based on

122
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:31,396
the other new requirements you gave me,

123
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:35,496
that needs to slip or the other task needs to slip,

124
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,896
which one is the most important?

125
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:43,896
Negotiate, come to an agreement and document it in writing.

126
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:47,563
Now that you're both in sync on these expectations that's good,

127
00:07:47,563 --> 00:07:51,532
hence you must write meeting minutes, email them out,

128
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:55,674
documenting all the agreements, notes and status items.

129
00:07:55,674 --> 00:07:58,696
This keeps everyone's expectations on track.

130
00:07:58,696 --> 00:08:04,819
If you do not write meeting notes then it is all from memory and guess what?

131
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,896
We all know the customer will only remember that you

132
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:10,169
must do everything by yesterday,

133
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:14,351
so we must write meeting minutes to make sure we're

134
00:08:14,351 --> 00:08:16,896
on the same page and in sync.

135
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:21,896
Next emails, so use emails to keep in regular contact with your customers.

136
00:08:21,896 --> 00:08:25,896
Not only emails, you want face to face meetings and such as well.

137
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:30,896
Some emails may be more formal with status reports, others can be simple.

138
00:08:30,896 --> 00:08:36,396
For example, hey just a note, we are on track with the new release for Friday,

139
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:41,325
we only have one issue at this time, we may need to reach out to you for help.

140
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:43,110
What did this just say?

141
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,753
This says to your customer the following,

142
00:08:45,753 --> 00:08:50,896
you are working on their stuff, things seem to be going well,

143
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:52,325
there may be one issue.

144
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:56,563
So that gives them a subtle clue that there could be a problem.

145
00:08:56,563 --> 00:09:01,021
So you're setting their expectation so it won't be a surprise.

146
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:05,896
And lastly, you might reach out to them if you need their help,

147
00:09:05,896 --> 00:09:07,696
that's very important.

148
00:09:07,696 --> 00:09:11,896
It makes them feel inclusive and supportive.

149
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:13,096
Now reports.

150
00:09:13,096 --> 00:09:17,896
Probably not everyone's favorite task during the week,

151
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:21,467
but reports show a clear delineation of work that was

152
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:25,039
done over a course of a week or a month.

153
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,896
Remember reports don't have to be very long,

154
00:09:27,896 --> 00:09:30,896
or in a format that clogs up all your time when you email.

155
00:09:30,896 --> 00:09:35,896
A simple email detailing tasks completed for the week shows your clients

156
00:09:35,896 --> 00:09:40,896
what they're paying for and thus keeps them happy.

157
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:44,325
Hopefully by following these steps you'll be on the road to an

158
00:09:44,325 --> 00:09:46,714
even better relationship with your clients.

159
00:09:46,714 --> 00:09:50,271
By following this process you'll most likely achieve

160
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:52,896
better results in your work as well.

161
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:55,396
Next, let's talk about marketing.

162
00:09:55,396 --> 00:10:00,325
You want to subtly market what you and your team does.

163
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:04,610
This is very important to set expectations for the client as well.

164
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,539
So you'll want to market your team and what they can

165
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:10,229
do for your customer or business.

166
00:10:10,229 --> 00:10:15,229
And what I mean by that is when you're speaking or writing during emails,

167
00:10:15,229 --> 00:10:17,563
meetings, reports, et cetera,

168
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:21,434
adding a few items that market and promote the

169
00:10:21,434 --> 00:10:23,896
things you and your team do is great.

170
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:26,896
Don't overdo it and brag about things certainly.

171
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:28,146
Here's an example,

172
00:10:28,146 --> 00:10:32,696
the team completed release 23 on Thursday as planned and I

173
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:35,896
want to thank my team for staying late.

174
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:37,563
Your customer will appreciate how hard your team is working

175
00:10:37,563 --> 00:10:41,896
to get something done and you have also shown your

176
00:10:41,896 --> 00:10:44,896
appreciation to your team as well.

177
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:47,204
Another example may be in a status report where you

178
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:48,819
mention other services you perform.

179
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:52,973
This may result in more work, growing your team,

180
00:10:52,973 --> 00:11:01,000
and expanding opportunities for your team's technical growth and your management growth as well.
