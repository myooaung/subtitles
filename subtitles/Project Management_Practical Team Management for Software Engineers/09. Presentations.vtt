00:00:01.038 --> 00:00:05.038
As a manager, you will absolutely need to give presentations.

2
00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:06.238
Don't want to?

3
00:00:06.238 --> 00:00:09.038
Well then management is not for you.

4
00:00:09.038 --> 00:00:14.038
They are a key part of your new team's success, so get good at them.

5
00:00:14.038 --> 00:00:15.705
Okay, well what's a presentation?

6
00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:19.192
It is basically you standing in front of an audience,

7
00:00:19.192 --> 00:00:23.038
not sitting hitting the keyboard, I want you to stand,

8
00:00:23.038 --> 00:00:25.288
and it can be a small or large audience,

9
00:00:25.288 --> 00:00:28.038
talking and presenting your material using a media device,

10
00:00:28.038 --> 00:00:30.961
like a screen, and likely using a presentation tool,

11
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:34.038
like PowerPoint or any one you might like to use.

12
00:00:34.038 --> 00:00:39.038
Now you are making the presentation for a reason, a purpose.

13
00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:45.038
You want something typically from your audience, an expected outcome.

14
00:00:45.038 --> 00:00:46.238
This is really important.

15
00:00:46.238 --> 00:00:47.738
Before you write your presentation,

16
00:00:47.738 --> 00:00:51.163
determine what it is that you want the outcome to be,

17
00:00:51.163 --> 00:00:56.038
write it down and use it as a guide as you build your presentation.

18
00:00:56.038 --> 00:00:59.884
And after you write each slide or develop each slide,

19
00:00:59.884 --> 00:01:02.705
does that slide contribute to your expected outcome?

20
00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:05.038
If not, change or delete the slide.

21
00:01:05.038 --> 00:01:10.765
Now some benefits here, when you're trying to convey and communicate with others,

22
00:01:10.765 --> 00:01:13.674
in a presentation format you are interacting with

23
00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:15.856
your audience about your topic.

24
00:01:15.856 --> 00:01:19.895
Observe their reactions to what you say and show,

25
00:01:19.895 --> 00:01:22.038
gauge their level of understanding.

26
00:01:22.038 --> 00:01:26.538
Emphasize your key points and assess the level and

27
00:01:26.538 --> 00:01:29.538
quality of acceptance of your message.

28
00:01:29.538 --> 00:01:35.192
This gives you a real time opportunity to adjust or tweak your

29
00:01:35.192 --> 00:01:39.493
message to further make your key points and to better ensure

30
00:01:39.493 --> 00:01:41.765
you get your intended outcome.

31
00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:45.705
So the benefit to presentations is the real time feedback,

32
00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:49.856
their body language and validation or maybe even rejection of your message,

33
00:01:49.856 --> 00:01:53.423
you can't get that with texting, you can't get that with emails,

34
00:01:53.423 --> 00:01:55.038
you can't get that with status reports.

35
00:01:55.038 --> 00:02:02.038
Okay, now let's see why having your outcome in mind is essential.

36
00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:05.038
So here are my recommendations for successful presentations.

37
00:02:05.038 --> 00:02:06.038
As I mentioned before,

38
00:02:06.038 --> 00:02:09.238
have the outcome in mind before you start writing your presentation,

39
00:02:09.238 --> 00:02:12.038
know exactly what you want to accomplish.

40
00:02:12.038 --> 00:02:14.576
If you were given a topic or assignment from your manager,

41
00:02:14.576 --> 00:02:18.038
review it and be sure you fully understand it before you begin.

42
00:02:18.038 --> 00:02:20.038
Now who is your audience?

43
00:02:20.038 --> 00:02:24.038
Well find out and know who your audience will be,

44
00:02:24.038 --> 00:02:29.038
what they may expect from the presentation and who are you about to talk.

45
00:02:29.038 --> 00:02:33.038
Maybe who you thought would be there is not, maybe others have shown up.

46
00:02:33.038 --> 00:02:34.467
Always be prepared to adapt.

47
00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:37.493
As long as the core message is in your presentation,

48
00:02:37.493 --> 00:02:44.346
you can use words to evolve or adapt and reengineer your message if need be.

49
00:02:44.346 --> 00:02:48.038
So that's why I like very lean presentations.

50
00:02:48.038 --> 00:02:50.438
If you have bulleted items and they're 2 or 3 sentences each,

51
00:02:50.438 --> 00:02:52.705
throw it away, red flag, not good.

52
00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:56.927
As you've seen in this presentation, maybe other Pluralsight presentations,

53
00:02:56.927 --> 00:03:00.038
you want really lean and mean screens.

54
00:03:00.038 --> 00:03:01.638
Lastly, research your topic,

55
00:03:01.638 --> 00:03:05.238
it's important to spend enough time collecting and confirming

56
00:03:05.238 --> 00:03:08.765
information in order to speak with confidence and knowledge.

57
00:03:08.765 --> 00:03:10.220
Let me repeat that,

58
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.538
confidence and knowledge will be felt and believed by your audience and

59
00:03:15.538 --> 00:03:19.705
they will then translate that into believing your message.

60
00:03:19.705 --> 00:03:25.038
I know that might sound kind of, really, is that how it works?

61
00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.038
But many times it does.

62
00:03:27.038 --> 00:03:29.788
So you need to be confident and knowledgeable and typically your

63
00:03:29.788 --> 00:03:33.269
message will be more acceptable and agreeable.

64
00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.038
Okay, now let's see a few more.

65
00:03:37.038 --> 00:03:41.038
Now let's get organized and do some planning for our presentations.

66
00:03:41.038 --> 00:03:43.807
So organize the main points in the most appropriate

67
00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:46.288
order for the topic you're presenting.

68
00:03:46.288 --> 00:03:50.038
Avoid writing complete sentences or paragraphs,

69
00:03:50.038 --> 00:03:51.538
and maybe not even prepare note cards,

70
00:03:51.538 --> 00:03:54.371
but you can to help you elaborate on the information presented.

71
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:57.638
I prefer you spending time with short, short bullets,

72
00:03:57.638 --> 00:04:03.038
understanding your topic, use eye contact and not notes.

73
00:04:03.038 --> 00:04:05.038
But if you're still learning and that gives you a little more confidence,

74
00:04:05.038 --> 00:04:06.163
then go ahead.

75
00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:10.288
But the goal is to have no note cards to me,

76
00:04:10.288 --> 00:04:12.371
be confident, and present the message.

77
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:16.238
Okay align your presentation too to a bigger purpose or goal.

78
00:04:16.238 --> 00:04:19.038
What's it tying into for the business?

79
00:04:19.038 --> 00:04:21.038
What are the business drivers, the real reasons why you're there?

80
00:04:21.038 --> 00:04:24.038
It's kind of back to purpose again in your outcome.

81
00:04:24.038 --> 00:04:28.038
You know, maybe it's tied to the company's strategic interests and objectives.

82
00:04:28.038 --> 00:04:29.674
And then determine your delivery medium,

83
00:04:29.674 --> 00:04:31.038
you know, I mentioned PowerPoint,

84
00:04:31.038 --> 00:04:34.038
it's become almost the ultimate most widely used presentation program around,

85
00:04:34.038 --> 00:04:36.324
but there are a lot of great tools,

86
00:04:36.324 --> 00:04:40.324
use what makes sense for you and maybe fits your corporate standard as well,

87
00:04:40.324 --> 00:04:43.905
but you may also need to display text in a certain way or

88
00:04:43.905 --> 00:04:46.371
movies or videos and have a graphic set that,

89
00:04:46.371 --> 00:04:50.038
you know, can really show the points you're trying to make.

90
00:04:50.038 --> 00:04:50.252
Alright,

91
00:04:50.252 --> 00:04:57.000
so that's kind of presentations in a nutshell and now let's move on to formal meetings.
