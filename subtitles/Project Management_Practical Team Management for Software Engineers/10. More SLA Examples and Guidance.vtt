00:00:01.616 --> 00:00:06.231
The next attribute is problem reporting and that's defined as a call

2
00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:10.616
center and issue tracking system that's used to log,

3
00:00:10.616 --> 00:00:13.449
manage, remediate, and report all issues.

4
00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:18.330
A detailed example would be the call center receives calls from 6:00

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.330
AM to 6:00 PM Monday through Friday or the customer can log their

6
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.616
issues directly at the following URL.

7
00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:29.462
That's how we define then problem reporting and

8
00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:34.616
what the customer can do about it.

9
00:00:34.616 --> 00:00:38.616
The next attribute is monitoring and reporting.

10
00:00:38.616 --> 00:00:39.949
So the manager, you,

11
00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.078
of the sales apps is responsible for monitoring and

12
00:00:43.078 --> 00:00:45.385
reporting on the sales systems.

13
00:00:45.385 --> 00:00:49.866
And the detailed example would be that I provide weekly

14
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:55.283
written status reports to the customers as well as conduct a

15
00:00:55.283 --> 00:00:58.616
quarterly customer planning meeting.

16
00:00:58.616 --> 00:01:03.616
The next attribute is consequences, in other words, where the buck stops.

17
00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:06.693
And as a manager of the sales apps you're responsible

18
00:01:06.693 --> 00:01:09.416
to remediate any customer feedback, complaints,

19
00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:10.616
and issues.

20
00:01:10.616 --> 00:01:13.949
And the example details would be they could call the

21
00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:16.847
manager of the sales apps anytime, which is you,

22
00:01:16.847 --> 00:01:19.616
and also the manager will work with my management,

23
00:01:19.616 --> 00:01:23.216
the business, steering groups, et cetera,

24
00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:25.616
for any remediation options.

25
00:01:25.616 --> 00:01:25.991
So again,

26
00:01:25.991 --> 00:01:28.616
on the left has always been kind of the what and on the right

27
00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:33.616
is examples of how you'll implement that.

28
00:01:33.616 --> 00:01:37.616
In the final example I want to talk about constraints.

29
00:01:37.616 --> 00:01:41.045
These are typically things you are not going to do or might

30
00:01:41.045 --> 00:01:43.154
limit your service or product offerings.

31
00:01:43.154 --> 00:01:48.154
For example, one of the items is 24 hour support is not provided.

32
00:01:48.154 --> 00:01:54.283
The second is you have a budget of only 200 hours per week for development,

33
00:01:54.283 --> 00:01:55.616
those are constraints.

34
00:01:55.616 --> 00:02:01.616
Some other details would be special case off-hour support can be scheduled.

35
00:02:01.616 --> 00:02:03.616
Okay that's good, the customer may like that.

36
00:02:03.616 --> 00:02:09.616
And also additional budget can be used for adding contractor resources.

37
00:02:09.616 --> 00:02:12.187
Now in all these examples I've given over the last several slides,

38
00:02:12.187 --> 00:02:15.187
these are a subset of the attributes that you may use,

39
00:02:15.187 --> 00:02:17.693
you may come up with other attributes that you'd like to add.

40
00:02:17.693 --> 00:02:20.283
And of course, for each of these attributes I've talked about,

41
00:02:20.283 --> 00:02:23.675
I've gone pretty light weight, but you get the idea,

42
00:02:23.675 --> 00:02:28.616
this helps lay out what it is you do and how you do it.

43
00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:32.616
This will set and manage expectations with the customers.

44
00:02:32.616 --> 00:02:37.616
Now I'd like to give you a little guidance about how to write these SLAs.

45
00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:41.001
On this slide we'll cover some general guidance on how you

46
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:44.889
might use or apply SLAs on your organization.

47
00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:50.343
Now informal definitions of services or lack therefore tend to cause

48
00:02:50.343 --> 00:02:54.283
customers to perceive their expectations are not being met.

49
00:02:54.283 --> 00:02:58.343
Formal definitions tend to make known more clearly what is

50
00:02:58.343 --> 00:03:01.616
expected from you and therefore cause customers to perceive

51
00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:04.016
that their expectations are being met,

52
00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:07.949
assuming you are delivering the same service level in either case.

53
00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:10.172
Of course SLAs help clarify expectations.

54
00:03:10.172 --> 00:03:16.838
Hey if it's all written down, jointly understood, things should be pretty clear.

55
00:03:16.838 --> 00:03:18.616
It's basically a contract.

56
00:03:18.616 --> 00:03:24.616
Now SLAs may work better for external services that you need.

57
00:03:24.616 --> 00:03:25.616
In other words,

58
00:03:25.616 --> 00:03:28.616
you hire a consulting company or a contracting company

59
00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:30.016
and they're going to work for you,

60
00:03:30.016 --> 00:03:32.866
make sure there's an SLA so you can hold them accountable.

61
00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:36.199
If you don't use them with your customers,

62
00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:40.616
you might consider using the SLAs for outside work you need.

63
00:03:40.616 --> 00:03:47.001
Next, SLAs may be a bit too overwhelming for some IT teams and their customers.

64
00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:49.693
They may be a bit too formal,

65
00:03:49.693 --> 00:03:53.283
too picky and sometimes can create an area of antagonism.

66
00:03:53.283 --> 00:03:56.060
Be careful in their use for internal customers,

67
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.838
a potential problem, formalism,

68
00:03:57.838 --> 00:04:04.616
can create an atmosphere of uncomfortableness in your working relationship.

69
00:04:04.616 --> 00:04:05.616
It might degrade trust even.

70
00:04:05.616 --> 00:04:06.016
In fact,

71
00:04:06.016 --> 00:04:08.949
it might be that you use an SLA with one customer group

72
00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.616
and in another no SLA is even needed.

73
00:04:11.616 --> 00:04:12.866
You can choose either one.

74
00:04:12.866 --> 00:04:15.231
But for external customers, I would recommend using them.

75
00:04:15.231 --> 00:04:17.385
Maybe try using a light weight approach,

76
00:04:17.385 --> 00:04:23.616
almost like I did in my example, of most of the categories we discussed.

77
00:04:23.616 --> 00:04:24.866
And maybe not too detailed,

78
00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:27.616
more general working guidelines so you can still set expectations,

79
00:04:27.616 --> 00:04:30.616
but not beat them over the head with them.

80
00:04:30.616 --> 00:04:33.616
They may be based on the type of customer you have too.

81
00:04:33.616 --> 00:04:37.616
If they are more forgiving then maybe you don't need so much detail.

82
00:04:37.616 --> 00:04:41.216
If they are extremely challenging, very challenging to manage,

83
00:04:41.216 --> 00:04:46.616
then layout an SLA to help contain and manage the relationship.

84
00:04:46.616 --> 00:04:48.462
If you follow the model presented,

85
00:04:48.462 --> 00:04:51.687
you have a nice PowerPoint deck here to mark it,

86
00:04:51.687 --> 00:04:54.187
if you will, or share with others,

87
00:04:54.187 --> 00:04:58.616
about what you do and how you deliver to the necessary standards.

88
00:04:58.616 --> 00:05:02.616
So whether it is signed or agreed to or not,

89
00:05:02.616 --> 00:05:07.416
you have a nice approach on how to write down and

90
00:05:07.416 --> 00:05:11.616
represent to others what you and your team do.

91
00:05:11.616 --> 00:05:13.216
This is very important.

92
00:05:13.216 --> 00:05:15.616
Now let's pivot to customer service.

93
00:05:15.616 --> 00:05:17.616
So how is your customer service?

94
00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:19.616
Oh, you think really that good?

95
00:05:19.616 --> 00:05:21.045
Well how you do know?

96
00:05:21.045 --> 00:05:28.000
Let's talk about customer service in the next section and how you can measure it.
