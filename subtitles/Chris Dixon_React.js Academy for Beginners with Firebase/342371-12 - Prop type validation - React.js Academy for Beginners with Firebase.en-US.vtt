00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
when passing around data between components,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.180
it is a good idea to provide some validation.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.150
Jacquet component is getting exactly the data which it needs.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.620
For example,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.380
if a component expects an object but gets an array,

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.650
it could break our up.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.590
And this is exactly what we've seen before,

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.410
when we needed to convert an object using object darkies.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.650
This will be using proper types,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.650
which is a library provided by Facebook to perform these checks.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.400
It is simple to get open running words improvises with errors during development.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.390
The owners.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.950
If our prototype fails,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.260
let's install this over in the terminal.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.780
We can close down or terminal with command or control,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.490
see no money to install this from MPM with the MP M I,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.810
and then the package name,

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.210
which is prop types.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.040
It's answer and give us a few moments to install inside of your project and then come back

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.940
once this is done.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.720
Okay,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.230
welcome back.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.660
Once this is installed,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.800
we need to import it into each file which receives the props.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.360
Let's begin at the top of the tree,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.150
which is the upto Js.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.810
This is the very top level,

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.020
so it doesn't receive any prompts from of components.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.890
But instead he does pass props down to the home and also the boards later on.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.510
In the course the home components receives the boards on the type of the boards is in Ray

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.550
and also create new board is a function.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.450
So let's begin over in this home component.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.240
How could begin a work problem?

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.890
Validation.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.640
First of all,

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.660
at the top of the file,

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.470
we can import the package prototypes.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.470
Comfortable.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.070
P Auntie could impart this from the proper times module.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.280
Okay,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.940
so next I'm going to set up these prop types right out of the bottom.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:00.550
The file.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.450
I want to do this just above our export defaults.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.120
We can do this with the name of all components,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.950
which is home.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.810
Never gone.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.220
Set the proper types.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.560
So little case P.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.350
In this case,

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.240
on immigrants,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.010
that is equal to an object which will contain the prototype for each proper,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.150
which is passed down.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.150
The 1st 1 is for the boards.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.870
Then we can set to the proper types,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.150
which is capital P anti,

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.050
which is the one we imported up at the top.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.620
And then after this concert,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.750
what type of data we expect to receive if we time thought.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.780
We can see some of these suggestions inside here when we want.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.450
In this case is an array.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.220
You can also set this to be a required field which is required separated by a comma.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.450
We can also do the same for our second prop,

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.500
which is create new board.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.850
Great new ball This time is a function and we can declare we want a type of function with

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.250
bunk.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.790
This is also required.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.890
So also changes on to the end.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.810
The next thing to do is to restart our server with MPM stars.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.470
Once this is done looking out testes,

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.250
aisles over in the browser,

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.650
we don't see any problems at the moment.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.650
But if we change one of the proper types,

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.850
let's say from array to be a type of object.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.500
Let's say this.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.070
I mean,

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:39.850
I'll see a failed prop type that so called back and changes to be an array once more under

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.850
,

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.850
Then save this final.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.270
Let's go into the sidebar.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:50.110
The next one down is the board dot Js board dot Js is not currently receiving a props has

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.170
moved down to the ball preview.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.350
We will come back to this board later on in the course,

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.740
just like before.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:04.820
The first thing to do is to import the proper types and then,

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.150
after this week in once more,

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.020
go right down to the very bottom,

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.280
just above our export default,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.390
the component name,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.280
off board preview and then set the proper time with a lower case,

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.750
be as that it's up to be equal to object.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.750
The one and only proper that the ball preview is can is from home.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.050
And if we go up when we're internally board preview was sending the board prop.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.550
This is a type of object.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.880
Let's set up the prop types Capital P and A Capital T.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.820
This is a type of objects on that.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.850
This is also required to the next components down in the sidebar is going to be the card.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.690
Let's click on this.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.650
We will come back to this soon,

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.420
since we're not using this card components just yet in our project.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.150
So finally we have the list doctor s components.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.340
This takes in a list,

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.150
so also needs a proper type.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:16.790
Let's do our imports about the top in full prototypes from prop types scroll down.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.520
We can set these up at the bottom with less door prop types,

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.190
so I will object up the single prop type.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:33.290
Which receiving is the list the prototype is an object on.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.420
This is also required to We will,

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.870
of course,

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:37.430
on today's.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.950
As we passed more props on also create more components,

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.670
they can't doctors.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.810
Component we mentioned for is not currently in use,

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.950
but we're going to make use of this now by including it for each card in our sample data.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.750
As we see here,

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.250
the card component is nested inside off each list,

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.010
meaning when it's on this over in the list.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.470
Doctor,

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.350
as components,

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.690
let's head over to the list.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:04.530
Dr A s arm.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:05.350
We can do this now.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.110
So inside here it's goes down the side ball.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.750
We're going to rent out a car components for each card in a list.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.750
Remember the sample data as a cards array on one card,

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:20.850
a rate per list.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:27.720
So let's go through the list and we can do this now by my pin through all props underneath

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.640
the title.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.670
On Underneath the list.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:30.090
Harder.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:35.590
Let's open up the curly braces this time is a object.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.850
So we also need to run object jockeys to transform our props into an array.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.080
The props once transform.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.050
Is this not props?

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.150
The list Note cards.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:49.750
What?

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.850
I'm going to mop through the results.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.250
Each item will be giving this key variable name.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.320
And then inside of these rockets,

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.450
we cannot put one card per item found in the loop.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.250
And make sure this has to close and rockets,

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.100
and then inside here,

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.950
we can all put over card components,

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:11.750
make you this is still imported about the top of the file,

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.750
which is we cannot a key,

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.710
but you're going to be equal to all key.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:19.390
Valuable.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.450
We can pass the data as props.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.250
This is going to be this.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.810
No props.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:31.150
Don't list dot com and then inside the square brackets would pass in the key.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:37.350
Close this off with a forward slash on the factors on this onto its online.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.350
There we go.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.310
Okay,

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.250
so now we're rendering out a card on passing the props.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.270
Let's head over to the card,

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:46.680
Doctor.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.160
Yes,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.850
We can all handle this data passed to it.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.610
At the moment,

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.050
we just have a div which is going to rent out the text.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:08:03.340
So first things first we could go up to the top on import our prototypes and from the

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.550
proper times package.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:11.680
Then at these right at the very bottom above our export default.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.990
The component name of cards.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:18.050
No prob times set up a object.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:24.550
The proper name is data on the prop type is an object,

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.350
which is also required.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.670
So before we go any further,

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:39.520
let's say this card components and then go over to the browser and we have a never in the

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.350
list line 15.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.930
Let's go there now line 15.

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:44.760
We have the data.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.250
This top prop start list.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.050
Andi should be cards within s on the end.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.990
Let's try this now.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.540
Good.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.250
So now let's see a list title and also the cards assigned to each one.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.930
It is a little difficult to see what's going on.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:00.210
No,

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.950
because the styling is missing,

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.080
you know,

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:03.660
components.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.500
So we have bean,

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:04.790
adding,

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.990
it's,

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.110
um,

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:06.510
classes as we go along.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.710
Such as The list had a on also this list,

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:16.050
and they have also provided some CSS to go with his course to make up look a bit better.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.180
You can find this CSS file as they download with the course.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.410
So go ahead and grab the CSS as a down lord.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:24.710
And then once you don't know,

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.450
we can paste this inside of the app dot CSS.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:33.050
So I'm going to remove all of the existing styles and then paste in all styles which have

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:33.710
been provided.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:40.140
So now if we give this final save and go off to the browser So now we can see more clearly

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.230
our free list in the sample data,

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:46.850
we have our list titles and then we have two cards inside of each list.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:52.250
So there is still a bit of work to do but can now see the list in cars more clearly.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.050
So this is it now for our prop types.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.000
I'm all answer this as we go for the rest of the course.
