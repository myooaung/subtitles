00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.435
In React earlier days,

00:00:03.435 --> 00:00:07.125
creating a new project involved a lot of setup work.

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:10.410
We had to install and configure tools such as bubble and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.015
Webb Park and the setup time could put off a lot of beginners.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:18.555
Now we have a great tool called Create React app,

00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:21.180
which is a really quick and simple way to get

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.030
started with react without getting caught up in

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.205
all of the initial setup and configuration and it's also officially supported too.

00:00:30.205 --> 00:00:33.635
We use Create React app from the terminal,

00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:35.160
but it's only a few commands,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.035
so don't worry, if you're not a regular terminal user.

00:00:39.035 --> 00:00:43.820
In fact, we can even use the one provided in Visual Studio Code.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.865
Let's open up Visual Studio Code.

00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:51.230
If we go to terminal and new terminal,

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.310
if you also have a separate terminal which you'd like to use too,

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.075
this is completely fine and it's no problem in doing so.

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:03.005
By default, it will open up in the home directory.

00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:05.975
We can use the CD command just to make sure,

00:01:05.975 --> 00:01:11.965
so type CD then Enter then we'll take it to your roots user directory.

00:01:11.965 --> 00:01:14.475
We can then type LS.

00:01:14.475 --> 00:01:18.200
This will then give us a list of files and folders for the user.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.850
Notice the desktop here and this is where I'm going to be adding my projects.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.635
I'm going to CD into the desktop and hit Enter.

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:31.640
You can create this project anywhere on your machine which you prefer.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.955
I want to keep this on the desktop for easy access.

00:01:34.955 --> 00:01:38.720
Then we want to run the command NPX,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.370
create React app, separated by hyphens.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.460
Then the name of our project,

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.250
which I'm going to call reacts Trello and then hit enter.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.000
This might take a little while to run since it needs to pull in all of these scripts,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.780
dependencies and modules for react to run.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.390
Notice the NPX command at the start rather than NPM.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.400
NPX is a tool designed to easily install and manage CLI packages.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.720
It basically allows us to use Create React app,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.350
just this once without needing to install it on our system.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.320
Give us a few minutes to finish off and then

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.690
pause the video and I'll see you when this is finished.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.330
Okay, so once this is all installed,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.035
we need to change in to our project directory.

00:02:32.035 --> 00:02:35.750
We can do this by either typing in CD react Trello,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.295
as it says in the terminal,

00:02:37.295 --> 00:02:41.015
or we can drag over the project from our desktop.

00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:42.695
Grab the project folder,

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:48.440
drag this over and then open this up to drag this into Visual Studio code.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.570
You'll see this automatically opens up the terminal into our project location.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.975
You can now go ahead and start the development server.

00:02:56.975 --> 00:03:00.035
We do this with a command called NMP stars.

00:03:00.035 --> 00:03:02.820
Type this in and hit "Enter."

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.230
This will then setup the development server on localhost 3000.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.485
This will either open up automatically in the browser or can navigate to localhost 3000,

00:03:15.485 --> 00:03:22.175
just like this, hit "Enter" and now have a basic React app up and running in the browser.

00:03:22.175 --> 00:03:25.925
This is why we need to go to view our project in future.

00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:28.555
Unless you are running on a different port.

00:03:28.555 --> 00:03:30.870
If you want to make any changes,

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.190
all you need to do is to go into the text editor,

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.070
then into the source directory and the app.js.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.005
Don't worry about all of this code at the moment,

00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:45.500
let's just go down here into the p elements and say,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.680
"I'm learning react" save this.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.610
Saving this file will automatically cause the browser

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.355
to reload and update with our changes,

00:03:55.355 --> 00:03:56.905
which we just added in.

00:03:56.905 --> 00:04:01.850
We don't need to worry about refreshing the browser after each change.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.880
That's it now for our project setup.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.760
Next we'll go over what all of these files and folders

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.870
are which have been created for us using Create React app.
