00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.575
When a user logs in and out of our application,

00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:08.010
we need a way to track this and update the state.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.975
Firebase provides us with a method for this called onAuthStateChanged.

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:16.665
This will listen to any changes to our uses of status,

00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:19.380
and then we can update our own state.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.445
Doing this will allow us to protect certain views in our app,

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:27.045
such as the board's view if the user logs out.

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:32.535
We can't attach this listener once the components mounts in the auth context.

00:00:32.535 --> 00:00:36.585
Let's head over to the file of context.js,

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:42.070
and then we can add this in a life cycle method called component will mount.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.010
Inside here we're going to access a method

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.680
which is going to be called onAuthStateChanged.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.980
Inside here we're going to setup a function which takes in the user.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.280
If the AuthStateChanged has cause the user to log in,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.420
the user value will be stored inside of this variable.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.160
We're going to first check if the user is present i.e,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.680
if they have logged in.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.445
We'll then going to update the state with the current user value, with this.set.State.

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:22.204
Passing in our state objects,

00:01:22.204 --> 00:01:24.985
where we're going to update the user.

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:28.645
Our user object is going to contain a id,

00:01:28.645 --> 00:01:32.000
which is going to be equal to the user.id.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.330
We also need to grab the email,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.515
which is from the user.email.

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:41.450
This code will be triggered if the user has logged

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.690
in on the else user information if not,

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.490
we're going to add a else section,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.505
which is also going to update the state to be an empty object.

00:01:51.505 --> 00:01:55.355
Then we set the user to be our empty object,

00:01:55.355 --> 00:01:58.580
just like this, and we have an error message down here,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.135
so FirebaseAuth just like this,

00:02:02.135 --> 00:02:06.950
and we can also change our state just above to be an empty object.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.115
Since we now allowing Firebase to control this.

00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:16.585
Below this, we already providing this user data to over components down as the value.

00:02:16.585 --> 00:02:19.150
I scroll down, we have the user,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.770
and also in the header components.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.670
If we take a look here, we also imported this user just here,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.610
and then grabbing the user's email just below.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.480
Now let's go over to our projects and we can test this.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.820
Let's try logging out.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.415
We see the message of signed out.

00:02:37.415 --> 00:02:39.870
Let's try logging in.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.580
Good to not only do we get the logged in message in the console,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.120
we also see the user has now been entered into the header.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.895
Let's try logging out.

00:02:51.895 --> 00:02:54.435
On the header is also updated.

00:02:54.435 --> 00:02:56.120
Good, this is all now working,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.420
but now we just need to move this over to the right-hand side.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.495
To do this, let's go to the header.js.

00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:05.590
We can cut out all the user information.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.880
We can create a div as a rapper,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.765
[inaudible] back in, and then add a class name.

00:03:12.765 --> 00:03:17.285
Activate the CSS, which is going to be equal to user area.

00:03:17.285 --> 00:03:22.090
Save this, and this now pushes our user area to the right hand side.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.655
Good, so we now detecting that the user's logged in state,

00:03:25.655 --> 00:03:27.230
and in the next video,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.240
we can use this for conditional rendering.
