00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.945
Using React router we can also pass parameters via the URL to over pages.

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:11.055
Parameters are a section of the URL which can change.

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:17.040
For example, if we had a user which is logged in and either use ID such as user one,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.425
we could then add "/boards".

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:22.605
Would display all boards for user one.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:25.410
This user one section is dynamic,

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.090
meaning it will change depending on which user is logged in.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.840
Also the same if we were to have various boards.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.180
We could also have a board.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.815
Then forward slash with the board ID to just 100,

00:00:40.815 --> 00:00:44.584
meaning that the 100 section would be dynamic,

00:00:44.584 --> 00:00:50.425
stored inside a variable and then available for use with React router.

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:55.515
Let's go to our App.js and see how we can implement this.

00:00:55.515 --> 00:00:58.655
At the moment we have the forward slash,

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:01.325
which is rendering out our "home" components.

00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:04.100
Later on in this course, this forward slash route

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.920
will be used to render a login component.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.260
A user needs to login before seeing their own boards.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.835
Therefore, this now means this home component,

00:01:13.835 --> 00:01:15.740
which displays the user's boards,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.625
will need to be at a route such as this, so user one.

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:23.485
Then we can see the available boards for that logged in user.

00:01:23.485 --> 00:01:26.800
Now it's not practical to add a different route,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.760
with a different path, for every user which is logged in in our website.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.760
Instead what we can do is add a colon,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.640
to add a dynamic section,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.865
followed by a name which we want to add to this variable.

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:42.710
Let's call it the user ID.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.410
Now if we go over to the browser and we're to have "123/boards".

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.290
This would now rend out to the home component and then store

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.670
the value of 123 inside of this user ID.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.235
Because this section is dynamic,

00:02:00.235 --> 00:02:01.810
it will still render out

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.240
these "Home" components regardless of what value is placed inside here.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.805
If we open up the "React developer tools".

00:02:10.805 --> 00:02:13.260
Let's click on this tab and then search for

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.175
the "Home components" which we are currently viewing.

00:02:16.175 --> 00:02:19.280
Will just see the props over on the right-hand side with the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.870
"Boards" and also the "Create New board" function.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.944
There is currently no reference to this user ID.

00:02:26.944 --> 00:02:31.960
To say this, we need to pass down the router's data as a prop two.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.325
We could do this inside of the "Render prop."

00:02:35.325 --> 00:02:39.770
Inside here, we're going to pass in the props as variable to the function.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.005
Then inside of our "Home components",

00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:45.135
as are these were a separate line.

00:02:45.135 --> 00:02:48.790
We can also spread in the "Props."

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.025
This will then merge in the router's data with the rest of the props,

00:02:56.025 --> 00:02:58.650
which you pass to the "Home components."

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.250
Back over to the "Dev tools" Let's

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.830
"Reload" go into "React" and search for the "Home components".

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:15.365
Select this. Now alongside the "Boards" and "Create New board" we have three new props.

00:03:15.365 --> 00:03:17.055
This is the "History,

00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:19.120
location and match" props,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.490
which is all passed from the React router.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.715
We will look at these in more detail as we go through the rest of the course.

00:03:25.715 --> 00:03:30.475
But for now we can find the parameters or these URL parameters,

00:03:30.475 --> 00:03:35.440
inside of the props on the "Match" And then down to

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.140
"Params" We therefore have this user ID variable with the value of 4-5-6,

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.615
which is grabbed from this section here.

00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:50.710
Later we'll use this user ID to fetch the boards for the currently logged in user.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.730
But for now we can simply output the user in the "Home.js" file.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.540
Let's head over to the "Home."

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.755
and just above our "Create Board Form," I'm going to output a "Span."

00:04:04.755 --> 00:04:06.915
And to display the user ID,

00:04:06.915 --> 00:04:09.845
we'll do this just as we would with any other props.

00:04:09.845 --> 00:04:14.895
We can access this "topprops.match" Which is these props,

00:04:14.895 --> 00:04:16.410
which you have just here.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.010
We need "match.paramas," and then the user ID.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.605
Let's give this a save and then go over to the browser.

00:04:27.605 --> 00:04:31.205
We now have the variable of 4-5-6.

00:04:31.205 --> 00:04:35.405
Let's try a different value inside here, so user one.

00:04:35.405 --> 00:04:39.035
Now this params is displayed inside the browser.

00:04:39.035 --> 00:04:41.795
We can also do this for our boards.

00:04:41.795 --> 00:04:46.160
If we go back to our "App.js" and then scroll down

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.005
to our "Board components" We can now add in the board ID.

00:04:51.005 --> 00:04:57.680
Forward slash, this is a dynamic sections so we need z colon, the board ID.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.615
This will now allow us to go into the URL.

00:05:01.615 --> 00:05:07.355
Then at the "Board", and then "/boardID" just as one.

00:05:07.355 --> 00:05:10.000
Wherever dynamic data we pass in for

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.140
the board ID will still run out this board components.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.690
Then the board ID will be stored inside of this variable.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.675
Since we also need pass down the router's props in its component tool,

00:05:23.675 --> 00:05:27.880
we can replace the component with the render function.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.235
Let's add these onto the online.

00:05:31.235 --> 00:05:37.440
We can remove the "components" and then replace this with the "render."

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.560
This takes in a function which we're going to pass in the router's props.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.890
Inside here we then rend out our "Board components" on a separate line,

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.385
but can also spread in the "props",

00:05:51.385 --> 00:05:54.445
which are the ones provided by the router,

00:05:54.445 --> 00:05:57.024
and then close off our board components.

00:05:57.024 --> 00:05:59.740
Let's test this is working over in the browser.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.195
To have forward slash one.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.875
Let's try 5,000.

00:06:04.875 --> 00:06:07.240
For each number which you pass in,

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.915
we still see the "Board component" rendered to the screen.

00:06:10.915 --> 00:06:14.675
Let's search inside of the "Dev tools" for the board.

00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:16.845
We still have the props of "history,

00:06:16.845 --> 00:06:21.675
location" and "march" we grab the "paramas" inside here.

00:06:21.675 --> 00:06:24.740
With this now working we've taken another step towards

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.105
structure which we need for the final project.

00:06:28.105 --> 00:06:31.380
Couldn't though we're just typing in these URLs.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.540
But in the next video,

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.150
we will look at how we can navigate to these routes.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.715
When a user clicks on a "board" preview.

00:06:37.715 --> 00:06:40.160
And also how we can access the React router

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.670
features when it's not possible to pass down props.
