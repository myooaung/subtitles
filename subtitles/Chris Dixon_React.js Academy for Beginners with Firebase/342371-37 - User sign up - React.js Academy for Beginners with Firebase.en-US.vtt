00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.485
I will use a form is now ready to be wired up to a method to push a new user to Firebase.

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:12.510
Since we're using the context API to hold all of our user data,

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.940
I'm going to set this up over in there.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.600
Let's go over to all contexts dot JS.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.160
Then at the very top,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.960
we need to first impulse our reference to the firebaseAuth package.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.940
This is a named export,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.520
we do this inside of the curly braces.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.760
The firebaseAuth from Firebase package,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.205
which is dot-dot slash and then Firebase,

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:43.700
then we can create a sign-up method which will make use of the email and password,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.415
which will be entered into the form soon.

00:00:46.415 --> 00:00:48.035
Now down in our class,

00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:50.014
just below our state's objects,

00:00:50.014 --> 00:00:51.820
we can create a sign-up,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.410
which will be a sync taken in

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.410
the email and also the password and then finally the event information.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.830
Inside here we can create a try section and we can also catch any errors.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.260
Rather than outputting a console log we won't come back to this very soon.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.270
We'll add a hand lens soon.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.340
Just above the first thing we're going to do is to grab

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.645
the inventive mission and then prevent the default behavior.

00:01:25.645 --> 00:01:31.450
We can then make use of this firebaseAuth package which leads to [inaudible] both.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.840
We're going to wait, firebaseAuth

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.460
and then we can call a Firebase method which is

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.190
called CREATE_USER with email and password.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.675
Inside of the brackets, this takes in the email and password,

00:01:51.675 --> 00:01:53.030
which is going to be passed to

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.160
our method and this is all we need to do now for the sign-up method.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.100
The next thing to do now have this available inside

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.170
this file is that these two are provider as a value.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.220
Just below the user,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.810
as are these onto its own line.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.000
Add a comma, now we can also pass down our sign-up method,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.880
which is equal to this dot sign-up,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.860
just exactly as we would do when passing down prompts.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.745
The sign-up method can now be accessed throughout the context API.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:28.870
Let's go to a user form dot JS.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.170
I'm working now import this Authconsumer at the very top.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.960
Inside the curly braces,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.250
you have Authconsumer from our package name which is at

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.790
the file path of dot slash and then the AuthContext.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.570
Just like we did with the bold components,

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.030
we need to surround all of our content in

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.740
this consumer so let's go down and grab everything from this return section.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.770
We can cut this out and in need of consumer.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.140
Remember from the last video we said that the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.770
consumer needs to have a function as a child.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.990
We can add this just inside the curly braces instead of

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.690
a function and then inside of here we're going to

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.379
pass in the sign-up method inside the curly braces.

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.435
Then inside this function body we can paste in all the contents which we just removed.

00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:28.580
With this now as a wrapper,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.955
all of these contents now has access to the sign-up method.

00:03:31.955 --> 00:03:35.875
This can be placed in the button as a on click handler.

00:03:35.875 --> 00:03:38.040
Inside the opening tag,

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.690
we can add on click creates a in line function which takes in the event information.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.380
This is going to ruin our sign-up method

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.330
and remember this takes in the email and password.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.725
The e-mail is available from this dots email input,

00:03:54.725 --> 00:03:59.170
which is our REF dot current dot value.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.894
Separated by comma, we can do the same for the password.

00:04:02.894 --> 00:04:07.885
The REF was called password inputs and then grab the current value.

00:04:07.885 --> 00:04:10.825
Also, remember when we set this up in the context,

00:04:10.825 --> 00:04:14.800
if we scroll up, this also takes in the event information.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.635
We can pass this in as a third argument.

00:04:17.635 --> 00:04:21.340
Let's now save this file and test this over in the browser.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.410
Let's create an e-mail inside here.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.930
Then we also need to add a password which is a minimum of

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.730
six characters. Click on sign-up.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.875
Home to Firebase.

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:41.550
Click on the user's tab and now we'll see our one and only user which we just created.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.840
If you don't see any users applying inside of here,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.080
do go back through and check the code and also make

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.650
sure that the password is minimum of six characters long.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.590
Otherwise, you will see an error inside the console.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.070
If you are seeing users in this Firebase console law,

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.460
you are now good to move on to the next video where we're going to

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.690
look at how a registered user can log in and out.
