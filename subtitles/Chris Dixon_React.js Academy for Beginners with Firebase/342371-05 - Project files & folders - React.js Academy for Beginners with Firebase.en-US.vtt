00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Just before we go any further,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.160
I want to give you a quick overview of what online files and folders are in our project,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.865
since they've been generated for us using Create React app.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:17.160
I don't want to just assume that we know what's going on here without going any further.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.480
First of all, at the very top we have the node modules folder.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.670
This is where all of our projects,

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.760
modules or packages are stored.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.285
This directory is nothing specific to react.

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:33.195
This is typical of any node projects.

00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:36.525
That require lots here if we open it up,

00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:42.730
and this location is also where any of the packages which we install will also be saved.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.460
Later in the course, we'll download packages such as Firebase and React router using NPM.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.375
We'll see these saved inside here.

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:56.705
This is also where our actual reacts package is saved to.

00:00:56.705 --> 00:00:59.240
If we scroll down,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.470
there's quite a lot we need to get down to react,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.240
react Dom, and also the React scripts,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.180
which we'll take a look at in just a moment when we get to the package JSON.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.290
Next, so we have the public folder.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.325
The public folder contains our static files,

00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:22.055
such as any images we want to use,

00:01:22.055 --> 00:01:24.460
and also any HTML.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.320
React has this index.html file.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.310
If you open it up, scrolling down to the bottom,

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.195
that is not a lot of content inside here.

00:01:34.195 --> 00:01:37.775
If we go over to our project inside the browser,

00:01:37.775 --> 00:01:40.540
and then go to view page source.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.925
This is the page which you see inside here.

00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:47.945
It doesn't show any actual HTML content in here.

00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:50.720
Even though we see something in the browser.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.130
This is because of the script tag down at the very bottom,

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.815
which is this one here.

00:01:56.815 --> 00:02:00.150
Remember earlier we said that Create React app,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.365
takes away the configuration photos,

00:02:02.365 --> 00:02:05.960
so we can concentrate on creating our React app.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.005
Well, this is one of the things which it does.

00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:12.020
It will use web pack to bundle together all

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.320
of the files and assets we have in our projects.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.590
Then create a bundle file as the output.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.725
This file is then injected into the projects using the script at the bottom.

00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:28.070
It injects them into any DOM element which we choose.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.900
Currently it will be output just above the div with the id of roots.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.245
This is one just here.

00:02:35.245 --> 00:02:37.915
We can click on this bundle link,

00:02:37.915 --> 00:02:39.800
which is the last link just here,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.320
and open this up into a new tab.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.500
This is all of the contents of our bundle.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.995
Don't worry about everything which is inside here at the moment,

00:02:48.995 --> 00:02:52.600
it's all just generated code for development.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.815
If we do a search,

00:02:54.815 --> 00:02:57.860
so browse search of command or control F,

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.620
we can search for the text we added,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.045
and we search for,

00:03:02.045 --> 00:03:04.430
"I am learning reacts".

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.585
We see this text is down here.

00:03:07.585 --> 00:03:12.560
This HTML file can also be used to add scripts or phones too.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.345
But this can also be often added as node modules.

00:03:16.345 --> 00:03:18.735
The next folder we have is

00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:24.310
the source and this is where we will be spending most of the time during this course.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.825
It's where we'll add our raw code,

00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:29.720
all of our JavaScript files on components.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.320
All these will be included into our bundle, which we just looked at.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.205
This is how they make it into our final app.

00:03:37.205 --> 00:03:41.045
There is no strict structure on how we can do this.

00:03:41.045 --> 00:03:44.705
We are pretty free to organize all files and folders how we like.

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:46.730
Although it is common to include

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.715
a components folder into the source directory, we'll do this soon.

00:03:51.715 --> 00:03:55.720
We will get plenty of practice writing components too.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.835
A component is basically a block of code,

00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:02.360
which we'll look at in more detail very soon.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.035
Next we have the app.css.

00:04:06.035 --> 00:04:11.165
This is a main CSS file which contains some default styling.

00:04:11.165 --> 00:04:15.020
In React, it's quite common to see a structure like this,

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.295
where we have one CSS file per components,

00:04:18.295 --> 00:04:21.695
and in the case here is the app.js.

00:04:21.695 --> 00:04:27.050
This app.js is one where we made our changes in the last video.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.035
Again React is pretty flexible with things.

00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:34.250
But this is often used as a main top-level component,

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.190
or a wrapper for the rest of our project,

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.380
we will be using this file to display

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.040
our header as this will be on all pages and then below

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.320
where we use a router to switch between

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.410
different components depending on the page we're viewing.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.580
After this, we have the app.test.js.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.295
This is a file if you want to test into our React project,

00:04:57.295 --> 00:05:00.590
although we won't be covering testing in this course.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.145
Next we have the index.css.

00:05:04.145 --> 00:05:11.065
This is a second CSS file containing these styles relating it to our index.js.

00:05:11.065 --> 00:05:15.010
Again, this is just for separation and organization.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.865
I'm going to delete this file to keep all of the styles nicely together in one file.

00:05:20.865 --> 00:05:24.710
It's a tube, I'm going to remove this,

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.655
and then open up the index.js,

00:05:28.655 --> 00:05:30.220
because we deleted this file,

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:37.250
we also need to remove this import from the index.css, and save this file.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.210
This is a main JavaScript file which is going to

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.755
be responsible for rendering our app, the browser.

00:05:44.755 --> 00:05:52.130
At the top, we importanting both React and also ReactDom from our node modules folder.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.840
In React early days,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.965
used to be in one large react package.

00:05:56.965 --> 00:06:03.290
But since it can now be used to build mobile apps with React native or even VR apps.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.170
All of the core functionality is now stored into

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.969
this react module and any functionality related to web apps,

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:14.800
is now in its separate import called ReactDom.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.780
ReactDom has a random method,

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.280
which we say just here,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.840
which is responsible for rendering the contents to the DOM.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.815
This random method takes in two things.

00:06:25.815 --> 00:06:28.820
First, we have the contents which you want to display,

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.579
currently our main app components.

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:34.160
This is the main route components,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.600
as we mentioned before.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.315
It's often used as the project wrapper.

00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:40.115
When using this in a file,

00:06:40.115 --> 00:06:44.375
we also need to import it over the top, just like we see here.

00:06:44.375 --> 00:06:49.220
Then second of all, the location where we want this app to mount two.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.320
I saw this onto a new line,

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.355
which is currently set to an element with the ID of roots.

00:06:55.355 --> 00:07:03.985
Which is what we looked at earlier before in the main index.html, the public index.html.

00:07:03.985 --> 00:07:06.650
This is the div with the ID root,

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.185
which we've seen before inside the browser.

00:07:09.185 --> 00:07:11.285
So this is basically saying,

00:07:11.285 --> 00:07:16.715
"Take my React app and place it here where we specify in the index page."

00:07:16.715 --> 00:07:22.480
The reason we do this is because we don't always use React for our full application.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.659
We may already have an existing projects,

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:28.430
where we only want to use react in a certain part.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.550
For this case, our HTML page may have lots of

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:37.355
existing content and we can simply add in a new element to mount react to.

00:07:37.355 --> 00:07:40.640
You can change this up to be anything which you want.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.205
We can add in some js X code.

00:07:43.205 --> 00:07:45.980
Lets add a level two heading,

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:51.025
a title of React Treble. Then close this off.

00:07:51.025 --> 00:07:55.265
We will look at this js X code in more detail soon.

00:07:55.265 --> 00:07:59.465
But it is basically a syntax we typically use in React,

00:07:59.465 --> 00:08:02.920
to mix both HTML and JavaScript together.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.830
If we save this file and then go to the browser,

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:11.630
we now see that our Level 2 heading has been mounted to the DOM.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.025
If we reload the view source,

00:08:15.025 --> 00:08:18.045
we still see that we don't have the contents.

00:08:18.045 --> 00:08:23.765
All we have again is this div with the ID root where our React app has been mounted to.

00:08:23.765 --> 00:08:25.700
Let's just change this back,

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.380
to our app components.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:32.680
Next up we have the logo.svg,

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.170
which is provided for the Create React app's data,

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:39.110
and then also a service worker file.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:42.770
This is an optional file to register a service worker.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:46.150
We won't be covering the service workers in this course,

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.969
but they used to make your app work offline,

00:08:48.969 --> 00:08:53.035
often to enable things such as push notifications.

00:08:53.035 --> 00:08:59.005
If using GitHub, we also have a dot gitignore file already setup.

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:03.760
This is used to exclude any files which you don't want to push to GitHub,

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.990
such as any sensitive information, containing passwords,

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:13.280
or any large or unnecessary files such as the node modules.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.280
Below this, we also have the package.json.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.470
This file again is not specific to React.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:24.430
It's something which you will see on a regular no projects.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.860
It contains information about our app,

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.750
such as the app's name,

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:34.430
the author, along with any dependencies which we'll need for the projects.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.280
Inside of the dependencies,

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.455
we have the react-dom listed,

00:09:38.455 --> 00:09:42.435
we have react and we also have the react-scripts.

00:09:42.435 --> 00:09:46.735
React-scripts is a library used by Create React app,

00:09:46.735 --> 00:09:52.545
and includes all of the scripts and configuration we need to run react in the browser.

00:09:52.545 --> 00:09:56.050
It converts the dependencies we need, things to chance,

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.375
bubble and web park behind the scenes,

00:09:58.375 --> 00:10:01.780
and then bundled them all into one library.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:06.175
This also makes maintaining all these packages much easier,

00:10:06.175 --> 00:10:10.660
since we just have one library to worry about when upgrade him.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:16.210
These dependencies in a no project would be added to our node modules folder,

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.420
after running a MPM install commands.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:23.635
All this is also being cupboard for us when we set up the project,

00:10:23.635 --> 00:10:27.415
below our dependencies, we also have some scripts.

00:10:27.415 --> 00:10:33.820
We already use the start script with MPM start kick-off our project at the beginning.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:39.625
There is also a command to build our projects for production, one for testing.

00:10:39.625 --> 00:10:43.000
Then we can also eject from React scripts.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.580
We've talked a bit so far about how a lot of

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.650
configuration is to influence behind the scenes.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.570
However, we can use this eject scripts to go over all of

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:57.740
these hidden magic and then place copies of our configuration and dependencies,

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.510
such as web pack and bubble,

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:04.535
and then place them directly into our project so we can edit these ourselves.

00:11:04.535 --> 00:11:09.010
There is also some more information about this in the readme file too,

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.870
finally have a yarn.lock file,

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:16.115
we don't need to worry too much about this since a is autogenerated,

00:11:16.115 --> 00:11:22.210
and contains a list of our dependencies and exact version numbers which we are using.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:26.014
This is for our file and folder structure.

00:11:26.014 --> 00:11:30.200
We will get a lot more familiar with this as we build our React app.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.500
Next we'll take a closer look at using components.
