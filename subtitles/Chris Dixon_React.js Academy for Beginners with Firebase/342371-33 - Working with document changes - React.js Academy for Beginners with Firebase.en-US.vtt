00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.415
In the last video we discussed was an era when we removed one of our lifts.

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:08.160
We've got the message I've encountered to children with

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.245
the same key and then we've seen an extra list appear inside of our project.

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:18.715
This is because of the way we have things at the moment in our own snapshot method.

00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:21.395
If we go over to the board dot.js,

00:00:21.395 --> 00:00:25.550
where we were working on our last video and then into the get list method.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.480
We are always constructing a new list item and then setting the state,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.820
which is this section just here.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.760
Even if the item was removed,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.770
we still get the change data from the list we then add it to our object.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.825
Then set it to states,

00:00:42.825 --> 00:00:47.010
this will result in the group of items which you see here.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.720
Therefore encounter in it two children with the same key to pixels.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.465
If you remember from the last video,

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:56.195
we said to bear in mind when we did the console log,

00:00:56.195 --> 00:00:58.720
there was a type of added.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.070
We can use this to either set the state or to remove the item from state,

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.825
depending on if the list was added or removed and we can do this with a if statement.

00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:13.370
Let's go back to our board.js.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.075
Then it just above where we construct our documents.

00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:19.820
We can add an if statement to check if

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.005
the change.type is it equal to the string of added.

00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:29.675
If it was, we can open and close the curly braces.

00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:34.265
We can then grab all of our data from set states,

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:36.950
our list and our documents.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.560
Then add these inside of our if statement.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.795
Now this will only set our state if the item has been added.

00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:48.170
However, if the item has been removed,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.045
just undo our if statement,

00:01:50.045 --> 00:01:54.410
we can then add a second if statement, bracket the change.type.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.810
This time is equal to remove.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:06.060
If it is, we can then open up the curly braces and then we can once more set the state,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.345
sets up our state objects.

00:02:09.345 --> 00:02:13.310
The state we want to obtain is the current lists.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.650
Sets of our array and now since we are removing an item from state,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.430
we can use the JavaScript filter method.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.510
We can do this by merging into our array a copy of the current lists.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:35.080
Merge these in with the three dots,.state,.current lists.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.835
We can then call the filter method.

00:02:37.835 --> 00:02:39.605
Inside of this filter method,

00:02:39.605 --> 00:02:43.345
we're going to run a function for each item inside of our list.

00:02:43.345 --> 00:02:49.520
We want to return only the lists where the list.id is

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.605
not equal to Change dot doc, dot ID.

00:02:55.605 --> 00:02:57.440
Just to recap what we are doing here,

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.895
we are grabbing all of our lists from states and then we're going to only return

00:03:01.895 --> 00:03:03.830
our lists where the id for

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.325
each particular list doesn't match the one which has been removed.

00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:11.155
This is available from change.doc.id.

00:03:11.155 --> 00:03:15.550
Now all that's left to do is to save this and go over to the browser.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.490
Inside of our board,

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.320
we can add a new list.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.370
Lets say to-do list three add this in.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.210
We're going to move any of these and now these are

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.630
added and removed without causing any errors.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.670
Finally, from the last video,

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.765
we still have the commented out section where we use the guess method.

00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:41.370
We can now safely remove this since we won't need this code anymore.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.385
This is our list now working with Firebase real-time data.

00:03:46.385 --> 00:03:50.130
Next, we will also apply this to our cards.
