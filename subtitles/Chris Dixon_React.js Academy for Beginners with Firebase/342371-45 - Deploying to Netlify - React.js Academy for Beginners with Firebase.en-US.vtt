00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.870
There are lots of hosting and providers out there.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.610
But a really popular and easy one to get going with is Netlify.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.685
They also have a free option to use too.

00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:16.380
We can quickly get our site online using the Netlify CLI,

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.375
which will give us a set of commands to push our application to production.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:25.185
We can do this over in the terminal using npm.

00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:34.800
Let's head over to our terminal and unicode npm install netlify -cli,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.080
then -g to install this globally.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.700
If you see an error when doing this,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.710
you may also need to add the pseudo keyword before this to install as the administrator.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.330
Once these CLI is installed for you,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:56.370
we can then run one of the commands which is provided called netlify deploy.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.560
This will open up in the browser where we need to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.970
create an account if you don't already have one.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.730
Now, we have some options of what we'd like to do next.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.800
We need to create and configure

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.105
a new site by using the up and down keys and then hit "Enter".

00:01:14.105 --> 00:01:16.380
I'm going to enter through this team name.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.880
This is completely fine.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.230
We can then choose a unique site name or we can leave it

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.740
blank to get a randomly generated name, which I'm going to do.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.775
I've used the Netlify CLI a few times before.

00:01:29.775 --> 00:01:31.430
If you've not used it in the past,

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.054
you may need to take into the browser to log in or also authorize the application.

00:01:37.054 --> 00:01:40.040
The next thing we need to do is to tell Netlify where

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.115
our Build folder is located in our project.

00:01:43.115 --> 00:01:47.065
This is simply the Build folder. They're the same.

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:50.390
Before we make this available for the world to see,

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.525
Netlify will give us a draft URL,

00:01:53.525 --> 00:01:58.600
which is basically a test site for us to see if everything is working first.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.859
Let's first begin by copying this draft URL.

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:07.800
We can copy this, all command and click to take into the browser.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.525
Here we can check if everything is working okay.

00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:15.395
Let's sign in. Give this a test.

00:02:15.395 --> 00:02:17.905
We take into our boards.

00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:20.250
Let's try some of these.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.070
We also have our list and our cards appearing.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.275
This all seems to be working fine.

00:02:25.275 --> 00:02:29.450
However, though, if we now click on this "Home" icon in the corner,

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.810
we then get an error message of page not found.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.485
This is because when we click on this homepage link in the corner,

00:02:36.485 --> 00:02:44.080
we then trying to link to a URL which ends in / our user ID and then /boards.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.410
However, we don't have this route or this link setup in our app.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.030
All of this is handled on the front end using the router.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.320
The solution to this when using a single-page application is to tell the server to

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.520
always only return the homepage and then we will handle any routing on the front end.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.775
Doing this is pretty simple,

00:03:05.775 --> 00:03:08.390
if we go back over to our text editor,

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.170
we simply need to add a _redirect file to our build directory root.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.685
Open up the Build folder,

00:03:16.685 --> 00:03:19.100
create a new file inside here,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.825
which is going to be _redirect.

00:03:22.825 --> 00:03:27.720
All we need to add inside here is / star

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.980
/ index.html 200, save this file.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.865
This will tell the server to always send back the

00:03:37.865 --> 00:03:43.119
index.html page and also a status code of 200.

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.684
Now with this in place, if we go down to our terminal,

00:03:46.684 --> 00:03:52.635
we can once again run netlify deploy, send this off.

00:03:52.635 --> 00:03:55.775
It will also ask us for the deploy path one more,

00:03:55.775 --> 00:03:57.995
which is just simply build.

00:03:57.995 --> 00:04:02.870
This one now builds our application giving us a live test URL.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:12.780
We can click on this and try logging in. This is fine.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.330
Click on the "Home" icon.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.010
Once we are happy that everything is working as expected,

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.245
we can now push this to production.

00:04:21.245 --> 00:04:24.590
We can do this with one more command down in a terminal.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.934
This is netlify deploy,

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:31.700
then -prod, which is short for production.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.140
Also, we need to pass in the Build path.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.000
This will now give us a live URL,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.269
which we can click on, open up in the browser.

00:04:41.269 --> 00:04:44.840
Now, we're left with a live link for our project on the web,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.610
which you can now share with others.
