00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.070
For this project, we're going to be using Firebase as the back-end.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:11.040
This will allow us to add a database to store all of our boards, lists, and cards.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.160
Also it will allow us to only get back the board's,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.700
list and cards we need for the currently log in user.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.980
We can sort them by the creation date.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.615
It will give us real time updates as data changes, and so much more.

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:28.565
Also, we can use Firebase for user authentication,

00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:30.880
signing up and login in.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.320
Another great feature of Firebase is that it can be used not only for web projects,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.455
but also for iOS and Android too,

00:00:39.455 --> 00:00:43.735
so we can share the same data across multiple apps.

00:00:43.735 --> 00:00:48.960
We can get started over at firebase.google.com.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.390
You need to sign up with a Google account if you've not used this before.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.920
If you need to go ahead and sign up now.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.530
I'm currently signed in,

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.320
so I'm just going to click on "Go to console".

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.680
Before we go any further though,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.224
Firebase seems to change it's website layout and design pretty regularly,

00:01:08.224 --> 00:01:10.825
but the steps are usually similar.

00:01:10.825 --> 00:01:13.460
If it looks a little different when you visit,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.635
you should still be able to work things out,

00:01:15.635 --> 00:01:18.565
since there are only a few steps to take.

00:01:18.565 --> 00:01:22.325
The first thing we need to do is to create a project,

00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:24.320
by clicking on "Add project".

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.080
I already have a project called React Trello,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.600
so instead I'm going to call this React Trello 2.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.644
We also need to accept the terms and conditions before we can create our project.

00:01:38.644 --> 00:01:42.410
Then give us a few moments to create.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.175
We're going to be using the latest Firebase database,

00:01:46.175 --> 00:01:48.635
which is called the Cloud Firestore,

00:01:48.635 --> 00:01:52.045
which will give us our real-time functionality.

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:57.110
Real-time meaning our app can be updated with changes as they happen,

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.010
and our data can be kept in sync across different devices,

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.545
rather than us having to make a new request after each change.

00:02:05.545 --> 00:02:08.895
Once this is done we can click on "Continue",

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:12.975
and then we're taken to the Homepage for our project.

00:02:12.975 --> 00:02:15.820
We now need to click on the Cloud Firestore,

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.120
which we can get from clicking on this Cloud Firestore section just here.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.060
Or we can click on the "Database" from the menu.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.020
Send things up is pretty simple,

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.670
we just click on "Create a database".

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.980
We're going to start in the test mode, just for now,

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.670
meaning and that's all users can read and write into our database.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.830
But we will add security rules later on. Click on "Next".

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.610
We can then select our region which is closest to us.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.370
Choose any of these and then click on "Done".

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.480
This is our database Homepage,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.600
and this is where our data will display once we push it to Firebase.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.880
We can also manually add collections to using this link here.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.465
A collection is a group of data which will be our boards,

00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:17.110
our lists, and our cards.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.164
Then add this database to our project.

00:03:20.164 --> 00:03:23.105
We need to first get our Firebase settings.

00:03:23.105 --> 00:03:28.640
We can do this in the sidebar and then click on "Project Overview".

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.240
We're going to be using the web version, so click on this.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.115
We'll need to give our application a nickname.

00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:40.860
I want to also call this, React Trello 2.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.180
Then register our app.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.445
This will give us access to our config settings,

00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:52.000
which we need to add it to our project.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.825
We need to copy all of the settings from inside the config object.

00:03:56.825 --> 00:04:00.260
Basically, everything inside of these curly braces.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.130
Copy all of these lines of code.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.920
Then we can take these over to Visual Studio code.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.510
Let's create a new file.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.145
Open the sidebar inside of source, new file.

00:04:13.145 --> 00:04:16.775
This is going to be called Firebase.js.

00:04:16.775 --> 00:04:20.665
The next step is to install Firebase from NPM.

00:04:20.665 --> 00:04:22.460
Go down to the terminal,

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.000
press Command or Control C if you need to close down the server,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.760
then you can run a command called NPM,

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.750
I for install, and then the package is simply called Firebase.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.730
Now if we go back into our Firebase.js file,

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.014
we can now do an import,

00:04:40.014 --> 00:04:44.389
pull in our Firebase package and store it inside a variable.

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.390
Import this from the node modules.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.700
This package will be called Firebase.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.210
Then we're going to do forward slash up.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.925
Forward slash up is the core Firebase client,

00:04:55.925 --> 00:04:58.985
which is required when using Firebase.

00:04:58.985 --> 00:05:03.565
The next step is to also import the firestore package.

00:05:03.565 --> 00:05:05.810
We don't need to store this inside a variable,

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.590
so we can just do an import without installing this by name,

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.945
so we can import the Firebase package,

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:14.515
then a forward slash Firestore.

00:05:14.515 --> 00:05:19.850
This will make the firestore functionality available in our projects.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.525
We're next going to create a constant called config.

00:05:23.525 --> 00:05:28.025
Config is going to hold all of the options which we just copied from Firebase.

00:05:28.025 --> 00:05:30.550
We can paste these inside here.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.995
Let's close the sidebar so we've got a little bit more space.

00:05:33.995 --> 00:05:38.215
It looks as though I've missed off the end of trello but it doesn't matter.

00:05:38.215 --> 00:05:41.150
Let's go down and now initialize our app.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.480
We can do this by selecting our Firebase variable,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.625
which we imported at the top.

00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:50.700
Then we can do a method called initialize App,

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:59.105
then we're going to pass in our config object without settings from Firebase.

00:05:59.105 --> 00:06:02.375
With this configuration now taken care of,

00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:05.090
I'm now going to set up three constants,

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.670
these will point to our database collections

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.730
which is going to be Boards, lists, and cards.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.155
This is just basically a shortcut which we're going to use throughout our project,

00:06:15.155 --> 00:06:16.540
rather than having a lot of

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.919
repetitive code which will point to the location in our database.

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:25.505
First of all, we're going to create a constant called db.

00:06:25.505 --> 00:06:28.830
It's is going to be equal to Firebase.firestore.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.880
Again, this is also a shortcut.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.870
This is a pointer to our Firebase database,

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.920
and now we can just type db instead of Firebase.firestore.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.170
Below this we're now going to create a reference to each collection we need,

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.480
this will allow us to access these new project to

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.275
save and retrieve data just by using the variable name.

00:06:51.275 --> 00:06:54.185
First of all, we'll create a boardsRef,

00:06:54.185 --> 00:06:57.304
and this is going to be equal to our database,

00:06:57.304 --> 00:07:02.540
which is DB, and I'm going to access a collection which we don't have yet,

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.075
but this will have the name of boards.

00:07:05.075 --> 00:07:08.990
I'm going to copy and paste this into more times.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.920
The second one is going to be a reference to our lists.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.380
The collection name is going to be lists.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.040
Then the third one is going to be a pointer to our cards.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.300
All this means now is in our project when we want to push

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.215
a board to Firebase or retrieve a board from Firebase,

00:07:30.215 --> 00:07:32.290
we just need to type the word boardsRef,

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:39.120
rather than having to type out Firebase.firestore.collection.boards.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.765
Now we can export these references,

00:07:41.765 --> 00:07:44.510
so we can access them in the files.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:49.265
You can do this, with a named Export inside the curly braces.

00:07:49.265 --> 00:07:52.200
We can export our boardsRef,

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:57.545
our list draft, and also the cards ref too.

00:07:57.545 --> 00:08:02.830
We can now save this file and test it's working in the app.js.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:07.935
We can begin with our boardsRef by importing this at the top of the file.

00:08:07.935 --> 00:08:11.130
Just below class we can create an import,

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:14.800
we'll first of all import our boardsRef.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.110
This is from our Firebase file,

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:22.660
which is a stringoff./ and then Firebase.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.050
This was a named export,

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.415
so we can import each one inside of these curly braces.

00:08:28.415 --> 00:08:33.685
We can then add a quick test in the componentDidmount to check this is working.

00:08:33.685 --> 00:08:36.215
Just under our set states,

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:39.305
we can now access this boardsRef variable.

00:08:39.305 --> 00:08:42.170
We can then call a method called dot add,

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:46.615
which is a Firebase method to add new data to this collection.

00:08:46.615 --> 00:08:54.660
We're simply going to create an object with a name and a value of hello. Let's save this.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.530
Now if we go onto our project and then reload,

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.960
we have an error of boardsRef. Let's check this out.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.800
We have the import, that looks correct,

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.125
go over to Firebase,

00:09:10.125 --> 00:09:15.520
and this needs an S. Back to the project.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.910
Reload, and this will now cause the component in mountain to run.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.010
If we go to Firebase,

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.600
and we can close this down,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.050
go to console, and into our database.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.625
We now see we have a board collection with a single document.

00:09:34.625 --> 00:09:36.365
This is the document's ID,

00:09:36.365 --> 00:09:38.755
then we have the name of hello.

00:09:38.755 --> 00:09:42.260
One of the benefits of using Firebase is we don't

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.750
need to define our collections beforehand.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:50.120
We can simply push a new object or new item to Firebase,

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.290
and it will also create the necessary collection and documents.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.535
This is just a test, so I'm going to delete this now.

00:09:57.535 --> 00:10:00.925
Let's go into our boards, delete the collection.

00:10:00.925 --> 00:10:03.745
We also need to type the board's name.

00:10:03.745 --> 00:10:10.480
We can remove this, and then remove the code from componentDidmount inside the app.js.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.580
Remove this line of code, save this file.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.885
Now this leaves us with Firebase on our setup.

00:10:17.885 --> 00:10:21.240
We're good to now move on to the next video.
