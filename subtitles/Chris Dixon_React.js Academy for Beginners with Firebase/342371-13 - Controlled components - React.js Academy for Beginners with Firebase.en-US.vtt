00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.200
If we had over two any URL numbers such as 1,2,3 and then forward slash boards.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.350
This view is rendered out by the home components.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.065
This contains a new board button.

00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:18.570
If we click, this will then add some hard coded data to our board states.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.340
This new board button is wide up over in the home.js.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.780
This is a button and it will trigger a method called newboard.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.200
All this board data is currently hard-coded,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.510
but we want the user to add the board name and also to select the color.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.925
Just as with any of the websites,

00:00:38.925 --> 00:00:41.205
we can do this with a form.

00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:44.120
Let's have this over in the sidebar.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.030
We're going to go into the components and then create

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.240
a new file for this called CreateBoardForm.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:02.580
With the dot js extension at the end and make sure you just spell right. There we go.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.820
The first thing we want to do is to import React from "react",

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.830
just as we always do.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.420
Then it's going to be a class-based components.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.525
Want to call this the same as the file, which is CreateBoardForm.

00:01:19.525 --> 00:01:24.850
This is going to extends React components.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.840
Inside here we add our required random method,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.515
which is then going to simply return some js x as our AP elements.

00:01:37.515 --> 00:01:39.565
With the texts of hi.

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:43.445
We'll come back to this in just a moment and create our reform.

00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:46.120
First, let's export default.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.020
CreateBoardForm. Save this file

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.150
and then we can import this file in it to our home components.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.440
Scroll up to the top underneath our prop types.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.730
We can import CreateBoardForm.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.665
The file path we need is going to be dot dot slash.

00:02:09.665 --> 00:02:12.470
Then it says CreateBoardForm.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.900
Scrolling down to our random effort,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.555
we no longer need this button which will have here,

00:02:17.555 --> 00:02:20.225
since we are going to replace this with a form.

00:02:20.225 --> 00:02:24.590
In the place here we can add our CreateBoardForm components.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.690
Closes off while we're here till we can add a board-preview wrapper,

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.910
which is going to be a surrounding dive.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.080
This will just add the style in which we need using CSS.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.510
We can add our class name.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.810
This one is going to be equal to board-preview-wrapper.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.865
Then grab the closing dive and add this just after the closing curly brace.

00:02:51.865 --> 00:02:54.395
This board-preview-wrapper will give us

00:02:54.395 --> 00:02:58.025
the CSS grid layout for all of our board-previews.

00:02:58.025 --> 00:03:03.169
Save this file and then go over to the browser and now we see the text of hi,

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:06.145
which means our component is now being rendered.

00:03:06.145 --> 00:03:09.140
Also our free board-previews and are being

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.115
displayed in the grid format rather than in a list.

00:03:13.115 --> 00:03:16.505
Back over to the CreateBoardForm components.

00:03:16.505 --> 00:03:19.045
We can create our form markup.

00:03:19.045 --> 00:03:23.035
Let's head over. In place of this high text,

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:24.895
we can remove this.

00:03:24.895 --> 00:03:28.390
We can add a form inside here.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.405
This form is also going to have a className,

00:03:31.405 --> 00:03:35.390
which becomes or create-board-wrapper.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.390
First of all, we need a input with the type of text.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.180
Which is going to be for our board name.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.115
Close this off and on a separate line i'm going to add

00:03:48.115 --> 00:03:52.390
the type which is going to be equal to text.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.610
It's also needs the name,

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.975
which is going to be equal to name.

00:03:56.975 --> 00:03:59.860
Then finally a placeholder value,

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.570
which is going to be board name.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.650
The second input which is formed is going to need is going to be a select box.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.460
This is how the user can select the background color for this board.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.500
Creates a select box.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.030
Let's open and close this.

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.040
This disliked also needs a name attributes which is going to be equal to background.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.950
Inside here will then list our options which are available for the user.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.680
I'm going to add six different colors.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.965
You can add any color value which you like these,

00:04:33.965 --> 00:04:37.205
or you can stick with ones which I want to choose.

00:04:37.205 --> 00:04:40.525
The first one is going to be a blue value.

00:04:40.525 --> 00:04:44.245
We can add the same using the value attributes.

00:04:44.245 --> 00:04:50.250
The x value of 80ccff.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.200
Want to copy and paste this in five more times.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.975
Giving us six option values.

00:04:55.975 --> 00:05:00.500
Is a common is going to be for a green color.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.140
The x value is going to be 80ffaa.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.720
The third one is going to be red,

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.670
which is a value of f94a1e.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.115
The fourth one is for a pink color.

00:05:17.115 --> 00:05:20.530
The x value this time is ffb3ff.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:28.440
Then we have a purple second-to-last, which is bf00ff.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.285
Finally we have the orange color.

00:05:33.285 --> 00:05:37.860
This is ffad, double three,

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.645
and there's our six colors.

00:05:39.645 --> 00:05:46.180
The last item we need to add is for a submit button with the texts of creating new board.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.390
It's also needs a type which is going to be submit.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.445
This is all we need to do for our form.

00:05:56.445 --> 00:06:00.380
Save this file and then go over to the browser and open the top.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.035
We now see our inputs of board name.

00:06:03.035 --> 00:06:08.230
We have our dropdown with these lactic colors and our submit button.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.945
This is our form now displayed in the browser.

00:06:11.945 --> 00:06:16.285
But now we need a way to get the data input by the user.

00:06:16.285 --> 00:06:20.195
There are a couple of ways of doing this when using React.

00:06:20.195 --> 00:06:24.950
First is what we're going to look at now called a controlled components.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.895
This generally means React takes control of the data,

00:06:28.895 --> 00:06:32.150
which we type in and then stores it into states.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.750
HTML form inputs such as this input and

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.830
select we have typically maintain their own state,

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.355
meaning the unaware of what the user typed in.

00:06:43.355 --> 00:06:49.680
You may have used the event.target.value before to accesses this.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.865
We can then access this value and place it into state.

00:06:52.865 --> 00:06:54.380
Once it is then in state,

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.920
we can use it to create our new board.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.815
We can begin by creating our default state.

00:07:00.815 --> 00:07:04.330
Let's go over to CreateBoardForm.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.555
Just underneath our class title.

00:07:07.555 --> 00:07:10.429
Let's add our state objects.

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:16.940
First of all, we can add the title and satisfy an initial value of an empty string.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:25.145
We can also set a default background based string value of 80ccff,

00:07:25.145 --> 00:07:28.450
which is just our first blue value.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.645
This will be our default background color if none over is selected.

00:07:33.645 --> 00:07:36.045
Scroll down into a form.

00:07:36.045 --> 00:07:37.610
Inside of these inputs,

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.145
we can create an inline event handler,

00:07:40.145 --> 00:07:43.690
set the state when a user types into the inputs.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.815
We can do this just under the placeholder.

00:07:46.815 --> 00:07:52.715
We can add the on change event handler and satisfy a inline function,

00:07:52.715 --> 00:07:56.600
which takes in the event data as e. This is

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.925
going to run a function which is going to run states.

00:08:00.925 --> 00:08:05.090
We can pass this in as an object and the state which we want to

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:09.810
change is the title which you want to set to e.targets.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.235
The value e.target.

00:08:14.235 --> 00:08:19.070
value is the event data which is typed in by the user.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.795
Then we can also do the same for the background too.

00:08:22.795 --> 00:08:30.485
Scroll down to our select just after the background inside the opening select tag.

00:08:30.485 --> 00:08:34.230
We can also add an on change event handler.

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:40.180
At this again, in line passing in the event data,

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.845
create our arrow function,

00:08:41.845 --> 00:08:44.170
which is also going to set state,

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:48.805
with this dot set state, personal objects.

00:08:48.805 --> 00:08:53.335
But this time we want to set the background inside the states.

00:08:53.335 --> 00:08:58.730
This is also e for target of value.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:05.980
Each time the user types anything into the form or changes the select inputs,

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.710
it will then run this function and update our state.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:14.900
Next, we can test this out by adding a on submit method to the form.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.160
Go down to our button and in fact,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.649
we'll add this to the actual form elements and these onto the online.

00:09:23.649 --> 00:09:27.280
This time the event handler is on submit.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.230
Once the form has been submitted,

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:34.790
we then want to run a custom method called this a handle submit.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:41.275
This will cause the handle submit method to run each time the form has been submitted.

00:09:41.275 --> 00:09:45.460
We can test this out above with a simple console log.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.770
Outside our random method,

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:55.480
we can create our custom method of handle submits passing in the event data.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.370
The first thing to do is to run e or prevent default.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:05.140
This will prevent the default behavior once the form has been submitted,

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.735
which will then be to reload the browser,

00:10:07.735 --> 00:10:10.360
and we don't want to do this since one react to be in

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.884
control of when the page reloads and updates.

00:10:13.884 --> 00:10:17.845
We can then do a simple console log to the browser,

00:10:17.845 --> 00:10:21.700
which is going to output this dot state.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.495
This dot state will then show us the title and background

00:10:25.495 --> 00:10:29.725
which the user has typed in once this form has been submitted.

00:10:29.725 --> 00:10:33.550
Let's say this and then go over to the browser.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.280
Into the console tab.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.070
Let's type anything into here.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.310
Change the value and create new board.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.190
This looks like we had a summit this,

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.570
let's check what's going on.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.990
It's a spelling mistake, so handle,

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:56.800
submit and let's try once more.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.880
Reload and we can add our test.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.935
Let's try with the default color.

00:11:03.935 --> 00:11:06.890
I'm going to have a title and a background.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:11.920
Let's change the color and also the title and there we go.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.675
Now the state has been updated with the value input by the user.

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:20.635
Now we can finish off our method by creating our board.

00:11:20.635 --> 00:11:23.125
Install this as an object.

00:11:23.125 --> 00:11:25.570
Let's remove the console log.

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:28.720
Create a constant for board.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.624
This will be an object which is going to take in the title,

00:11:33.624 --> 00:11:40.840
which we can grab from states with this dot state dot title, separated by comma.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.960
This also needs to grab the background.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.850
This is an easy one too.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:50.030
This is the start state, the background.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.490
Then we can add the value of created at,

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.380
which just like we looked at earlier,

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.245
is going to be equal to new dot date.

00:11:59.245 --> 00:12:03.475
Therefore, we can grab this from the database in time order.

00:12:03.475 --> 00:12:06.865
We don't have any user data just yet,

00:12:06.865 --> 00:12:08.995
so we can add a simple string.

00:12:08.995 --> 00:12:11.260
Let's go for a, b, c 1,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:17.005
2 ,3 giving us the board data which we need to send off to the database.

00:12:17.005 --> 00:12:20.410
If we go over to the app.js,

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.310
we still have a method called create new board.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.440
This also takes in the boards,

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.545
but we have this now which we can pass along with the method.

00:12:29.545 --> 00:12:34.195
We do need to pass this method down as a prop and we'll get to this in just a moment.

00:12:34.195 --> 00:12:42.310
But first we want to add an if statement to first check if the board dot title exists.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:46.045
We want to check if this board dot title is there,

00:12:46.045 --> 00:12:47.260
because if it's not,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.895
this means that the user is trying to submit a board without a name.

00:12:51.895 --> 00:12:57.250
We also want to check if the board dot background exists too,

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:01.295
which it should, because we have this stored into state.

00:13:01.295 --> 00:13:07.755
We can then run our create new board method with this dot prop,

00:13:07.755 --> 00:13:10.900
dot create a new board.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:14.815
Passing in our new board objects.

00:13:14.815 --> 00:13:17.740
Now the next step is to actually make sure that

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.905
these props are being received by this form.

00:13:20.905 --> 00:13:24.985
Open the app.js, we have our create new board method,

00:13:24.985 --> 00:13:27.175
which is set in the states.

00:13:27.175 --> 00:13:30.865
We're currently putting this down into the home components.

00:13:30.865 --> 00:13:33.505
Let's head over to the home dot js,

00:13:33.505 --> 00:13:38.380
this home dot js then it needs to passes this down to create board form.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:43.130
We can do this now, so creates new board.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.105
This is equal to our props,

00:13:46.105 --> 00:13:49.885
so this dot props dot create new board.

00:13:49.885 --> 00:13:53.215
This should now be available in our form.

00:13:53.215 --> 00:13:57.580
Just one thing to do before we go ahead and check this out is we

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:01.840
still have this new broad method just above in our home components.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.485
We can now remove this since this is no longer needed.

00:14:05.485 --> 00:14:10.420
Save this and make sure all of our files are saved and head over to the browser.

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.430
We can now test this out.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:13.885
Let's add a new board.

00:14:13.885 --> 00:14:15.820
I'm going to go forward to do,

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:20.215
which is going to be a red color and then create new board.

00:14:20.215 --> 00:14:23.635
Create new board is not a function.

00:14:23.635 --> 00:14:26.485
This is over in here.

00:14:26.485 --> 00:14:31.250
Lowercase w, let's try one more.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.875
That's due in a color of red.

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:39.190
Create new boards and now we'll see our board

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:42.775
has been pushed to states and then rendered in the browser.

00:14:42.775 --> 00:14:44.350
To round off this video,

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.490
we are passing props,

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:49.375
so we needs some property validation inside of all form.

00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:53.200
Let's first begin in the create board form by

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.850
importing our prop types from our prop types package.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:04.675
Then as ever, we can add this down at the bottom of our components,

00:15:04.675 --> 00:15:07.490
just above our export.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:13.465
Creates board form dot prop types,

00:15:13.465 --> 00:15:16.975
lowercase p, set of all objects.

00:15:16.975 --> 00:15:22.645
The single prop which we are receiving for this component is create new board.

00:15:22.645 --> 00:15:26.980
This new board is going to have the prop type of function,

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.500
which will add with dot func.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:35.320
This is also required since we always want to be able to add a new board.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.489
Let's save this and go over to the browser and check there's no issues,

00:15:39.489 --> 00:15:41.395
and everything looks fine.

00:15:41.395 --> 00:15:45.490
The next topic we'll continue looking at forms by taking

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:50.540
a look at on control components and also using refs.
