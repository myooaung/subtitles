00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.360
This app.js file used to render out our home component and also the board.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.269
In the last video, when we switched to the router,

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.775
we only rendered out the board component,

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:14.625
leaving this home component until this video.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:19.520
This is because this home component also makes use of props,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.055
we pass down the boards,

00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:24.035
and also the create new board method.

00:00:24.035 --> 00:00:26.690
Now, when passing props using the router,

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.905
the first instinct would be maybe to do something like this.

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:33.395
If we had our home routes,

00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:37.715
we could pass in a component of home.

00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:40.190
We could then also pass down the props,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.065
just like we have commented out below,

00:00:42.065 --> 00:00:43.840
such as the boards.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.820
Let's add this is over and also create new board.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.195
Leave no component to mirror what we had earlier.

00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:57.400
However, though, if we were to save this and then go over to our app,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.720
we need to go over to the forward slash,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.520
which is the home component.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.215
We now see we get a error message in the console and also in the browser.

00:01:06.215 --> 00:01:08.240
We are receiving these errors because

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.170
the home component is not receiving the props which it needs.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.700
Therefore, React is receiving this undefined or null value.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.680
When using the React router,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.970
we cannot pass down props in the traditional way.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.750
The solution is to pass in a render prop in the place of our component.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.620
Let's start by removing our props and also this home component.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.460
Then in place, we can add in a render prop.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.910
Inside here this takes in a function.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.425
So passing a arrow function, just like this.

00:01:42.425 --> 00:01:46.610
In here, we can then add our home component with our props.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.935
So just like we have earlier,

00:01:48.935 --> 00:01:51.005
down here we have the home component,

00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:53.030
which one is out our two boards.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.180
We can, in fact, copy this section and then add this inside of this function.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.260
In fact, we just need a home and not this board,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.015
so let's remove this.

00:02:05.015 --> 00:02:08.405
So first of all, let's save this file and check this out.

00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:12.805
We now see the home component rendering out the board previews,

00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:15.065
so this now removes our error.

00:02:15.065 --> 00:02:18.095
We also see this page not found component.

00:02:18.095 --> 00:02:19.640
Since it doesn't have a path,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.350
it will always render with our current router layout.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.829
To fix this, we can surround our routes with a switch statement.

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.295
So inside the browser router we can make use

00:02:31.295 --> 00:02:35.305
of this switch package which we imported earlier.

00:02:35.305 --> 00:02:37.760
Just after browse router,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.710
we can pass this in.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.085
It has an opening and a closing tag,

00:02:43.085 --> 00:02:47.580
which sits just inside of our browser router.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.765
What switch will do is to look at

00:02:50.765 --> 00:02:55.685
our components and then only render the first one which matches.

00:02:55.685 --> 00:02:59.930
So if a forward slash or a forward slash board is found,

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.690
the corresponding component will be rendered

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.110
just like when using a regular JavaScript switch statements.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.610
If none are match,

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.345
we are then left with the page not found down at the bottom.

00:03:11.345 --> 00:03:16.055
Let's save this and check that the page not found component is removed.

00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:19.555
Now, we'll just have the home components as expected.

00:03:19.555 --> 00:03:23.325
This now leaves us with the behavior which we would expect

00:03:23.325 --> 00:03:28.060
and this is how we can pass down props using the React router.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.650
Next, we're going to continue looking at

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.550
this router and how we can pass parameters via the URL.
