(soft electronic music)

2

00:00:02,581  -->  00:00:05,270
(keyboard clicking)

3

00:00:05,270  -->  00:00:06,720
<v Sarah>So for our second challenge</v>
4

4

00:00:06,720  -->  00:00:11,340
I want you to change the implementation of insertion sort
5

5

00:00:11,340  -->  00:00:14,080
that we went through in the insertion sort video
6

6

00:00:14,080  -->  00:00:16,930
so that it's a recursive implementation.
7

7

00:00:16,930  -->  00:00:20,240
So I want you to sort the usual example array,
8

8

00:00:20,240  -->  00:00:22,770
and in the resources section for this video
9

9

00:00:22,770  -->  00:00:24,990
you'll find a starter project that essentially
10

10

00:00:24,990  -->  00:00:27,700
will contain the code that we covered
11

11

00:00:27,700  -->  00:00:29,420
in the insertion sort video.
12

12

00:00:29,420  -->  00:00:33,530
So if you need to review the video on recursion,
13

13

00:00:33,530  -->  00:00:36,330
and of course the video on insertion sort,
14

14

00:00:36,330  -->  00:00:38,150
if you need to review that as well.
15

15

00:00:38,150  -->  00:00:40,240
So essentially the challenge is to take
16

16

00:00:40,240  -->  00:00:42,790
the iterative implementation and change
17

17

00:00:42,790  -->  00:00:44,980
it to a recursive implementation.
18

18

00:00:44,980  -->  00:00:47,823
Good luck, and I'll see you in the solution video.
