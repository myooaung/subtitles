00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:13.150
Next we will be using the bird face face to make a traditional design called the crane.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:21.280
The next part will be to take one layer and folded over to the other side.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.275
So it looks a bit like that.

00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:29.720
You're gonna do the same thing with the other side but with different layer. C.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.670
Or gummy is all about layers.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.040
As you're gonna take the 0.21.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.200
This is called an inside reverse fold.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.040
She'd be able to figure it out how I just did it there.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.750
Sort of fold it inside.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.880
That is your Crane's head.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:13.590
Next, you're going to take the wings and hold them so that they stick out.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.480
So Ukraine can sit up.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.309
And you have finished the crane.
