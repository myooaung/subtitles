Even skinnier. Xt, easier inside reverse fold.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:49.550
To push up the fat end and be skinny sheep.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.350
This is going to be the head.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.350

00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:24.210
But reverse fold again.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.190
If they're ever spoke to.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.110
This is the body of your sneak.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.840
Next, he didn't afford the outside edges.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.720
Edge like that.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.480
You're going to repeat with the other side.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.470
