00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.980
He can commit at least one base two memory.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.920
You can leave this course and search up books up

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.060
online because bases are what most projects are based on.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.210
Although some books don't use basis.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.800
Or you can stick around,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.935
warn some of my favorites to start try making a couple of

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:27.340
each base to set aside to make an animal or a flower.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.530
Let's get started in making your first base.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.140
So first we're going to be making a bird base.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.240
So take u square piece of paper and folded in half,

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:50.060
and then fold it over to the other side so that the tips matchup sharpen the phone.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.820
And then suppose trickier,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.070
you can open it up.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.320
So it looks like that.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.620
And then put your finger and if it helps,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.740
and then you're going to squash it down length.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.080
Does what people call squash.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.460
You shape to look something like this.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.330
To continue the rest of verb-based Phase one will like to turn it

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.920
over and then repeat the squash fold with the site.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.940
Like so.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:36.650
Say you have a diamond shaped C,

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.020
It has, it has these different layers until you can open it up.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.320
On the inside.
