00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.335
Next we're going to make the water bomb base

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:14.294
again to turn it over to the pattern side is on the outside.

00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:20.310
Then you will fold it in half this way.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.610
So it looks like a rectangle.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:37.375
Seek. Thank and a folded in half again to the other side.

00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:41.160
This time, it share it lines up perfectly.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.925
It shouldn't Berkeley this.

00:00:55.925 --> 00:00:58.475
Next again and do the squash rule,

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.990
but a different way this time.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.810
Just 0s what you learned before and he should be five.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.870
Next, complete the base.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.005
You're going to want to flip it over and repeat the squash fold.

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:29.100
But right

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.190
now I

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.050
have a water bomb base.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.250
And it also has four layers, like the birthplace.
