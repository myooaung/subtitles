00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.415
And surprisingly, the water bomb base is used to make water bombs.

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:10.630
Let's give it a try.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.315
Takes the edge, unfold it towards the line in the middle.

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:24.825
And repeat Christianity side.

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:28.750
Reaching another ugly Fleck.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.045
And the shape over all of it.

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:41.770
Save it in say,

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.790
day two theaters side.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.670
Next.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.700
We will take this little plaque and you see this needle Little Pocket.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:14.850
We're going to check that the top flap and put it inside of the pocket.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.540
Xbox.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.995
Or do the same for solid,

00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:37.500
you can fold it over like that. If it helps.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.560
You open the pocket,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.680
the flat, and shove it inside.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.470
Now, you'll see a little hole and you will blow into it like a whistle.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.155
This one fleet it.

00:03:15.155 --> 00:03:17.180
You can also fill it with water.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.830
And then you'll have a water bomb.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.610
You'll see a little hole and you'll blow into it like a whistle.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.930
Now at one end,

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.380
you'll see a little hole and you'll blow into it like a whistle.
