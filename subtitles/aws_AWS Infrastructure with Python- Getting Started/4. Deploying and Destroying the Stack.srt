1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,240
Now that we viewed the CloudFormation template,

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,060
normally we actually deploy using the cdk deploy command,

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,060
and we just specify the stack that we want to deploy.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,820
We don't actually need to generate a CloudFormation template and upload it.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,930
If we run cdk deploy,

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:26,070
you can actually see all of the resources that this

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,410
CDK stack is going to deploy.

8
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,860
So you can see we have the lambda function,

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,550
the permissions for that lambda function, and so on.

10
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,140
All of them are viewable from the console.

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,320
Afterwards,

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,140
just confirm that you want to deploy these changes, and CDK

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,190
will take care of creating this LambdaStack.

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,440
If we go view the CloudFormation console,

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,840
you'll actually see the LambdaStack in the CloudFormation console.

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,420
Now you can see the create is in progress,

17
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,140
it will take some time to create,

18
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,540
but it's a fully working CloudFormation environment.

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,460
So all of the things that are true for

20
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,940
CloudFormation are also true for this stack.

21
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,380
If I delete this stack,

22
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,340
all of the resources associated with this stack are also deleted.

23
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,420
Now let's just wait for this stack to finish creating.

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,720
And you can see that the stack has now finished creating.

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,740
We can actually visit the endpoint seen in the Outputs file.

26
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,340
So if we visit that endpoint and we pass in the proper GET

27
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,160
parameter we can actually view the result of the app.

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,920
So you can see here that we specified Hello, Marc!

29
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,780
You have a hit.

30
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,340
We can change the name to whatever name we want as well.

31
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:04,940
So this is a very simple lambda function fronted by an API gateway.

32
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,650
Now to delete this stack,

33
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:11,870
we can delete it from the CloudFormation console. We can also use the

34
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,040
cdk destroy command to destroy the LambdaStack.

35
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,970
It will ask for confirmation, and then you just need to say yes.

36
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:26,740
It will destroy all of the resources associated with this LambdaStack.

37
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,980
If we go back to CloudFormation,

38
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,840
you'll actually see that the stack is in the process of deleting.

39
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:42,000
So the CDK handles everything from provisioning to destroying your CloudFormation stack.
