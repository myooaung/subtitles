1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,600
Now, before we start using the CDK on Cloud9,

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,770
we have to make sure that we assign the appropriate

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,740
role to the Cloud9 environment.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,440
Now to do this, go to Services, and then look for IAM.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,340
From IAM, we can actually create the role needed for Cloud9.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,240
Once you're on the IAM dashboard, go to Roles.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,940
In my case, I already have several roles here.

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,060
However, I will create a new role for this Cloud9 environment.

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,310
For the new role, I'll select EC2.

10
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:45,530
This is because Cloud9 actually runs on an EC2 instance.

11
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,940
Afterwards, click Next.

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,190
Now I know that this is normally bad practice in production; however,

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,780
for the purposes of this course,

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,640
we're going to assign this role administrator access policies.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,900
This is to ensure that Cloud9 has all of the permissions it

16
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,640
needs to provision infrastructure with the CDK.

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,240
Afterwards, click Next.

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,760
You can add tags if you want.

19
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,320
I'm leaving this blank.

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,140
Afterwards, just click Review, and make sure you give your role a name.

21
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,220
In my case, I'm naming my role CDKRole.

22
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:32,340
Create your role, and now your role should be ready to attach to an EC2 instance.

23
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,540
Now go to Services and look for EC2.

24
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,240
This should take you to your EC2 instance dashboard.

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,040
Go to Running instances,

26
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,540
and you should see all of the instances you have available in your account.

27
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,450
In my case, I have several Cloud9 environments running,

28
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,140
as well as several other EC2 instances.

29
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,240
Make sure that in case you have other environments,

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,140
you select the one that you created for the CDK.

31
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,440
In my case, it is the CDK Cloud9 environment.

32
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,220
Afterwards,

33
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:17,820
just click Actions, Instant Settings, Attach or Replace IAM Role,

34
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,140
and then select the role that you just created.

35
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,940
Afterwards, just apply these changes,

36
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,590
and now your role has been attached to the EC2 instance,

37
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:36,000
and your Cloud9 environment should have no issues creating infrastructure with the CDK.
