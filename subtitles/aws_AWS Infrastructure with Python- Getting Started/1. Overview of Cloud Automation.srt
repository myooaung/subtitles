00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,760
Welcome again to the course entitled AWS

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,650
Infrastructure with Python: Getting Started.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,040
My name is Zenon, and I'll be your instructor for the course,

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:16,740
and we're going to start with the introduction to the AWS Cloud Development Kit.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,070
Now what is this Cloud Development Kit that everyone keeps

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,540
talking about? First off, in this module,

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,140
we're going to understand the use case for CDK.

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,240
Why do we even need to learn this new framework to

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,740
provision your infrastructure?

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,540
Secondly, we're going to understand the components of a CDK app.

11
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,840
How do we begin building a CDK app?

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,660
Lastly,

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,620
we're going to discuss, specifically, how the CDK is

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,580
used with Python. Now, first off,

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,740
let's take a look at the cloud automation journey.

16
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:00,020
Some of you may have started your journey in the cloud through manual processes.

17
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,480
You go to the console, you point and you click,

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,340
and you provision your infrastructure from the console.

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:07,990
However,

20
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,860
you may have realized very quickly that that becomes

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,340
very hassle and very inefficient.

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,640
Afterwards, some of you may have attempted to script out your infrastructure.

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,420
Some of you have used the AWS CLI to automatically attach

24
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,340
an EBS volume or detach an EBS volume.

25
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,460
Some of you have used the CLI to automatically assign security groups,

26
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,040
for example.

27
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,630
However,

28
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,330
you notice, also, that the syntax for this can get quite

29
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,350
long and quite difficult to manage.

30
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,900
Lastly,

31
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,130
some of you may even use some sort of resource provisioning

32
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:56,000
engine. So some of you have used CloudFormation. Some of you have used Terraform to provision your AWS infrastructure.
