00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.140
Now in this demo, we're first going to create a Cloud 9 environment.

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.920
If you're following this at home,

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.140
you don't actually need a Cloud 9 environment for CDK to work.

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.730
However,

5
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.740
this ensures us that we have a consistent environment to run our project in.

6
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.040
Secondly, we're going to install the AWS CDK in that Cloud 9 environment.

7
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.420
Third,

8
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.370
we're going to use the Python 3 virtual environment module to

9
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.540
create a virtual environment for our CDK project.

10
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.140
This will help manage our CDK dependencies for us.

11
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.530
Fourth,

12
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.590
we're going to initialize the default CDK Python app so

13
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.040
that we can deploy and build it later.

14
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.040
Now we're going to create our Cloud 9 environment.

15
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.990
AWS has cloud‑enabled IDE.

16
00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:02.340
Now to create a Cloud 9 environment, go to services and look for Cloud 9.

17
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.560
Now in my case, I already have several Cloud 9 environments set up.

18
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.340
In your case, you may see a Getting Started screen.

19
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.220
Just make sure you click the Create environment button to create an environment.

20
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.910
In my case,

21
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.240
I'll select the Create environment button on the upper right‑hand corner.

22
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.910
Now I just need to give this Cloud 9 environment a name.

23
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.940
Let me just name this Test.

24
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.140
And then, for the most part, the default settings are fine.

25
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.840
However, there is one setting I will change, which is the platform.

26
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.640
I'm going to be changing the platform from Amazon Linux 2 to Ubuntu 18.04.

27
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.430
This will allow us to install dependencies more easily

28
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.940
because of the libraries available.

29
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.840
Another interesting thing about Cloud 9 is its cost‑saving capability.

30
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.560
So what Cloud 9 does is if you do not use the IDE for a period of time,

31
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.840
in this case 30 minutes,

32
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.270
then Cloud 9 will automatically stop the EC2 instance that it's running on.

33
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.120
This going to help save on costs if you're not using Cloud 9.

34
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.940
Afterwards, just click Next step and then create your Cloud 9 environment.

35
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.890
Now this may take some time to create.

36
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.340
However, I already have an environment set up for you.

37
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.430
Now this is a environment that I've named CDK that I'm

38
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.340
going to be using for the class.

39
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.540
Now Cloud 9 has a fully working Linux terminal here at the bottom.

40
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.850
I can also open files.

41
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.840
I can put whatever input I want in this file and save it wherever I want.

42
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.630
Now I can type whatever I want again in the file,

43
00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:03.000
and then it will save into the EC2 instance that this Cloud 9 environment is running on.
