1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,670
Now in this course, we've created serverless environments,

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,120
we've created containerized environments,

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,980
we've even created networking environments.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:19,640
We'll end this course by creating a virtualized environment in the cloud.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,360
So in this module,

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,840
we're first going to talk about how to create EC2 instances using the CDK.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:38,640
We'll then use the JSii interface to implement CDK interfaces in Python.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,580
Lastly,

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,220
we'll end with some final tips regarding the CDK project and

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:49,240
how to stay updated with the CDK project.

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,950
Now, going back to our scenario,

12
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:58,550
you can think of these instances as Globomantics wanting to

13
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:03,740
implement a more virtual machine type infrastructure.

14
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:09,440
Maybe they realize they have something that they cannot run on a container.

15
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,280
So what we're going to do is,

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,330
with the network we created from the previous module,

17
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:22,000
we're going to set up a bastion host that can connect to our private subnets,

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:36,000
our EC2 instances, which host a web application, and a load balancer, which will distribute the traffic to these EC2 instances.
