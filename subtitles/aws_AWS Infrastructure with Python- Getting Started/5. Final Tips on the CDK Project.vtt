Now, I hope those demos deploying these constructs on different

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.480
environments showed you that the CDK is quite straightforward to

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.870
use, and it's a project that is worthwhile following. Some final

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.420
tips before we close this course, we can actually go to the CDK Release page,

5
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.410
and you can see here that there are already several

6
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.840
releases that the CDK team have published.

7
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:41.740
In fact, the course uses version 1.58. There is already version 1.63 out.

8
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.040
And if you look at the release dates,

9
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.840
sometimes the release cycles are as short as just a few days.

10
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.840
So we needed to specify version 1.58 because we didn't know, or I didn't

11
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.670
know, what breaking changes may come up if we released a newer version, so I

12
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.740
couldn't just keep upgrading as the course went on.

13
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.710
You can actually see the new features, and most importantly,

14
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.240
the breaking changes on this particular page.

15
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.430
I've had several projects already where I had to rewrite the

16
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.220
code to meet the breaking changes, or to fix these breaking

17
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.040
changes, that the CDK lists down.

18
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.740
So the CDK is still very much an ongoing project,

19
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.890
and I suggest both checking this page, as well as the

20
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.310
Issues page for updates on the project.

21
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.740
I even suggest reporting some issues if you have any. The CDK

22
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.300
team monitors these issues religiously.

23
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.330
I have posted some issues myself. So if there is a feature that you want

24
00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:06.000
supported on the CDK or if there is a bug that you identify, don't hesitate to report it here.
