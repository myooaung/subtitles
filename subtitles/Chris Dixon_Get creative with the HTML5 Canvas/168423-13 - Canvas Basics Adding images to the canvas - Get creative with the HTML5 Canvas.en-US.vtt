00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.550
We're going to take a little break from actually drawing onto the canvas.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.905
I'm going to take a look at how we can actually add

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:11.055
images to the canvas and how we can work with them.

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:16.440
I've gone ahead and created a new pen and named it Adding Images To the Canvas.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.520
Go ahead and create one if you haven't already done so.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.015
To begin I'm going to change the style,

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:28.770
so let's just remove the background color because we don't need that.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:36.315
Then I'm just going to add the border once again of two pixels and a solid line.

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:41.740
Then let's get rid of the linear and the radial gradients section.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.100
Now we're left with a blank canvas with the border.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.100
Let's begin by adding image elements to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.210
the canvas and let's store this inside a variable called Image.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.460
Variable image is equal to a new image.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:09.200
Then we can set the source of the image with image.src,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.580
and then we'll add the path to the image you want to add.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.420
To grab an image I'm going to head over to Wikipedia.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.910
I'll go to wikipedia.org.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.090
Just take a look at an image which you want to work with.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.085
This looks like a nice image,

00:01:34.085 --> 00:01:36.235
so let's just click on that.

00:01:36.235 --> 00:01:39.810
Then if you right click or Control click,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.750
we can then click "Copy Image Address",

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.320
and then paste this inside the image source.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:56.265
To get this to display we need to use the draw image method, so ctx.drawImage.

00:01:56.265 --> 00:02:01.380
Then inside the brackets we need to first add the image you want to add.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.609
We've got it stored inside the image variable,

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:10.365
and then it's at the starting position so the x and y of 0, 0.

00:02:10.365 --> 00:02:14.095
This should make the image appear in the top left-hand corner.

00:02:14.095 --> 00:02:18.075
As you can see the image is a lot bigger than the canvas.

00:02:18.075 --> 00:02:20.715
It's stretched a lot further than we can see.

00:02:20.715 --> 00:02:22.325
This is easy to fix.

00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:25.370
All we need to do is set the size of the image.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.730
I'm going to set this to be the same size as the canvas with canvas.width,

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:40.725
then let's set the height to be canvas.height and save that.

00:02:40.725 --> 00:02:44.685
That's how we can add image to the canvas.

00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:48.185
We're not restricted to other new images every time.

00:02:48.185 --> 00:02:51.665
We can actually use a image which has already been added,

00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:55.965
not only to the canvas but to any part of a web page.

00:02:55.965 --> 00:03:00.565
So we can grab either the full image or a section of the image.

00:03:00.565 --> 00:03:05.369
To do that I'm just going to copy this image source,

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:09.460
and then let's delete the image we've just added.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.675
I'm going to add this image as a HTML element,

00:03:14.675 --> 00:03:20.240
so image source is equal to,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.160
and then paste in the link that we just copied.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.630
You can see that the image has appeared below the canvas. That's good.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.165
I'm just going to add an ID,

00:03:32.165 --> 00:03:37.830
so we can use that with scripting just simply of myImage.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.935
I'm going to use that to grab the image soon.

00:03:40.935 --> 00:03:44.205
Then just to restrict the height,

00:03:44.205 --> 00:03:49.210
so we can see a little bit better on the page let's set this to be 300,

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.280
and then close off the image tag.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.550
We've got an existing image which is appearing off the canvas.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.535
We want to grab the full image or a particular section. The way to do that.

00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:11.270
If we head back over to the script tags and then we can grab this image by its ID.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.905
Let's store the image inside a image variable once again.

00:04:15.905 --> 00:04:19.680
The image is equal to documents,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.820
and let's grab it by its ID with getElementByID.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.500
The ID which we want to grab is my image,

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.440
so just add that inside of there,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.860
and then we can redraw the image onto

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:49.090
the canvas with ctx.drawImage.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.940
What do you want to draw? Well, it's this variable called Image so let's add that in.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:01.280
Then the position which we want to add it to is 0, 0.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.100
The image doesn't appear on the canvas.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.495
This is because we are trying to crop the image before it is actually finished loading.

00:05:11.495 --> 00:05:15.430
To overcome this, we can add a onload function.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.460
This means our canvas code will not actually be

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.945
run until the document has finished loading.

00:05:21.945 --> 00:05:25.520
This includes all the images and all the scripts.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:33.020
Let's surround all the current script within the onload function, so window.onload.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.425
Once the browser has loaded up,

00:05:37.425 --> 00:05:39.880
we'll trigger a function.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.844
Let's open up the curly braces,

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:50.105
but surround all the existing code within the script between these curly braces.

00:05:50.105 --> 00:05:55.170
Let's just indent this and save that.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.910
Now the image has appeared on the canvas,

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.930
such as something to bear in mind because sometimes you try to grab

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.175
an image or something of a web page before it's actually loaded,

00:06:07.175 --> 00:06:08.615
and then when nothing happens,

00:06:08.615 --> 00:06:10.960
we sometimes think there's a problem with the code.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.210
Whereas all we need to do is wait for the window or

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.960
the browser to finish loading the script or the image,

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.845
and then we can begin to work with it.

00:06:20.845 --> 00:06:25.550
The last thing I want to show you is how to crop or slice an image.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.080
We can also do this by using

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.890
the same draw image method which you'll just take it and look at.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.710
The only difference is it takes in a lot more parameters.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.280
Let's take a look at a slide to find out how to use this.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.190
On the left-hand side is the source image.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.515
This is the original image, it's full size.

00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:52.310
The first parameter is just simply the image that we want to grab.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.495
We then got an x and y position which is the starting point

00:06:56.495 --> 00:07:01.405
in the top left-hand corner of the area that we want to crop.

00:07:01.405 --> 00:07:04.520
We'll then set the width and the height

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.775
of the area of the image which we would like to crop.

00:07:07.775 --> 00:07:09.725
Then on the right-hand side,

00:07:09.725 --> 00:07:13.160
we've got the last four parameters which all relate to

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.015
the canvas and how we'd like to place on the canvas.

00:07:17.015 --> 00:07:19.910
We'll start with the x and y position.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.955
They'd like to draw the cropped image too.

00:07:22.955 --> 00:07:26.960
Again, this is the top left-hand corner of the image in

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.710
relation to the canvas coordinates of 0, 0.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:37.165
Then lastly, we've got the width and the height of the cropped image.

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:41.945
This is the size the image will be when placed back onto the canvas.

00:07:41.945 --> 00:07:46.530
Let's head back over to CodePen and put this into practice.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.270
Using what we've just taken a look at,

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.800
we can add some additional parameters to draw image.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.135
Rather than the full size image,

00:07:56.135 --> 00:07:57.620
which we currently got,

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.715
I want to crop a 100 by 100 pixels

00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:06.710
square from the top left-hand corner of the original image.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.120
We can leave the first value as it is,

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.460
because this is the image which we would like to grab.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.465
We can also leave the 0,

00:08:15.465 --> 00:08:20.905
0 position as this is the top corner that we want to start from.

00:08:20.905 --> 00:08:26.645
The area which we want to grab is going to be 100 by 100.

00:08:26.645 --> 00:08:31.105
Then to place this section into the middle of the canvas,

00:08:31.105 --> 00:08:34.010
I'm going to use canvas.width,

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.345
divided by 2, take away 50.

00:08:39.345 --> 00:08:45.460
This 50 is half the width of the image so this will offset the image to be in the center.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.200
We'll do the same for the height.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:53.775
Divide by 2, take away 50.

00:08:53.775 --> 00:08:58.000
Then we'll keep out the same size as the original crop of

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.600
100 by 100 pixels, and there we have it.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.670
This is the top left-hand corner cropped from

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:11.055
the original image which is from this section.

00:09:11.055 --> 00:09:14.050
Then we'll place in this cropped area into the center of

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:18.230
the canvas with these last four parameters.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:24.350
That's how we can add images to the canvas and I'll see you in the next video.
