00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.330
Thank you for joining me on this course.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.495
I hope you've enjoyed it and hope you've learned a lot from it.

00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:11.280
We've covered so much ground including how to set up the Canvas.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.380
We then looked at basic scripting on how to draw shapes such as rectangles.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.190
We covered how to understand the Canvas coordinates.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.394
We also looked at lines and paths and how important it was to march up to pixels,

00:00:25.394 --> 00:00:28.270
to create crisp line edges.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.155
We looked at various other techniques such as corners and meters, arcs, and circles.

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:38.520
How to add text to the Canvas and also gradients.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.395
We finished off the Canvas basic section by adding

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:46.285
images to the Canvas and also pans and shadows.

00:00:46.285 --> 00:00:50.225
We then stepped up a little by moving on to the next section,

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:53.105
where we started looking at various different types of curves,

00:00:53.105 --> 00:00:56.425
such as Bezier and quadratic curves.

00:00:56.425 --> 00:01:01.955
We also covered the save and install methods and how to use them properly.

00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:07.930
Along with various transformations such as scaling, rotating, and translating.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.720
You should now understand how to work with pixels and

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.365
how to access the pixel data of an image,

00:01:15.365 --> 00:01:17.870
and then use that pixel data to manipulate

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.945
the image to create effect such as converting an image to be grayscale.

00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:27.170
We also looked at how Looping can make repetitive jobs a lot

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.740
simpler and also how to animate our drawings to really bring them to life.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.210
Then hopefully, at the end of the course,

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.174
you are able to have some success,

00:01:37.174 --> 00:01:38.900
we draw on Mickey Mouse's face,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.940
to put into practice all you've learned from the course.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.585
So for me, bye for now,

00:01:45.585 --> 00:01:49.110
and hopefully, I'll see you again in the future course.
