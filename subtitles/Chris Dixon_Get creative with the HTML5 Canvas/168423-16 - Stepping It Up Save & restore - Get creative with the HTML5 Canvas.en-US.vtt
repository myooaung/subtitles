00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.630
Welcome back guys. In this video,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.770
we're going to take a look at a interesting feature of the canvas,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.960
which is the save and restore methods.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.000
Let's create a new pane to demonstrate this.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.540
Let's call this save and restore,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:32.020
so Copy and Paste into the title and let's clean up the script,

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.340
totally all of the section from the last video.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:50.035
Then change the height of the canvas to be 600 and then we're good to go. There we go.

00:00:50.035 --> 00:00:54.110
First of all we are going to take a look at save on the say method

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.465
saves the current state of the canvas onto a stack.

00:00:58.465 --> 00:01:03.095
The current state saved includes things such as the stroke style,

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:05.165
the width of any line style,

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:08.315
the phones baselines, mighty limits,

00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:11.275
and the transformation to name a few.

00:01:11.275 --> 00:01:14.774
Let's begin by creating two circles,

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:18.625
so I'm going to create one red and one green.

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:23.050
I'm going to create a path, we'd begin path.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.060
This is for the first circle,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.035
so I'm going to add a fillStyle equal to

00:01:31.035 --> 00:01:38.860
green and then draw the circle with the arc method.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:47.145
The first position that I want is 150 by 150 on the x and y,

00:01:47.145 --> 00:01:49.905
a radius of 80,

00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:55.590
and then we'll create a full circle with the starting position of zero.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.280
Then two times math.pi,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.240
and then use a fill,

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:13.350
so it's a green circle and I'm just going to Copy this and Paste it in

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:21.090
below will change the fillStyle to the red and the position to be 400,

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.315
150, so we've got nice reds and a nice green circle.

00:02:27.315 --> 00:02:30.350
I'm going to create one more circle below,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.955
but this time without any color fill,

00:02:32.955 --> 00:02:41.830
so let's delete that and move the position to be 150, 400.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.720
Change the y to be 400.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.910
You notice how this third circle,

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.099
even though we haven't got a fillStyle,

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.610
has inherited the red color from the previous circle.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.080
This is fine if that's what we want.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.935
But we can also use save and restore at certain points to changes.

00:03:02.935 --> 00:03:08.350
For example, we can save the canvas state after the first circle and

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.960
then use the restore method just before we

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.645
create the third circle to give it the color of green.

00:03:14.645 --> 00:03:20.660
Just after the block of code for the first green circle,

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:27.160
let's add ctx.save and so we know what we're doing.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.630
We'll just add a comment,

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:38.080
so this will save the green fill and then to create the green fill on the third circle,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.110
we can add ctx.restore.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.880
Just fold the third circle is drawn. There we go.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.605
So that restores the circles color to be green just like the first one.

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:55.530
We can also carry on with multiple save and restore points.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.510
I'm going to create a fourth circle, not the bottom.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.330
This time the x is 400,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.790
the y is 400,

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.360
and the rest can remain the same.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.560
We've got a safe point for the green field,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.900
so let's add a safe point also for the red color.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:28.720
Let's do one more save and a comments so this will save the red fill.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.495
So you know, is something has just happened there.

00:04:32.495 --> 00:04:35.225
Once we've created a second save,

00:04:35.225 --> 00:04:37.240
we save the red fill,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.710
the green circle that we restore to you before is now reverted back to red.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.905
Let's just comment that out to C, so it's green.

00:04:46.905 --> 00:04:50.135
Then we add the save, and then it changes red.

00:04:50.135 --> 00:04:54.650
The reason this happens is because you mentioned at the start of this video

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.865
that every time we create a save is added to the stack,

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:00.680
so we're first going to save,

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.134
which is a greenfield,

00:05:02.134 --> 00:05:04.235
would then saved onto the stack

00:05:04.235 --> 00:05:09.260
a red fill and because we've only done the restore method once,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.225
it reverts back to the last safe, which is the red fill.

00:05:13.225 --> 00:05:18.035
If then we want to revert back one more save back to the greenfield,

00:05:18.035 --> 00:05:24.060
we need to do a second restore, so ctx.restore.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.660
Now this to restore back the green will just remove the fillStyle.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.095
That should go to green, which it does.

00:05:34.095 --> 00:05:36.555
Let's add some comments into that,

00:05:36.555 --> 00:05:41.940
so because this is the first restore,

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:51.520
this recovers the last save and the last save was the red fill.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.600
Then down below we've got the second restore,

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.700
which recovers the second last save from the stack,

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.590
and the second last color,

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.930
which you saved was the original green fill.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.410
They'll go so hope that makes sense.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.145
By using save and restore,

00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:21.905
it's all down to the order in which we create the saves.

00:06:21.905 --> 00:06:25.370
Then we need to restore in a particular order to make sure that

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.795
we recover the particular save that we'll want to re-use.

00:06:28.795 --> 00:06:32.420
Thank you and we'll move on now to the next video where we'll

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.050
take a look at how to scale, rotate, and translate.
