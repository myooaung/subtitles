00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.684
In the last video, we looked at some transformation methods such as: translate,

00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:08.955
rotate, and how to scale our objects.

00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:12.450
In this video, we're going to move on and take a look at how we can

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.025
apply all these transformations in a single method.

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:23.910
In particular, we're going to be taking a look at the transform method and set transform.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.120
Let's create our new pen to do this in.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.400
This one is called transformations.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.665
We can leave the size of the Canvas just as it is.

00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:49.685
In fact, we'll leave the first rectangle,

00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:51.290
which is the purple one.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.900
We should get rid of the orange example,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.920
and we'll get to work with this triangle.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.585
I've commented out rotate,

00:01:01.585 --> 00:01:05.010
and want to do the same for translate.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.035
You'll see why these two are left in, in just a moment.

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:15.330
This one restores our rectangle to be at the original coordinates in the top left.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.940
First we want to take a look at using the transform method, so ctx.transform.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.385
This can get quite complicated.

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:34.380
I'm just going to add a comment above to show you all the parameters which we can use,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.225
so the six interval.

00:01:36.225 --> 00:01:41.590
The first one is horizontal scaling.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.190
The second one is horizontal skewing.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.390
The primitive number 3 is vertical skewing.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.760
Then number 4 is vertical scaling.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:12.460
Just two more to go, number 5 is to translate or move horizontally.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.620
The last one, which is number 6,

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.590
is to translate vertically.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.905
There's quite a lot to take into account there.

00:02:29.905 --> 00:02:33.730
First of all, we're going to take a look at the parameters which we already know,

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.255
which we used in the last video and these are scaling and translating.

00:02:39.255 --> 00:02:42.950
Let's add these Inside the transform method.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.870
First of all, let's look at scaling.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.085
The first parameter is horizontal scaling.

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:51.020
I'm going to set this to be one,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.745
which is the equivalent of 100 percent.

00:02:54.745 --> 00:03:00.340
Just like the last video, 0.5 is 50 percent and so on.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.275
It is given for now, so let's set that to zero.

00:03:04.275 --> 00:03:07.195
Same with the vertical skewing.

00:03:07.195 --> 00:03:11.330
The fourth parameter is vertical scaling.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.695
I'll set that again to be one or 100 percent.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:21.925
Then number 5 and 6 is to translate on the x and y-axis.

00:03:21.925 --> 00:03:26.415
Let's just keep it simple and we'll translate it on the x-axis,

00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:32.475
50 pixels and zero on the y, and save that.

00:03:32.475 --> 00:03:35.100
There's our rectangle returned.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.820
It's been returned the same size because we've set

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.410
the scaling on the x and y to be 100 percent.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.990
I can make that a little bit bigger, just like so.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.880
Rather than the starting position to be in the top left hand corner of zero zero,

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.405
we've moved across 50 pixels on the x-axis,

00:04:02.405 --> 00:04:05.554
and we've left it at zero on the y-axis,

00:04:05.554 --> 00:04:07.860
so it's still at the top.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.810
The only parameters which we haven't looked at is the horizontal and vertical skewing.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.485
Let's apply some of these values now.

00:04:17.485 --> 00:04:21.870
Start with horizontal skewing and let's see what effect this has.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.795
Let's begin with 0.2. Lets increases this.

00:04:27.795 --> 00:04:32.925
0.5, and you get the idea so I can keep increasing this.

00:04:32.925 --> 00:04:36.340
We'll try one, and we can move even further,

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.185
we don't stop at one, and so on.

00:04:40.185 --> 00:04:43.170
Let's change the vertical skewing now.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.010
Again, let's begin with 0.2. and we should get

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.775
a skew in the vertical direction rather than horizontally.

00:04:51.775 --> 00:04:54.710
Let's take a look at 0.5.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.450
We can use this to make some interesting shapes.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.330
Let's try one. There we go.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.525
This is useful if we want to apply quite few transformations to the same shape.

00:05:07.525 --> 00:05:13.300
I'm going to change it it back to zero and return to our original rectangle.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.835
When using the translate methods,

00:05:15.835 --> 00:05:21.190
not only the transformations which we set within the parameters applied,

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:28.455
but it also takes into account any transformations such as scale and translate,

00:05:28.455 --> 00:05:31.610
which have already been declared previously.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.779
This is what we call add into the transformation matrix.

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:37.595
Using the transform method,

00:05:37.595 --> 00:05:43.480
we've moved the translate horizontally by 50 pixels.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:49.085
If we uncomment out the translates that we previously set.

00:05:49.085 --> 00:05:53.410
On the x-axis we've got the translate of 100 pixels,

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.140
so we should get the 100 pixels, add it of the 50.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.585
If we just uncomment out the translates, which we do.

00:06:03.585 --> 00:06:10.975
That's moved over 150 pixels and we've also got the 100 pixels on the y-axis.

00:06:10.975 --> 00:06:13.910
Just bear in mind that anything which is being

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.335
applied before this transform will also be taken into account.

00:06:18.335 --> 00:06:21.560
But what if we wanted our transformation to ignore

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.200
any previous transforms or to effectively reset the transformation matrix.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.670
Then this is when we can take advantage of the set transform method.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:38.105
Set transform resets the current transform before applying any transforms which we set.

00:06:38.105 --> 00:06:44.430
To do this all we need to do is change transform to be set transform.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.780
You notice how the translate that we set at the top has now been ignored,

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:56.604
leaving only the parameters which we set to be applied to the rectangle.

00:06:56.604 --> 00:06:59.655
That's how we can translate, scale,

00:06:59.655 --> 00:07:02.900
and skew by using the transform method.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.545
The main thing to remember is when using transform,

00:07:06.545 --> 00:07:10.399
it will always take into account any previous transforms.

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:13.700
However, if we set that to be set transform,

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.205
any previous transformations will be ignored,

00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:19.930
leaving only the ones in the brackets to be applied.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.210
Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.490
We'll take a look at working with pixels.
