00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.160
Welcome back guys. In this video,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.805
we're going to take a look at how to use gradients within the canvas.

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:12.435
In particular, we're going to take a look at two different types.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:17.085
We're going to take a look at linear and radial gradients.

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:21.845
To begin with, I've created a new pen, titled gradients.

00:00:21.845 --> 00:00:25.805
I'm going to remove the canvas script in, which we don't need.

00:00:25.805 --> 00:00:31.300
All the sections below the two variables can be removed.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.790
I'm going leave the style background as red, that's fine.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.990
Let's begin just with a comment,

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.945
just of linear gradients.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:50.465
We're going to start by using the create linear gradient method.

00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:58.860
So ctx.createLinearGradient, and as usual,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.460
be careful of the capital letters for linear on gradient.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.755
So within the brackets, we need to specify the start and the ending position.

00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:13.655
So I'm going to create a gradient from one corner of the canvas,

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:17.330
right across in a straight line to the other.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.260
This is going to be used to blend from one color to another,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.455
or even blend using as many colors as you like.

00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:29.115
So I'm going to set the starting position to be in the top left, which is 0,

00:01:29.115 --> 00:01:35.375
0, and then the finish position to be in the bottom right.

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:42.000
So let's crop that with canvas.width and canvas.height.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.325
So next I'm going to add this line into a variable.

00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:52.250
So variable I'm going to call mine linear,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.890
because it's a linear gradient.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.250
Let's store it inside there.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.415
We can then use this variable to add color stops,

00:02:01.415 --> 00:02:04.205
which is the color which we would like to add at

00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:08.980
various positions or various stages of the gradient.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:17.050
So let's add the variable of linear.addColorStop.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.650
So within the add color stop method,

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.170
I'm going to add two parameters.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.730
So the first one is a value between zero and one.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.115
This is the position of the gradient where we would like the color to apply to.

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:40.100
So zero is the start of the gradient,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.765
and one is the end.

00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:46.920
So I'm going to set the starting color to be green,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.520
and then I'm going to add two more.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.500
So linear.addColorStop.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.100
This time we're going to cycle of orange.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.355
I want this to be halfway across the gradient.

00:03:06.355 --> 00:03:12.350
So I'm going to set it to be 0.5 and color to be orange.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:20.890
Then we'll set one more in exactly the same way.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.315
But this time at the end of the gradient,

00:03:25.315 --> 00:03:27.430
which is position one,

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.130
and then the color, I want to set mine to be red.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.270
So we're nearly there now just a couple more lines to get this gradient to work.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.435
So next we're going to set the fillStyle,

00:03:41.435 --> 00:03:46.020
which you've seen before, ctx.fillStyle.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.760
So up to now in this course,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.945
we've been setting a certain color,

00:03:50.945 --> 00:03:52.640
such as white, red,

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.840
or black that we'd like to apply to the fillStyle.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.390
But this time we can apply the gradient by adding the linear variable,

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.710
which we just created.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.800
Then lastly, we need to create the rectangles,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.600
add the gradient too.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.510
So let's simply use a fillRect method.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.330
I'm going to create this rectangle to be the same size as the canvas.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.825
So 0, 0, 600,

00:04:22.825 --> 00:04:27.450
300, and save that, and there we have it.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.010
There is our linear gradient.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.010
So we start the beginning,

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.095
which is position zero.

00:04:34.095 --> 00:04:39.660
We start with a green color, and then halfway we blend into orange.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.830
Then finally we end at the red color,

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.005
which is set to be position one,

00:04:45.005 --> 00:04:50.375
which is the very last position of the gradient, which is just here.

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:55.365
I've created the rectangle to add the linear gradient too.

00:04:55.365 --> 00:04:58.010
So I mentioned at the start of this video we're going to

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.995
take a look at two different types of gradients.

00:05:00.995 --> 00:05:02.885
So the first one being linear,

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:06.965
and then the next one we're going to take a look at is radial gradient.

00:05:06.965 --> 00:05:10.070
So the difference between a linear gradient work

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.190
between two points across a straight line,

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.300
whereas a radial gradient is circular and is

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.920
a blend between two imaginary circles, which we specify.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.040
So let's take a look at radial gradient.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.275
Just like we've done for the first example,

00:05:34.275 --> 00:05:37.105
I'm going to create a variable, store this in.

00:05:37.105 --> 00:05:41.230
So this time I'm going to call it radial.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:50.250
So set that equal to ctx.createRadialGradient.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.780
So the parameters we need to add is different to the linear gradient.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.185
Rather than having a start point and an end point,

00:06:03.185 --> 00:06:07.025
we need to define two imaginary circles.

00:06:07.025 --> 00:06:10.430
One being starting and one being an ending circle.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:16.490
So to begin, I'm going to create the two circles at the same starting coordinates.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.160
Then we'll create the gradient effect by enlarging the second circle's radius.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.895
So let's add the six parameters.

00:06:23.895 --> 00:06:27.305
The first three parameters is for the starting circle.

00:06:27.305 --> 00:06:30.860
So I'm going to create this at the center of the canvas,

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.910
which is 300, 150.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.295
The third value is the radius of the starting circle.

00:06:38.295 --> 00:06:41.550
So I'm going to set that to be 10.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.380
Then we're going to do the same for the second circle.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.590
So again, at the center of the canvas of 300, 150.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.860
But this time we'll make the radius to be 150.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.370
Then just like the linear example,

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:03.930
we can use the radial variable to add the color stops.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.080
You can add any color which you like inside there.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.755
I'm just going to keep mine the same as the last example.

00:07:13.755 --> 00:07:16.050
In fact, I just copy

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:26.470
these two lines and change the variable to be radial.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.760
Then set the fillStyle,

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.435
and this is radial.

00:07:39.435 --> 00:07:43.580
Then just as before, we'll also use fillRect.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.635
I'm going to set it to be the full size of the canvas.

00:07:50.635 --> 00:07:55.610
So 0, 0, 600, 300.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.910
Now we've got the radial gradient displaying on the screen.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:06.130
So we create the first imaginary circle with the radius of 10.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.845
This is the smaller inner circle,

00:08:08.845 --> 00:08:12.380
which has the starting color of green.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.375
Then as we move outwards to the largest circle,

00:08:16.375 --> 00:08:19.460
which has radius of a 150,

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:24.095
this is the endpoint where we blend to red,

00:08:24.095 --> 00:08:26.980
which is the outside of the circle.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.280
So this effect is being achieved by placing two circles,

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.780
both on the same starting coordinates of 300, 150.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.110
Of course, we can play around with these and create an offset.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:46.260
So for example, if we change the x position of the starter circle to be 200,

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.505
that moves the green section to be far with the left.

00:08:50.505 --> 00:08:53.015
We can play around with this and get some nice effects.

00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:57.875
So let's change that back, and we can also change the position of the ending circle.

00:08:57.875 --> 00:09:01.150
So I'll change that one to be 200 too.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:06.815
This offsets the second circle to the left too giving us a different effect there.

00:09:06.815 --> 00:09:11.015
So do have a play around with those values and see what you can create.

00:09:11.015 --> 00:09:13.520
Then when you're ready to move on to the next video,

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.190
we'll take a look at adding images to the canvas. Will see you there.
