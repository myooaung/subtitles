00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.120
Okay guys. First of all,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.630
before we start drawing anything onto the Canvas,

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.680
I just want to take one or two moments just to take a quick look what we can

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.465
do with HTML5 Canvas and what exactly the Canvas is.

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:20.760
So basically the Canvas is a HTML element.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.610
Just like many of the HTML tags,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.935
such as paragraph tags,

00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:30.270
we have a opening and a closing elements.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.400
So unlike the image tag,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.025
for example, it's not a self-closing tag.

00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:36.790
So we don't need the opening tag,

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.670
and then the closing tag with the forward slash.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.810
It's a rectangular area of a web page which we can use to draw.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.710
To enable us to draw,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.675
we use a scripting language,

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:52.760
which is usually JavaScript's,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.250
but scripting languages can be used.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.320
But for the remainder of this course,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.540
we will be using JavaScript as is the most popular language used with the Canvas.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.010
If you do need any help with tutorials or references online,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.480
pretty much all of them are based on JavaScript and finally,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.690
the Canvas was added in HTML5.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.570
So it's pretty new, but it is quite well supported.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.870
Now let's take a look at one or two things that we can do with the Canvas.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.520
So as we mentioned before,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.880
we can use the Canvas to draw.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.920
We can draw things such as rectangles, circles, straight lines,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.325
and arcs, and many of the different types

00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:41.645
of graphics which we'll get into as we progress through the course.

00:01:41.645 --> 00:01:44.880
We can even draw text to the Canvas.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.705
We can add some simple text or we can at various different fonts, different colors.

00:01:50.705 --> 00:01:55.330
We can add gradients and even animate that text.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.835
The Canvas can be used to also add images

00:01:58.835 --> 00:02:02.270
and its various different image manipulation techniques,

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.170
which we'll look at as we progress through the course.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.360
We'll also take a look out various

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.795
animations on various transformations as we go through the course.

00:02:11.795 --> 00:02:14.630
There's lots of cool facts you can add such as

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.955
rotations and you can apply some of these animations to actually create games.

00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:22.865
A lot games isn't really covered in this course.

00:02:22.865 --> 00:02:26.270
A lot of the techniques which we will use can then

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.250
be applied to games if that's something which you want to progress onto.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.960
Finally, we can also patterns, gradients,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.890
and shadows to the graphics and the text to make that look really good.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.515
So I mentioned before that the Canvas has a opening and a closing tag,

00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:49.585
and also that the Canvas is pretty well spotted now.

00:02:49.585 --> 00:02:52.950
But just equip ourself for supported browsers.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.380
Between these two tags,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.690
we can add some plain text.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.320
Just let the user know that the Canvas isn't supported in

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.230
their browser and maybe message just to ask them to update to a newer browser.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.950
So we can use this as a fallback fall on supported browsers.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.725
Again, like many over HTML elements,

00:03:15.725 --> 00:03:20.520
we can also add attributes to the Canvas opening tag.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.660
Many of these will look very familiar if you've done a little bit of HTML in the past.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.570
This example has a ID,

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.270
which we're going to be using throughout this course to target the Canvas.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.940
This example's got a width and the height

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.340
attribute to set the size of the Canvas which you want to use,

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.495
and we can also add a style attribute,

00:03:45.495 --> 00:03:49.360
add things such as background colors, and borders.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.940
Lets look what the HTML5 Canvas is,

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.145
some things we can use it for.

00:03:56.145 --> 00:03:58.970
So now let's move on to the next video.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.670
I will actually get started with setting up the Canvas.
