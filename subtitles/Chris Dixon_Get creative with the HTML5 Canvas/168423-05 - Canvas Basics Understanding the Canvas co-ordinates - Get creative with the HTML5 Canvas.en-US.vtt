00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.685
In the last video, we'll drew some rectangles and some squares onto the Canvas.

00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:09.705
You were introduced to some basic Canvas coordinates.

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:12.120
We just want to take a few moments now just to look at

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.760
the Canvas coordinates in more detail.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.220
Understanding how the coordinates work will really

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.200
help you as you progress through this course.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:27.150
Already know that 0,0 is the top left-hand corner of the Canvas.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.765
If we imagine this grid is the Canvas and

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:34.825
each little square contained within the grid is one pixel.

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:37.625
Because we're using the 2D context,

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:41.465
we have both the x and the y-axis.

00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:45.965
The x-axis runs horizontally across the Canvas,

00:00:45.965 --> 00:00:48.655
whereas the y runs vertically.

00:00:48.655 --> 00:00:55.330
We'll have position 0, 0 on the top left-hand corner represented by the little dot.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.295
As the x value is increased,

00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:01.550
we run across the Canvas horizontally.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.010
If we go across four pixels,

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.010
this is the starting points of the square,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.340
so x is equal to four.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.290
Because the starting points of the square is only one pixel from the top.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.530
This makes the y value equal to one.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.540
It's just the same as we looked at in the last video,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.430
where we set the 0, 0 position of the first rectangle.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.660
Then we set the second rectangle,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.110
or the second square to begin in the center of

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.315
the Canvas to create a square in the bottom right-hand corner.

00:01:34.315 --> 00:01:39.530
We set the x and y position to be 150 by 150,

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.285
which was exactly halfway in the middle of the Canvas.

00:01:43.285 --> 00:01:46.520
Being able to get your hand round these coordinates from

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.795
an early stage will really help you as you progress through the course.

00:01:49.795 --> 00:01:53.180
It's really worth knowing that particularly the y-axis

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.080
in traditional geometry and in various different industries,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.060
a positive y value,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.130
would actually increase up.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.900
Whereas in the Canvas,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.065
all the positive values for y go vertically down the Canvas.

00:02:08.065 --> 00:02:11.330
If you do come from a particular background where

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.115
the coordinates are done in a different way, just be careful of that.

00:02:15.115 --> 00:02:19.740
Hope that makes sense. Now we'll move on to creating more drawings.
