00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.180
So now we've got a better understanding of how to work with pixels using the Canvas,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.545
and now I'd like to set a challenge for you to have a go at.

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:16.589
That challenge is to take a color image and convert it to be grayscale,

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:18.450
or black and white,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.660
I'd really like you to give this a go yourself before

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.585
moving on to the solution in the next video.

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:27.990
But before I leave you to go ahead and give this a go,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.185
there's just one or two little things I'd like to show you first,

00:00:31.185 --> 00:00:32.980
just to help you along.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.880
The first one is actually how to make an image grayscale.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.955
In the last video we used a for loop,

00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:44.950
and we grabbed all of the pixel data from the canvas.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.785
Once you found a image to place onto the canvas,

00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:54.280
using draw image I'll then like you to create a for loop in a similar way to this one,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.375
although we do only need the red,

00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:58.480
green, and blue channels.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.850
The way we can create a grayscale effect on image is to set the value of the red,

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.040
green, and blue channel to be the average of all three.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.715
One way of doing that is create a variable and add the three values together,

00:01:14.715 --> 00:01:16.605
and then divide it by three,

00:01:16.605 --> 00:01:21.730
and set the three channels to be the equivalent of the average value.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.890
Another important thing I'd like to point out,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.250
which may cause some problems along the way is we need to

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.925
use the get ImageData method for the challenge.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:35.660
When using this method, it requires that the image as well as

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.390
the code executing it is on the same domain of the web server.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.860
Because we don't have access to the server,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.585
because we're using CodePen,

00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:49.735
we need to add a special attribute to the image called cross origin,

00:01:49.735 --> 00:01:52.220
and this allows us to use an image from

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.165
a different source in our demo without throwing any errors.

00:01:56.165 --> 00:01:59.615
If you want to find out more about the cross-origin attribute,

00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:03.150
you can head over to this link on the screen now.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.385
Otherwise I'll just show you the one line of code

00:02:09.385 --> 00:02:12.910
which you'll need to add in when creating the image.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.580
The line of code that you do need to add,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.045
first of all I'm going to select a image variable.

00:02:22.045 --> 00:02:26.425
If your valuable for load an image is a different name,

00:02:26.425 --> 00:02:28.135
of course do change that.

00:02:28.135 --> 00:02:35.870
Then cross origin, and I'm going to set mine equal to anonymous.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.470
So if you add this line of code in just

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.405
before adding the image source, you should be good to go.

00:02:44.405 --> 00:02:49.535
Also know if you working along with a text editor instead of using CodePen,

00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:52.580
you may also run into the same issue in certain browsers,

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.630
such as Google Chrome when using the default settings.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.450
A workaround for this is to use a local host such as MMP to serve up your project.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.030
Or I've also found the Firefox browser works without any issues,

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.350
so I leave that with you to have a go.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.510
If you do get stuck, don't worry,

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.630
just move onto the next video and I'll show you my solution.
