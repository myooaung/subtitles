00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.535
I want to begin in this video by doing some basic Canvas setup.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:20.340
I'm going to work for this video and for the remainder of this course in CodePen,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.135
which is available from codepen.io.

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:28.665
As you can see, CodePen is a playground for the front end web.

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:31.590
Basically, what we can do on using CodePen,

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.590
is we can have online text editor,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.660
where we can use our code.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.755
Also alongside in a split screen,

00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:45.835
we can also have a browser window which displays the results of our code.

00:00:45.835 --> 00:00:49.235
We'll do these in what is called a Pen.

00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:52.610
A pen is just its own self-contained area,

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.430
such as we can create a website using a pen.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.495
I'm also going to be using Pens for each section of this course,

00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:05.345
just so all the different areas are contained and you can use them for future reference.

00:01:05.345 --> 00:01:07.790
Of course, if you don't want to use CodePen,

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.465
you can use a desktop-based text editor and also a web browser,

00:01:13.465 --> 00:01:16.500
so feel free to do that route if you prefer.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.280
But for the remainder of this course,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.170
I'm going to use CodePen.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.360
If CodePen is something which you haven't used before,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.705
click on the "Sign Up" button at the top-right-hand corner,

00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:31.920
and then follow the simple sign-up process to create an account.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.395
CodePen does come with a monthly cost if you do want to use one of the pro accounts.

00:01:39.395 --> 00:01:41.960
However, all you need for the remainder of

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.610
this course is sign up for one of the free plans.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.600
Go ahead and click on Sign up for them.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.250
You should hit the "Login" button.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.840
I'm just going to log into my account and hence,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.685
begin with set up the Canvas.

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:02.440
I'm going to click on "New Pen."

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.715
When you first start, this will be the screen that you see.

00:02:09.715 --> 00:02:12.190
You may have a slightly different layout.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.565
The white arrow you can see on the right-hand-side,

00:02:15.565 --> 00:02:19.705
is going to be the area where we can see the results of our code.

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:22.550
Effectively, it's going to be the web browser.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.735
I've got a HTML section,

00:02:24.735 --> 00:02:28.935
a CSS section, and a JavaScript section.

00:02:28.935 --> 00:02:33.995
For this video, I'm just going to be concentrating in the HTML section.

00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:39.310
I'm just going to rearrange this just to get small some more room in there.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.570
Then I'm just going to click on the Pen and then call it "Setting up the Canvas."

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.640
Then I'm going to save that to start with.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.940
The first thing I want to do in the HTML section is to create a basic HTML skeleton.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.885
That's nice and easy to do in CodePen.

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:08.630
If you type in htlm:5.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.500
We can use the ML commands and the Hit tab,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.280
then that creates a HTML5 scale inference to begin with.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.955
I would set it straight to the documents tittle.

00:03:20.955 --> 00:03:23.370
I'm just going to call it the same,

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.650
"Setting up the Canvas."

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.160
Now, we're good to go inside the body section.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.730
We know from the last video,

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.990
that the HTML5 Canvas has the Canvas tags.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.980
We have the opening Canvas tag,

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.130
and we also have the closing tag with the forward slash.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:56.070
Begin with these two, then let's add some attributes inside the open-end Canvas tag.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.390
We know that we can draw graphics with the Canvas using scripting.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.680
I will mention that we're going to be using JavaScript for the rest of the course.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.845
We'll link the script to the Canvas by referring to the Canvas's ID,

00:04:11.845 --> 00:04:15.315
which you're now going to set as attribute.

00:04:15.315 --> 00:04:19.800
Give the Canvas an ID and you call it anything you want,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.610
but I'll simply going to call it "myCanvas."

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.330
If we save that, we'll notice on the right-hand-side,

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.390
that there's actually no Canvas drawn on the screen.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.480
This is because the Canvas tags as they are,

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.575
actually, don't draw anything by default.

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:39.919
Just so we can see underneath the title,

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.635
I'm just going to add some styling there.

00:04:42.635 --> 00:04:46.530
This is just standard CSS styles.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.260
I'm just going to add a color to the background.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:58.410
Let's begin by tag in the Canvas and then add a background.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.970
I'm going to make mine red. There we go.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.430
That is the Canvas appearing on the screen there.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.080
We can see that there's a red rectangle appear.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.599
This is because by default,

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:18.255
the width of the Canvas is 300 pixels wide with a default of 150 pixels height.

00:05:18.255 --> 00:05:22.515
Of course, we can't change this in the attributes.

00:05:22.515 --> 00:05:26.700
We can add a width of

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:34.550
300 pixels and also add a height of 300 pixels.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.510
Now, you can see we've got a nice square Canvas to begin with, then finally,

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.030
for unsupported browsers, let's add

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.460
the fallback text that we looked at in the last video.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.495
We'll start with the message of your browser,

00:05:48.495 --> 00:05:51.970
it does not support the HTML5 Canvas.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:11.670
Please consider updating or changing

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:21.210
your browser for

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.560
a better experience.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.320
Just like that. You can see if we save the Pen at the text,

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.030
which will just place inside there,

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.770
it doesn't actually appear in the Canvas on the right-hand-side.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.940
This is because our demonstration environment fully spots the Canvas,

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.340
but of course, it's good practice to leave that in

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.615
there for people who don't have an up-to-date browser.

00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:50.225
Now, we've got the basics of how to set up the Canvas,

00:06:50.225 --> 00:06:52.250
now, let's move on to the next video,

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.600
we'll get down some drawing.
