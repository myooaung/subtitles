00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.260
This video is all about corners and miters.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.495
Let's create a new Pen for this video by [inaudible] the last one.

00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:18.360
Then as usual, just change the title to be corners and

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.910
miters and the same inside the HTML title.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.070
Let's create some more space.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.380
Then for this example, I'm just going to leave the first triangle

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.800
from the last video and then get rid of the second one.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.860
There we go. The triangle which we've got on the screen has sharp corners.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.100
We can change this by using various properties.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.565
We can add rounded corners on beveled corners,

00:00:57.565 --> 00:01:01.835
as well as these miter corners which you can see by default.

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:10.090
The way to do that is to use the context.lineJoin,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.220
and then we can set the type of join that we want to use for each one of the corners.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.800
The first one I'm going to add is round, and then save that.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.080
We can see that the edges on the free corners of

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.070
the triangle now have a much softer rounded edge to them.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.680
We can also change the rounded corners to be a bevel.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.065
This adds much more of a squared off effect to each one of the three sides.

00:01:41.065 --> 00:01:44.465
The third property, which we can add is the miter,

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:47.915
and the miter is the defaults which we started with.

00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:51.710
This won't actually make any changes from the original triangle,

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.805
we're just left with the three sharp corners.

00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:57.635
If the miter effect is what you're looking for,

00:01:57.635 --> 00:02:01.730
you don't need to add this line in at all as its default.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.330
That's three styles which you can add to corners.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.850
Next, I want to show you how to use lineCap.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.410
LineCap is a technique which you can use to change the style of the ends of the line.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:23.340
To demonstrate this, I'm just going to remove the last two lines of the triangle.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.205
Just make that into a straight line.

00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:32.470
Then we can change lineJoin to be lineCap.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.995
The default is the butt

00:02:37.995 --> 00:02:43.065
and this is just the squared edges which we see on a standard line.

00:02:43.065 --> 00:02:45.720
It squares off each one of the ends

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.735
and is the default style if nothing else is specified.

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:52.555
We can also change these to be round,

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:55.840
just as with the triangle example, which we just looked at.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.915
We got a nice rounded corner on each of the ends of the line.

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:04.540
Now, the last one is the square.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.010
By using a square, you may not notice much of a difference

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.045
and actually looks quite similar to the butt which we just looked at before,

00:03:13.045 --> 00:03:14.874
which is the default.

00:03:14.874 --> 00:03:17.435
However, when using the square,

00:03:17.435 --> 00:03:20.515
it does actually make the line a little bit longer

00:03:20.515 --> 00:03:25.045
because a square is added on to each end of the line.

00:03:25.045 --> 00:03:30.075
The square extends out half of the width of the line,

00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:34.135
so it makes it a little bit longer on each end.

00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:36.170
It's only a subtle difference,

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.160
but it's worth bearing in mind if you need to have control over the length of the line.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.460
That's how you use lineJoin and also lineCap.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.865
The third and final technique which we want to take a look at in this video,

00:03:49.865 --> 00:03:52.260
is how to use the miterLimit.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.430
Let's take a little look at some slides to get better understanding.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.290
I've created a sketch to give you

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.230
a better understanding of the miterLimit before we actually get into any code.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.160
In front of you is two different corners with different angles.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.080
As you can see, these different angles create a different length of miter.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.435
From the inside points to the outside points,

00:04:18.435 --> 00:04:23.785
the length is much wider on this example than over on the left.

00:04:23.785 --> 00:04:30.960
We can actually have control of the length of this miter by using the miterLimit.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.750
We can control the length of the miter if we want to by using miterLimit.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.825
If the length of the miter is longer than the miterLimit, which we set,

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:46.930
the corner, as you can see on the right example,

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.135
is then beveled or effectively cut off.

00:04:51.135 --> 00:04:55.650
We can use this to gain control over the length of our miters.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.980
Let's head back over to CodePen and put this into practice.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.585
For this example, we just need to add another line.

00:05:04.585 --> 00:05:07.450
Just make this into a corner,

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.085
so create a lineTo.

00:05:10.085 --> 00:05:15.510
I'm going to make this 30,100.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.625
I should play around these to get a nice corner.

00:05:18.625 --> 00:05:23.050
I'm going to make that 250 and 70.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:29.390
I'll just change the x and y for the pen to move to 30 and 30.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.765
Now, let's make the line width just a little bit smaller,

00:05:34.765 --> 00:05:37.270
change that to be 10.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.590
We can see the full angle or the full corner now on screen.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.650
We don't need the lineCap from the previous example either.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:55.135
Okay, the first thing we need to do is set the lineJoin to be the type of miter.

00:05:55.135 --> 00:05:57.715
Let's add that here now.

00:05:57.715 --> 00:06:06.700
LineJoin equals miter, then we can add the miterLimit just below.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.015
We're just going to begin with the value of 10.

00:06:13.015 --> 00:06:15.950
10 is actually the default value.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.255
You won't notice any difference by setting this to be 10.

00:06:19.255 --> 00:06:23.410
We've got a long sharp edge on there, got a sharp corner.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.725
Let's just try and reduce this down to five and see what happens.

00:06:27.725 --> 00:06:32.340
The value of 5 is lower than the length of the corner,

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.570
so this has now being set to be a beveled end.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.330
We can use this to restrict the sharpness of a corner.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.035
That's how we can use corners and miters with the canvas.

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:48.649
We'll move now on to the next video where we'll take a look at arcs and circles.
