00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.475
Welcome back guys. This video is called Removing Sections of The Canvas.

00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:07.650
I'm going to take a look at a couple of

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.220
different methods to both cover-up sections of the Canvas,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.215
and also completely remove

00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:17.565
the pixels which had been drawn to certain areas of the Canvas.

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:21.420
But let's take a look at how to clip an area of

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.740
the Canvas to restrict the drawing to a certain shape.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.460
I've gone ahead and fork the last video and set

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.690
the title to removing sections of the Canvas.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.530
I'm now going to remove all of the scripting

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.615
as usual except the Canvas and the context variables.

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:49.600
Then lastly, I'm going to change the style at the background,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.290
and let's set that to be red.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.030
You'll see why in just a moment.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.305
Using what we already know,

00:01:03.305 --> 00:01:08.255
we can create the effect of removing sections of the Canvas just by adding

00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:14.200
a shape such as a rectangle with a background color such as white.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.295
Let's do that now. First of all,

00:01:17.295 --> 00:01:22.590
set the fill style of the rectangle,

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.300
and I'm going to make that white.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.930
Then let's create the rectangle itself with fillRect.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.405
I'm going to create mine in the top left-hand corner.

00:01:36.405 --> 00:01:40.350
So zero-zero for the starting position,

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.390
a width of half the Canvas,

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:51.060
which is 300, and then I want to set the height to be half the Canvas again, of 150.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.425
Then we get a white rectangle in the top corner,

00:01:54.425 --> 00:01:58.355
which gives of the illusion that part of the Canvas has been removed.

00:01:58.355 --> 00:02:01.490
However, this is just covering the object which is being

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.900
drawn rather than actually removing any pixels.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.275
If we wanted to actually remove any pixels

00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:12.365
within a certain area which has already been drawn,

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:15.770
we can do this by using the clearRect method,

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.590
and this actually removes all the pixels within a given area.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.985
Let's take a look at that. If we

00:02:23.985 --> 00:02:27.875
wanted to remove part of the rectangle which we've just drawn,

00:02:27.875 --> 00:02:33.030
we could use ctx.clearRect,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.360
and the parameters work in the same way as the fillRect.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.205
We start with the position that we want to begin with,

00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:46.360
which in my case is zero-zero.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.570
I'm just going to create a 100 by 100 square to remove,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.645
which you can see it's just about the top corner.

00:02:56.645 --> 00:03:02.875
This has removed the pixels which has been drawn within this 100 by 100 section.

00:03:02.875 --> 00:03:06.200
Of course, if you want to clear the whole of the Canvas,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:14.035
you can just simply add canvas.width and also canvas.height.

00:03:14.035 --> 00:03:17.210
This will select the whole area of the Canvas and

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.750
clear all the pixels which has been drawn to it.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.550
I'll just put a command in front of this just to get our white triangle back.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.170
The last method I want to show you is clip.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.580
If you've ever used a clipping mask in photo editing software such as Photoshop,

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.895
clip works with the same effects.

00:03:39.895 --> 00:03:45.170
We declare a section we want to clip such as a rectangle or a circle

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.360
then anything else which we draw on

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.460
the Canvas will only be visible within this drawn area.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.175
Anything else outside of this area will not be visible.

00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:58.415
Let's take a look at an example.

00:03:58.415 --> 00:04:02.520
I'm just going to draw one more rectangle.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.520
This time I'm going to create a white rectangle in the bottom right-hand corner.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.480
I'm going to set the starting position to be in the center of the Canvas,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.230
so that's 300, 150.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.320
Then exactly the same for the size 300 by 150.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.940
To create this clip, I going to first draw a circle in the center of the Canvas.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.480
We can use a circle to be the area which we want to restrict the drawing to.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.295
Let's add a circle or an arc.

00:04:41.295 --> 00:04:44.920
We know how to do this. We can use ctx.arc.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.250
The starting position is in the center.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.080
The Canvas width divided by two. Same for the heights.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.955
The radius of 150.

00:05:02.955 --> 00:05:05.515
Then to draw a full circle,

00:05:05.515 --> 00:05:13.760
we'll start with the zero as the starting position and then two times Math.PI.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.190
Then we'll draw it with the stroke.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.920
Now, there is our a circle which is the full height of the Canvas.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.350
Now, if we want to restrict all the drawing to be inside of the circle,

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.420
we can then clip this area.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.860
We have ctx.clip.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.125
Now, all the rectangles and all the objects which had been drawn

00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:52.190
is only visible within this circle or this area which we've created.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.800
All that's left outside the circle is simply the Canvas background color.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.760
That's how we can remove sections off the Canvas.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.585
We looked at how to cover up certain areas,

00:06:04.585 --> 00:06:08.580
we looked at how to remove pixels off the Canvas, and finally,

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.580
we looked at the clip method to restrict all the drawing to within a certain area,

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.330
such as the circle which we've drawn.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.220
We'll leave this video there, and I'll see you in

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.130
the next video where we'll take a look at gradients.
