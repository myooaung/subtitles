00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.000
So a big congratulations from me for reaching the end of this course.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.820
So as a little bit of a fun exercise,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.735
I'll like to challenge you to draw a Mickey Mouse's face.

00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:21.670
Now it doesn't need to be perfect,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.465
the whole idea is just to give you something to practice with,

00:00:25.465 --> 00:00:30.305
which involves some of the techniques which we looked at throughout this course and

00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:32.200
it also gives you a chance to think about things

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.195
yourself rather than typing along with me.

00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:39.340
So this is what I come up with and this is what I'd like you to create.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.590
So I would recommend finding a simple Mickey Mouse picture, just to copy from.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.190
So one little tip which you may find useful is

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.285
before actually drawing the curves for a lot of the face,

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:58.930
you may find it a lot easy by creating some small arcs as reference points.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.185
For example, the start and the ending point of a curve,

00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:06.920
and this is what I do when creating this example and having

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.890
these reference points to hand really does make it a lot easier when drawing the curves.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.550
So go ahead and spend a little time trying to replicate this,

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.715
and don't worry if you do struggle with any of these paths.

00:01:19.715 --> 00:01:21.020
Because in the next video,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.830
I'll show you the solution to how I created this. So good luck.
