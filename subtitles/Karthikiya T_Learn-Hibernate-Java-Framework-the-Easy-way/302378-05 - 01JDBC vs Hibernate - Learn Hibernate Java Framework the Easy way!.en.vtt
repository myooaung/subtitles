00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.010
Here are some of the differences between J.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:08.810
BBC versus Happen it and you'll see why have been it is a better alternative combat to jail

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.810
.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.550
BBC One is off course,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.770
the object mapping,

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.890
which we've already talked about with Jerry busy,

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.690
we have to do it manually and with have been it,

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.050
it will do the same for us.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.070
One of the primary strengths off happen.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.940
It is it offer so called I have iniquity language.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.580
Now.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.970
If you worked with database for a bit,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.440
then you probably know that the syntax off SQL statements vary a little bit,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.840
depending on the database that you deal with,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.300
if you learn,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.010
have been it query language.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.050
No matter which did the best you're using,

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.510
the statements are going to remain same so that it would be easier to switch to alternate

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.480
data basis without having to change or without having to introduce a lot of changes in your

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.970
code.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.740
Using Jerry BC,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.350
you sort of have to enter the database specific queries,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.010
but with Cabinet EQ and just simply use hedge fuel that would remain common for all the

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.380
databases because because happen,

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.370
it is actually going to take care off converting this into the database specific SQL

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.150
statement.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.190
And added to that,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.660
as I've already mentioned with have been it,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.070
you're actually interact with the Java objects.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.710
So in here,

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.950
in the statement with which we're trying to delete an entry from student,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.770
this student in here is actually the name of the class,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.270
not the name of the table reciting the relational database.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.960
So that's the kind of beauty that happen.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.460
It offers for developers.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.200
And all the Java developers would actually feel more comfortable interacting with the job

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.650
object rather than the relation database table.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.610
And as a by product,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.490
we have the falling advantages.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.700
With this approach,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.350
we can actually get into the notion off polymorphism inheritance,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.310
etcetera and have been It will take care off mapping all these notions with the relation

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.850
database.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.450
We're going to take a look at an example.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.270
We have videos dedicated to talk on all these.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.720
You'll have to wait until then and the statements that you write in happen it or not case

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.450
since two,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.620
for example,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.220
hammocks off upper case and lower case in here,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.720
but still it is valid.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.600
But of course,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.350
case sensitivity is applicable when you're defining your class name.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.970
This is something that revolve that you talked about isn't HBO?

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.860
You don't have to worry too much about switching to alternators.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.080
One of the major advantages off use inhabited framework is its ability to handle the

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.900
exceptions.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.970
I mean to go back here with very busy approach.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.850
We have to rob the code and on the try catch block,

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.300
and then we have to cast the exceptions.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.190
That's because these are checked exceptions,

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.130
and and we developers have to take care off dealing with those exceptions.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.630
But whereas with hibernate happen,

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.430
it is actually going to convert those checked exceptions into unchecked exceptions so that

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.250
we developers don't have to deal with it.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.800
So that's going to save a lot off typing,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.030
improve the readability of the code,

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.750
etcetera.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.920
And having it is actually going to incorporate certain mechanisms,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.010
like cashing mechanism to improve the performance,

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.150
thereby it will try its best to keep the database requests at minimal level possible.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.000
Also,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.120
there was some kind off a database connection,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.330
which was all that existing from previous initialization then have been It will try to use

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.410
that connection instead of creating a brand new connection again and again.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:45.280
So aspects like these would help us improve the overall performance off the application and

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.620
have been,

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.670
It allows us to write annotations.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.110
These are basically GP annotations,

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.890
and the advantages associated with annotations are quite obvious.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.300
You can get it off all the XML configuration files.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.650
It's also like your writing court in more natural passion.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.290
Get it off lot off mess by using annotations.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.000
And finally,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.960
one of the greatest strengths off have been eight is that it's ability is that its ability

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.570
to adopt is,

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.850
is that its ability to adopt a new changes introduced in the database.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.170
For example,

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.250
with Jerry BC If you're trying to add a new column in the database,

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.550
then you have to go and change the court in here,

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.410
for instance,

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.350
in here we have toe add another statement to deal with that column,

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.050
and even in the cord,

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.670
that helps in adding an entry into the database.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.450
We have to introduce another statement to deal with that new column.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.410
Oro.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.690
It is we developers who have to take care off those new changes,

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.070
but whereas with happen it happened,

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.510
it will help us get it off all that burden and it is going to do the job for us.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.620
Now we have a host of other benefits off hibernate.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.450
Worse is dealing with the database in traditional approach.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.570
But I'm not going to list them because because you're not yet aware off some of the

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.790
habitants concepts,

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.130
and they would not make a lot of sense.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.780
Well,

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.550
we're going to talk about all those concepts in detail.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.850
Sell state June for that.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.300
And of course,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.340
we can get it off some of these problems with Jerry BC,

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.720
as well by introducing new class files,

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.400
etcetera.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.500
But it would be as good as introducing a brand new framework all on your own.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.890
So that's Ah terrible West off time.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:32.890
Instead,

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:38.780
it would be a wise choice to use a well matured framework like cabinet that is specifically

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.150
tuned to solve your problems.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.780
All right,

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.180
I think this is a good start.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.050
Stay tuned
