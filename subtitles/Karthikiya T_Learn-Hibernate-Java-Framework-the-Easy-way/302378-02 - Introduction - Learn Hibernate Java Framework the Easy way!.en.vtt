00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
welcome to my course on hibernate.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.900
Having it is the most popular open source object,

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.810
relational mapping framework or simply Orem framework that will is,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:16.280
have you interact with the database from your application As a job a developer.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.270
You will feel very comfortable using habit meat because it will enable you to interact with

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.210
the database in object oriented manner than writing static queries like you normally do in

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.450
case off Jerry BC.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:34.640
And there are a host off benefits associated with using harmonic framework compact to using

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.040
Jerry BC Some of them are.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.300
You will be able to use some notions like inheritance,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.200
polymorphism composition,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.620
Java collections,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.450
etcetera.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.090
And then you would be able to map these terms with the relation thereof s tables.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.790
You will understand about it in this course.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.980
Having it offers better performance with the futures like lazy loading,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.600
cashing mechanism,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.070
fetching strategies,

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.090
etcetera.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.660
We're going to talk about all of them in the scores.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.650
Harbin.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.240
It offers better transaction management and with the features like optimistic locking data

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.240
,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.350
consistency is insured.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.390
Have been It is extensible as well,

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.650
and in fact we're going to take a look at how we can use third party libraries to introduce

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.550
some of the features like connection pulling second level cache A etcetera.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.310
And there are a host of other concepts with all cover in this course.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.260
For this course,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.450
I'm assuming that you already know how to write Java programs and run them.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.340
You also need to be ever off some basic terabytes and ask your terminologies along with

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.590
some knowledge on how to use them and Justin gets.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.010
If you don't know any of these,

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.450
then I have an excellent course on the same as well.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.110
You can check it out or drop me a message,

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.810
and then I'll be able to get back.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.270
Typically,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.410
an application would follow the following layered architecture er,

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.290
and this course is primarily focused on how happen it talked to a database from your

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.460
application logic.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.030
If you want to learn about just off the technologies that fall in other layers,

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.850
or if you want to learn how the entire application is built,

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.910
you can check my other courses.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.860
O R.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.970
If you need guidance on where to get started and what to learn,

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.540
you can drop me a message,

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.350
and I'll be happy to respond.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.050
Why take my course,

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.360
I have the unique ability to teach the concepts and simple and easy to understand manner.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.580
You can check the free preview videos off the scores and you can take the call.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.650
No pressure.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.550
I tried my best to keep these videos very focused and to the point,

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.250
because time is very precious and I respect your time.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.720
Here are some of the benefits In taking my course you will gain confidence and stand on

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.350
your own.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.900
If you've been using java for a while,

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.120
then you must know how been made.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.510
There is literally no high in job application that goes without using have been made.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.910
My primary goal is to make you comfortable using have been eight and stand on your own.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.720
If you don't have proper foundation on the technology,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.880
you will simply end up wasting a lot of time and energy in your workspace without making

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.870
any progress.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.050
This course will give you a good foundation on the technology and will make your product to

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.150
now.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.100
Did you ever come across with the colleague who tries to be smart,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.040
as if he knows everything in the world?

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.540
Well,

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.350
you can keep him come by making a meaningful arguments with him on the subject.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.950
Give a lot to be comfortable in giving or taking interviews on the subject.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.650
