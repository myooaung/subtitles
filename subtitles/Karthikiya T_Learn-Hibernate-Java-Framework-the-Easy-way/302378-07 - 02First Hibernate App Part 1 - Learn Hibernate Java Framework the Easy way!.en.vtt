X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.230
hold it.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.850
Let's get started with our first Cabinet example.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.410
And for this purpose,

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.680
as I've already mentioned,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.690
we're going to be using living as a project management tool.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.790
And so I'm going to create the project using the same.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.450
If you don't know maven,

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.840
then just try to imitate exactly what I'm doing.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:24.700
Click on file New and then Maven Project Click Next in my Melvin course.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.250
I've explained everything about all this prompts someone to click next.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.330
I'm currently isn't the default archetype,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.320
which is made an archetype quick start here.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.370
We can give any coordinates off or choice,

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.840
but I would recommend you to give the same coordinates that I'm about to give.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.300
That's because actually have ready made files that I'm going to add into our project.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.410
And these files are actually tuned according to the naming conventions that I follow here.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.070
So in here,

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.940
I'm going to say,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.160
calm dot company,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.790
an artifact that is going to be hetch be hyphen project or project despair.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.170
AJ,

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.310
you can give any name off your choice.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.030
You have to take care off,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.600
making those changes in your palm that XML file.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.390
If you don't want to take that burden,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.380
Just you.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.580
Exact same name,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.500
click finish.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.870
So this is going to take a while.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.130
And while it does,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.060
I'm actually going to walk it through.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.940
List off steps involved to write off first have been eight application.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.260
You can open this file with the name first broke Step start dogs within which I mentioned

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.580
all these steps that will help you write your first cabinet application.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.550
So the first step in it is off course here to have a database set up,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.430
which are the data visitor using you need to have at least one database created in my case

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.430
.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.790
I'm using post area skill and its default database,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.890
which is post Greece.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.890
So let me just log into the bulls,

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.890
graze shell,

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.490
and I'm going to enter all the para meters like the server database port number.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.980
No matter which database you use,

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.830
it must be having some kind off a command crossing tool like this.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.350
And you're supposed to log in and enter your database.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.550
So I'm going to enter the user name and passport for the database with the name pose grease

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.550
,

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.120
which is the default database in Bosnia.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.580
Skill.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.550
So have long been successfully now I can actually go ahead and create a table.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.760
However,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.380
I would like to leave that job toe happen it so I'm not going to manually create a table.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.630
The second step is to create so called a persistent class or sometimes termed as an entity

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.190
class.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.030
This is the class whose instances would get stored in the database by Harbin.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.550
It remember this diagram that we had talked in one of four previous examples.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.080
So here we have a job object with certain values assigned to these fields and having it is

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.640
actually going to take care off storing all these values in its corresponding table in the

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.800
relational database,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.470
this particular object must have bean an instance off the so called a persistent class.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.970
So how do you term a class as a persistent class is when that class follows all these rules

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:22.410
Now,

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.120
these are not hardened fast rules.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.030
You can break these rules if you wish.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.050
If you think it makes sense to do so.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.680
But these are the standard rules off a Poggio are plain old java object,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.240
so it must not have any public fields.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.960
All the fields must be private and all the fields would have,

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.550
public getters are centers,

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.570
and that class would have one default constructor,

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.900
and that particular class should not extend any other class.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.620
That has some fancy methods,

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.540
and that's actually quite obvious.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.450
We want to keep things simple,

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.050
just plain old Java objects,

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.730
and the class must not extend our implement.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:07.160
Any specialized classes are interfaces that has fans and methods with some pansy logic and

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.080
optionally.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.730
That particular class can be see realizable.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.760
It's highly recommended that you make it see realizable because more often in distributed

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.660
applications,

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.980
this frameworks would actually use the mechanism off civilization to convert the objects

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.060
into byte stream,

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.990
store them in memory and then returned back as objects.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.790
It has a very significant role,

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.020
especially in distributed applications,

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.600
and it's highly recommended that you implement see realizable interface for your class.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.550
So let's try to execute this particular step.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.000
I have got everything ready for you.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.750
Go to the list off downloaded files from this course,

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.110
and you must be able to locate this particular fold of the name first hibernate example

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.750
inside which you can look at all these files.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.510
You see this file with the name employed or Java.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.100
This is what our persistent class would be.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:08.470
So let's see for project is ready in our eclipse and Roman it is would expand this and

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.900
inside our source directory under a sourcing main Java.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.730
We have one default class.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.390
We can get it off it if you wish.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:24.430
But what I'm going to do is I'm going to simply drag this last file into this particular

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.950
package and make sure that we don't have any errors.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.190
As you can see,

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.780
this is a Poggio it implemented realizable.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.850
We have one default constructor.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.090
Along with that,

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.840
we also have a parametric constructor which we're going to use to assign values to all

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:51.920
these fields will take a look at it in a while and then we have set off feels that we want

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.910
to correspond them with the relational database table field and then we have the

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.450
corresponding garrison seras.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.300
If you're trying to create this class on your own,

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.230
don't try to write all these ghettos and set us on your own.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.210
It's always better that to generate the court automatically to make it ever free.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.490
So you go to source and he choose this option get us and centers.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.580
Currently,

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.340
all the fields in here have their own garrison centers,

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.630
so I got this prompt.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.240
Otherwise,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.150
you would get to select all the fields for what you want to generate ghettos and centers.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.220
So we got there.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.150
Let's move on with our next step.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:34.500
So the next step is to create so called a Cabinet configuration file,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.810
which would essentially help.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.960
They hibernate to talk with the database.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.100
So this is the file,

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.900
very would provide all the connection para meters so that have a net will know to which

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.450
database do you want hibernate to talk to?

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:53.350
So if you go to the list of downloadable are downloaded files,

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.390
you'll be able to locate this file with the name have been it dot c of Gerard XML.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.750
So let's drag this into the resources folder.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:12.170
So let's create that particular folder under Main.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:19.910
Let's create this folder with the name Resources inside,

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.800
which we're going to put our convict file.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:30.370
Let's drag this down to here and let's see what's inside it.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:35.330
It's a very simple XML file.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.010
With all these tags having it.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:42.430
Conflagration is going to be the ultimate route tag inside which he would specify The

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.460
session factory.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.470
We're going to talk about session factory,

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:46.680
incoming videos,

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.450
and then you have to provide all of these connection battle meters.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.560
If you've worked with database before,

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.190
you probably know what this perimeters are.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:08:00.870
You would provide the driver details depending on the database that you're using.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.990
Since mine is supposedly a secure,

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.050
I'm pointing to the post Gaskill driver,

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.050
and here's a euro to my database.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.350
The connection you are.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:10.550
Oh,

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.550
wherever your database is installed,

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:20.290
this is going to be that I p address and then port in which your database is installed and

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:21.250
in the database.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:26.200
And here we have the that database specific you Zinnemann passport,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.300
basically credentials.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.350
And then we have something new here,

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.100
which is called SQL Dialect.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.280
Remember,

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.250
have mentioned that have been.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:41.310
It takes care of translating the Hatch girl or have been it query language to a database

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:42.800
Pacifica Skill statements.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.220
Well,

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.110
that is possible because off this dialect,

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.940
so depending on the database that you're using,

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:53.250
you have toe provide this particular perimeter accordingly,

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.830
Proposed agrees.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.460
This is what I have to provide,

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.600
but for safe you're using Oracle,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.980
then that's going to change to this,

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.650
and if it is for my ask your then it's going to be this.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:12.710
So just do a quick Google search and then you'll be able to get the have been a dialect

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.410
specific to your database,

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.800
and you just have to mention it over here.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.750
What we have next year is couple off tanks.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.390
This is not really mandatory,

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:28.360
but it's always good to set this to true so that when we see the output on the council,

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.560
we can see the list of SQL statements that were executed by hibernate.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.950
So show SQL Flag would tell,

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:40.900
have a need whether do we want to see the instruction that it is executing in our database

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.100
and former.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:48.930
The skill would instruct hibernate to show those resulting queries in human readable manner

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:53.350
so that quickly that gets displayed will split up into multiple lines,

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.430
and it would be easier for us to read.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:02.370
So what we have here next is But this property were sort of instructing have been it to

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:07.010
update the database according to the changes that are being introduced in our entity.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.100
So when I said this to update,

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:14.120
this is what is actually going to create a table in case of the table is not present in the

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.790
database.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.650
If I don't have this property set,

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:24.440
then we should be creating the table prayer to creating or entities and running our

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.270
application.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:30.610
We're going to talk about this particular field incoming videos because you need to be

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:31.660
aware off certain terms,

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:36.420
like session and Session factory to completely understand various options you can provide

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:36.950
in here.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.710
So we're going to skip it for now.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:39.960
But for the time being,

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.000
this is needed.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.350
Just keep that in mind.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:49.130
Let's continue from next video just for your psychological satisfaction and then we'll
