X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
hold it.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.360
Let's continue with the next step as part of step for what we need to create is so called a

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.660
mapping it similar file.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.540
This is XML file that tells hibernate which persistent class and its fields would map to

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.250
which relation or table and its columns.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.080
Let me just walk it through the XML document and then you'll understand better.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.530
So you have this file employees dotage,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.860
b m dot xml To make sure that whatever the persistent class name that should you hear,

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.750
it has to be same name in here as well.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.520
I'm going to drag this into our projects resources.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.740
All right,

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.100
let me pull it again.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.140
So here we have as part of resources,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.680
let's see what's inside it.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.640
These tags are pretty straightforward to understand.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.280
Actually,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.840
we have this route tag having it mapping inside which you would space for multiple class

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.360
files,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.290
essentially depot systems,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.050
last files.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.180
So you have the stag in here and he would specify the name of the trance along with its

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.050
package.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.750
So this is our post system class,

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.590
if you remember,

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.610
and we're mentioning,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.760
but what table name is the table in the relational database And then we're just mentioning

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:31.550
those two properties deciding in that persistent class in our case there just age and name

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.550
.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:42.350
And here are age and name and the map to the relation database table columns with the name

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.850
an age.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.950
So you provide this attribute column that maps to the relation that the best table.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.340
So essentially,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.280
we're trying to map this particular tribute off entity are persistent class,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.450
but this relation database table call them.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.090
And in here we're providing the data type basically water.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.290
The data time that you provide in here,

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.950
same goes here as well.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.850
And then we have this field,

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.130
which is I D.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.580
Which is also against pacified as bottle Depot system class.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.860
Whether forget about all of these annotations,

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.660
we're going to talk about it pretty soon.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.360
And here is I D and is actually the primary key off the relation that the best table and

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.360
these attributes are pretty straightforward.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.350
Your provide the name,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:41.420
which is I d Whatever is specified over here and then and then the type data type off the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.930
field and it's corresponding column in the table employees and additionally can also

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.850
include this particular tag which is generator.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.770
This is like generating the identified automatically and in here again have multiple

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:58.450
options.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.070
This school of these options are somewhat similar to what you would specify a spot off a

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.730
database SQL query.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.100
If you know about generating sequences in s cure,

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.180
then you can easily understand various other options we can provide in here in my database

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.710
course,

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.590
we talked about all of them.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.690
Creating sequences are to implementing the values,

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.400
etcetera.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.350
So once we're on our application would be able to see what this is going to do.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.620
And specifically,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.940
we're going to check to see what is the skill statement that happen.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.450
It has executed to replicate the same.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.210
Now,

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.640
once you specify this mapping file and tell have been eight,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.880
which persistent glass and it's fields should map to which table and its columns you'd have

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.050
to mention that mapping inside your Cabinet convict XML file,

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.650
just as we did here.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.380
And by the way,

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.910
this particular file doesn't necessarily have to be an XML file.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.850
You can also specify this as a properties file,

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.710
so it would name it as hibernate dot properties.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.900
But make sure that the name is hibernate and nothing else.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.250
And when you're specifying your properties file,

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.550
it's going to look something like this.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.660
You'll get it off all these tags and institute.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.040
Just use these names like Cabinet connection.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.230
Euro equals the Ural similarly,

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:25.840
would provide all the other para meters have dialect except a pretty straightforward Now

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.920
we're pretty much done with our application.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.450
The only thing that we need to do is to write a class file that triggers everything.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.800
And that class file is with the name.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.750
Just don't Java.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:47.550
Let's pull it into our project and to grab this to the source directory.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.250
And in order to understand what's going on in here,

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.650
we need to know something about sessions and Session factory,

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.070
which will talk in next radio.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.080
But before that,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.490
let's try to fix these errors.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.390
Can you guess why these errors are coming?

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.650
I'll give you two seconds.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:13.710
That's because we haven't done anything to use have been it libraries.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.510
And as I've already mentioned,

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.000
Maven will make our job a lot easier.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.740
But despondent XML file went open.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:30.550
This and the company that goes inside the Palm the XML file is going to be this.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.830
So let's copy all the country from here,

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.150
and this is the reason why I had mentioned you better said the same corners that I had said

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.220
so that he won't get any crashes.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.220
So here we have those exact coordinates.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.620
I'm going to copy this from the Lexx,

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.790
Mo.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.250
File and pissed it in here.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:06:00.450
So what am I doing primarily here is have included all the dependence is that are required

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.930
for our Cabinet application to run.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.420
Do they can note that these libraries not only wearing truth,

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.950
having it libraries,

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:14.110
but also a few other related libraries,

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.650
And it's very hard?

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.300
Or I would say it's impossible or pretty time consuming to do all this on your own.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.130
It's very tedious job to search and Internet and download those jar files and then point to

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.420
that class file's directory,

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.050
etcetera.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.650
It's a big mess,

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.840
so Megan comes in very handy,

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.280
and it's a great tool.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.910
And in addition to that,

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:36.840
by default,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:43.220
the default compiler plug in that comes along with maven would use Java 1.5 portion.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:49.270
So when it explicitly said this para meters to use the job awash in that you are using.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.950
So whichever the Dow abortion that you have installed.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.750
You can specify that version number in here,

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.550
so make sure that you change this.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.400
And if you haven't provided the same corners that I had provided do make sure that you

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.350
change them over here.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:11.550
Let me say this file and make sure that we don't have those errors anymore.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.130
So let me just quickly upgrade the project.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.450
I gotta maven update project,

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.550
and this is certainly going to take a while.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.490
So let me this positivity and then get back.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.500
All right,

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.190
Here we are now.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.050
There are no errors whatsoever.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.980
So we'll talk about what's happening in here,

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.380
you know?

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.170
Next video.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.910
See you soon.
