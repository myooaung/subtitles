00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.100
In my interview,

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.310
you have mentioned that one of the advantages with have been it is that it supports

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.850
standard GP annotations and by using annotations you can actually get it off this mapping

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.750
file that tries to map depot system class with the relational database table,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.850
and we'll see how it's done.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.810
In fact,

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.330
I already have the cord ready.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.500
I just have to uncommitted.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.250
So inside my persistent class,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.900
I'm going to UN command this tree lines.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.520
And if you notice we have another here,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.900
we have support for these annotations from couple of packages.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.230
One is from the Java expert assistance,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.550
and the other is from the hibernate.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.490
So which one should I use?

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.550
Can you make a guess?

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.780
Obviously,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.210
it's going to be job expert assistance.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.470
That's because let me do control shift oh,

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.280
to import the class files.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.930
So that's because has evolved,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.710
we mentioned.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.370
These are standard JP annotations as well,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.270
so two more at later point of time.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.560
If you'd like to switch to a different or M tool that also supports GP annotations,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.650
then it's easier for you to switch.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.980
If you use have been,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.730
it's best if it can irritations the new Mafia certain challenges while trying for all

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.460
tornadoes.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.040
So here we have annotations,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.750
and these are pretty much self explanatory.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.000
In this a mapping file.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.340
We have the class tag.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.070
So in here we have had great entity tag.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.850
Now,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.880
if you're used to enterprise Java beans,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.990
this is the entity bean,

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.660
and by default,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.970
the table that's going to correspond to this entity.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.980
Bean is going to be with the name employees unless you explicitly specified with another

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.650
annotation at the table.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.560
We won't explore.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.440
Rest off the annotations involved incoming videos,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.170
for sure,

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.650
but I would like to keep this video very simple.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.750
So we also have a couple of fields along with the identify air.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.310
So we do have the idea field,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.800
and along with that,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.810
I've used this couple of annotations.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.940
One is to mention that this field is the identify air,

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.750
which will be the primary key.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.050
And just as we specified a generator here we do have the generator here as well,

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.840
and whatever the options that you can provide in here can go in here as well.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.150
Regiment similar,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.670
and you don't have toe explicitly mention annotations in here to tell hibernate that these

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.070
are also the fields in the database having that can figure it out automatically and would

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.680
create columns accordingly.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.150
So now guess what?

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.690
By introducing all these annotations,

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.350
I can literally get it off this file altogether.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.110
It's not mandatory that you need to delete this file.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.800
We can use both if needed.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.260
But I see no point in using XML document,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.290
and I'm not sure if I would ever use an example document for mapping.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.860
We're going to be using annotations and are examples,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.420
unless I feel there's a real need to talk about some of the tags involved in decimal

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.090
document.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.990
So for now,

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.450
I'm going to get rid off this.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.950
So let's dilated.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.650
And as a next step,

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.360
if you remember in our convict file,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.250
we have this set and this pointing to the mapping XML fire.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:39.920
So I went to get it off this let me just come in this out and interact with this.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.800
So I had the same dag mapping.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.020
But this time,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.070
instead of saying a resource like an example,

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.660
document or properties file,

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.880
I said it's going to be a class file,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:58.020
and I would point to the persistent last and in it to provide the complete package.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.100
And I'm going to copy this and use the same,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.900
you know,

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.450
test our job as well.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.910
But this time I'm not going to add a resource.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.330
Guess what I'm going to add.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.560
A class had annotated fast is what I'm going to use inside,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.790
which had mentioned that class file and then dark class as simple as that.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.660
Now,

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.050
before I run the program,

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.110
let me show you that I have deleted the table beforehand,

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.550
so there's no table off employees.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.370
Now.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.510
Let me run this program and we'll see it.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.470
Get well,

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.770
say,

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:42.720
taking effect.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.790
And sure enough,

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:50.410
these two queries were executed and same thing got reflected in database as well.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.880
So annotations are pretty in to do to program us to code because right when you're defining

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.740
your fields,

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.850
a programmer can also take care off how they're going to be present in database as well.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:10.020
So it's like more natural and into the way to write a program and also get it off all the

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.640
all the mess with the maximal documents.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.500
So that's one of the advantages also,

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.290
moreover,

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.610
we have lot off tools that would help generate this entity classes from an existing

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:23.420
database.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.100
So in case if you're not using having it before,

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.910
but you already have a database,

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.330
then it can still start with have been it.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:36.400
And you can use these tools to generate this entity classes from the database like you do

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.890
the reverse engineering and ah,

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.250
you can and you can get your we're going.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.600
We're going to actually see an example of the same as well in future videos.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.100
But one does that want age,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.110
though with sanitation is that if there's any change that you introduce in the mapping XML

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.790
document,

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.760
then you don't have to rebuild the entire application.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.650
But if you have any changes that needs to be incorporated as part off annotations,

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.400
then you have to rebuild the application because we need the dark.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.650
Last file with those annotations reflected not really a big concern,

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.510
and I think annotations is definitely a better alternator.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.400
But maybe if you're using earlier Russians off hibernate and you were already using these

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.570
XML documents,

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.490
it may be a little bit off in afford to switch to annotations.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.270
It may not be as smooth,

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.830
but still it's possible,

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.880
and there are tools out there to help you out with the same.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.030
So with this,

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.680
I think we have a fair understanding off Harbin aid.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.780
I think this is a good start as well and we have a lot of exciting concepts.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:41.940
Incoming videos,

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.080
so stadium.
