00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,010
All right guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:07,110
So in the last couple of lectures we went through the 
basics of Snapchat, who uses the platform, what are
2

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,490
all the terms you need to know, how to 
create an account, and where everything is.
3

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,500
Well, in this lecture, we'll discuss how to start 
taking snaps and how to promote yourself.
4

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,180
You'll discover there's plenty 
you can do to spread the word.
5

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,480
So snaps are the currency of 
the land here in snappy chat land.
6

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,630
No blog posts or words need to apply.
7

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,160
Pictures and videos are the only thing that really works.
8

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,710
So you as a brand or a business need to think of ways 
that you can use the visual format to communicate
9

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,120
and make some connections.
10

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,550
Like I've said before, this doesn't apply to everybody.
11

12
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,170
Some of you, it's going be harder to do visuals, 
but I generally think it's worth trying
12

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,560
for most people. Now, taking a snap is simple enough,
you just go to the camera mode and then click the big circle.
13

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,490
You've probably taken thousands of photos in your 
life, so you pretty much know how that works.
14

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,810
If you want to send a video through the camera mode, 
it's a little bit different, you hold down the button
15

16
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,420
and then you see like a loading screen.
16

17
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,430
Now, you might ask, isn't this for my business?
17

18
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,500
Isn't this supposed to be professional?
18

19
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,760
Maybe I should get a professional camera crew, or lighting 
setup, or something like that, where I start sending snaps.
19

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,630
Maybe I should get a professional camera crew, or lighting 
setup, or something like that, where I start sending snaps.
20

21
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,030
Forget that, this is Snapchat. Just hold up your camera 
and snap the picture, because everyone else, from
21

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,010
the Kardashian people to the guy down the street,
22

23
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,750
they're pretty much doing the same thing.
23

24
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,360
It's all about spontaneity, and if you aren't spontaneous, 
then it kind of kills the vibe. Just like Snapchat
24

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,930
users embrace the idea that the picture is going to be gone 
within either, you know, 10 seconds or 24 hours if it's a story,
25

26
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,940
users embrace the idea that the picture is going to be gone 
within either, you know, 10 seconds or 24 hours if it's a story,
26

27
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,950
they also know that everyone else is working with the same 
toolset and the same structure, the same limitations
27

28
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,090
work for everybody.
28

29
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,070
Now, honestly, anybody making their pictures look too 
good on Snapchat are going to actually look suspicious,
29

30
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,040
like they've got something to sell, 
so that's something you want to avoid.
30

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,510
So that's how you take a snap, but to make an impression 
with followers, that's just going to depend on what you snap.
31

32
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,860
So that's how you take a snap, but to make an impression 
with followers, that's just going to depend on what you snap.
32

33
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,570
And this is where you can make 
a difference. Here on Snapchat,
33

34
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,070
you won't be writing blog posts or articles, obviously, and 
you won't be posting long form e-books or producing videos.
34

35
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,550
you won't be writing blog posts or articles, obviously, and 
you won't be posting long form e-books or producing videos.
35

36
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,490
Any of that content marketing stuff 
is not really going to work.
36

37
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,570
So what exactly are we supposed to create here anyway?
37

38
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,170
This is the question that befuddles many marketers 
and it's the reason why Snapchat is still an emerging
38

39
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,240
market. And I will warn you upfront, it is difficult.
39

40
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:13,800
It's very counter-intuitive,
40

41
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,040
It's very counter-intuitive,
41

42
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,220
and they didn't really make their platform 
to make this easy on marketers.
42

43
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,380
But anyway, to answer that 
question, what should you create,
43

44
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,060
you need to look at what's being done. Now, let's jump back
into Snapchat and look and see what other brands are doing.
44

45
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,860
you need to look at what's being done. Now, let's jump back
into Snapchat and look and see what other brands are doing.
45

46
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,210
Go to the camera mode and click on Search up at the top.
46

47
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,480
You should bring up a bunch of top stories, but also 
a bunch of categories on the bottom. One of these
47

48
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,630
might relate to what you might do.
48

49
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,540
You've got "Around me" to see local Snapchatters, 
then you also have music, sports, fashion, bars, 
49

50
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,200
nightclubs, food, all kinds of stuff.
50

51
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,770
Scroll the category you like,
51

52
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,180
pick one that looks interesting, and then
52

53
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,460
tap it. Some of the snaps and videos you see might be exactly 
the kind of thing you might do, and others just might suck.
53

54
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,270
tap it. Some of the snaps and videos you see might be exactly 
the kind of thing you might do, and others just might suck.
54

55
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,130
In fact, most will probably suck, 
but it's just a numbers game.
55

56
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,090
We're catching moments in time here for many people,
and they're not posed, they're not Photoshopped, and
56

57
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,520
they're not engineered.
57

58
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,960
Now, some snaps will have text and emojis, some won't.
58

59
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,310
My advice for you is just browse a bunch of these 
Snapchatters, you'll see the kind of stuff that gets shared.
59

60
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,000
My advice for you is just browse a bunch of these 
Snapchatters, you'll see the kind of stuff that gets shared.
60

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,270
What do you like and what might 
you want to try for yourself?
61

62
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,270
This is pretty much where you go for inspiration.
62

63
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,820
Now, asking yourself these questions might help as well.
63

64
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,630
What is my brand personality like?
64

65
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,010
If you could describe it, would it be,
65

66
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:26,690
If you could describe it, would it be,
66

67
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,040
I don't know, fun, playful, casual, serious, conservative?
67

68
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,300
Are you a rebel, are you a know-it-all?
68

69
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:39,870
Some mix of the above? And what Snapchat filters or 
lenses would you use to then show off that personality?
69

70
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,440
Chances are, if you're trying to be professional and 
serious, you're not going to be using the lens that
70

71
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,120
changes your face into a panda.
71

72
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,270
Also ask yourself "What would my followers 
or customers like to see from my brand?"
72

73
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,760
Obviously, keeping it within the scope of Snapchat. 
Is my target market the type of people that anxiously
73

74
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,780
awaits our next product or post?
74

75
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,250
Are they people that require constant care?
75

76
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,280
So they ask a lot of questions, or 
they're not particularly on the ball at all.
76

77
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,370
What can I show them that will excite them, intrigue them, 
amuse them, or inform them? Would they care about
77

78
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,930
how our product is made?
78

79
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,640
Would they care what our office looks like?
79

80
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,000
Do they care who the people behind the products are?
80

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,450
What can I show them here that I 
can't show them anywhere else?
81

82
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,050
Do they really want to see selfies from our CEO?
82

83
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,030
Would they care about some of the things our team 
does outside of work or charities we support?
83

84
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:31,710
So remember, you can answer any of these questions 
with individual snaps, videos, or you can combine multiple
84

85
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,660
ones into Snapchat stories.
85

86
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,990
Pick some sort of topic and start snapping.
86

87
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,080
Let's look at an example, and this one is called Feet 
Socks and it's a sock company that uses channels like
87

88
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,270
Snapchat along with Instagram and YouTube to post,
well, all kinds of different photos and videos.
88

89
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,130
But each channel is going to be different for them. 
Shots from their professional photo shoots usually end
89

90
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:56,340
up on Instagram, but more random fun stuff, like special 
promotions or even weird skits, or outtakes, or
90

91
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,030
behind the scenes, those generally go on Snapchat.
91

92
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,350
behind the scenes, those generally go on Snapchat.
92

93
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:03,410
Now, one kind of snap that comes up a lot for brands
is that behind the scenes pictures I was talking about.
93

94
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,050
More than any other channel,
94

95
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,550
Snapchat really feels like the best place to share these 
hidden moments just before or after events, during
95

96
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,870
the production process, when you're making your product, 
or to catch up with people involved with your brand.
96

97
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,590
the production process, when you're making your product, 
or to catch up with people involved with your brand.
97

98
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,810
Show some of these moments that don't require you 
to write an entire blog post or produce something
98

99
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,820
super fancy. Just take a snap and post it.
99

100
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,260
super fancy. Just take a snap and post it.
100

101
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,050
Related to this,
101

102
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:29,360
you could also offer sneak peeks of new products, upcoming 
events, or promotions you plan on running in the future.
102

103
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,080
you could also offer sneak peeks of new products, upcoming 
events, or promotions you plan on running in the future.
103

104
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,070
Let's look at another example.
104

105
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,370
Taco Bell, for instance, has done this a lot.
105

106
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,220
They'll create stories that are specifically about a 
new product that's coming out and then tease out
106

107
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,780
details to its followers.
107

108
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,240
Watch out, here comes the 
Quadruple Chalupa Queso whatever.
108

109
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:42,730
And yes, hey, you know, that works for them.
109

110
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,590
And yes, hey, you know, that works for them.
110

111
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,940
Taco Bell is a bit of a cultural icon 
amongst people who like to get high.
111

112
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,110
But if you want to do something really unique and 
exclusive to Snapchat, you could create what's called a
112

113
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,470
branded geofilter.
113

114
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,960
Now, branded filters are just like the regular filters 
on Snapchat, except they're created by brands to
114

115
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,280
promote themselves and whatever else. 
But a geofilter is tied to a location.
115

116
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,140
You have to be in a specific area, sometimes even 
at a specific time, for the filter to become available.
116

117
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:14,480
For example, Starbucks created a branded geofilter
to promote their happy hour Frappuccino.
117

118
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,880
Snapchat users could take selfies with themselves 
with this exclusive filter, and by sharing it, it would
118

119
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,660
help them essentially promote their 
happy hour event and special pricing.
119

120
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:28,340
You obviously don't have to be a giant brand to do 
this, but if you're someone who runs a meetup and
120

121
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,860
it's related to something, your business or 
your product, you could do this if you wanted to.
121

122
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,630
And speaking of pricing, business 
geofilters are actually pretty cheap,
122

123
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,390
it's something like $5 per 20,000 square feet.
123

124
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,070
So if you have a physical store or an
event where you might be appearing,
124

125
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,890
it's actually a tactic worth considering.
125

126
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,780
I did see one person do this once 
when they were giving a talk.
126

127
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,250
They created a geofilter for the space of the talk 
and then during the talk told people to do it. Now,
127

128
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,520
something else you might want to post is a shoutout.
128

129
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,100
Now, a shoutout is basically letting your followers 
know about another Snapchatter out there that's
129

130
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,080
worth following, in the hopes that that account 
will then give you a shoutout back.
130

131
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,930
For example, if there's a writer on Snapchat that covers 
your industry and you developed an app they
131

132
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,100
might like, it'd be great if their followers 
would follow you as well, right?
132

133
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:19,220
So you could snap a screenshot of their most recent 
snap or story and then add text to it, like "Follow
133

134
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,760
this person on Snapchat" or "This person makes great stuff."
134

135
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,100
Now, in fact, this is so common that a lot of Snapchatters
will actually work out a trade in advance or they call it
135

136
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,260
a shoutout for a shoutout type promotion.
136

137
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:36,340
You just essentially ask the other Snapchatter to
give you one in exchange for one of your own.
137

138
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,540
You can actually do this through 
the direct messaging feature.
138

139
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,170
Now, if the followers of both accounts are interested 
in this, well, then it makes sense and it could
139

140
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,090
be a win-win and help you promote your stuff.
140

141
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:49,230
Now, speaking of promotion, Snapchat shouldn't be 
your only channel, so don't treat it like your only child.
141

142
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,760
Cross-promote some of your Snapchat stuff on other 
platforms. For example, create a story on Snapchat,
142

143
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,930
then download that story, post it on Facebook, 
and then promote your presence on Snapchat.
143

144
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,580
You've got to make sure you recycle this stuff.
144

145
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,830
Post your Snapcode to your website along
in the other social media links and icons.
145

146
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,740
If you need your Snapcode,
146

147
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,230
go to your profile on Snapchat and click the 
little Share icon under the Snapcode. It'll let
147

148
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,610
you download the image, so you 
can put it wherever you want.
148

149
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,270
Now, if you have an email list,
and you might not yet at this point,
149

150
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,660
or maybe it's small,
150

151
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,150
you can put together a short announcement about your new 
account, and that's generally a nice excuse to contact people.
151

152
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:23,530
you can put together a short announcement about your new 
account, and that's generally a nice excuse to contact people.
152

153
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:29,140
Then you just write an email that's like, "Hey, some of you 
guys have been asking if we're on Snapchat," and maybe 
153

154
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,590
they've been asking you this, maybe they haven't,
154

155
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,940
doesn't really matter.
155

156
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,360
And then what you can say is,
156

157
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:38,630
you know, "The answer is now yes, we do have one," and 
then you can put your Snapcode image and then just make
157

158
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:43,430
it easy for them to snap it and then encourage other 
people on your list to download the app and follow
158

159
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:48,710
you as well. Plus, you can add what you'll be using the 
account for, posting behind the scenes pics, sharing
159

160
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,580
discount codes is a great one,
160

161
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,940
say that like, "If you follow us on Snapchat, we share X 
amount of discount codes a day, or per week, or whatever."
161

162
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,440
Give people a reason to care.
162

163
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,910
So sharing your Snapchat info across multiple channels can 
drive people to your account and get you some followers.
163

164
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,070
So sharing your Snapchat info across multiple channels can 
drive people to your account and get you some followers.
164

165
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,610
Now, it's obviously not necessarily new followers,
but followers that follow you on multiple channels are
165

166
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,550
just in general more engaged,
more likely to buy your stuff.
166

167
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,660
Now, coming up in the next couple of lectures, I'm going 
to share some ways to promote yourself on Snapchat
167

168
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,980
and expand your audience so that it's not just limited 
to the people that came from your other
168

169
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,180
channels or your direct contact list.
169

170
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,300
All right guys, see you then.
