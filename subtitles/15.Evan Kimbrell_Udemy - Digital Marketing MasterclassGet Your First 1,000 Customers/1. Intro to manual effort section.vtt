00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.870
Hey, hey, hey, we're ready to get started getting customers.
1

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.640
I hope you guys are excited, because right
now I'm going to smash that excitement with
2

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.420
some sad, sad news. In this upcoming section,
3

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.480
yes, we are going to go after potential customers
and get our first couple sales, but everything in this
4

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.340
section is manual effort.
5

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.510
You heard in the previous lectures we talked about
the graph of effort and customers, we're focusing on
6

7
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.650
the first section, which is low effort, low reward, but
that effort comes from you, because we want to save
7

8
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.840
resources until we are 100% sure we know exactly
what we're doing and what we're offering.
8

9
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.610
So, yes, these techniques are not going to be glamorous,
and these techniques are not going to get you
9

10
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.330
1,000 customers, let alone 100,
10

11
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.500
but what they will get you is your first set of customers.
11

12
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.910
Now, sometimes getting over that initial hump of
getting your first customer is all you need to actually
12

13
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.830
feel validated and motivated that you,
yes, can start this business and grow it.
13

14
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.390
Trust me, the first time that you see that order button
get clicked and an order placed, or the first
14

15
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.890
time you get an invoice for your first sale,
15

16
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.410
that is a huge moment, and is one of the
best things about being a business owner.
16

17
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.000
Conversely, one of the most discouraging things that
can happen to an entrepreneur is spending hundreds
17

18
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.040
of hours building a product, pouring your effort and
your life and your soul into some product that then
18

19
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.680
just flounders and doesn't get a sale
for an extended period of time.
19

20
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.940
It happens to a lot of people out there.
20

21
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.220
It's incredibly discouraging, and it makes
you feel like you're just wasting your time.
21

22
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.320
So that's what we're going to do in this section, we're
going to specifically target getting you over that hump.
22

23
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.420
It's a big block, and that's why we're going to use
some tried and true manual efforts to get over that,
23

24
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.590
so you can feel like, yes, you can do it. Now, you won't
be a multi-millionaire at the end of this section,
24

25
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.180
and if you were already a multi-millionaire
because you were rich beforehand, call me,
25

26
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.170
and if you were already a multi-millionaire
because you were rich beforehand, call me,
26

27
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.970
but what we will do is establish that your product is real
and is needed, and most importantly, don't forget this,
27

28
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.050
but what we will do is establish that your product is real
and is needed, and most importantly, don't forget this,
28

29
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.780
we will finally establish a feedback
loop with real live customers.
29

30
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.310
This is the feedback we're going to gather and
incorporate into our business so that we can go to the
30

31
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.760
next stages with ease.
31

32
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.950
Let me tell you right now, if you do not start working
with real customers, getting real feedback,
32

33
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:44.910
you run the risk of completely blowing out and failing
at the higher effort, higher reward strategies.
33

34
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.910
You cannot just jump right into a content strategy,
for instance, without first getting some real customers,
34

35
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.750
figuring out who they are exactly, what they like,
what they respond to, what your product benefits are,
35

36
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.670
and what are its weaknesses, and you need to get that
from real customers, not just yourself and your friends.
36

37
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.210
and what are its weaknesses, and you need to get that
from real customers, not just yourself and your friends.
37

38
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.130
All right, get excited,
38

39
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.530
but don't get too excited, because we are going to get
some sales, but it's going to be in a quick and dirty fashion
39

40
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.410
but don't get too excited, because we are going to get
some sales, but it's going to be in a quick and dirty fashion
40

41
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.850
that is not at all glamorous.
41

42
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.330
All right.
42

43
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.180
See you in the next lecture.
