00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.800
All right guys we are back then.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.000
Thank you for being here.

3
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.170
So far in the SCA section of of course we've talked about how Google works and the importance of keyword

4
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:07.780
research.

5
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.580
The more you understand these topics the better prepared you'll be to create pages that rank well on

6
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.960
the ESA R P's.

7
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.440
Remember those are the search engine result pages or you just Serps.

8
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.760
Well Google's algorithm takes a lot of things into consideration when it ranks pages.

9
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.470
Now these things are called ranking factors and they relate to the quality clarity and usability of

10
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.130
your page.

11
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.530
Most of these ranking factors are things on or inside your page like the words you typed out or the

12
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.040
code in each meal tax you use to build the page.

13
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.330
So I want to talk about those factors in this lecture.

14
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.750
They're also known as the on page MCO factors and how you can improve those for your own Web site.

15
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.620
The first few things I want to mention are the things that actually appear on the search engine result

16
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.270
page.

17
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.770
Let's do a quick search and you'll see what I mean.

18
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.420
For example let's search for how to install a sprinkler system for people who own homes and businesses

19
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.350
with grassy areas.

20
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.030
If you decided you wanted to to put in a sprinkler system by yourself you might search for something

21
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.760
like this.

22
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.400
So look at the page results.

23
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.080
It lists each result has a title.

24
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.990
That's the big link.

25
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.140
You click to get the page you want.

26
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.480
It's gonna have the U.R.L. the actual address of that page and that's a description which is sometimes

27
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.430
a custom written description of your page.

28
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.300
Or it might be an excerpt from the page a small section that might have a search term right in there.

29
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.190
Of the three things you see there while the most prominent is going to be the title.

30
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.910
And that's one of the major ranking search factors of a page the words you use in the title greatly

31
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.310
affect the terms that page ranks for.

32
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.050
Where exactly does this title come from.

33
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.450
Well it's actually just inside the H.G. mail code that makes up your page.

34
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.900
Now there's a section near the top of your HDL pages it's your index page called the header and in the

35
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.030
header is a tag called title.

36
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.630
Go figure.

37
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.460
Now if you don't hand code page to email and not many people do these days you may be publishing pages

38
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.380
and WordPress or some other content management system so you'll set the title for your page in a field

39
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.230
called perhaps title know near the top of your editing screen and WordPress.

40
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.420
It's just in the settings the HMO code is important to see though.

41
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.140
Let me show you.

42
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.940
I'm going to click on this Rainbird Sprinkler system installation guide search result and then I'm going

43
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.500
to view the source code of that page that comes up.

44
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.230
Now the source code is all the HD him all that makes up the page.

45
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.340
Now here in the source you can see this tag near the top.

46
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.450
Now the way you guys look for source it just depends here on Firefox or Chrome chrome you just literally

47
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.060
right click go to view source.

48
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.290
So that code defines the title of the page whatever is in that tag appears at the top of the browser

49
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.940
tab and it's what people see on the server when this page comes up.

50
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.260
But most importantly this particular example of a title is extremely clear.

51
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.170
What's this page about the Rainbird company has published an installation guide for a sprinkler system.

52
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.240
It's pretty obvious right.

53
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.310
And you'd expect the contents of the page going to match that title.

54
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.370
So this example of a title tag is a good example to follow.

55
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.510
So when defining your own title tags you want to make sure you do a few things right.

56
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.760
Number one make your title very clear.

57
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.950
Just like our Rainbird example the average person should be able to read your title and understand immediately

58
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.480
what they'll find on the page.

59
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.480
They'll be reading that title on the Serb.

60
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.140
Most likely.

61
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.160
So make sure it's obvious that your page is all about and obviously helps that if your title is related

62
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.000
to the search term you're going for google will give you a bump for that usually the case that that

63
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.160
was a big bump.

64
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.960
Now it's kind of kind of goes without saying.

65
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.480
More importantly though now is the match between the title and the page because if someone's read the

66
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.910
title and it doesn't accurately represent what's on the page they'll click through and they'll bounce.

67
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.240
Why does that matter to Google.

68
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.700
Well guess what Google actually tracks that Google pays attention to how long Google say on your page.

69
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.690
So if people keep going to this page and leaving immediately the probably figured out they shouldn't

70
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.100
be ranking for this this search term and that is the number two tip is just make sure it's accurate

71
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.590
in fact as someone described it on the page or show them the page first and then describe the title

72
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.300
and see what they say.

73
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.830
Does it make sense is it obvious or does it make them stop and think for a second try not to make the

74
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.050
page sound better than it actually is as well.

75
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.610
Do you put best irrigation system ever or even you know free money click here.

76
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.130
Well those might sound enticing but they wouldn't exactly be accurate to make it clear 100 percent accurate.

77
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.310
And that might mean being brutally honest with yourself.

78
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.840
Number three is make your title unique.

79
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.950
The title page tells us what the page is about.

80
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.240
What's the main subject of it.

81
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.300
If you make the title of every page on your site the same thing.

82
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.510
Well Google will think you're trying to make every page rank for the same topic and they might actually

83
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.620
penalize your page for that or drop it from its rankings entirely.

84
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.690
Every page is different even if every page on your site is about the same sprinkler system in some way.

85
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.290
There has to be some difference between them right sprinkler system installation sprinkler system repair

86
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.450
sprinkler system estimate sprinkler system parts.

87
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.860
These are all unique enough that differences are clear.

88
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.440
So make every title unique for each page you create make your title concise and keep it under 60 characters

89
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.800
a lot of these suggestions are best practices.

90
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.020
So the limit on the length might seem strict in comparison.

91
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.120
Well it's for a good reason when you view it as the Sharpie on a mobile device which is where most searches

92
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.920
are being done these days actually.

93
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.390
Google can usually show the first 60 characters or so of the title before it has to put it in an ellipsis.

94
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.980
You know the dot dot dots at the end.

95
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.780
Honestly you should be able to sum up the main idea of every page you create in less than 60 characters

96
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.090
with the exception of blog titles which I know can sometimes be longer for creative purposes but in

97
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.240
those cases just make sure that the first 60 characters gets the point across.

98
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.950
In general if they don't it's going to not perform as well on mobile she means guess what Google is

99
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.000
going to rank lower.

100
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.780
So the best practice is 60 characters or less.

101
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:29.380
If you can do it.

102
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:35.390
Keep in mind the title's not only show up on ACR piece but also when a page gets shared on social media

103
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.170
Facebook and Twitter don't show much more than that 60 character count in their apps anyway.

104
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.370
So make sure people can see the entire title and try your best to keep it least coherent on their 60

105
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.940
characters.

106
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.780
Okay so that's the title tag but what about those two things you see on the SRP the U.R.L. and the description.

107
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:53.690
Well you are Alice.

108
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.980
Well the URL whatever the page is you are all gets automatically displayed.

109
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.270
There's nothing for you really to do there although I do have some thoughts and site structure that

110
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.660
could make your your URLs look more attractive to people.

111
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.800
Well actually discuss those in a later lecture.

112
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.790
Now what is Google like.

113
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:14.570
Well Google likes to see the title of the you are well matched to the keyword but also to the title

114
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.360
of the page.

115
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.240
Again just looking for accuracy if the title of the page is how to make the best sandwich in the world

116
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.140
but the you are all a slug as your Web site dot com slash.

117
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.510
How to create some Manet's.

118
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.510
Well then OK.

119
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.220
You obviously have a mismatch and that will get penalized.

120
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.940
It's also generally worth saying that when you pick the name of your you are l try not to change it

121
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.800
too often because Google also looks at how long it's been up.

122
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.950
So if you keep changing it well it's not going to rank for something for very long.

123
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.150
Now the description is the last part and it's something you can control.

124
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.130
The description is a field in the header code just like the title and it looks like this.

125
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.380
Okay.

126
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.400
Now the interesting thing is that this field is not a ranking factor for SC ho.

127
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.730
Believe it or not it has absolutely zero bearing on the ranking.

128
00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.510
So many people ignore it.

129
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.380
It's actually an optional field.

130
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.800
It used to be the case that people would just stuff tons of keywords in it.

131
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.910
So if you looked at their keywords it would be like a like a crappy Craigslist ad or just have hundreds

132
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.320
of different words stuck together in it in no coherent order.

133
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.330
However of course when I say it's not a ranking factor it's not a direct ranking factor.

134
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.130
Indirectly if you have a good description that means more people click it and more people clicking it

135
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.450
and then being satisfied will rank higher.

136
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.950
So it's only indirect for a non ranking feel it's kind of interesting.

137
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.140
Google would make it visible and search results at all if they didn't directly care about it.

138
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.860
While it's obviously worth taking advantage of I probably shouldn't say this but the point of SGI is

139
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.890
not just to get ranked really really high.

140
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.160
Google can only do so much for you even if you're the number one search result but your description

141
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:43.910
is terrible.

142
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.550
Your title is terrible and you somehow manage to do it.

143
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.030
That just means you're not going to as many people so do actually put some effort into optimizing this

144
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:50.580
as well.

145
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.670
Should you use the description.

146
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.620
Yeah absolutely you absolutely should.

147
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.090
If at the bare minimum you'll use description other people won't.

148
00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.560
And I'll make your link stick out.

149
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.330
Generally speaking one sentence is all you need.

150
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:03.910
If you want you can do two.

151
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.720
All right so this is a good start or discussion of.

152
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.160
On page FCO factors.

153
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.050
Let's take a break here.

154
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.810
Most guys more in the next lecture.

155
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.250
Right guys.

156
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:10.670
See you then.
