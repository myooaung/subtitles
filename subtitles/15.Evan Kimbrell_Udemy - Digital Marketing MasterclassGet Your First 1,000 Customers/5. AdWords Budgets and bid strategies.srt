1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,760
All right here we are back again talking about adverts in our last lecture.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,310
We went through the first steps of setting up a campaign.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,410
But now we're at the point where we need to consider the money.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,230
How much do we want to set for a budget and what kind of good strategy do we want to use.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,740
One of the first things to do is figure out how much you can afford to spend on advertising to begin

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,330
with PPC again pay per click with say 100 times you'll be paying every time someone clicks your AD.

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,450
So let's take this scenario and just do a little math.

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,210
Let's say you want to do an ad to increase sales of a product.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,720
So let's say it's the I don't know the smart scooter with Wi-Fi that's built into the tracks how far

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,530
you scoot every day somewhat cool every time you sell your smart scooter.

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,620
Let's just say you make 20 bucks in profit.

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,470
Yes I know you probably make more on the smart scooter but don't whatever you have a page set up on

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,450
your site where you sell the smart scooter.

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,910
And according to your stats the conversion rate on the page is let's say 2 percent like two out of every

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,460
hundred people who come to the website end up buying it.

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,350
So with that in mind ask yourself how much would you be willing to pay Google to make a sale.

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,780
Do you make $20 with each sale of a smart scooter.

18
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,570
Are you cool giving Google let's say four dollars or where you go say a 20 percent cut.

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,130
How about $6 or 30 percent cut.

20
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,350
The more you're willing to give Google the more you can afford to pay per click.

21
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,970
If you do some basic math you can figure out the amount to spend on adverts at least for cases where

22
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,970
you're trying to drive direct sales multipole your profit per sale by your conversion rate.

23
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,630
Then by the percentage you're willing to give Google not to say the percentage want to get Google but

24
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,620
really it's like how much can you possibly spare to make this worth it.

25
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,190
You know your costs right.

26
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,690
You know it's time and effort went into doing this.

27
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,080
So now in our case let's just do that formula.

28
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,610
That's Tony Ahlers times 2 percent or point O2 going to do a multiplication.

29
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:52,460
Then you multiply that by let's say the 30 percent cut that we're find getting to Google.

30
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:58,650
So that is Times point 3 Tony box Times point 0 2 times Point 3 is 12 cents.

31
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,570
So in this case you be willing to spend 12 cents per click to increase sales of your smart Skooter now

32
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,520
might not sound like a lot but when you think of the number of clicks you might need to generate a sale

33
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,920
on the page you're 2 percent conversion rate.

34
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,770
In this case it can add up if you don't set a limit.

35
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,090
Now that's where your budget comes in.

36
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,830
And since you did this math already you can figure out a place to start.

37
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,880
So let's say you're willing to spend 12 cents per click and you want to try this out for say two weeks

38
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,150
or 14 days.

39
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:32,700
Well if you got say 25 clicks a day it would add up or multiply up 35 clicks a day times 14 all at 350

40
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,540
clicks in total.

41
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,870
Now multiply 350 total clicks times your 12 cents per click and you just got a total campaign budget

42
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,420
that's about $42.

43
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,240
Not bad I guess.

44
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,790
Now how many sales would you get with those 350 total clicks Well multiply those clicks by your conversion

45
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,210
rate of 2 percent and all the answers about 7 7 sales.

46
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:56,040
So with all your numbers hold true especially your conversion rate and keep in mind guys it constantly

47
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,240
fluctuates and it changes.

48
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,650
This is something you might not even know right now.

49
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:05,640
Then by the end of two weeks you'll have to spend $42 or less to hopefully generate seven sales of your

50
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,380
smart scooter.

51
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,610
Now seven sales while you make 20 bucks each.

52
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,680
That's a total profit of $140 than minus $42 so you owe Google.

53
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,330
So basically it's like like a hundred dollars in profit.

54
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,000
Now the important part here is that you need to have the information to guide your budgeting.

55
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,130
If you know things like how much you make per sale and the conversion rate on the page where you'll

56
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,440
be sending people well then you can very easily put yourself in a position where you could budget your

57
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,060
advertising pretty effectively.

58
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,940
Now of course this is never it's never that simple.

59
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,230
Now you might have a conversion rate they established before that conversion rate might be based off

60
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,920
as zero or on our Facebook.

61
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,360
Now it's not the case that it's always this straightforward.

62
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,530
In fact it's usually got other layers of complications with it.

63
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,590
So let's say you thought your conversion was 2 percent.

64
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:59,170
Well what does that actually based off of a you could be 2 percent of SEO traffic converts.

65
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,900
Well as the traffic is going to be different than your at the Emerald sites like Facebook or shares

66
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:10,410
or something like that you kind of have to use it as a guide but then immediately adjust and say Actually

67
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:16,170
my ads are converting at this percentage now it could be higher because people are knowingly clicking

68
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,310
something because they know they want to buy something or it can be lower because people just don't

69
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,350
trust ads as much.

70
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,480
Now might be a good time to review your own numbers and plug them into that equation that we had before.

71
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,940
How much profit per sale times your conversion rate on your page.

72
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,550
Your best guess at your conversion rate times how much you're willing to give away to Google to make

73
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,330
this worth it.

74
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,950
So now I know we've covered some of the math to help you prep for this bidding adventure.

75
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,610
Let's jump back over to Google Adwords and that first screen where we were setting up our campaign.

76
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,390
We're looking at good strategy now if you click it you'll see two categories.

77
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,660
Automated bid strategies and manual with manual and you decide exactly how much your bid will be and

78
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,220
set your budget per day.

79
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,970
The automated bid strategies allow Google to change your bid pending on what kind of goal you're trying

80
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:06,970
to achieve target search page location means you want to get to the top of the search ranking page specifically

81
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,570
target CPA will place bids to try to get you the most conversions possible.

82
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:18,570
You actually pay per the conversion not per click but the cost per conversion will be higher.

83
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,300
We probably won't actually cover that in this course because it requires a lot more.

84
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,900
You have to really set this one up and again if you knew how many people would come to your page and

85
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,260
how many would convert then why wouldn't you just just do it based off of clicks.

86
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,320
So why don't you just say I'll pay this much for a click.

87
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,460
Now there's also oftens recreating ads simply to outrank ads from another domain.

88
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,630
They want to battle a competitor for the Arpey turf.

89
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:43,600
Go for it.

90
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:48,280
Then of course there are often you simply maximize clicks and maximize conversions.

91
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,590
All of this depends on what you're trying to accomplish.

92
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:55,450
Keep in mind some of these are budget conscious like you just say don't ever go over this budget and

93
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,270
then some of them are just going to focus on getting you the most traffic.

94
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:03,290
So if you just knew that you are a wide range you could pay well then maybe you go for that.

95
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,340
And that would give you a lot more growth sooner.

96
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,680
Now in our case we're trying to increase sales of our smart scooter so we could go to the manual strategy

97
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,510
route or try an automated option like the maximize conversions for example.

98
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:22,230
Now if you already have conversion tracking set up on your site well you could try this out conversion

99
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,350
tracking is actually some you set up and Google Analytics and it communicates directly with Google AdWords.

100
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,240
It's the same company and same system.

101
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,480
Now let's just assume are really new at all of this and just go with that manual option.

102
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,190
So all we have to do is tell it our default bid and our budget per day.

103
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,820
Remember how we talked about running a campaign for 14 days and maybe spending let's say $42 in total.

104
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,640
Well $42 divided by 14 days is you do the math about $3 a day.

105
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,280
So we could use that $3 as our daily budget and $3.

106
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,330
I don't obviously suggest it's not really enough to make this work but OK go for it.

107
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,390
Now you can go higher if you want to see how it goes.

108
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,260
It's all up to you.

109
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,270
I think I'm personally going to go higher because why not are smart Skooter is worth it.

110
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,520
Let's see $5 a day.

111
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,640
But our default bit.

112
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,260
Let's start with 50 cents.

113
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,490
Now it's more than 12 cents.

114
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,020
We you know figured out before but for the purpose of our example let's just start with a round number

115
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,840
and let's just see how it does.

116
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,960
So we've done this whole example with the assumption that we're selling a product and doing advertising

117
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,920
to increase sales.

118
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,230
Your goal and specifics will be different.

119
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,910
You might want to drive traffic to a page to get e-mail newsletter registration through a form not a

120
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,690
sale but a different kind of conversion.

121
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,160
But e-mails obviously don't generate money like a sale.

122
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,370
So how much is that going to be worth it to you.

123
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,800
In most cases what people do is you run it to a page you sign up for an e-mail newsletter and then they

124
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,160
give you a drip of e-mails over a long period of time and they know how many people who sign up.

125
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,980
Eventually we'll buy on that process and that's usually going to be higher than people who go on your

126
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,090
page and clicking buy.

127
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,490
So how much would a 100 sign ups be worth.

128
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:57,040
Well you'd have to run this test beforehand to know that number then obviously how many clicks would

129
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,540
it take to get those 100 sign ups.

130
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,350
This is why it takes a little bit of time to get the OEM machine running smoothly.

131
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:08,140
Now if you don't know things like conversion rate or dollar amounts well it'll make it tougher to figure

132
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,340
out your budget for ads.

133
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,590
So then what's the number you're willing to spend to try to see if this works at all and to get your

134
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,520
baseline numbers.

135
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,270
If all else fails pick a total dollar amount you're just comfortable with in general.

136
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,170
And then just go with that.

137
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,860
So the last piece on this page is the ad extensions part.

138
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:27,370
This part is interesting because it deals with some extra Google features you can have a peer with your

139
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,070
and if they apply to you.

140
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,300
Number one if you have a physical location you can check off the location box and Google will display

141
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,490
an address and phone number for your store.

142
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,490
Pretty nice if you expect people to look for someone like you while they're out shopping.

143
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,840
Number two if you have specific pages on your site that would help a customer better understand your

144
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,730
product or service.

145
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:51,700
Well you can check off the site links box filings or those extra links Google sometimes ads below your

146
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,620
link on the search engine page that leads to important sections or pages of your site.

147
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,410
Now it's up to you.

148
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,930
You can add something that makes sense for you.

149
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:05,620
For example if you were searching for let's say a server power system well you'd see IBM ad listed at

150
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,720
the top with site links below it.

151
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,430
That's a site link and then lastly number three if you have a phone number you want to include with

152
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,990
your ad click the call box and will that at it.

153
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,210
If you're comfortable taking phone calls and doing direct sales well then it might be the case that

154
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,520
you can up your conversion rate significantly.

155
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,560
So once you reach this point well you set your bid strategy you've set your daily budget your bid amount

156
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,560
if it was necessary and you checked all the other options.

157
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:35,200
Now once you flip all the switches on this page the next one will be all about creating your ad groups.

158
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,420
And for that info sadly you'll have to tune into our next lecture.

159
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,100
