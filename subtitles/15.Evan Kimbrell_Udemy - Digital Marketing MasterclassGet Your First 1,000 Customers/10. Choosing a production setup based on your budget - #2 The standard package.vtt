WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.600
All right.

2
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.360
Now let's move up to the standard package and this is like if we wanted to we could spend between 500

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.110
and 1000.

4
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.410
OK.

5
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.660
And this is really like the base level that I would suggest doing I would only do the ultra cheap version

6
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.590
if you absolutely had no money.

7
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:22.770
I guess in this scenario a standard what I would suggest doing is one going to go at the consumer level

8
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.390
camera.

9
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.510
And I would go at the point and shoot.

10
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.290
OK.

11
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.440
There is a camera I can't it's called the Panasonic Lumix point and shoot and it actually looks like

12
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.640
a DSL archosaurs a handle and it's heavier but it has a lot of similar features and it's only like $270

13
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.140
right now.

14
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.440
So you get the FCC 80 which if you wanted to shoot for k can do that.

15
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.830
That's $400.

16
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.720
The absolute cheapest one is to 50.

17
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.500
And that's the F.C. 70.

18
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.010
And that's the thing to shoot a.p.

19
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.200
If you're on a budget don't go for four K like four cases automatically going to add a thousand dollars

20
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.400
or so to your budget.

21
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.710
It's just not worth doing if you're this low.

22
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.640
I mean it year you really really want for cable then you're really really going to have to spend more

23
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.770
money and that's the case well maybe you rent your stuff.

24
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.300
Maybe you're really good about planning when you do it and then you only spend a couple hundred dollars

25
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.370
renting everything for a couple of days.

26
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.920
Now back to the whole standard package.

27
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.050
OK so said he had that one at like $250 there's also some pretty good camcorders out there.

28
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.190
Another one is the Panasonic h c v 7 7 0 HD.

29
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.480
It's a camcorder that was about like $450 $500 you can find in a Web site called be an age photo dot

30
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.910
com.

31
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.870
That's another option.

32
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.740
You know it's not $250 but it's a little bit more and it's give you a lot of functional you need and

33
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.640
this is great if you're only focusing on video because it's not going to take photographs for you.

34
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.550
And again I'm speaking with Panasonic because I just like Panasonic.

35
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.920
They're just cheaper in general because people don't think the brand super fancy.

36
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.130
They don't make these like ridiculously high end cameras.

37
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.320
They focus on making better kind of cheap versions.

38
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.180
All right so then for the Lumix have probably the Panasonic Lumix.

39
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.300
FC 70 is what I probably suggest using or a mere illis point and shoot that you can find.

40
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.760
You can get one of those like Canon power shots for $200 Nikon Coolpix is in there $200.

41
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.490
And again with these ones we're going to focus on as an MP rating.

42
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.230
You know look for megapixels.

43
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.530
I personally suggest don't shoot don't shoot below 16 anything above that's going to be great.

44
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.210
I think it's kind of the bare minimum for a tripod.

45
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.120
You can just get what's called names on base a basic tripod.

46
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.650
It's literally like $4000.

47
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.750
I mean this just Super-Duper Chib is going to break immediately but whatever for lighting Now what I

48
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.360
would suggest doing is again on Amazon.

49
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.210
We have the most studio Sarbox box panels and thank God for this but there's a lot of people who want

50
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.020
entry level video equipment.

51
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.010
And so a lot of these Chinese brands have just started pumping out the absolute cheapest thing they

52
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.810
can possibly make in most scenarios if just you for instance you only need two lights if you're doing

53
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.730
flat lighting or talked about before.

54
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.120
So you only need two lights plus soft boxes so they have a lot of deals on there.

55
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.400
You can get two of them plus the light stands for like 75 bucks and didn't get one for 40.

56
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.170
So really easy to use.

57
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.370
They're super cheap and they suck to set up.

58
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.050
But if you're on a budget that's what you can go with the longest I'm actually shot with these right.

59
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.890
They're really big.

60
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.870
And what you do is you have this cheap plastic holder and then you install these bulbs into them and

61
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.090
they have the same Lima studio bulbs they're talking to before you screw them in.

62
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.940
And then you have to take these rods stick in.

63
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.100
And then you put this reflector Mattila around it and a soft box on the top.

64
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.930
It does create decently well lit light.

65
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.720
You can't modulate how bright it is because it's just going to be a light bulb.

66
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.490
But again you're on a budget.

67
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.200
So if you want it to be darker move it farther away.

68
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.500
That's pretty much.

69
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.460
You want it to be brighter than move the box closer to what you're trying to shoot.

70
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.230
They also have like big kits like three point kits and those you know these like $170.

71
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.620
But now there are like 100 bucks so I would check those out.

72
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.110
There's a 100 in one copy cat Chinese brands.

73
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.140
Just read the reviews.

74
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.080
I mean they're all an equal level of bad but they'll get the job done.

75
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.300
Another option I can throw out there is doing what's called a Chinese lantern or a Chinese lantern is

76
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.650
there just paper lanterns that open up and their big orbs.

77
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.960
One really cheap way of getting soft diffused light is actually just hang those up and put a bulb inside

78
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.210
of that because of the paper and the fact that it shoots it everywhere it actually does create pretty

79
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.730
good light.

80
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.260
It's hard to aim at something.

81
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.200
But these things like it's like four bucks for one of these things.

82
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.170
And then it's just the light bulb that you put in it.

83
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.760
So is also really easy to do on a budget.

84
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.250
Now for your recorder I would suggest go to a little bit more.

85
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.450
You could probably go with like a lot earlier for this so you can get there's a task candy bar 10.

86
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.630
Well it's actually just Wireless-N or chord's.

87
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:57.830
Everything right there.

88
00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.230
And that's only 200 bucks.

89
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.430
I think that's decent There are of course cheaper Blob's out there you can get a law for 20 bucks you

90
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.600
can get what's called a giant squid law which are really popular.

91
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.750
They're only 50 bucks.

92
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.040
But the problem is where are you going to record it to.

93
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.990
So that's something to keep in mind.

94
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.980
It has to go to a quarter and then over a quarter it is going to be at least $200.

95
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.190
Then other things you might need.

96
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.860
You know you can easily buy some seamless paper for your background.

97
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.290
I would suggest going to savage paper.

98
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.970
Usually they give me free shipping if you buy a large enough roll.

99
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.120
You also get them off amazon again if you have Prime.

100
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.460
Those are costs probably 50 bucks if you can do it with a smaller role.

101
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.950
Do you need a wider role there usually like $75 something like that passed out.

102
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.890
You'll just need a lot of random stuff like memory cards.

103
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:51.750
Gaffer's tape probably you'll get light stands with the limo studio packages but really anything else

104
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.760
you can possibly think of.

105
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.940
If you guys want to go with a shotgun instead zone up your budget a little bit.

106
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.650
But one thing I would say is don't go with a super cheap shotgun.

107
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.030
There's like $50 ones out there and they're absolute garbage.

108
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.820
I mean they literally will have a built in humming noise and they'll drive you nuts.

109
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.220
Now you can do the one that I use and this is actually I bought this.

110
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.290
Well the first thing I ever bought and I've used it for two and a half years.

111
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.310
I love the audio quality and it's cheap.

112
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.790
It's I got to see this one off.

113
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:29.810
So it's Audio Technica Audio Technica which is a popular brand for audio equipment.

114
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:37.330
It's the 88 7 5 r and it's kind of like a snub nose and it is what they call it for a shotgun.

115
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.340
It's really short.

116
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.000
That one works really really well.

117
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.590
And if you pair that it's only about $160.

118
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.190
Used to be like 200 something now it's only 160 to pair that with the $25.

119
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.540
Boom stand.

120
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:55.770
Plus you know there's these attachments you can put on your boom stand that allow you to absorb vibrations

121
00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.880
so that you know if it's damp or something like that or something moves it doesn't pick it up.

122
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.100
And the actual Boom Shaka I guess that's the basic package.

123
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.670
I think that gives you a pretty good range of things you can use.

124
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.690
You know the most expensive thing is going to be the audio so you can either get a shot gun for like

125
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.500
170 like the one I suggest but then it's obviously you have to go to a quarter or quarter is a minimum

126
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.180
of 200 to 300.

127
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.870
But there is a camera Lumix the fact 70 I think it was called.

128
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:28.920
And that one's only about $250 cannot shoot for AK but at this point you shouldn't be shooting for for

129
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.630
AK anyway lights.

130
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.480
I would go with the lamest studio ones you can find on Amazon.

131
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:38.100
Seventy five bucks for two comes with a soft box and I believe it comes with the light bulbs.

132
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.380
They don't come with light bulbs and it might be 125 something like that.

133
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:46.120
Then you can just get a cheap $14 camera stand and that is pretty much it.

134
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.820
Then you have to buy some accessories like memory cards and probably some things like tape and whatnot

135
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:51.960
but that's about it.

136
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.860
Also in this range you can actually start doing a little bit of like soundproofing and all you need

137
00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:01.740
for soundproofing are all blankets or moving blankets and moving blankets might spend fifty bucks and

138
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.140
send you like 12 of them.

139
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.170
You only need three or four.

140
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.720
And then if you combine that with duct tape while you can just duct tape them everywhere you need them

141
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.080
when you're recording huge pain.

142
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.800
When you have to set up and take down.

143
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.490
But again we're trying to save money.

144
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:19.200
This is a pretty good set up and you can do a lot with it.

145
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.360
I mean you pretty much have everything you need.

146
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.560
It's a great starter package and you'll start learning very very quickly.

147
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.000
Cons of this obviously are going to be like durability things going to break a lot more.

148
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:33.480
And just in general yeah you're going to struggle with some harder scenes to shoot.
