00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.940
Everyone welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.220
So up until this point the content strategy lectures have covered a lot of the houses involved setting

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.760
things up and choosing your weapons so to speak.

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.110
We talked about how to define your audience how to rely on common content types and topics and get ramped

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.340
up more quickly.

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.240
How to figure out what to write and how to do all this with clear goals in mind.

7
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.580
Well in the next group of lectures starting right now in fact I want to walk you through some tactics

8
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.820
for creating content that builds on all of the strategies we've covered so far.

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.580
We're going to cover five different content formats that get used pretty often across the interweb.

10
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.990
The idea here is that yes it's great that we know the types and topics but now what's an actual strategy

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.950
I could use.

12
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.640
And how do I do it correctly.

13
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.880
So without further ado let's go over our first tactic which we call the canonical long form post.

14
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.850
Now what is that exactly.

15
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.940
Yes I know before we talked about the ultimate guide type of content and well that actually fits under

16
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.730
this umbrella.

17
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.890
So a long form post as it's referred to in the content marketing universe is technically any post that's

18
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.890
twenty five hundred words or more and that 2500 number.

19
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.010
Well it's kind of just an artificial limit that some people I guess put on themselves when they write

20
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.930
blog posts.

21
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.090
Some people of course limit themselves to two thousand words.

22
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.040
Other people might say 3000.

23
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.680
I kind of splitting the difference here.

24
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.580
But for some reason this is the range people consider for a long form.

25
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.380
The point is that most post people write for the purposes of content marketing or filling the Blagg

26
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.760
are way less than that number.

27
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.750
Hey less than twenty five hundred words.

28
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.390
It's rarely the case you see an article that breaks a seven hundred.

29
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.140
So why do content writers do that specifically you might ask.

30
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.270
Never write anything longer than a page or so.

31
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.620
Well there are probably three good reasons for that.

32
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.620
For one it's just easier writing last takes less time less effort number two.

33
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.870
Writing shorter pieces means you can publish more of them.

34
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.710
For some reason some places feel compelled to deliver a high number of content pieces every week or

35
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.690
every day.

36
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.050
And so shorter content allows people to write more.

37
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.460
It's kind of a loophole but you have to remember that a lot of these places writing blogs every single

38
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.540
day get paid by the page view or by display advertisement advertisements.

39
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.220
So if you send someone three short articles that's three different page views versus a one long which

40
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.980
is usually just going end up being one page view.

41
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.760
I know it's goofy.

42
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.070
And the third reason people write shorter stuff is because writers think readers want shorter pieces

43
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.780
you know keep telling you this all the time.

44
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.390
We have limited attention spans.

45
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.120
Mobile devices of smaller screens the smaller screens make it a lot harder to read etc. etc..

46
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.670
Now these reasons aren't necessarily wrong but what they do is cause writers and marketers and other

47
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.790
people who want to create content to shy away from those longer more authoritative pieces pieces that

48
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.070
deliver more value and frankly just last a lot longer.

49
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.950
And if you heard me say the word canonical earlier that's exactly what that means.

50
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.800
Canonical authoritative or basically like the final word.

51
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.390
If you create a piece that's the final word on a topic or issue that's a significant accomplishment

52
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.080
if you follow through on it of course.

53
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.000
My point here is that you shouldn't ignore the long form content options these pieces longer than twenty

54
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.190
five hundred words.

55
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.380
And in fact I've mentioned them already.

56
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.950
You might remember me actually talking about those ultimate guides awhile back in how some places use

57
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.550
them to generate a lot of views or downloads or other important metrics.

58
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.220
Well you can bet that when they discussed creating an Ultimate Guide nobody at buffer or nobody had

59
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.670
MailChimp or any other places that create these guides all the time said sounds great guys but let's

60
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.690
just keep it under 3000 words and they don't want to give that people too much value.

61
00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.290
You can tell I'm a little biased towards long form if you didn't catch that by looking at the length

62
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.910
of this course.

63
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.330
OK.

64
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.420
You got it long for us.

65
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.090
Twenty five hundred words or above why that number.

66
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.270
Only God knows.

67
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.680
Why don't more people do it.

68
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.070
Well because there's a plague going around that causes companies to think that they need to publish

69
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.850
quantity not quality.

70
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.990
Well guess what.

71
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:21.900
Longer form content is significantly more valuable than those shorter posts and they're not just great

72
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.530
value for your readers but you as well.

73
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.070
Let's go over some of the reasons why long form content works and hopefully that will give you a better

74
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:36.630
understanding of kind of the relative value of longer pieces compared to other ones out there floating

75
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.140
in the space of the Internet.

76
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.950
And since we're talking about long form we're going to cover eight whole reasons because that's epic

77
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:44.740
and long.

78
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.360
So number one is that longer form pieces have better search rankings.

79
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.910
When you look at Google and you search for how to do something you'll notice that there is a general

80
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.250
trend the results that are at the top of the list are generally going to be longer because Google just

81
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.920
assumes longer pieces of information that are there for the person searching it's more likely to be

82
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.580
satisfied.

83
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.940
So Google is pretty biased towards long form stuff.

84
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.460
Second reason is that they didn't General generate more social.

85
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.910
Data shows that post longer than 2000 words rank higher than shorter ones.

86
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.500
And while many people are creating shorter pieces of content more data shows that longer content just

87
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.500
gets shared a lot more probably because people are more proud of it or more willing to show it off.

88
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.120
This means that an opportunity exists if you're willing to create those longer form pieces.

89
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.720
So that's two reasons you rank higher and people are more likely to share it.

90
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:36.820
But here's number three.

91
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.300
It's more convenient for the reader with a long form piece that covers a lot more material the reader

92
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.590
won't have to go to different sources to get all the information or content they need.

93
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.430
All of that value is included in one place so that increases the value of the canonical piece you made.

94
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.390
The fourth reason is well what other benefits can you expect from long form pieces.

95
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.220
Well people will spend more time on your site.

96
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.190
This is generally an important metric.

97
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.060
Keeping people on your site longer it means they'll look for more value you might have.

98
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.810
Now of course there's a little bit different than the newspaper sites or the buzz feeds where they get

99
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.900
paid by banner ads or display ads where they just want people to click around.

100
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.950
But with longer form content means they stay on it longer if they're more likely to go to other pages.

101
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.470
The fifth reason is that long form pieces result in better reputation and authority for you.

102
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.730
You go through all of this effort to create a bigger better piece of content.

103
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.140
It's not going to go unnoticed beyond the actual ranking sharers and other numbers people will begin

104
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:39.830
to view you more of an authority especially if you bring something new to the space that you're jumping

105
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.270
into.

106
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:46.550
Reason Number six is another nice benefit of long form content is that it's got long term value longer

107
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.520
pieces will get more views long after short post have gone out of date.

108
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.970
They've got more staying power so it's great to have content do more work for you in the future rather

109
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.390
than less in the future.

110
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:04.840
And the reason why it lasts longer has to do with the fact that you wrote a 10 page piece on something.

111
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.100
It's going to be a while before someone decides to make an 11 page piece on it and supersedes you and

112
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.350
your rankings there in general just more timeless.

113
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.070
The seventh reason is that it's easier to collect data along forum post.

114
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:22.160
Some sites offer up e-books or ultimate guides and PTF and to get to that they require e-mail address

115
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.410
for you to download.

116
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:29.840
Getting your content like this is much easier to do with a big definitive guide as opposed to just baiting

117
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:35.780
someone with a 500 word blog post than saying oh you got to trade your email for it is rarely worth

118
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.860
it for the user.

119
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.240
The long form piece of content there's more perceived value and that generally just means people are

120
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.890
more willing to give up something in exchange for it.

121
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:50.870
A number a the last freeze in the last benefit using long form content of long form posts are usually

122
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.040
easier to promote.

123
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.220
You can grab all kinds of content from a big post to help you promote it.

124
00:07:55.220 --> 00:08:01.160
This means that you can take excerpts quotes or images in just sentences and then use them in social

125
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:08.660
media posts images videos you can promote individual sections you can spin them off into their own like

126
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.560
miniature pose.

127
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.810
There's a lot you can do with it.

128
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.410
That's obviously hard to do with a short five hundred word post.

129
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.380
There's just not as much meat on the bone.

130
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.260
Now all of these villains should sound good to you but I know creating long form content is easier said

131
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.160
than done.

132
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.440
So how actually do you do it.

133
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.040
Well in the next lecture I'll walk you through some of the choices you need to make and most important

134
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.350
will be deciding on your topic.

135
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.660
If you're ready to see how to put together a long form piece and I'll see you in the next lecture.

136
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:35.900
Otherwise skip it.
