00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.090
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.540
So in the last lecture I mentioned that most of the reasons for creating content can be grouped into

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.780
three big categories and branding and engagement.

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.930
And we had conversions.

5
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.960
So in this lecture let's focus on branding goals and see how content can help you reach them.

6
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.670
Now first of all what exactly is a brand anyway.

7
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.400
Isn't a brand just something that big corporations have.

8
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.390
Well yes and no.

9
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.180
Pretty much any business regardless of size has its own brand and a brand is not just your name and

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.630
a logo or your tagline it relates to what you say and what you do your actions shape people's perceptions

11
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.980
and attitudes about you along with their expectations.

12
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.150
So yeah your brand gets affected by all of those external things as well.

13
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.970
What people think of you is part of the deal.

14
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.480
This is why content is so connected to goals related to branding.

15
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.150
Think about how often you'll be creating and publishing content.

16
00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.420
It's a lot more than how often you'll be rolling out a new product or even a product update.

17
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.710
All those tweets all those posts all those shares add up over time.

18
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.500
A lot of your father's experiences with you online will come in the form of content.

19
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.200
So what you create can help shape their impression of you.

20
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.770
In fact creating a good first impression is important for some of the most common branding goals like

21
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.980
establishing trust and connecting with people.

22
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.420
In other words building your following.

23
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.580
So how can you create a positive first impression through content planning.

24
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.430
The key to this is writing with the right voice.

25
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.830
When people first see our Web site or visit your social media page on Facebook or whatever they should

26
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.330
quickly get an idea of what you care about what topics you write about what kind of headlines you use.

27
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.320
What sort of language do you use.

28
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.470
What boys you use could be casual or it could be formal.

29
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.400
It could be helpful and supportive like a friend or more authoritative like an expert.

30
00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.750
The voice you use when you write should connect to what you want to be seen as do you want to be everyone's

31
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.060
friend or do you want to be seen as the industry expert.

32
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.630
Now the answer is up to you but whatever direction you choose should basically echo throughout everything

33
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.260
you write.

34
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.420
For example if you sound like an expert with your formal voice on your blog then you shouldn't all of

35
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.600
a sudden sound like a quirky teenager on Twitter.

36
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.510
You need to be consistent with your voice.

37
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.810
Whatever voice you do go with it also helps to write in a human kind of way.

38
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.220
What I mean here is that there are real people behind every brand.

39
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.050
Customers are more likely to trust you and want to follow you if you show some kind of human emotion

40
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.360
throughout your content.

41
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.060
Motions aren't just happy or sad or angry.

42
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.320
A really powerful emotion is empathy which is the ability to understand and share the feelings of other

43
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.630
people and you understand your customers.

44
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.310
You'll be able to create better more relevant content that really speaks to their needs.

45
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.840
You'll know when one idea for a checklist for example is more needed than another.

46
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.440
If you can empathize with their followers you'll know how they might respond.

47
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.140
When something big happens in their industry and then you can write something to sympathize with them.

48
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.950
Celebrate with them or address certain fears they might have.

49
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.580
Maybe you're thinking right about now.

50
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.210
OK writing with the right voice and writing in a human way all sounds fine but what does what you're

51
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.340
actually write about.

52
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.600
I'm trying to write specifically for brand a great topic to help you strengthen your brand is generally

53
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.200
going to be something like writing about why you're here.

54
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.450
We've mentioned before company stories before as a way to explain company origin stories.

55
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.730
A lot of times these stories can touch upon family connections causes you believe in and situations

56
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.680
your customers can relate to especially if you were once in their shoes and decided to make a solution

57
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.240
to a common problem.

58
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.330
Scratch your own itch.

59
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.790
In fact if you haven't yet written your origin story do this.

60
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.360
Open up a Google doc or ER doc or whatever and start typing in it.

61
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.030
Answer these questions.

62
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.700
Why did you create your business or product.

63
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.790
Who helped you get started.

64
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.750
Who are you hoping to help.

65
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.240
What will success look like to you.

66
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.750
The first three questions might be easy because it's all you've thought about Probably but the last

67
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.880
one gets more to your mission.

68
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.280
Sure we all want to make money keep the business going and so on but in the end how will you know when

69
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.380
you've really made it.

70
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.990
What does real success actually mean to you.

71
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.100
The answers you come up with could be the focus of many of the pieces you create who you're trying to

72
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.350
help as your audience so you should write your content with them in mind while you started your business

73
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.510
or created your product speaks to the problems you're trying to solve and success gets to what you believe

74
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.940
in.

75
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.940
Whether you want to dominate the industry or give all your profits to orphanages or simply help one

76
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.840
person each day how do you measure success should ultimately drive what you do.

77
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.470
So once you figure out all of these things about yourself how can you communicate them through content.

78
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.630
Well number one if you wanted to focus on brand perhaps you should focus on interviews.

79
00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.230
Interviews can give you opportunities to answer questions about yourself like the ones we discussed

80
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.520
yes you can actually interview yourself it's actually not that weird it's pretty common.

81
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.240
You can give your CEO or your founder some questions answer over email and then turn it into a Q&amp;A blog

82
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.010
post or record a quick video and edit it in a fun way.

83
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.180
If that obviously suits your brand personality either way it can help humanize your company because

84
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.050
it shows that there are real people with real feelings behind the business.

85
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.620
If you want to make the interview even more relevant Here's a tip.

86
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.230
Put it into context with current events or a product release.

87
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.980
For example view an app and Apple just released a big iOS update.

88
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:42.950
Maybe you'd interview your lead app developer and then ask them about updates when your customers can

89
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.620
expect them and then talk about any new features.

90
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.600
It's an easy way to tie into something relevant for your customers and it shows that staying up to date

91
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.070
is important to your brand.

92
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.390
The second way you can focus on branding is to communicate through videos.

93
00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.290
Now videos can be fun ways to give followers a peek behind the curtain.

94
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.170
Who is the CEO and what are they like.

95
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:09.080
Let them talk about themselves or have someone interview him or her as just as you can get your friend

96
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.040
to interview you.

97
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.110
How does this company get stuff done.

98
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.810
What tools do they use or what partners do they work with is a company for example Zendesk Well they

99
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.860
created a video about their company a few years back and it's still great.

100
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.560
I mean it's definitely quirky but it manages to show you a ton of different aspects of the company like

101
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.520
their people their office what they care about.

102
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.490
Is a good example for showing that the production value of your video role will reflect your standards.

103
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.640
If you're more informal maybe you can get away with video shot off your laptop.

104
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.190
But many companies would probably opt for higher production values.

105
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.350
Don't worry we'll actually cover video marketing in more detail real soon.

106
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.800
I'll send it as the next section.

107
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.570
Now the third thing you can do are case studies case studies can be powerful ways to prove your worth

108
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.910
by showing evidence of your success.

109
00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.590
They can also get into detail about who your customers are and what kind of solution you represent.

110
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.850
Are you just a temporary stopgap or a long term partner.

111
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.690
You'll have to make that clear for your audience.

112
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:11.210
Let me share a quick example with you of a piece of content that was definitely created to focus exclusively

113
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.230
on branding.

114
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.630
OK in the summer of 2016 buffer was forced to make layoffs.

115
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.220
OK buffer is that online app that helps you schedule your social media post for you.

116
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:28.190
Very popular they're well known for like being 100 percent remote and having quirky company values whatever.

117
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.900
So buffer was laying people off.

118
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.450
But instead of remaining silent or spinning the event they posted about it in their blog.

119
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:40.480
And in fact the post read like a case study going into deep detail and running a level of transparency

120
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.060
most companies would not dare to show.

121
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:49.340
Now why exactly would they share all of these details about an objectively bad thing that's happening

122
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.090
to the company.

123
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:54.770
Well it's because part of buffer's brand is about believing in transparency.

124
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.510
They've written about it and demonstrated it many times.

125
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:02.330
So even though the Post covered a sad event for the company the post stayed true to their spirit of

126
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:03.410
transparency.

127
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.730
Now just a quick word of warning when you write about yourself Just remember your goals.

128
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.700
If you're writing to improve brand awareness and reputation.

129
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:15.050
Don't write posts that basically calls for people to buy your stuff.

130
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:20.720
There will always be opportunities to sell but as part of your content strategy content created for

131
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.820
branding purposes should stay focused on making connections not making money.

132
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:32.360
So those are some of the ways to write in support of brand goals and a few examples of how others have

133
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.080
done it.

134
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.580
Next up we're going to discuss how to create content that supports engagement.

135
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.720
What does that mean.

136
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.000
Well you're going have to find out by watching the next lecture.

137
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:42.440
See the.
