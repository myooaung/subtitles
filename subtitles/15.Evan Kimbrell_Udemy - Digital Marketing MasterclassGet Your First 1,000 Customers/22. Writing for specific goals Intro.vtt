Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.740
So as you've seen from the last group of lectures there are many different ways you can create content

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.540
for your business.

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.360
Digging for ideas might take some time but you can come up with ideas lists stories all kinds of ways

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.740
to educate share and inform.

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.530
But before we move forward I want to hit you with something that needs to stick with you throughout

7
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.820
your content creation process.

8
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:31.440
Any time you have one of those great ideas about content like an awesome top 10 list idea or an ultimate

9
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.650
guide to doing whatever you can totally crush dude.

10
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.150
Just remember that whatever you make should be created for a specific reason.

11
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.030
If you're not trying to support a product or a business and you're just blogging for fun then yeah sure

12
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.010
try out articles and write whatever you feel like because it's totally up to you.

13
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.250
Marvin what do you make of this.

14
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.790
I don't even have a be.

15
00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.120
We've got to have an opinion but when you make a content strategy as part of a larger growth strategy

16
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.280
for an actual business you put it together to support your goals and the business behind it specifically.

17
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.440
So if all content should be created for a reason.

18
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.410
What kind of reasons are we talking about.

19
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.570
Most of the reasons why we write content is going to be grouped into three big ones.

20
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.950
Number one is branding.

21
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.050
Number two is engagement and word three is conversions.

22
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.110
But the first reason is branding and branding goals include building awareness like when you're first

23
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.760
starting out.

24
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.200
We're launching a new product with new content you can build awareness and your audience branding goals

25
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.530
can also include things like improving your reputation like establishing yourself as an expert which

26
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.190
you can definitely do if you create a lot of great articles and posts on a topic you know well.

27
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.130
You can also focus on engagement goals which was the second type which means generating some kind of

28
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.220
reaction with the content you create.

29
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.830
Now engagement can mean like sickman shares in comments.

30
00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.710
I mean a lot of other things those reactions are meaningful because content that generates them engagement

31
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.540
can build buzz about you and your business.

32
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.010
That's where the marketing really starts growing and multiplying.

33
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.770
Encouragement is great too because it can help you increase your exposure without relying on paid marketing

34
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.530
channels.

35
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.910
And the last group of goals are conversion goals.

36
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.160
Now conversions happen when a reader or web site visit or performs some kind of action like making a

37
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.770
purchase setting up for an email list or something that can be measured since conversions usually involve

38
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.040
money you can bet a lot of people focus on these goals and content absolutely helps them with it as

39
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.610
well.

40
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.280
We'll talk each kind of goal in more detail coming up in the next set of lectures so stay tuned.

41
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.770
See that.
