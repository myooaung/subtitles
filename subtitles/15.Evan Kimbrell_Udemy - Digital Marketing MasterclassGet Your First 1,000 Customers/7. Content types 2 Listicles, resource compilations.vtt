00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.730
Hey guys welcome back to the Corps.

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.460
So in our last lecture we are three different types of content that we're focused on answering questions

3
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.900
talked about tutorials interviews and we talked about round ups and this lecture.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.670
I wanted to focus on content types that really embraced the power of the list.

5
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.950
Why list you might ask well list offer the writer a way to upload a bunch of items and information really

6
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.920
quickly and allows the reader to scan them pretty easily for content like blog posts.

7
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.190
Many people like lists because when they see that number in the title you know these posts like eight

8
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.750
easy ways to do something or 49 free Web sites for doing whatever they know exactly how much stuff they're

9
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.360
getting.

10
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.350
Forty nine or eight or twenty or whatever.

11
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.430
And this list type content can make for great reference material the type of stuff people bookmark or

12
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.270
go back to multiple times.

13
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.990
And also it often gets shared a lot because again people like to share things they know people want

14
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.980
to read.

15
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.350
People want to read things that are easy to digest.

16
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.580
Listicle just in general are easy to digest.

17
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.640
So those are going to talk about two different types of list content.

18
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.870
Listicle and resource compilations.

19
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.470
All right so first up which is exactly a listicle.

20
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.700
Don't worry it's not a medical condition like if you're listicle last longer than four hours please

21
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.070
consult a doctor.

22
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.570
We're actually talking about list article.

23
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.370
It's a portmanteau.

24
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.760
Yes.

25
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.940
And just said portmanteaux of the word list and the word article stick them together.

26
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.630
It's kind of like the word smog which you might have thought was just the Chinese word for clouds but

27
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.300
instead actually it's it's a portmanteau of smoke plus fog equals smog.

28
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.330
Now the goals are pretty easy to identify because they usually have a number in the Title 47 reasons

29
00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.060
why you should never go to Kazakhstan or the best ways to cook potatoes in order.

30
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.190
You can literally go to Google start typing in any random number under a hundred.

31
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.820
The 38 best and yeah you'll find results now.

32
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.180
Yes.

33
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.390
Ellipticals are a bit over done right now and there's no better evidence of this than some of the list.

34
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.450
Buzzfeed has put out recently.

35
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.210
That just go to BuzzFeed and search just jumping around.

36
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.510
They have some of the worst stuff I've ever seen.

37
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.560
There's one called 15 hedgehog's with things that look like hedgehogs or 20 things that will make you

38
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.490
say no.

39
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.900
Or 35 people who just realize that Seth MacFarlane the guy started Family Guy is actually hot.

40
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.330
I'm guessing there are some slow news days at BuzzFeed But before you pass this over as being out of

41
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:49.380
style or overly saturated or something that you saw years ago but it's done.

42
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.930
Actually let me tell you it's if you look at the numbers and look at the the reality of the situation

43
00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.680
it's not not even close the amount of listicle is on the Internet is increasing not decreasing.

44
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.110
And there are veritable merits to using this form of blogging.

45
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.810
Now it's also probably the easiest thing to churn out if you're just stuck and not sure what to write

46
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:10.320
about.

47
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.100
Listicle is hit on something important.

48
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.190
People like this form of content and because of that it's not going to go away for a long time.

49
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.700
So what sort of listicle could you make.

50
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.900
Well the top ten ways to use your product is a star but it's not terribly interesting so let's give

51
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.660
it some kind of angle.

52
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.490
The top 10 unexpected ways to use your product or think of those pain points you talked about before.

53
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.630
Top Ten Ways your product save saves customers money or if that's too specific try top ten ways our

54
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.710
product can help your small business.

55
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.100
But remember what I mentioned about making tutorials while you have the option of making things that

56
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.750
are internal or internally focused where you create things that describe your products or your services

57
00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.550
like we just did here in the last example or you can think externally and focus on customer needs.

58
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.920
Beyond your stupid products maybe you make an app for digital artists to quickly retouch photos on their

59
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:16.140
phone so you could write thirty seven breathtaking photos taking on an iPhone or 25 digital artist taking

60
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.530
mobile photography to the next level.

61
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.030
Those listicle are about your product but could be interesting and or even inspirational to your customers.

62
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.740
Here's a great example.

63
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:33.270
Nine-Nine designs is a graphic design marketplace where freelance artists come together to create designs.

64
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.270
People might need need a logo or a book cover or a T-shirt design.

65
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.220
I'll check them out nationally.

66
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.620
Freelance artists are a big part of their audience so their blog naturally covers a lot of relevant

67
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.300
information for that exact type of person.

68
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:57.180
They provide lots of tutorials but also listicle that provide lots of ideas like this one here with

69
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.700
30 free public domain image sites which is actually a common need for designers the last thing you want

70
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.010
to do is grab an image that you don't have the rights to use it and then get sued.

71
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.120
Here's a few more listicle tips if you can digest it.

72
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.460
What a blow people's minds.

73
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.580
Well give them something like 10 and a half.

74
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.150
Unexpected ways to use your product.

75
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.700
What's a half reason you might say.

76
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.400
How do you even measure a half reason.

77
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:30.530
Believe it or not more people and more readers will be drawn to this simply out of curiosity.

78
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.020
We're getting to that point where we're more and more used to the standard template headlines for listicle.

79
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.290
So the more you can change it or tweak it or make something out of the ordinary More likely they are

80
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:47.400
to recognize that this is something that generally we see in all marketing channels as it matures.

81
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:54.490
So instead of making top 10 lists going from one to 10 make it a countdown that counts from ten to one

82
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.990
save the best for last.

83
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.020
Keep the reader guessing what will be number one.

84
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.360
That's another way of doing it slightly differently.

85
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.040
Another thing is that data has shown that crazy adjectives can grab people's attention instead of top

86
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:13.150
10 unexpected ways perhaps try ten ridiculous ways or 10 hilarious ways and use an adjective that makes

87
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.410
some kind of sense.

88
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.140
Please for the love of God don't use the word epic or game changing every time because one you sound

89
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.880
like an idiot and two if you keep using those words they cease to mean anything so stop it.

90
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.810
OK so listicle healthy present lists of content.

91
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:29.720
Go figure.

92
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:36.150
They could be links they could be lists of tools or pictures or songs or whatever.

93
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.500
Listicle are very flexible that way.

94
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.620
So find ways to explore the different types of information you can present that has value to your audience

95
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.010
and that you can fit in some type of a list.

96
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:52.060
Now another type of list that can have a lot of value for your audience is the second type we're talking

97
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.090
about in this lecture.

98
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.860
It's called a resource compilation.

99
00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:03.280
Now this is basically a list of helpful resources helpful blogs web sites downloads apps tools whatever

100
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.580
that your audience would appreciate about a certain topic.

101
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:12.400
This type of list is specifically focused on giving readers something they can continually return to

102
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.440
to help them do things better.

103
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.360
If you guys are in my non-technical persons guide to building products and apps we have a couple of

104
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.190
resource compilations at the very end.

105
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:27.670
I put something like 90 tools for non-technical entrepreneurs and it's divided by each stage of starting

106
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:28.850
a business.

107
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.460
That is something people generally like.

108
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.330
Here's another example.

109
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:37.990
Startup stash is a Web site you might have seen a product is the most popular thing products listed

110
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.290
on product on ever.

111
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:44.560
Well they bill themselves as a curated directory of resources and tools to help you build your startup

112
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:50.650
and they are not kidding here on the home page if you look at it you've got a list of all the types

113
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.550
of resources you'd need from idea generation to design and deployment.

114
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.730
Customers are poor and beyond click any of those.

115
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:02.830
Let's say we go to mockups and wireframe and now you see a list of tools for this task.

116
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.910
So when you click on one let's go with Mockingbird.

117
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.910
Now you see some info about them.

118
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:15.040
So if you're building a startup you'll need ideas on tools to use for different tasks from time to time

119
00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.330
and start up stash.

120
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:21.490
While it certainly delivers them one reason people create resource compilations is because of the benefits

121
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:25.600
you can get from Link Building and the eyes of Google and other search engines.

122
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:32.310
When you link to a site you're endorsing them so that link then increases your SEO value of the page

123
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.890
you've been linked to.

124
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:40.840
Don't worry about as we talk about that in the last section but just know this Google uses tricks to

125
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.440
figure out whether or not your page is valuable to people.

126
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:49.570
One of the things they look for is if it's valuable and people will link to it and then it looks for

127
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:50.120
links.

128
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.480
What's that nice is that whoever you link to can often link back to you.

129
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.440
And that's generally how you make it look like your page is very interesting.

130
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.850
Also just in general people really like sharing resource compilations because they want to be helpful

131
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.980
to their audience however small it may be.

132
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.790
So how exactly could you go about creating a resource compilation of your own.

133
00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:14.470
Well start with links you've bookmarked that help you do research or your job.

134
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:21.190
If you provide let's say I.T. support maybe you've got links at the ready for all the major laptop or

135
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:27.190
router manufacturers who create apps for iOS as you might have links to official documentation along

136
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.790
with tools you use for wire framing and emulation.

137
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.200
What resources would benefit your audience.

138
00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.860
What would help them do their job better.

139
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:42.220
I think it's really important to first start in your bookmarks because people like to see resource compilations

140
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.820
but they also like for someone else to do the curation for them.

141
00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:50.050
If you're an expert and what you do you've been doing it for 10 years 20 years.

142
00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:53.980
Chances are you know of some resources that they've never heard of.

143
00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.820
That saves them a lot of time.

144
00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.490
They feel like they're getting the inside track on something.

145
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:05.210
Do you think rosted your bookmark list or you pulled out of your Evernote troves all the links that

146
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.610
you've used are shared or saved.

147
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:14.390
The next thing is really just doing the research yourself because you again being their expert or knowing

148
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:20.600
something about this topic you're building a resource list for should have a better time or an easier

149
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:27.530
time finding links to easy to use tools easy to use resources or things that your audience would like.

150
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:33.980
So it really just comes down to legwork and then using your own perception to kind of curate what you

151
00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.930
think is worth using what looks good and then what's common.

152
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.290
But you think it's crap and should be left out between listicle and resource compilations.

153
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:47.540
You've got two really useful types of content ones that get used by a lot of different bloggers and

154
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.100
businesses dig into these types and try to find some ways that you can offer some of your own.

155
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.350
Chances are you can figure something out.

156
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:54.590
All right.

157
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:58.790
Time to take a breath maybe even get some ideas down about these content types.

158
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.930
I strongly suggest taking notes as we go through this because you might get ideas as I described the

159
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:09.410
content and give you examples of how it works and we'll pick up with some more and the next lecture.

160
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.080
I see it.
