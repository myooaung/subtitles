00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,840
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,940
So in this series of lectures we're talking about different kinds of lead magnets.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:12,820
Things you basically create that could be used to attract leads in the form of like emails or sign ups.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,830
Now the first couple we covered in the last few lectures were white papers and e-books.

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,350
Now in this lecture I'm going to go over different kind of creation that could compel people to give

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,000
you their personal information and then as an email course now an email course is an automated series

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,100
of emails containing educational training type material.

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:36,900
When people sign up for an email course they receive each part usually every day or two until it's complete.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,610
Some people actually call this an auto responder course because that's basically what they're setting

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,840
up a system that auto responds to people with a bunch of periodic e-mail messages.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,280
Once they sign up that's when it starts the process.

12
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,540
Well it's called a course.

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,760
A lot of times the person signing up just really just received a bunch of information a task they can

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,590
do on their own which I guess that makes it of course in some cases the person offering the course might

15
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,080
say e-mail me with questions or tell me what you think.

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,490
But the recipient of the e-mails usually don't submit any work to be graded or anything like that.

17
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,490
It's totally self-driven and optional.

18
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:14,250
For example buffer offers a 25 day email course on social media growth strategies on the landing page

19
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,120
where you'd sign up.

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,090
They promised each lesson we'll just take 10 minutes or less per day.

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,590
They give you a bullet list of the types of tools and best practices you'll read about and they offer

22
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,770
a preview of one of the lessons you'll receive to sign up.

23
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,290
All you need to do is enter your email and click the button.

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,260
So why does buffer offer a free email course like this.

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,910
Well the business is all about social media strategy.

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,980
The platform helps people plan and schedule social media posts.

27
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:43,140
So by creating a course like this they can help their followers improve their social media skills and

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,360
probably get more on the platform that offer than offers.

29
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,780
But beyond educating an audience there are plenty of benefits to creating an email course.

30
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,030
One you can collect email addresses obviously use an email or courses require an email address to sign

31
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,570
up.

32
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,190
This is a great way to build a list and promote and sell yourself for your stuff.

33
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:07,220
Number two is you have qualified leads the people who sign up obviously care about the topic so it's

34
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,720
pretty easy to assume that they will care about other things as you say related to it.

35
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,600
Obviously this is an opportunity and don't abuse the shit out of it.

36
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,840
You can also offer them other things down the line but that's entirely up to you.

37
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,100
But there have been a bit of an email choruses that establishes your expertise.

38
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,700
We've said this in our other lectures on why you might create a white paper or an e-book and it pretty

39
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,210
much holds true here as well.

40
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,850
Email of course shows people you have skills to pay the bills when it comes to the topics in your industry.

41
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,180
Fourth reason is that email courses give you a chance to reuse some of your best material.

42
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,060
Start actually if you just have a bunch of blog post articles e-books or white papers or just any training

43
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,690
materials that you have that performed decently well.

44
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,000
You're going to remix these into an email course and actually doesn't even take that much effort.

45
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,310
You don't have to reinvent the wheel here you can simply take a great wheel and then put a different

46
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,060
spin on it.

47
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,810
See what I did there.

48
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:59,880
And the reason of course since this is an auto responder course is that this whole thing works automatically

49
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,960
without you needing to really do anything.

50
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,640
People sign up whatever email service you are using to power the course does its thing flitters emails

51
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,170
the schedule while you're off working on whatever you need to work on.

52
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:17,370
As more people sign up your lead list grows and you hardly have to really do anything other than keep

53
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,080
promoting it.

54
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,780
So who does email courses.

55
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,810
Wow what kind of business.

56
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,530
That's a great fit.

57
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,310
Here is somebody offering things like professional training or services.

58
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,530
If you create an in-depth training course that you sell promote them with an email course you give people

59
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:37,150
a taste of the full course with an email course that perhaps provided introductory foundational info.

60
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,080
The ones that then want to go further than you have the option to sell them something.

61
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,660
Maybe your email course is like I don't know Lesson 1 or chapter 1 of the full course giving away for

62
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,750
free allows people to get a feel for it and potentially hook them in for the full ride soothing whatever

63
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,700
you make is decent.

64
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,570
Now consultants are a good match for email courses as well.

65
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,310
Email courses can be a logical way to repackage previous works like blog post articles and other training

66
00:03:59,310 --> 00:03:59,940
materials.

67
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,870
Since we already said that since it makes sense for consultants to assemble their best stuff into a

68
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,070
collection or program they can offer it through something like an email course.

69
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:13,530
It's a way to establish their expertise as they look for new clients and each person that signs up is

70
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,220
a new lead.

71
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,270
They can then just follow up with really if you have expertise we're sharing on the topic your audience

72
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:24,080
would like something that you could organized into five day 10 day or longer type of program.

73
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,950
Well you could do an email course as well.

74
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,080
And our next lecture we're going to talk about ways that you can create that course and then I'll see

75
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:31,290
that.
