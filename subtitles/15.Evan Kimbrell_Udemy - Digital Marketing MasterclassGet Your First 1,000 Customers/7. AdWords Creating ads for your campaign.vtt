00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.060
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.020
In our last lecture we put together our key word list for added up inside of our words.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.200
The next step is going to be to create some at so let's just jump right back in.

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.550
I'm going to go back in the adverts and look at the creation page now a text ads you don't have a lot

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.270
of space to make your pitch unfortunately specifically ads are made up of four pieces one headline and

6
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.420
it's 30 characters.

7
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.000
This is the main text you'll see as a clickable link.

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.600
Headline 2 is also 30 characters and appears alongside headline one with a dash between them.

9
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.810
Now description is 80 characters appearing under U R L and then there's the u r l that appears under

10
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.540
the headline and above the description.

11
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.320
So you can actually put in anything you want for the euro here.

12
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.930
This is for display only so it actually makes the most sense to put your main u r l here or to put your

13
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.730
you are Al and then the section of a site where they might be going give a ridiculously long u r l that

14
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.560
has tons and tons of dots and numbers and stuff.

15
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.490
The end.

16
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.060
Just change the display so it's something simpler.

17
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.790
Personally I like your display that they're going to the home page because it's just too complicated

18
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.520
to have a slash than the name of the landing page and also in general I don't think people like it as

19
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.920
much when they see that oh I'm not going to the real page.

20
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.230
I'm going to like this advertising page.

21
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.530
They don't like thinking that but obviously they convert better when they do it.

22
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.630
So you could make it web site dot com slash order or web site dot com slash Sign-Up.

23
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.190
If they're going to order or sign up for something but I'd prefer to just take them to a Web site dot

24
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.620
com.

25
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.010
You can also make it like web site dot com slash newsletters.

26
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.930
If you're doing newsletters whatever you do just make it simple.

27
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.320
And if you decide to go with a splash landing page kind of display link then just try to make it as

28
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.780
accurate as possible.

29
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.560
Remember whatever they read on this and is the frame of mind they'll be carrying with them to your ad

30
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.860
page so if you give them the wrong impression chances are they're probably going to leave because it

31
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.180
has limited space in these fields.

32
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.120
You need to make your ad effective as quickly as possible.

33
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.950
So what in general makes for a good at.

34
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.770
So number one.

35
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.270
Keep it short and well you can have a choice here but in general shorter is better.

36
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.100
In other words just get right to the point of what makes you or your product awesome.

37
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.540
But remember you have multiple fields to make your pitch.

38
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.100
For example you might be trying to get more users for your shopping app that shows lower prices when

39
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.170
you scan barcodes in a store.

40
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.780
There are plenty of benefits to your app but in your ad focus on the one that will make the most relevant

41
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.490
connection with your people.

42
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.920
Download bar Khoder save money when you shop.

43
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.680
Don Knapp.

44
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.080
I don't know.

45
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.850
Tracks fitness activity.

46
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.720
Try track your workout and get fit.

47
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.600
Download fitness tracks and other protests.

48
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.050
Make sure to include one of your keywords in the app.

49
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.670
You could one of the keywords in the actual text.

50
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.930
It will improve your ads quality score.

51
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.110
It's kind of crazy that some ads don't include one of the key words that they're displaying for but

52
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.450
they just don't really know better or they're trying to advertise on way too many keywords and just

53
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.590
unfortunately they didn't customize each one to include a keyword to give your aunt a better chance

54
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.390
to be seen and at the same time it also helps improve the relevance of your ad for the person seeing

55
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.350
it on the page.

56
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.960
Either way a higher quality scores means that you might be bumped up in the slot you are at or you'll

57
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.930
pay quite a bit less for your clicks.

58
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.630
Now if you develop a new kind of chat app for families I don't know maybe family chat app is a keyword

59
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.160
that you would be targeting.

60
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.390
So your ad should probably include those keywords new family chat app get for my fam for a while.

61
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.550
The next step I'll say is.

62
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.270
Include an offer or price or something worth taking action on.

63
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.540
If you're doing a promo What is the promo price or the deal numbers or prizes inside add tax can be

64
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.960
unexpected and actually help draw the eye.

65
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.720
And does it offer something better than your competitors.

66
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.700
Well take advantage of your being seen and highlight your price or deal or the specific benefit that

67
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.960
beats out the rest.

68
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.770
Remember you're going to be visually compare to all the other people that are advertising right next

69
00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:59.100
to you.

70
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.980
For example let's say something like iPhone 7 price cut right tune to ninety nine order now.

71
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.320
Well that would get the point across with specifics on the price.

72
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.660
Or you could say marketing tips email sign up plus get free templates to get registrations for your

73
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.170
newsletter.

74
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.520
By promoting the offer of free stuff that they might actually want to use.

75
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.550
Either way you're just sticking out.

76
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.180
Right you're saying why you're different you're saying how they're going to benefit from clicking here

77
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.340
and there are several that say make sure to match to your goal if you want to sell something well write

78
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:36.870
your ad so the customer knows it's now available for order today or on sale even if your product has

79
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.180
been available for a while.

80
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.160
There's still nothing wrong with saying kids as pro now available.

81
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.940
Track your kids anywhere they go.

82
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.440
You're trying to get sign ups on the other hand.

83
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:53.400
Well and let them know what they can sign up for and that they can sign up now including your offer

84
00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.930
or benefits helps as well manage money with big dinero sign up with free 30 day a trial the next step

85
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.420
is make sure that you match it to your landing page whether you've built your landing page or not.

86
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.660
This ad should be a perfect match for it if the headline matches the title on the landing page.

87
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.880
That's actually the best description matches taxed on the page.

88
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.360
That's also good as well.

89
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.280
So don't go crazy coming up with a clever headline that doesn't match the landing page because some

90
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.800
people click through actually be confused.

91
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.870
This is a concept called conversion set convergence and it's basically the scent that gets carried from

92
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.580
an ad to a landing page.

93
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.740
So if I clicked something thinking that I'm going to see something specific or a very detailed image

94
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.940
in mind then when I get to the page.

95
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.220
How closely does that relate to what I thought I was going to get.

96
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.430
Now this applies to all ads like for instance doing graphic ads.

97
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.850
You'll make sure that the colors match the landing page you'll make sure that the words you use matched

98
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.200
the tone of voice and some of the keywords you use.

99
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:57.840
Either way if I click something I expect to see something similar or directly relevant kind of a continuation

100
00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.330
of this first thought I had when I clicked it.

101
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.200
Now a quick aside no Google wants to make sure your ads are helpful and of high quality Now we already

102
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.470
kind of covered up for part of their Everetts is cracking down on spam and just in general Lousie looking

103
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.930
at the ad any explanation points.

104
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.800
For instance Google might actually stop you from submitting.

105
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.760
They don't want you to use numbers like get it for free.

106
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.260
Right.

107
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:26.230
Where four means four and you're probably just trying to save space but they think it looks cheap.

108
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.480
Basically use real words and deliver an ad that's focused on facts and easy to understand.

109
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.980
So think of your own goal right now what are you trying to accomplish with your app again is sales sign

110
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.970
ups page visits or is it something else.

111
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.000
In the example we've been using through these lectures our goal has been to increase sales of our smart

112
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.040
scooter so our headlines and description should support that specifically as you type in the fields

113
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.060
for your ad follow along with the preview on the right.

114
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:55.860
Try toggling between mobile and desktop to see how it looks on both When you're satisfied click save

115
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:56.940
and button.

116
00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.620
Google will show a warning message if there's any punctuation problem or issue with the characters you

117
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.360
use.

118
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:08.790
But after that it'll be up to Google to formally review it and it takes just generally I don't know

119
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.830
sometimes it's an hour a couple of hours sometimes it's a day or two.

120
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.150
Very rarely do these get reviewed manually.

121
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.890
But sometimes that actually does happen.

122
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:22.560
Now once you've got your asset hit review campaign at the bottom and you'll see the review screen shows

123
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.040
you the numbers for daily estimates and your budget.

124
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:30.150
Not a glass you can also see the ad group and keyword list along with any of the ads you created to

125
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.100
make any changes.

126
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.780
Hit the back button but otherwise hit save and finish.

127
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.400
If you're not ready completely yet will hit finish and pause campaign.

128
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:42.270
For example if you have a landing page to complete before this thing goes live then just pause and don't

129
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:47.130
actually publish it because it is point you just have to wait for who was approval again might take

130
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.100
a couple hours or it might take more than a day.

131
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.640
So if you're planning on starting your ad on a specific date like the launch date of an app or a sale

132
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.630
make sure you submit your ad for approval and least a few days before that.

133
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.410
Also keep in mind they might reject your ad because you did something wrong which case you'd have to

134
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.550
either appeal it or try to tweak it and resubmit it.

135
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.860
Once you do have approval it's not really that hard.

136
00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:11.850
You could start running your own but if you want to save yourself some trouble figuring out how well

137
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:12.740
you're doing.

138
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:18.600
Create a second and as soon as your first one is approved and then run both ads is what we call a split

139
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.020
test.

140
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:24.090
Now we covered this earlier but an AB test or a split test is basically a Google run to and side by

141
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:27.450
side and then you'll see which one gets a higher click rate.

142
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:34.160
Generally speaking if you have two ads in a split test google show 50 percent of the audience one add

143
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.430
and then the other 50 percent of the audience the other half.

144
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.300
There is a way that you can actually make Google choose for you.

145
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:39.570
Right.

146
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:45.030
So if you're really busy and you don't want to have constant tweaking your ads they can automatically

147
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.630
pick that one has a better click through rate and just automatically switch to displaying that one.

148
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:53.040
Now you could run a whole bunch of alternate versions where you change like one little thing let's say

149
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.800
a different word in your headline or different display you are all my in general to get results.

150
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.210
The quickest way is just to change everything.

151
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.560
Both the headlines display you are Al and then the description make them as different as possible.

152
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.330
Keep your final You are L..

153
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.970
You know that's the you are here landing page the exact same.

154
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:09.690
So try that.

155
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:14.730
Try coming up with one idea for an ad and then an entirely different idea for an ad but keep that you

156
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.090
are all the same.

157
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.940
Then what will happen is the best one will determine which one has the best text and then what you can

158
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.550
do from there is start whittling it down and that's generally the process of this.

159
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:30.550
You generally do broad scope at first where the ads are nothing alike at all.

160
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:35.580
And then once you figure out which angle or which topic or which kind of strategy is working the best

161
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:40.680
you take that one and then you start running smaller variations of test then you swap out the headline

162
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.850
but nothing else.

163
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:45.450
Then you swap out a couple of words but nothing else and you kind of whittle it down until you have

164
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.260
your best version.

165
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.950
Now when you have that second and design just submit it for approval and then when it's a proof both

166
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:54.780
your ad should have a green circle next to them meaning that they're active and will both run then give

167
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.430
your ads a few days or a week and look to see which ad has the better click through rate.

168
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.370
And a lower cost per click that I'll probably determine a winner.

169
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:08.660
For example an ad with a 3 percent click through rate certainly beats one with a 1.5 percent click theory.

170
00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:13.420
But remember the average click through rate for many industries is about 2 percent so 3 percent would

171
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.520
be above average which means Nice work.

172
00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.420
Now of course this doesn't ever end there because if only it was like that.

173
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.150
You then you just focus on the keywords that convert the best but you have to understand that there's

174
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.560
a bigger picture to this so maybe more people click on this and bought all those people clicking from

175
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.350
those links then purchasing.

176
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.790
Sometimes that happens sometimes there are certain keyword phrases that just hit a certain frame of

177
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.720
mind or people buy more often.

178
00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.310
So you just have to track that.

179
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:46.100
And if using Google Adwords and Google Analytics it pretty much will automatically do that for you.

180
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.080
But regardless that's something to keep in mind and you always have to balance the math and you could

181
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.840
certainly keep testing after that if you wanted to.

182
00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:56.860
And it's a good idea if you want to make your ads as effective as possible of course you're going to

183
00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.860
take a lot of time and money in the process of optimizing it.

184
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.880
Unfortunately that's kind of just how SDMI is going to work.

185
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.830
Usually you just start off with smaller budgets.

186
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.400
See what works see what numbers you can get.

187
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.420
And then sometimes you just you can make the math work.

188
00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:17.080
And sometimes after several iterations you can you just can't find anything that's cheap enough to actually

189
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.100
make it worth it for you.

190
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:18.300
All right.

191
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.240
So anyway there you go.

192
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:23.950
Once you have your ads up and running review their performance see what works and you see success as

193
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.780
well and generally tried to duplicate it for other goals with the new campaign.

194
00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:33.340
If you're seeing problems try to test it and tease it out then review the results again and then make

195
00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:34.560
changes accordingly.

196
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.390
And of course keep an eye on your budget.

197
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:36.930
Now that's it.

198
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.910
Thank you for watching.

199
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:38.830
