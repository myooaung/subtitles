1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:00,780
All right.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,410
Welcome back to the course.

3
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,550
We're still talking about defining our audience and well for good reason.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,700
We discussed all the different ways in the previous lecture we can collect data and the more we know

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,430
about our audience the better.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,270
It helps us plan and helps us create content and it helps us understand our audience better.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,240
Those are all good things.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,750
But every time we have an idea for a blog post or a video we don't want to dive into the mountain of

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,080
data or dozens of Google Docs or lists or whatever we've collected.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,540
You might be familiar with that saying that a picture is worth a thousand words.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:41,040
Well rather than consult with those thousands of words every time we have an idea let's instead consult

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,940
with a picture to help us get that picture of our audience.

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,640
We're going to create what we call a user persona.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,310
Now if you guys are in some of my other classes we cover user personas so you can skip this if you want

15
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:59,730
to use because you're a new user persona is basically a character we create that represents our ideal

16
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,080
customer or client.

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,730
It's an approximation or an average or representative.

18
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:11,190
However you want to describe it of our audience but for the purposes of coming up with content ideas

19
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,240
and creating those pieces a user persona is like a gatekeeper.

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,190
If an idea works for them then it should work for our target audience.

21
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,020
So how do we put together a user persona.

22
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:30,420
Basically if our target audience could be represented by one person we would want a profile or a bio

23
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,550
of person.

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,620
We'd like to know their name their job role their goals professionally and in some cases personally

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,690
and would be great to know their daily challenges what they have to accomplish each day.

26
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,710
What often gets in the way of meeting those goals.

27
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:52,950
Oddly enough the weirdest part of that bio might be the name because if we're supposed to create a profile

28
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,650
that represents an entire group of people we can't exactly call it Carl or Gloria or something like

29
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,490
that right.

30
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,140
Oh actually we can.

31
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,440
Let me help paint this picture here and really we can just do this in a Google doc.

32
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,090
It's really nothing fancy.

33
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,760
If my target audience was let's say new business owners perhaps I named my persona new business Bob

34
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:21,090
or not I know startups Steve or people out there who do X will recommend a new user persona when you

35
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,340
pick a name for your persona.

36
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:29,110
They'll suggest you use alliteration because it helps make those names easier to remember.

37
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,270
That point is really up to you.

38
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,710
I personally think it's a little goofy but I will stick with that pattern.

39
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,560
After you decide on a name for use a persona then we can add in other details that we've mentioned before.

40
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,310
Their job role while job role does not necessarily equal job title.

41
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:50,670
Our business owner might be credited as the CEO or owner or president or founder something like that

42
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,470
but in reality our audience members have multiple roles.

43
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,230
Are the CEO as well as the chief product officer.

44
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,100
Maybe the CTO as well.

45
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,300
Maybe they're the head of business development maybe even sales and support.

46
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,390
Certainly if that business employs one person well for our persona we can select the roles most common

47
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,870
for our audience and expand upon them in the section where we talk about goals and daily challenges.

48
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:22,170
When we lose goals in this persona we'll probably list common new business struggles grow our user base

49
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,510
scale the business and define a business strategy.

50
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,580
So our challenges will reflect those goals.

51
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,070
Limited resources to grow user base limited finances to hire new people.

52
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,790
Limited knowledge of industry.

53
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,960
We can continue to flesh out this persona more data that we've collected like the demographics we found.

54
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,640
Let's put in an age for our persona.

55
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,740
Somewhere in that range that we identified for 25 to 30 for any number in there can work.

56
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,800
Where does this guy live.

57
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,050
Well our audience is from all over.

58
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,110
But they are most likely city dwellers.

59
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:02,590
We can leave it as that actually helps us understand what they have access to on the day to day basis.

60
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:08,970
We don't want to be overly specific and put in an example like Austin Texas unless we were actually

61
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,420
targeting just that one city.

62
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:17,040
Let's put an annual income and let's just put something in a range that we identify let's say a range

63
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,550
is thirty five thousand to ten thousand dollars.

64
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,290
We can put in whatever we want there then for education level let's say bachelor's degree.

65
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:31,020
It's kind of hard to guess that one but based on your research we ran a survey you might be able to

66
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,190
kind of figure that one out.

67
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,420
Also if you just look on Facebook at some of your users you'll notice a pattern pretty quickly if you

68
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,400
notice that they have universities listed one more piece we can add here.

69
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,390
Favorite Web sites and brands.

70
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:47,760
Now when we research Serious Eats in our last video we found information about users on Quantcast and

71
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,590
it showed us some of the brands and Web sites their users liked here and your persona.

72
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:58,260
We can list these names and you or else to give us more of an idea of where they go and what they think

73
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,610
about during each day.

74
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,500
So is sort of Steve here starting to take shape.

75
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,670
Well a little bit.

76
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,620
You could even add a picture if you wanted to and find you know just some guy on google image search

77
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,830
wearing a hoodie or something that looks like he or she might be in your target audience.

78
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,600
Again hardcore people and you x will suggest that you do put a photo because the photo will allow you

79
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,200
to connect to that persona on more of a human level.

80
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,550
This pic is of an actor who is on Mad Men a few times.

81
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,250
I don't know.

82
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,870
He just kind of looks like what I'd imagined sort of Steve looks like it's just really I don't know

83
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,550
another way to make him more memorable.

84
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,460
Another detail.

85
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:41,380
And here is a biography or a persona story and really all you'd be doing here is playing a little bit

86
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:48,360
of make believe if this persona had more history to it more motivation behind it what would it all be.

87
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:54,520
Why did startups Steve start his company what's driving him to achieve those goals of his.

88
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,670
Is he a hard worker or is this more of a side job like.

89
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,040
I'll put more effort into this if it takes off kind of approach.

90
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,340
Are there causes he believes in all this can help us speak to some of the values of our audience.

91
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:13,720
And honestly if you don't know this information that's fine but do it last and take your best guess

92
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,820
at it again try to read people's Facebook posts try to actually talk to some of your customers and try

93
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,800
to kind of create an approximation of a story that you might think is believable if you figured out

94
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,200
that they believe in hard work well then so should our persona.

95
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,780
So our guy Steve.

96
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,730
He learned how to create apps in college.

97
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,120
And his first job was as a developer.

98
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,720
He did that for a few years and on the sides started developing this app idea.

99
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:41,210
He had six months later after you launched it he realized he needed to make a decision.

100
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,310
Either stick with his day job or quit and devote his time to the app.

101
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,260
So he took a chance and now he's trying to build a business around this app.

102
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:50,790
There you go.

103
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,640
That's a story.

104
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:57,370
And one more detail you can add here is a quote almost like a personal mantra or a mission statement

105
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,470
totally optional for you guys out there.

106
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,720
But some people have found that doing this can also help their understanding.

107
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,970
It's another way to quickly sum up your persona and make it again more memorable.

108
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:14,470
Perhaps it's something like I can't wait to retire at 35 which clearly means or this guy wants to make

109
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,050
lots of money.

110
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,290
Or maybe it's if I can help just one person a day I'm happy.

111
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:26,380
Which could mean he's not as interested in growth as he is and say like user satisfaction or making

112
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,040
some kind of personal or social difference whatever that is.

113
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:35,760
Sort of Steve would most likely say I want to help as many customers as I can to achieve their dreams.

114
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,540
So he believes in growing his company and doing good at the same time.

115
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,290
Good for Steve.

116
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:41,890
And there you go.

117
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,860
We've got a Google doc page here that's less than a page long.

118
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,120
Somewhere you can find a lot of detail.

119
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,370
Just a glance.

120
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:53,140
This is the picture we're talking about now and we've created a user persona we can use that to help

121
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:59,090
us come up with content ideas or at the very least validate the ones we've already thought of.

122
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,450
Let's say we've got some ideas for blog posts squirreled away.

123
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,550
The question becomes would startups be interested in these.

124
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,160
So say idea number one.

125
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:14,760
It's a blog post titled Five Easy Steps to grow your user base through targeted Facebook ads.

126
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:21,520
Let's say idea Number two we can do a series on how to articles demonstrating how to use different apps

127
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,270
and platforms.

128
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:27,760
Do payroll accounting and finance funds stuff let's say idea Number three is an interview with a startup

129
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:33,000
founder we know personally asking him how he managed to become profitable within a year.

130
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,250
Which of the three ideas would make the most sense for our persona.

131
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,560
Well we know sort of Steve wants to grow his user base and it's one of the goals we mentioned and it's

132
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:47,650
in that quote We came up with so idea one probably seems like a winner right now.

133
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:53,380
Idea number two is interesting there's plenty of new business owners who could use the help of platforms

134
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,890
and apps to organize and automate different tasks.

135
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,240
But it is finance and accounting.

136
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,360
One of the tasks that Steve would be interested in is payroll specifically something Steve would care

137
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,040
about.

138
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,660
I'm not entirely sure because there's no indication of that in the user persona we put together a lot

139
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:16,230
of these startups Steeves might be the only employees at the moment so maybe it's less of a concern.

140
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,950
For now I might say let's pass on it but don't dismiss it completely you can just kind of store it off

141
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,030
to the side.

142
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,000
Maybe there could be demand for it later or maybe might change your mind.

143
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:31,200
Now that idea Number three or three is this interview of the founder a friend of ours.

144
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,310
He's willing to give us advice on how to become profitable and this could speak to some of startup Steve's

145
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:41,070
goals some of his psychographic It's like scaling the business into finding a strategy.

146
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,320
I'd say this is one we could definitely consider.

147
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,300
So there you go.

148
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:50,080
You had three good ideas but thanks to the help of our persona we know that two of them would be more

149
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,380
appropriate for our audience user personas can help focus our efforts this way not just with creating

150
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:02,430
the content but of validating our ideas before we've even one word of it saves us a lot of time and

151
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,280
a lot of trouble.

152
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,410
So now it's your turn.

153
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:09,660
Do you have a startup Steve or someone else that would serve as their user persona opened up a Google

154
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:16,350
Docs or just some easy place you can jot down information like this give them a name give them a job

155
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,680
role or multiple job roles.

156
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,460
Remember don't give them a job title because they're just not as accurate.

157
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,420
Give them some professional and personal goals.

158
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,710
Give them some challenges you think they might deal with on a day to day basis and then give them some

159
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:38,130
demographics like age location education level and income and maybe if you want favorite brands and

160
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:42,770
Web sites that they use then you can kind of wrap it up with some optional things that I like to add.

161
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,870
You can tell their story you can add a quote and you can add a picture boom.

162
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,420
There you go.

163
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,550
You've got a persona.

164
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,960
And through this process you might realize you know we've got startups Steve for sure.

165
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:59,280
But beyond new business owners I know that we also get a lot of people who invest in their businesses

166
00:10:59,310 --> 00:10:59,930
as well.

167
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:06,060
So maybe then you add a second persona like let's call it investor Irwin or something like that.

168
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,020
Now keep in mind no company is only going to have one user persona.

169
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:17,550
It's good to get a good handful as long as you think there is a good serious chunk or contingent of

170
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,830
your audience that fits each one.

171
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,720
A lot of businesses can easily define one or two or even three personas.

172
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,440
But if you go beyond three then I think you might be spreading yourself too thin.

173
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:34,500
And it's hard to kind of make content that bridges the gaps between too many personas find the ones

174
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,680
you absolutely want to focus on and make this persona as your primary ones.

175
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,310
So once you have your personas print them out and put them on your wall or post them internally with

176
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:49,260
other people who write for you your personas can be your virtual customers the people you keep in mind

177
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,290
as you work through ideas write content prepare other marketing materials.

178
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,750
Don't forget about them.

179
00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:00,220
OK that's it you guys know what goes into a percent on how to kind of rationalize your way through them.

180
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,110
You have any questions.

181
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,970
Make sure to post in the slack.

182
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,320
Otherwise I'll see in the next lecture.
