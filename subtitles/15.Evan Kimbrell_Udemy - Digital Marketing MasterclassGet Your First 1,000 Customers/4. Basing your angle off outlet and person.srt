OK guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:07,400
In our last lecture, we talked about ways to get the 
attention of a reporter by considering certain angles.
2

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,900
We focused on three of them actually, offering 
something special and unique, or at least one thing in
3

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,560
your product offering that's special and unique, tying it 
into a trending topic, or taking an opposing position,
4

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,790
or just piggybacking on some general, something that's 
happening, and you have data to support or go against
5

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,780
it. As part of your PR efforts, you should try and come 
up with something relevant, timely, and with an
6

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,730
angle that's interesting to a writer and their audience.
7

8
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:38,070
Well, your angle can also be more effective if you 
consider the person you're pitching your story to
8

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,840
and the place they write for.
9

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,690
Now, some writers operate a one person blog, but 
many of the writers you might be after will write for
10

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,510
bigger outlets, news sites, magazines,
industry blogs, and more things like that.
11

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,740
Each of these outlets has its own style and 
this gets to what our lecture is about.
12

13
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,220
I want to discuss how you can base your angle on
the outlet or individual you're pitching to and how
13

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,790
to make it as effective as possible. As you go through 
the section and you start doing your research
14

15
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,470
into reporters, bloggers, and writers, which 
we'll jump into in our next lecture,
15

16
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,170
part of the work you'll need to do is 
to get to know them and their outlets.
16

17
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:16,170
Knowing the types of stories they publish, the formats 
they use, and the subjects they usually cover will
17

18
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,760
give you a clear idea about which places and
people would be interested in what you offer.
18

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,750
It also will give you some idea on how to angle it to them.
19

20
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,270
I mean, you wouldn't necessarily walk into a vegan 
restaurant offering a kick ass steak recipe.
20

21
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:33,020
So I don't think you can just walk up to any reporter 
or magazine and then just get your pitch approved.
21

22
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,770
You need to understand them first.
22

23
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,800
So part of gaining this understanding
is reading what they publish.
23

24
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,220
Now, for any writer you identify as a lead, you'll want 
to read their works to see if their style and
24

25
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,650
opinions are a good match with what you want them to 
write about. The same needs to be done for the place
25

26
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,540
they write for.
26

27
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,200
Does the magazine, the blog, or the media site they 
write for publish anything like what you have in mind?
27

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,540
Certainly, if you have an app or some kind of tech 
product, maybe you've considered approaching an outlet
28

29
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,730
like, let's say, Wired or Engadget, which 
feature tech subject matter all the time.
29

30
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,320
If you're trying to pitch a story about great recipes 
for cats with dementia, maybe Wired is probably not
30

31
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,910
your thing. While you're reading their work,
31

32
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,580
make note of the format and 
subject matter of each piece.
32

33
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,700
Does the site you want to get in feature long form
pieces or do they concentrate on shorter posts?
33

34
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,340
Consider a magazine like The Atlantic, for example.
34

35
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:27,000
While they cover different topics, like politics, human 
interest stories, and culture, they're very much
35

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,620
known for their long form pieces they publish.
36

37
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,590
If you have an idea they might like, make sure it 
fits in a long form format and there's a lot to say
37

38
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,090
on it, or it fits into a rather long form story.
38

39
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,090
When you're reading works from a specific 
writer, make note of their writing style.
39

40
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,490
Does the reporter write in an unbiased or biased way?
40

41
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,930
Are they offering nothing but facts
or sharing lots of their own opinions?
41

42
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,180
Do they inject controversial ideas into their work 
or do they keep things conservative and safe?
42

43
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,380
If you're interested in being featured in Vice, for
example, you should be aware that their articles
43

44
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,890
are often opinionated and they always try to go for edge.
44

45
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,140
Now, would your subject fit their vibe?
45

46
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,790
They're always counterculture.
46

47
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,010
They're always going to be contrarian.
47

48
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,330
They always want to have things that no one else is 
covering and things that are kind of grungy or edgy.
48

49
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,930
If you fit somewhere in there, you can 
make a pitch that fits somewhere in there.
49

50
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:22,260
Consider a pitch that takes advantage of that style and 
then emphasize how rough and kind of cutting edge
50

51
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,130
and hip this is. As you do your research into the writers 
and outlets you want to potentially reach out to,
51

52
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:26,340
and hip this is. As you do your research into the writers 
and outlets you want to potentially reach out to,
52

53
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,850
remember that they have just as 
many angles as your story does.
53

54
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,960
Writers don't just want relevant, timely, and interesting.
54

55
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,440
They want something they can easily plug into their 
blog or magazine and something that fits well with
55

56
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,430
their style and for their audience.
56

57
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,040
If a writer gets a pitch that really fits with their interest,
it has a much better chance of being heard
57

58
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,290
than one that only fits your interests.
58

59
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,320
Now, obviously keep this in mind going forward.
59

60
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,960
So really it comes down to two things.
60

61
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,120
Are you matching the person 
and are you matching the outlet?
61

62
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,870
The outlet is going to have a brand personality.
62

63
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,770
They're going to cover certain types of things.
63

64
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:05,190
Forbes, Business Insider, and Entrepreneur.com, they're 
all going to cover very similar things, they're going
64

65
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,070
to be above water,
65

66
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,520
they're very rarely opinionated,
66

67
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,890
they like to cover things that happen in businesses, 
and they love startup stories or some juicy gossip
67

68
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,080
about the finance sector.
68

69
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,400
On the other hand, like a Wired or an Engadget, we were
talking about, or The Verge, they're going to cover
69

70
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,800
technology and they only want things that are 
cutting edge or things that seem futuristic.
70

71
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,650
They also do like to insert opinions and they do
like to cover things that are kind of in the blind
71

72
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,570
spot of the cultural eye, so to speak.
72

73
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,650
They like to cover things that you were not aware of,
73

74
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,410
things they love covering, like spying stories.
74

75
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,510
So the first thing you have to do is make sure that
your pitch and your angle matches the brand of the
75

76
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,160
overall kind of umbrella site.
76

77
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,500
And the second thing you need to do is make sure it 
matches the interests of the individual. You're going
77

78
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,550
to pitch to a writer, not the brand.
78

79
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,350
So when you pitch to the writer, read what they've 
written before and you'll notice, hey, they like covering
79

80
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,130
certain topics. They'll even write in their bio sometimes,
80

81
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,090
"This is what I cover."
81

82
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,790
So if you can match in one of those realms, one 
of those topics, and then match it to the angle and
82

83
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,690
the brand of their outlet,
83

84
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:10,010
you have a very good chance of getting picked up. Okay, 
I think we've covered all the angles on angles on angles.
84

85
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,640
you have a very good chance of getting picked up. Okay, 
I think we've covered all the angles on angles on angles.
85

86
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,780
I'll see you guys in the next lecture.
