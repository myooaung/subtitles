00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.530
All right we're back with another cool tactic you can use to come up with some content ideas.

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.030
This time I want to talk about the Google Keyword planner if you know anything about it you might know

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.590
it's usually used by marketers to find keywords for creating ads.

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.470
However we can use the same tool to find keywords for creating content.

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.060
Let's start by opening up the Google Keyword planner.

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.960
I can never remember what the R L is usually Google Google Keyword planner and you can find it nowadays.

7
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.300
I think you actually need an outwards account to access.

8
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.200
So if you don't have one just go through the process and sign up.

9
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.860
It's fine because it's completely free and you should have signed up for it before we set it up and

10
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.280
like Section 4.

11
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.980
But what are all paused the video and all weight behind the play button.

12
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.700
All right after you have an account all set up you might have to go up to the Tools menu at the top

13
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.920
so it will click that and then go down to keyword planner and click that to get where we want to go.

14
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.580
Well it's your on the keyword player screen it should look something like this.

15
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.340
It'll ask you where you want to start.

16
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.470
So let's pick the first option on the first section is called search for new keywords by using a phrase

17
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.910
website or category.

18
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.950
Clickety click click click and opens up a form underneath the first few fields are the most important

19
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.010
in your product or service field.

20
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.800
Type in exactly what you offer in the form of a search term.

21
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.580
Could be graphic design consulting services work could be dog walking app.

22
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.240
What do you offer or what do you do.

23
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.330
Shouldn't be too hard.

24
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.970
Just type it in there and just a couple words below that you've got your landing page.

25
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.500
And now if you're doing an ad campaign you put in your landing page you are all right here.

26
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.780
They'd scan it and get the keywords off and do some of the work for you.

27
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.350
All right.

28
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.860
We're just doing research for content so you can you can enter the you are all of a different page that

29
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.480
has some relevant keywords if you want or I think you can actually skip this one if you have a great

30
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.300
blog post written about yourself.

31
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.770
You could intern that you are L..

32
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.230
You can also put in the you are Alpher your about page or I don't know.

33
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.140
Sometimes you just put in your home page and that's generally good enough.

34
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.550
Now the next thing is the product category.

35
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.330
This pulldown is going to take you on a journey so you'll have to look around and see if you can find

36
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.090
a relevant match for yourself.

37
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.450
You know that dog walking app we're always mentioning that it's like Barker Wolf I swear I need to learn

38
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.210
the name of it.

39
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.330
Well you go on your hobbies and leisure.

40
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.010
You can actually then go to pets and animals and you'll find dog walking.

41
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.030
How about that.

42
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.380
If you get stuck on where to go just click all categories again and look around and you know do some

43
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.070
more of there.

44
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.420
OK now the next thing on the page is targeting the first couple of fields looking for specifics and

45
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.580
the location and language of your audience.

46
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.990
And this part you want to think about your customers and where they'd be searching from to find content

47
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.960
about someone like you if you will be looking for local customers and hope they'll look for you then

48
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.200
you can enter your city and stay in the U.S. for example.

49
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.430
But for now if you're not just folks in a local municipality or state or whatever you just type in United

50
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.040
States or whatever country you're in follow the same logic when choosing your language in the next field

51
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.550
as well.

52
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.800
OK let's leave everything else as is some of the features apply more to ad campaigns and for now it's

53
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.390
easier to see what you've got with just these results.

54
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.540
So hit that button that says get ideas at the bottom and let the keyword planner crunch the magic numbers.

55
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.470
The next screen will show you results in the form of keyword ideas.

56
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.960
Now these keyword phrases listed below have been search for with various levels of interest this is

57
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.020
all being pulled out of Google's massive pile of search data that interest is measured by the average

58
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.000
monthly search numbers.

59
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.010
Now what you'll see are ranges but look obviously for the higher numbers.

60
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.310
That means there's more demand for those searches.

61
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.570
So what are we seeing from this tool that can help you create content.

62
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.050
Well the keyword phrases and combinations you see here can be used to come up with ideas for blog posts

63
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.640
and social media updates.

64
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.020
For example let's say you're still developing that dog walking and we talked about before and then you

65
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.110
know the buzz seemed to lecture and like I don't know 30 seconds ago.

66
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.840
Now if you go into dog walking app for your description and dog walking under the category you'll see

67
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.950
keyword results that include dog walking services and even something like dog sitter.

68
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.140
So how can you use this information to come up with continuities.

69
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.590
Well perhaps the people searching for pet sitting services on Google would want to hear about our dog

70
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.990
walking app if they saw in a blog post that people who use the app will off their dog more and spent

71
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.650
less on dog walking services that be worth something if it.

72
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.600
Know if this was true of course you can take it a step further and combine these ideas with those popular

73
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.470
content formats.

74
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.810
We mentioned a few videos back remember interviews and ultimate guides and top 10 list.

75
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.770
Well how about making making dog walking easy.

76
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:41.740
An interview with our app designer or how about top 10 ways you can use a dog walking app while on vacation.

77
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.240
There's a lot of possibilities and someone will land on it and read it.

78
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.010
Now think about why people are searching for the terms that keyword planner shows you.

79
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.770
And then come up with a connection.

80
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.270
If there is one you've got yourself a topic you can try.

81
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.210
You can't make a connection Well then just move on to the next phrase.

82
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.310
But if none of the phrases really work for you change up your information let's try a different phrase

83
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.260
to describe yourself or try a different category you'll eventually get something.

84
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.100
In fact let's try another example right now.

85
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.070
What's clear keyword planner from the Tools menu.

86
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.140
Go back to where we started with this.

87
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.950
Now what's the idea of web design consulting.

88
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.670
So I'm going to write some blog posts and try and build up the following.

89
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:23.220
Get some more clients whatever I'm going to type in web design agency here in the first field than under

90
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.020
Categories.

91
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.880
We'll go to Internet and telecom and then Internet networks and then finally we can actually narrow

92
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.630
it down to web design and development.

93
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.370
Oh and one more thing I'll say I live in the Portland Oregon area and I'm only looking for local clients.

94
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.080
I don't live in Portland.

95
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.170
That's not true.

96
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.030
But let's pretend.

97
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.860
Let's just say that's how I roll.

98
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.090
Going to enter that in the location field.

99
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.640
Got it.

100
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.240
OK.

101
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.960
So now let's hit it.

102
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.840
Ideas so I'm going to poke around these results a lot of the first ones really all look like.

103
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.820
I mean it's a lot of the same terms I think is really jumping out at me here.

104
00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.970
Well I'm going to try something I'm going to go up to the top where it has my description and I'm going

105
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.290
to change it again.

106
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.690
I'm going into the agency because well you know I do web design.

107
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:14.190
Maybe if I use a simpler term it will help me find some more interesting phrase that any agency is kind

108
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.420
of pigeonholing me.

109
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.700
OK.

110
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.960
So refresh the results.

111
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.510
And while they are now the first 10 or so all sounds the same.

112
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.760
We've got web developer web development and web designer.

113
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:24.000
All right.

114
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.980
But if I keep scrolling some more down here at the bottom I'm seeing some adjectives in there and this

115
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:35.520
is actually more interesting now look at professional web site design or a good web site design affordable

116
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.660
website design.

117
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.910
Now that's an actual trend for you.

118
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.000
People are looking for web design services that are cheap and also good.

119
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.730
And you know what I can work with that it's not impossible if somebody were searching for that.

120
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.620
What type of content piece could you make that they would find interesting.

121
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.090
We could write some blog posts that include those terms for sure.

122
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.430
We could write something like the five essential elements for professional web site design or how to

123
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.320
choose the right agency for good and affordable web site design something like that you're appealing

124
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.960
to these people that search for those terms we mentioned before.

125
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.150
But with the content you show off your expertise proving that you know what you're talking about maybe

126
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.890
even sprinkle in and examples of your own work or links to case studies you've done that where you get

127
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:17.150
them.

128
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.420
If you create an info graphic of the steps they need to take to ensure that web site design gets done

129
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.760
correctly then you can brand it with your logo and you are all that way when someone reads it they will

130
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.410
know exactly where it came from.

131
00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.120
Even if someone shared it offsite.

132
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.280
All right so whatever you make or do you the keyword planner can give you some ideas for things right

133
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.990
right set up just coming up with ideas out of thin air.

134
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.070
You can think of ones related to search terms that are actually in demand.

135
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.610
Check it out.

136
00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.220
I think it's incredibly useful.

137
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.100
See the next lecture.
