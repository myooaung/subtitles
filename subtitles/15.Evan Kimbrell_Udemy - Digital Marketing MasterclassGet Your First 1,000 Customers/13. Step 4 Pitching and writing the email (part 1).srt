1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,350
OK guys we are back.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,490
Thanks for being here.

3
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,510
So we've been running through some various steps now for getting PR coverage in the most recent lectures

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,760
we've covered how to find research and get the attention of some of your prospective contacts.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,810
These reporters and bloggers and writers are on your list.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,870
And if you've reached this point you've been getting ready to finally pitch them.

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,650
Just remember to go through these steps first and don't start your process here.

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,350
OK.

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,750
All right so once you're ready to reach out to a reporter or journalist you're going to need a simple

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,050
piece of information or e-mail address.

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,760
Now e-mail really is the best way to pitch people in general.

12
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,010
Reporters prefer it to social media messages or phone calls because well they can organize email keep

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,020
all those pitches and ideas in one place.

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,660
Also easier for them to ignore which is just being polite.

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,510
So pick their preferred method of communication.

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,880
Some might prefer Twitter but most of them are going to prefer email but this very simple piece of info

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,990
their email address isn't always simple to come by.

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,880
No not every journalist publicly lists their email address.

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,170
In fact very few do.

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:58,460
Why.

21
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,570
Because if they did they'd just get bombarded.

22
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:05,460
In order to get their email you need to do a process called email hunting and it's a process that every

23
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,260
would be marketer or just anyone who needs to do cold emailing in general absolutely has to know it's

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,780
a fantastic skill.

25
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,750
Trust me even if you have no interest in PR This will help you a hundred times over.

26
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,280
But the way it works is pretty simple.

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,630
What's your email address.

28
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,760
No seriously don't blurt it out at the screen.

29
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,170
I mean actually think about it.

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,910
I'm just going to take a weird gasp just to and out on a limb here and say that your username probably

31
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,280
has.

32
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,910
Oh I don't know your first name and or your last name in it.

33
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,740
Right.

34
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,230
Look at that.

35
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,350
I'm pretty much psychic.

36
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,960
I can even guess that your email provider is either going to be where you work or a generic provider

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,480
like Gmail or God save you Hotmail.

38
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:45,000
If everyone uses the same username and uses pretty much the same predictable email providers then hey

39
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,400
it's pretty easy to just guess their email.

40
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,110
Now you can do this manually if you for some reason wanted to do just that.

41
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:58,470
You would just take the person's first and last name and then permute it as we call it into 25 or so.

42
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,620
The most common combinations found in email addresses the top 25 permutations just printed is a fancy

43
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,650
word for different combinations of first and last name.

44
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,510
As a user name will cover easily 95 percent of all email usernames.

45
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,980
If you're trying to find my email address Well you can probably guess e Kimbrel or Evan K or Evan dot

46
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,550
Kimbrough.

47
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,290
There's a pretty good chance you get it.

48
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,430
You don't have to keep going to get the correct one but well that's your problem.

49
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,830
Well I personally hate doing this process manually so I use some tools now the first tool does the least

50
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,430
amount and will go through a couple more tools where they get progressively more complicated.

51
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,430
The first one is just called email permutations by Metric sparrow.

52
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,460
Put a link to it over in the resource is pretty simple.

53
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,240
All you do is you put in the first and last name of the person and the name of their domain and what

54
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,520
it does it just spits out the top 25 combinations.

55
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,670
You can try emailing.

56
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,100
Then what you do is you just copy and paste that and when you send an email to put it in the TO category

57
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:59,010
or if you want to be Slye put one in the two and then the 24 other ones in the BCSC so that when they

58
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,530
get the email it doesn't look like you sent it to 25 people.

59
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,180
That's kind of bad form.

60
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,260
Then what happens is you sent out the email and guess what.

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,180
24.

62
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,080
Most of the time will just bounce just won't go through and that last one will get through now.

63
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:17,260
I've had some people mention this before like doesn't this ruin my email provider's spam score.

64
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:23,220
No Know it all only matters if you're sending out thousands of emails if you're telling this to ten

65
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,050
or a hundred people.

66
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,970
It's just not going to make a difference.

67
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:33,390
Spammers get knocked down because they're sending hundreds of thousands of bad emails like this.

68
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,870
Anyway that's a pretty cool tool but it can get even better.

69
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,580
Now the next tool can go a little further with it's called email Hunter.

70
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,500
They install a browser plug in such that you can go to LinkedIn and then look at anyone's profile and

71
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,590
you click the hunter button on their profile uses their profile info to make their best guess at what

72
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,510
their email is.

73
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,970
Now I'd say it's right maybe 70 percent of the time.

74
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,770
Now you might get wrong emails but like we said before we're going to try to contact a lot of press.

75
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,320
So it really shouldn't matter if for some reason your emails are the same person are going through.

76
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,020
Well then you can keep trying try other domains or other combinations or I don't know just how to do

77
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,220
a little bit more research.

78
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,780
If email Hunter now is too much for you and let's say you already have all the info for the targets

79
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,420
compiled and you don't necessarily need to trawl through LinkedIn to find everyone.

80
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,570
Well there's another tool you can use and this is the most advanced but actually the simplest version

81
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,510
and it's called Law Norbert.

82
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,810
Yes I know it's a goofy name and it's incredibly hard to remember but they do have a tool that does

83
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,350
the same thing but simplified.

84
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,690
You just plug in the names you know and the domain you know and it just does its best to look up the

85
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,040
email and it gives you confidence rating and how sure they are that this email works now the way that

86
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,480
they work is they'll just automatically look up the names vs the domain and what they'll do is they'll

87
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:51,040
ping the e-mails server over and over again to see which e-mails actually exist on that server.

88
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,000
So it actually can save a lot of time by looking for what are called M-x records.

89
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,570
Then also it has a massive public database of all the other ones that have worked in the past.

90
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,900
A lot of times you types in again somebody else search that person's email Well it'll automatically

91
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,250
find it if they found it before.

92
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,880
All right so there's a few different ways you can hunt down someone's email address but if all else

93
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,220
fails if you've made contact with a reporter before you can always just politely ask if you haven't

94
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,110
engaged with them before then well I'd try one of the techniques I've just mentioned earlier.

95
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,190
Now once you have their e-mail address then you need to write something.

96
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,570
And that's what we'll start talking about in our next lecture.

97
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:23,980
See the.
