Hey guys, long time no see.
1

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.410
Not really, I just like saying that. Hopefully, you 
guys have a better feel for Google Analytics
2

3
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.800
now and you've been able to poke around 
and find stuff out about your own website.
3

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.310
As I said at the end of the last lecture, this lecture
is going to be all about goals, setting them up
4

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.220
and then understanding how to use them effectively.
5

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.540
So let's get our goals on.
6

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.590
OK, so we'll start on the Audience Overview page, because 
as I said in the last lecture, this is where Google Analytics
7

8
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.550
always starts you.
8

9
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.450
This time we're going to head 
up to the Administration tab.
9

10
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.200
Here we see three sections, we have Account, Property,
and View. We're looking for Goals, which is right here
10

11
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.370
in the View section.
11

12
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.050
Now, click on that and you can see my laziness
in all its official glory, since I don't actually have
12

13
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.910
any goals set up. At this point, it should be fairly 
obvious what the next step is, since there is a bright
13

14
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.930
red button right here that says New Goal.
14

15
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.660
Now, we're on the goal setup screen and Google gives 
us a bunch of template options and four categories,
15

16
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.650
revenue, acquisition, inquiry, engagement.
16

17
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.270
There's also a custom option toward the bottom if you need it,
17

18
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.210
but most common goal types are going 
to be in this template section.
18

19
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.300
Now, goals don't make a ton of sense for 25 days of 
ideas, unless maybe we're doing like media plays in
19

20
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.530
the engagement category, which
20

21
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.190
tell me when people play my videos.
21

22
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.380
But I actually already have that set up, because 
Wistia tells me when people play my videos.
22

23
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.570
Also, I did this for fun, so I wasn't really trying to track 
where my best sources were coming from and
23

24
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.650
how many people converted.
24

25
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.580
So instead let's pretend I'm selling some sort of 
products, since that's probably what most of you will
25

26
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.710
be doing with your business.
26

27
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.410
So under Revenue, I'll click on "Place an order" 
and scroll down and click Continue.
27

28
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.470
That takes us to the second step in the setup process, which
is goal description. We can name this whatever we want,
28

29
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.950
That takes us to the second step in the setup process, which
is goal description. We can name this whatever we want,
29

30
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.720
so let's pretend I'm Carl and I'm setting up a goal for 
tracking the sales of my sweet, sweet creampuffs.
30

31
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.270
I'm going to leave destination picked here under 
Type, because in the next section I'll type in the
31

32
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.020
URL where users will end up after 
they complete their purchase.
32

33
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.020
This is important, because it'll essentially represent 
a sale of the product, because it means they got
33

34
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.810
past the checkout page. We'll click Continue 
and we are onto the last step, goal details.
34

35
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.730
Now, this is where you plug in the 
URL where your users end up
35

36
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.770
after they complete their purchase, like I just mentioned.
I recommend assigning a value to each order,
36

37
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.180
because that will help us later on when we talk about 
things like running ads, because it will allow you to
37

38
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.510
determine whether or not these ads 
are at the end of the day profitable.
38

39
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.590
Now, lastly, we could create a funnel, which is basically 
a series of web pages on your site that your
39

40
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.710
customers have to go through 
in order to place your order.
40

41
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.720
This could look something like a product page, then a 
View Cart page, and then a checkout page, then, let's say,
41

42
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.950
like a "Thank you for your order" page or whatever 
makes sense for your site. You can add as many steps or
42

43
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.090
pages as needed.
43

44
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.590
Now, I highly recommend that you do take some time 
and set up your funnel, and this is something that
44

45
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.470
marketers for some reason refer 
to as instrumenting your funnel.
45

46
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.210
Now, why should you instrument your funnel? Well, 
because then you'll be able to see how many users get
46

47
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.260
through each step and why might that be important.
47

48
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.120
Well, let's use Carl's creampuffs as an example
48

49
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.180
one last time to illustrate why. Let's say Carl has his
site set up like the funnels example I just gave.
49

50
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.150
So his customers go to the product page for 
his creampuffs, that's step one in the funnel.
50

51
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.770
Then, after they click the "Add to cart" button, they click 
on the "View cart" button, which puts them on the
51

52
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.320
"View cart" page, that's step two. Let's say 25% of the people 
who started at step one ended up clicking through to step two.
52

53
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.280
"View cart" page, that's step two. Let's say 25% of the people 
who started at step one ended up clicking through to step two.
53

54
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.900
Now, some of those people are ready to buy Carl's 
creampuffs, so they click "Checkout," which puts them
54

55
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.330
on the next checkout page, which is step three.
55

56
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.340
Let's say maybe only another 10% of people actually 
get from step two to step three. After some
56

57
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.720
of these people put in their payment info, they click 
"Order," end up on the "Thank you" page, which is the final
57

58
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.720
step in the funnel.
58

59
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.400
And let's say 50% of people go
from step three to the final step.
59

60
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.020
Now let's just do that math really quickly.
60

61
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.020
Carry the one... That means that Carl has an overall 
conversion rate of 1.25% from step one to the final step.
61

62
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.780
Carry the one... That means that Carl has an overall 
conversion rate of 1.25% from step one to the final step.
62

63
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.860
How I got to that guys, you just multiply them all together.
63

64
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.340
Yes, I know, that was a mouthful.
64

65
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.850
Anyway, now, with this funnel instrumented, well, Carl 
doesn't have to actually do the math and Google will
65

66
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.070
give him an easy way to see how each step is performing.
66

67
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.190
Now, most importantly, though, he can 
make changes to his site in the future,
67

68
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.200
let it run for a while, and then see what kind 
of effect those changes have on his funnel.
68

69
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.370
Also, it's incredibly useful for troubleshooting, because
it might turn out that you have an abnormal
69

70
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.140
drop off in one stage,
70

71
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.860
therefore you should focus your effort on fixing that 
page. And that's pretty much it for setting up goals.
71

72
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:05.280
therefore you should focus your effort on fixing that 
page. And that's pretty much it for setting up goals.
72

73
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.340
One quick thing you should know about it is, when you 
set up a new goal, it'll only track data after you set it up.
73

74
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.060
One quick thing you should know about it is, when you 
set up a new goal, it'll only track data after you set it up.
74

75
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.070
In other words, Google won't display any past information, 
even though they know the information to have access to it.
75

76
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.960
In other words, Google won't display any past information, 
even though they know the information to have access to it.
76

77
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.960
It drives me crazy.
77

78
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.770
But, of course, you can't really complain 
too much, because Google Analytics is free.
78

79
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.390
OK, guys, off to the last lecture in this section.
79

80
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.110
I will see you then.
