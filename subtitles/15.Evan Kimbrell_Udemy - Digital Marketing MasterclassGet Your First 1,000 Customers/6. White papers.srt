00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,150
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,770
So now that we've established what landing pages are and you know checked the last few lectures and

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,520
you honestly need a reminder at this point let's discuss what we're going to create to attract people

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,580
to those landing pages and to get them to take action.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,700
Our hope in creating these landing pages or our goal is probably going to be we want to collect the

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,820
leads so we can then sell to later.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,670
To get leads we need people to fill out a form with their personal information.

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:32,370
At the very least their email address and to compel them to do that specifically will we need to offer

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,760
them something in return.

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,240
We need to create something of value to the audience we're trying to attract something that will help

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:45,410
them make a decision understand a concept better and make us look like experts at the same time.

12
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,810
Basically we need to create a lead magnet.

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,040
Now as a reminder a lead magnet is a piece of content we create that attracts people you know like a

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,980
magnet to a landing page and that we give away in exchange for some personal information and information

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,380
allows us to sell them whatever our stuff is later usually then send them newsletters or promotional

16
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:04,830
stuff.

17
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,570
So there are four types of lead magnets.

18
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:12,180
I'm going to cover in this lecture and then the next lectures and each one offers a different format

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,000
with different ways to show off your expertise and value.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,200
Now they are white papers e-books email courses and webinars.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,030
It'll be up to you to pick which one you think you can pull off and which one fits your business the

22
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:24,830
best.

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,240
So let's get started.

24
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:31,770
So the first I believe that we're going to cover here are white papers so white papers are well researched

25
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,920
written pieces created for customers to address key questions or points relevant to their business.

26
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,970
They're usually written in a more formal tone and they have a structure that includes a summary at the

27
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:42,480
beginning.

28
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:49,830
They state a problem and a solution and include data graphs and some written analysis along the way

29
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,890
to help prove some point or some series of points.

30
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,340
Now in the end most of them are in the neighborhood of let's say 10 to 15 pages long.

31
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,990
They're usually offered as PTF.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,300
Now that's not to say that you might see longer ones there are ones that will be 50 pages but you rarely

33
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:13,650
see one that's for no recook example evolved media this white paper about backup and disaster recovery

34
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,400
super sexy content.

35
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,800
When you arrive on this landing page for it on their site you get a short description of the white paper

36
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,930
and in this case there's no form to fill out to get it you just click the button below that opens a

37
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,640
nicely designed PTF which if you scroll through it kind of looks like a chapter from a book.

38
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,270
Flat out nice and it's easy to read and it'll look nice if you print it out.

39
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:39,240
So what's so special about the white paper format specifically what benefits does it offer that something

40
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,870
else wouldn't.

41
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,910
For one thing white papers can help establish what's called Thought leadership meaning it can cast you

42
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,740
as an expert in whatever the papers about you've done the research you've produced your findings so

43
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,660
people should come to you with questions and new business.

44
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,720
You can also reinforce your recommendations and findings in white papers with customer success stories.

45
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:04,410
So if they use your product to succeed then you look supersmart white papers also provide a lot of detail

46
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:09,120
in one place for prospective customers about a pain point or a common problem they have.

47
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,140
They don't have to dig around Google or through multiple blog posts.

48
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,500
Instead they can download a white paper which gives them ideas on how to fix whatever problem they're

49
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,900
specifically facing.

50
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,140
Another benefit for you is that white papers are usually so rich with information and detail that they

51
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,830
can use to create other types of content you can repurpose them pretty easily.

52
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:32,070
You can take excerpts from and create blog post social media images or tweets and if you can use those

53
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,450
things that promote the white paper as well.

54
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,690
So Ghana has its own marketing built into it by design why papers are designed to get downloaded and

55
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,710
or printed so they should serve as a reference materials over a long period of time.

56
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,390
Every time someone goes back to it your name and you are all are constantly going to be plastered all

57
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,510
over it or it should be.

58
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,460
So they'll come back to you later for more expertise.

59
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,430
So in that sense a kind of a double whammy.

60
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:56,730
Right.

61
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,310
Like get their information so you can contact them.

62
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,270
But then also if they do end up reading it they'll assume you're an expert and if they need you they'll

63
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,620
come out of the woods for you.

64
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,340
Now here's another example the white paper that's worth checking out.

65
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:13,860
Now a place called Data Ramah data over me I to dinner on a published this white paper on Seven Steps

66
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,290
to an integrated marketing analytics strategy.

67
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,090
And what does it data Ramah make a marketing analytics platform.

68
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,800
So it makes a lot of sense that they write a piece that offers helpful information about the concept

69
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,160
of integrated marketing analytics and they give you the steps to take to use it in your business.

70
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,930
But part of these steps include using the tool they offer so not only is this an educational reference

71
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,090
time piece but it's also a Trojan horse type of promotion.

72
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:46,140
Yes I know this one might sound like a listicle But what makes it a white paper is just generally that

73
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,080
it's going to be more databased and it's going to be a hell of a lot longer than a listicle.

74
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,590
So I would imagine each individual piece of the seven is multiple pages.

75
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:59,340
Now you can see they wrote this to get leads but also you know to get sales.

76
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,730
Now does every white paper have to be educational and promotional.

77
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,000
Now not really that's actually up to you.

78
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,240
Sometimes it's just nice to offer help with information as a way of establishing you're an expert makes

79
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,090
you look good.

80
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,580
But if there's a logical not to use sales the way of including your own product or service in there

81
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,270
as well why not just start to think of it from the reader's point of view.

82
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:24,150
If your white paper addresses a problem and the only solution presented is your product then people

83
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,910
might feel like they're just repeating a gigantic brochure.

84
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,230
So in terms of topics why papers work really well when they focus on a problem like how can I start

85
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,240
using analytics in my marketing decision making.

86
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,420
They can also be used to describe the benefits of a type of product or solution.

87
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:44,100
If you've created a social media scheduling app and you know all the benefits of how an app like that

88
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,780
can help social media managers for example.

89
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,640
So how can you create a White Paper.

90
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,220
Well in the next hour we'll discuss the steps you can take and some tools and templates out there to

91
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,570
save you a lot of time.

92
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,440
All right guys see the.
