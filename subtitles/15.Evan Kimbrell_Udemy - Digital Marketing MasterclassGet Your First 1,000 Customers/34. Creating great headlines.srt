00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,220
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,360
So in our last lecture I gave you some really great tips on how to write better pat myself on the backs.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,340
Great tips.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,580
I mean you probably finished watching and wrote like 20 blog posts just right after you are done or

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,000
not.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,390
Either way good for you.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,270
But in this lecture I want to talk about an element that can really make or break your content and it's

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,410
surprisingly simple.

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,450
It's the part of your content that anyone who reads it will see first and you can guess what I'm talking

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:27,750
about.

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,310
Talking about the headline The title of your post or the headline is extremely important.

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,980
I'm going to say that right up front because honestly if you don't do a good job of creating a headline

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:44,370
you're really just doing your blog post before you even trying to promote it or your video or whatever

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,630
it is that you're creating that kind of freaks you out then good.

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,010
I want you to always remember this point your headline needs to be good but when I see your headline

16
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,990
needs to be good I don't mean it needs to be like the greatest bunch of words ever strung together by

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,800
a human being.

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,580
What I mean is that your headline needs to work.

19
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,800
Now the job of a headline is to grab the interest of your audience and to compel them to read your content.

20
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:07,800
That's it right.

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,060
Get your attention and make them want to read what you've got.

22
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,360
If your headline can do those two things and generally it's successful.

23
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,830
So the real creativity and strategy here comes from figuring out how to grab the audience's interest

24
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,710
and how to compel them to click through and read your work.

25
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,260
Those are the points I'm going to share with you right now.

26
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,600
First of all when you're creating a headline just get to the point.

27
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,510
There's this old saying that the simplest solution is often the best solution and that really does apply

28
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,910
here.

29
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,970
Think simple.

30
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,530
Figure out what's the main point of your content.

31
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,680
The simplest description of what your content is about is usually a great place to start.

32
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,350
When creating a headline of a size that you start there.

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,140
Don't.

34
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,370
Isn't there a really simple thing called.

35
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,710
This is an article about 10 things to do with your new apps.

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,090
No one's going to click that but use it as a baseline.

37
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,480
So if you wrote a post about lessons you learned from say attending an Android app development conference

38
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,230
and you wanted to tell a friend about it and the simplest way possible what would you tell them.

39
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,170
Probably.

40
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,770
It's a blog post about lessons I learned that the Android App Development Conference.

41
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,100
So guess what.

42
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,510
You should probably call the post.

43
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,620
Maybe lessons learned from the Android App Development Conference.

44
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,960
It's really not that hard is it just don't overthink it.

45
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,760
Getting to the point in your headline is the best way to get across of the value your content has to

46
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,620
offer.

47
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,470
Don't make them think too much when they read your headline.

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,330
Your decision to click on your headline needs to be instantaneous so be as clear as possible.

49
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,650
Part of getting to that point where there are headlines to let readers know what value your content

50
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,000
has to offer or promise value in your headline.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,180
Let them know exactly what they'll get when they read it.

52
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,590
This is especially relevant for a post where you write about ways to do things or options for people

53
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,540
to consider.

54
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,460
In the end you could be providing details about how to install an app or might deliver an opinion that

55
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,660
helps your audience make a choice about that on a web hosting.

56
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,260
Any time you see a headline that starts with how to or best ways to.

57
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,550
Well you know exactly what kind of value you'll get if you click through.

58
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,470
So try your best to communicate the pieces value clearly in the headline.

59
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,820
In fact promise that value as early as possible.

60
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,420
Research has shown that when people see the value at the beginning of a headline they'll click More

61
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,700
often than when it's buried at the middle of the sentence or the end of the headline.

62
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,770
So for instance installing your sink in five minutes would be more effective than how to quickly install

63
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,470
your sync.

64
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,460
So state your offer or your value early and grab the reader's attention.

65
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,300
Now a great way to be clear with your headline is include any important or relevant details.

66
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,890
Another headline tip for you.

67
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,920
Specific detail is much more valuable than some kind of vague statement.

68
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,910
Numbers are great to include in headlines because for one thing they're not words.

69
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,480
Human eyes spots any differences so in the case of headlines numbers really jump out to you.

70
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,090
Yes I know there's some grammar nazis out there who don't like seeing numbers in headlines but the game

71
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:57,660
has changed.

72
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,880
I'm sorry for listicle numbers give that expectation of how long the piece will be so whether it's the

73
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,900
top ten ways to cook carrots or 68 prising uses for an eraser.

74
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,240
That's all weird on the reader knows how much time they'll take to read but numbers could also represent

75
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:17,070
data in the headline which is also a great way to communicate why you should care about this article.

76
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:23,100
For example how I reduced email bounce rates by 90 percent is way more powerful the headline than just

77
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:29,460
how I reduced email bounce rates that 90 percent provides a real number that helps the reader understand

78
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,010
the degree of value they can get from this piece.

79
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:38,190
All right so far I've mentioned temp's like get to the point promis value include any important relevant

80
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,090
details.

81
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,850
Those three basic ideas are the foundation of every good headline so make sure that you're following

82
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,630
them.

83
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,430
There's one other chap about headline that's entirely based on data and research and that tip is to

84
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,430
keep your headline between six and 10 words long.

85
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,560
Now I don't like to put limits on content.

86
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,040
I'm a big fan of taking as much time as you need to provide that value people are looking.

87
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,140
And since you're still watching these lectures I know you know what I'm talking about.

88
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,220
But when it comes deadlines restricting yourself to this range of six to 10 words is actually a good

89
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:09,810
idea.

90
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,650
And here is why there's been a ton of research done by different places on the effect emissive headlines

91
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,060
what works and what doesn't.

92
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,020
People have looked at thousands upon thousands of headlines and click through rates and shares and all

93
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,860
that stuff.

94
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,600
Most of the data tells us that headlines between six and 10 words get clicked on engage with more often

95
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,260
than others.

96
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,360
But wait there's more research also tells us that when people evaluate headlines you know that fraction

97
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,500
of a second when they look at the search result or a title that pops up in their Facebook feed they

98
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,140
usually look at the first three words of a headline and the last three words kind of like the way you

99
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,890
read sentences apparently don't read the letters in the middle of the words read the beginning and the

100
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,250
end of the words you drop the middles you can actually read them fine.

101
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,010
That kind of a fun experiment but it actually works.

102
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,060
Now if we assume it's true that you only read the first three and the last three in headline then you

103
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,000
know what that means for headlines that are six words long.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,250
People read the entire thing for headlines that are ten words long and they might skim more miss some

105
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,370
of the middle few words.

106
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,770
Someone interesting right.

107
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:11,380
So if you read a headline that's like 16 words long say the Top Ten Ways to Use Google Analytics find

108
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,290
customers in other parts of the world.

109
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:18,850
Well a lot of people might just see the top 10 ways and maybe parts of the world.

110
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:24,630
But everything in between that is a blur and therefore the meaning of the article is completely lost.

111
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,500
Remember we all make these decisions really fast if something takes more time than something else we

112
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,480
usually opt for the quicker shorter route.

113
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,770
It's human nature.

114
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,460
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,860
So do what you can do to stick to this recommendation six to 10 words to create your headline.

116
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,750
That's it.

117
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,900
Now about that research we talked about before.

118
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,080
You know where people evaluate thousands of headlines looking for trends and such.

119
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,700
Well there's a few other insights that I can share with you and we can pull from that data.

120
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,430
Research has shown that headlines with positive adjectives attract more clicks than headlines without

121
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:54,760
them.

122
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,330
What's a positive adjective.

123
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,710
Things like bestor biggest or even great.

124
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,520
Those words are positive in nature.

125
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,060
The opposites of course are things like worst or smallest or terrible.

126
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,390
Those are negative adjectives.

127
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:10,450
Part of the human nature we talked about is to seek out positive content and data shows people click

128
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,060
headlines and positive actions more than others.

129
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,110
So in your case add some positive and interesting touches to your headlines.

130
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,170
If you're writing about a client's success story the subject is already positive in nature.

131
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:26,090
But if you're writing about like five mistakes you've made with clients and lessons you've learned.

132
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,760
Highlight the positive angle here.

133
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,730
Something like five surprising lessons learned from my client.

134
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,850
Now here's another idea that you can try out a few onto your post.

135
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,060
Answer an important question.

136
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,510
Try making your headline the question by asking a question in your headline you're offering something

137
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,280
different so you actually cast some attention.

138
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,790
Just make sure whatever question you ask actually gets answered in the post.

139
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,970
Here's an example.

140
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,970
What is our title said.

141
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,780
What does Google's algorithm change mean for marketers.

142
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,800
Well this tells you what the content is about.

143
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,470
It's a recent change Google's algorithm it tells you it's for marketers.

144
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:01,220
It also tells you that we're answering an important question in it you'll find the answer inside without

145
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,660
being said.

146
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:06,630
Another good idea for your headlines is try to make them somewhat of a teaser.

147
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,120
Now not only is he not a fan of people who make headlines that seem mysterious for no reason.

148
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,970
But sometimes it can be interesting if you twist it slightly.

149
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:21,100
So for example if you write a headline like how one changed my writing process saved my blog people

150
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,070
might wonder what changed.

All they know is it's about writing for a blog if they have a blog they want to save or keep running.

152
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,610
Well perhaps we'll check it out and click the title.

153
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:38,320
Word of warning please do not do this repeatedly because then when people look at your page for all

154
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,270
your posts it just looks like a ton of crap that's just tons of click and do all these things that are

155
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,190
best used in moderation.

156
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,380
If you keep using it it loses its magic.

157
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,220
Now be careful and not get too mysterious or try to be too clever with your headlines.

158
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,870
If you're not sure.

159
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:59,620
Show the title to someone and just ask them to tell you what they think it is and if they are in their

160
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,930
perfect world would click on it or they hate people.

161
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:07,610
You can try to coast schedule headline analyzed or put it the resources will throw it up here.

162
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,280
It's a page where you can just go and plug in your title and they'll evaluate it for things like length

163
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,650
clarity in other ways.

164
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,770
Us human beings look at these headlines.

165
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,850
It works pretty well.

166
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,660
Either way a different perspective sometimes helps to show you're not as clever as you think you are.

167
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,960
But don't worry none of us really are.

168
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,230
So when in doubt default back to those original three tips I gave you for writing headlines.

169
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,210
Get to the point.

170
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,910
Promise your value and include any important relevant details.

171
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:37,990
You follow those three tips and maybe sprinkle in some of the other strategies from time to time the

172
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:43,540
optional ones like including positive adjectives and trying some questions in your title you might have

173
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,800
some really interesting headlines that are in the worst case scenario they're still effective.

174
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,620
All right that's it.

175
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,180
Go away.

176
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,310
I'll see you in the next lecture.
