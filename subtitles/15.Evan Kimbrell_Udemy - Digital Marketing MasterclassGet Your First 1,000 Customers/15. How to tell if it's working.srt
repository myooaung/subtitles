00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,710
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,160
All right.

3
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,770
So we've reached the point where we've talked about pretty much all the ways to improve as you know

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,250
as of the other ways but these are kind of the best practices and the standard ones you need to know.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,030
But now we want to know how can we tell if what we're doing is even paying off at all.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,340
So as I say I want to talk about the ways we can tell if your efforts are working at all.

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,510
First off understand that as CEO efforts just take a lot of time.

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:28,020
I said this before you're not going to see results overnight and you're probably not going to see them

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,180
in a week.

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,470
And it may potentially take months.

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,850
So be patient but keep at it.

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,510
They're continuously publishing new articles and posts and other things on their site.

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,910
Well that's going to help quite a bit now by all means feel free to go into Google Analytics and see

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,890
what's happening.

15
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,340
You've already got data from previous things you published that can give you a good baseline starting

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,180
point but after a few weeks perhaps a month you could start checking these things out.

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,670
Now first let's look at the organic traffic to your site.

18
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,490
Go to Google Analytics acquisition and it's under all traffic and source medium.

19
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:03,090
Now organic traffic is the number of people checking out each page and it's generated by people finding

20
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,620
you through Google clicking on a link to you from another site or typing in your your l.

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,370
That does not include traffic from any page search efforts.

22
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,710
So if you're publishing articles and posts and the promotion of these pages is good you should see an

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,470
increase in organic traffic.

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,620
Next you should check out the number of referrals to your site.

25
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,870
Now go to acquisition.

26
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,840
All traffic and referrals.

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,010
When people link to you from another site well that's a referral.

28
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:35,130
And those are great things to get if you're publishing good stuff that other people like and appreciate.

29
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,890
Then you should see more referrals.

30
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,020
You also look at how you're performing for specific keywords.

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,500
For example you can look at the list of keywords people are using to find you.

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,320
So this way you do this is just go to acquisition search cons. And then queries.

33
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,550
Now this view of the stats includes numbers for keyword rankings so you view them over time you might

34
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,870
see an improvement for the ones you're focusing on track your performance over time for your important

35
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,520
keywords.

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,200
Google can provide you with the downloadable report to track keywords as well.

37
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,080
You just need to sign into your AdWords account assuming you create one being one it takes two seconds

38
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,730
add words on Google dot com.

39
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:14,520
And then what we want to do is just go to campaigns and keywords then adjust the date range filters.

40
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,620
Any other info you want in your report and click the download button.

41
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,440
Now if your efforts are working then over time you should see improvement for the key words you're targeting

42
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,860
now to get a kind of overall view of performance.

43
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,300
It helps take into account the specific dates when you started making changes and updates to the site.

44
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,800
Essentially any technical changes you might have put in place you might see an uptick in certain metrics

45
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,890
things to improve SightSpeed or by implementing a site map might also be useful to rerun any diagnostics

46
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,900
you might have run like SightSpeed reports to see if your site is any faster than before.

47
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,240
Now the numbers and metrics will be the final judge of success.

48
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,950
Every website and business is different so you have to know how you'll measure success as you're going

49
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,660
through the numbers certain numbers will mean more to you than other people out there.

50
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,740
So get into the habit of reviewing your performance on a regular basis understanding how you're doing.

51
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,730
Set a regular calendar reminder to go through stats every I don't know Tuesday morning for example and

52
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,360
the staff will be there when you need them.

53
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,010
But the more regularly you review them the quicker you can make the changes for the better.

54
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,900
Now the idea of checking every Tuesday to see where you are in the rankings for all your keywords drives

55
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,490
you crazy drives me crazy.

56
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,780
There are actually some tools out there that do that rank scanner.

57
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,590
There's a free version type in your key words and I'll track them for you.

58
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,980
There's other ones like SERPs dot com and maws dot com.

59
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,090
Also if you sign up for theirs I'm not sure it's in their free version.

60
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,170
But same thing.

61
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,520
You can tell which keywords you care about.

62
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,290
It'll track how you're doing over time.

63
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:36,660
Are you guys.

64
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,620
That's it for this lecture.

65
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,600
I'll see the next one.
