Hey guys, welcome to the course.
1

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.050
Welcome to the obligatory course overview lecture.
2

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.430
So the next minute or so I'm going to go over
what we cover in the course and in what order,
3

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.230
so you should know what to expect.
4

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.000
OK.
5

6
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.880
The way this works is pretty logical.
6

7
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:23.850
We start off with really small scale, manual effort,
low kind of return on effort opportunities, and then
7

8
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.390
we slowly transition across the course towards the
end, where we're focusing on long term, big picture
8

9
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.900
and potentially big return on investment opportunities.
In the first section, we're going to focus on catching
9

10
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.460
everyone up to speed, we're going to
cover some basic marketing concepts.
10

11
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.190
Mainly, we're going to focus on growth channels, also
known as traction channels, then we'll talk a little bit about
11

12
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.900
acquisition and saturation, and we'll talk a little bit
more about how the course is going to work. In
12

13
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.440
the next section, what we're going to do is we're going
to work on planning a strategy. Now, a strategy is meant
13

14
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:04.290
to work for you, who you are, what your business is,
what you're interested in, and it's going to help you
14

15
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.260
kind of figure out who your target market is going
to be. Now, that section is completely optional. If
15

16
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.950
you guys feel like you have a good idea of who your customer
is, you've already done, let's say, user personas, skip it.
16

17
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.980
you guys feel like you have a good idea of who your customer
is, you've already done, let's say, user personas, skip it.
17

18
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.640
you guys feel like you have a good idea of who your customer
is, you've already done, let's say, user personas, skip it.
18

19
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.780
Next section, what we do is called "Get your 10"
19

20
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.330
and that's where we're going to focus
on really, really manual effort,
20

21
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.420
easy to do strategies that potentially could work today
for you. And so we're going to focus on things like Twitter,
21

22
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.760
easy to do strategies that potentially could work today
for you. And so we're going to focus on things like Twitter,
22

23
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.470
easy to do strategies that potentially could work today
for you. And so we're going to focus on things like Twitter,
23

24
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.290
we're going to use community groups like Reddit,
24

25
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.780
we'll use Hacker News, we'll use Meetup, things like that.
25

26
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.030
Then what we do is we move on to "Get your 100,"
where we focus on, again, community groups,
26

27
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.540
but this time we're going to expand it to things like Product Hunt, we're going to use Hacker News, we're going to go back to Reddit,
27

28
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.310
and then we'll get into emerging platforms, then we're
going to do Instagram, then we're going to do Snapchat.
28

29
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.440
After that, we have a section called "Take a break."
29

30
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.400
That's where we take a break to make sure that everyone
is caught up to speed with how to use Google Analytics
30

31
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.340
or an analytics offer of your choice.
31

32
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.000
Just got to make sure that we're capturing all the
information we have and we understand how to analyze it.
32

33
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.230
Just got to make sure that we're capturing all the
information we have and we understand how to analyze it.
33

34
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.790
Then, after that, we go into "Get your 500," where we
first start off with how to get press for your business,
34

35
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:19.200
then we move on to content marketing, we'll cover things like
guest blogging, writing your own posts, making microsites,
35

36
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.610
then we move on to content marketing, we'll cover things like
guest blogging, writing your own posts, making microsites,
36

37
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.740
then we'll move on to video marketing, how to actually
make your first video and use that either as an
37

38
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.740
ad, or an explainer, or as anything, like a walkthrough,
as a complement to your content strategy.
38

39
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.980
Then we round out that section
with landing pages and lead magnets.
39

40
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.230
Then, the final section, what we do is SEO and SEM.
40

41
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:46.420
Those are the biggest, most time-heavy,
longest horizon type strategies,
41

42
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.080
and that's why we end with those.
42

43
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.100
OK, guys, I hope you're excited for this.
43

44
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.690
It's going to be a long journey, but at the end of it, trust me,
you're going to learn an enormous amount of information.
44

45
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.640
It's going to be a long journey, but at the end of it, trust me,
you're going to learn an enormous amount of information.
45

46
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.100
All right. Ready?
46

47
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.550
All right. Ready?
47

48
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.500
See you in the next lecture.
