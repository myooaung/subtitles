00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.270
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.750
So in the last lecture we covered the best
practices for reaching out to your network.
2

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.930
Your network is any group of people
you can contact and get a response from.
3

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.790
Yes, you do have a network, and there is a way to
do it without feeling like a complete spammer.
4

5
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.290
Now, I know a lot of you out there have
trouble connecting this to actually doing it.
5

6
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.810
It's one thing to just say "contact them with these best
practices" and it's another thing to actually see it.
6

7
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.290
It's one thing to just say "contact them with these best
practices" and it's another thing to actually see it.
7

8
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.040
So that's what we're going to do in this lecture,
we're going to practice writing that e-mail.
8

9
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.620
So let's get to work constructing our message. Remember,
9

10
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.020
we have a list and it's made up of different types of people.
10

11
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.250
Number one, it's people that we have contacted
recently, as in as soon as six months ago.
11

12
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.010
Number two, it's people that don't club baby seals
for fun. Number three, it's people who are remotely
12

13
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.680
relevant to what you're doing, remotely
relevant. Now, to get this started,
13

14
00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:03.060
as we've suggested prior, we're going to whip out an
email. Open up a Gmail, Apple Mail, or invent a time
14

15
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.220
machine, go back to the 90s and open up a Hotmail.
If any of you have taken any of my other courses,
15

16
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.450
you probably remember the three tenants of cold emailing.
16

17
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.600
Now, in this exercise, we're not exactly cold emailing,
because they know you, so it wouldn't be cold, but
17

18
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.200
they're not all going to be your best friend from forever,
18

19
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.080
so it's kind of like lukewarm emailing. But it's worth
a refresher on those tenants, because those cold
19

20
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.100
emailing principles are going to
help us pretty much the same here.
20

21
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.940
Now, there were three of them.
21

22
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.730
One was that you have to keep it short, two was you
have to make sure that the email is personalized,
22

23
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.400
and number three, you have to make sure it explicitly
lays out how it might be valuable to them.
23

24
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.550
In this case, we follow the first two rules religiously,
but the last one isn't completely necessary, because
24

25
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.090
the dynamic is a little bit different, and if you do
it wrong, it almost sounds like you're trying to
25

26
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.510
sell it to them and convince them it's
going to help them, and it's not necessary.
26

27
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.800
Now, the first thing, like always,
is going to be your subject line.
27

28
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.770
In this case, the person we are emailing presumably
is open to receiving email and will open regardless,
28

29
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.030
so there's really no sense in
writing "I'M ON FIRE" in all caps.
29

30
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.000
so there's really no sense in
writing "I'M ON FIRE" in all caps.
30

31
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.990
Since the stakes here are low, there are
really a lot of different ways to do this.
31

32
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.720
I personally would suggest you write something that
refers to you or uses a personal pronoun and sounds
32

33
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.960
like you are merely updating them on your life.
33

34
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:35.370
No, I don't mean "Re: That talk we had," I mean
something like "My new project" or "My new business."
34

35
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.220
What I would not suggest doing is something like
"Checking in," because that's almost kind of like a Trojan
35

36
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.750
horse email, where they think they're going to check in,
36

37
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.970
but really you're just loading their computer up with malware.
37

38
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.350
The point is, you don't want that mismatch between what
they think the email is and what it actually ends up being,
38

39
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.830
The point is, you don't want that mismatch between what
they think the email is and what it actually ends up being,
39

40
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.920
because that's what comes off as disingenuous.
40

41
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.160
Also, on a similar token, I wouldn't
suggest saying something like,
41

42
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.580
"Need your help," because it signals you might need
actual help, which could be misconstrued or it could
42

43
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.020
actually deter people from opening the email.
43

44
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.060
It's a sad fact, but true.
44

45
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.360
They might not open it if they think it's
going to then ask them to do something.
45

46
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.170
OK, so go with whatever makes sense to you.
46

47
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.350
Just don't mislead them as to what's in the actual body
of the email and don't scream that you need help.
47

48
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.800
Just don't mislead them as to what's in the actual body
of the email and don't scream that you need help.
48

49
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.800
All right, so in the actual body of the email
we need to start off in a personal way.
49

50
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.800
If you opened an email, even if it was from one
of your friends, and the first line was trying to sell
50

51
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.340
you beef jerky, well, you wouldn't be thrilled about
it, even if it was your friend and even if you really
51

52
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.280
did like beef jerky. The best thing I would suggest doing
is one of a number of things. You could mention
52

53
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.220
something about the last time you connected,
53

54
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.450
and if you can't remember, just try to look it up.
54

55
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.760
and if you can't remember, just try to look it up.
55

56
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.020
You could throw in a personal anecdote.
56

57
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.300
"Hey, remember that knee slapper of
a joke John told about killing his wife?"
57

58
00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.200
Mention that. If you know of something they did and
something that they would also remember, well then try
58

59
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.690
to mention that - a vacation, a promotion, a change in job,
59

60
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.790
a child, whatever. Do any number of these things, but
make sure you open briefly with something personal
60

61
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.110
that you can actually connect on.
61

62
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.980
I'm talking 2-3 sentences short, and by
the way, just saying "Hope all is well" -
62

63
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.680
I'm talking 2-3 sentences short, and by
the way, just saying "Hope all is well" -
63

64
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.790
come on, that's just way too lazy.
64

65
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.920
You know you can do better.
65

66
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.500
OK, so that is paragraph number one.
66

67
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.080
You are reminding them that you care enough
to contact them and you're getting some
67

68
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.680
"Hey, this isn't an automated email blast"
out of the way. Onto paragraph number two.
68

69
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.120
Here's where we turn a little bit and start
introducing what we've been working on.
69

70
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.740
I personally would start with a sentence that
connects your business to them in some way.
70

71
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.350
Do you remember when we were talking about [...]?
71

72
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.940
Do you remember that company we talked about?
72

73
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.090
If you think hard enough, there's always
something you can tie in here.
73

74
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.270
Do you remember how much I love beef jerky?
74

75
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.680
Well, let me remind you.
75

76
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.060
I'm actually pretty impartial to beef jerky.
76

77
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.020
The point here is that you don't want to merely write
2-3 sentence of personalized "How are you doing?"
77

78
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.570
and then copy and paste your business or project
description right after that. You're not really going
78

79
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.350
to carry them over to the next paragraph,
79

80
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.470
and again, you just sound like a cheese ball.
80

81
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.220
So segue a little by introducing some relevance, then
explain what you're doing. Now, here's a word about tone.
81

82
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.120
So segue a little by introducing some relevance, then
explain what you're doing. Now, here's a word about tone.
82

83
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.460
Don't lose sight of the fact that you
are talking to a friend/acquaintance.
83

84
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.910
This is not a blog post, so write
84

85
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:37.660
the way that you specifically would speak to that person.
You speak differently to different people, unless
85

86
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.630
of course that's just me and I should be
having an existential crisis right now.
86

87
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.660
No, I think I'm good. Past that, just keep it simple.
87

88
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.190
Don't introduce jargon that they wouldn't
understand. If they're in the industry, then
88

89
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.740
OK, well, you can get away with it.
89

90
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.950
But if they're not, well, you
reasonably have to tone it down.
90

91
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.420
I generally like to do it like this.
91

92
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:04.460
Number one, I like to give them a summarized sentence
of what my business or product or project is and
92

93
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.500
attach it in a way like, "I started [...]."
93

94
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.840
"I went ahead and made [...]."
Number two, give them the latest news.
94

95
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.880
"I just sold 100 widgets. Just went live.
Just got the site done."
95

96
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.780
"I just sold 100 widgets. Just went live.
Just got the site done."
96

97
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.340
Then try to round it out with any accolades you can
mention that might make it a little more noteworthy
97

98
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.980
without sounding like you're just bragging.
98

99
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.800
"It's pretty cool. I was featured here."
99

100
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.390
"It's pretty cool. I was featured here."
100

101
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:37.770
"It was bought by X amount of people and X amount of countries."
"Got a sale with the Fortune 100 beef jerky company."
101

102
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.510
"It was bought by X amount of people and X amount of countries."
"Got a sale with the Fortune 100 beef jerky company."
102

103
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.850
Now, in the last paragraph, we're
probably at 7-10 sentences by now,
103

104
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.630
you just want to bring this home and again connect it
back to the person and try your best to articulate
104

105
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.040
why they should care.
105

106
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.690
It could be as simple as "Hey, I respect your advice.
106

107
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:59.000
Can you give me some feedback?" or "What do you
think?" or it could just be something specific to how this
107

108
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.290
might benefit them in some kind of vague way.
108

109
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.840
Really just try to get creative here.
109

110
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:09.110
The point is that there's really some currency to be
exchanged here, so don't waste the opportunity. Asking
110

111
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.100
people for their advice,
111

112
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:16.130
believe it or not, makes them feel like you care
about their opinion, even if it's not true at all.
112

113
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.750
This is also your opportunity to put
in some form of a call to action.
113

114
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.640
"Hey, can you look at this?"
114

115
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.090
"What do you think about this?"
115

116
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.720
"Do you know anyone who would be interested in this?"
116

117
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.210
OK, so it's really quite simple.
117

118
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:32.240
2-3 sentences getting mushy and personal,
3-4 sentences saying what you're doing, what's
118

119
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.600
changed, or what's new, and what you're doing right,
119

120
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:41.000
then wrap it up with two sentences or so calling them to
do something or just reminding them why they might care.
120

121
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.810
then wrap it up with two sentences or so calling them to
do something or just reminding them why they might care.
121

122
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:42.250
Cool? Okay.
122

123
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:42.580
Cool? Okay.
123

124
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.560
It's actually quite easy.
124

125
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.810
Just open up your email and honestly try it out.
125

126
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:53.750
To give you guys a quick example of a bad version
of a cold email to your network, we'll run through
126

127
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.660
one I actually found today real quick.
127

128
00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:01.310
This is one from a site called Ladder.io and it's a good
reminder why the internet is not made of all great things.
128

129
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:02.570
This is one from a site called Ladder.io and it's a good
reminder why the internet is not made of all great things.
129

130
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.520
It goes something like this.
130

131
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:10.280
"Hey Dave, I'm selling premium dog biscuits on a subscription
for $50/month, taking 20 pre-orders at that price.
131

132
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.230
"Hey Dave, I'm selling premium dog biscuits on a subscription
for $50/month, taking 20 pre-orders at that price.
132

133
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.650
PayPal me $50 at example@email.com if you want in.
133

134
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.380
Know anybody else that would be interested?
134

135
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.820
Feel free to forward this email.
Any questions? Just hit reply."
135

136
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:28.190
Yes, that is an actual example template that
was actually suggested by someone.
136

137
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:34.490
There's no personalization, no mention of our relationship,
and not even the broadest attempt to explain
137

138
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.910
why I might care about doggy biscuits.
138

139
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.930
Does he think everyone cares about said doggy biscuits?
139

140
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.360
Like I'm going to flip my desk right
now and run to my wallet
140

141
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.160
because you said doggy biscuits.
141

142
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.740
And then the next part is obviously just wow.
142

143
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:55.730
No justification of why it's great or interesting, no
description of the product, and seriously he's using
143

144
00:08:55.730 --> 00:09:04.190
that pre-order limit trick for his friends. 20 orders and
what? The world can't supply 21 one dog biscuit bags?
144

145
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.970
that pre-order limit trick for his friends. 20 orders and
what? The world can't supply 21 one dog biscuit bags?
145

146
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.730
Seriously Dave, you're number 21. Sorry, get lost.
146

147
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:08.300
Seriously Dave, you're number 21. Sorry, get lost.
147

148
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.090
Seriously Dave, you're number 21. Sorry, get lost.
148

149
00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.380
OK, I think you get the point.
149

150
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:15.170
We really don't need to dive in any more
to explain why that one is just awful.
150

151
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:15.830
It's brief,
151

152
00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:20.750
yes, but there's no personal touch, and you can kind of tell
by the tone of this that the writer probably despises Dave.
152

153
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.310
yes, but there's no personal touch, and you can kind of tell
by the tone of this that the writer probably despises Dave.
153

154
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.620
Whatever he did, we can only imagine.
154

155
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.690
OK, so you got the tools, you know what to do,
open up your email client and get started.
155

156
00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.770
If you're stuck, post in a Slack group.
156

157
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.470
Otherwise, I'll see you in the next lecture.
