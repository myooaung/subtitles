00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,700
All right guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,180
Now, we've spent our last lecture talking 
about how to do a Snapchat takeover.
2

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:10,980
That's just a tactic that a bunch of brands 
have used to try and raise the profile of 
3

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,790
their Snapchat account and their brand, relatively 
easy to pull off, you just have to find someone
4

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,240
in your space that has a lot of followers on there
5

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:27,990
and usually it's better if you just go for low profile, 
medium profile influencers that are directly
6

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,630
relevant and most likely willing to do this.
7

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,070
Now, there's another way you can attract new users 
and get attention, and that is, well, giving away stuff.
8

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:35,580
Now, there's another way you can attract new users 
and get attention, and that is, well, giving away stuff.
9

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,300
So, in this lecture, we're going to discuss 
how you can run a Snapchat promotion.
10

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,430
So first off, promotions come in a bunch of different flavors.
11

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,010
It's important to know the differences.
12

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,370
Now, you could give away a prize to a random user,
13

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,840
this is what we call a giveaway.
14

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,400
You can also give away a prize to a user you choose 
based on some criteria or skill, like best comment,
15

16
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,950
funniest video or a selfie, whatever it is,
16

17
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,550
and this is called a contest.
17

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,640
You could also just post a code or a coupon 
directly on your account and have anyone use it,
18

19
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,630
and technically, well, this is just known 
as marketing or sales promotions.
19

20
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,550
It's not really the same thing.
20

21
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,680
And while it's not technically in this 
family of tactics, we'll circle back to it later.
21

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,720
So for now let's talk about running 
a contest or running a giveaway.
22

23
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,780
So why run a contest or a giveaway?
23

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,670
Well, because you can generate some 
excitement by giving something away.
24

25
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,710
People generally like free stuff.
25

26
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,970
Sometimes it takes some old school bribing to 
get people to pay attention or take some action.
26

27
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,990
The hope is that once they do that thing, like, connect, 
or buy your stuff, well, then they'll discover, "Oh
27

28
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:40,950
wow, this is actually pretty cool, maybe I'll tell people about it, 
or recommend it, or write a nice review, or whatever."
28

29
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,910
wow, this is actually pretty cool, maybe I'll tell people about it, 
or recommend it, or write a nice review, or whatever."
29

30
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,770
So let's jump into an example.
30

31
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,630
Let's say you've built a platform that helps companies 
specifically, let's say, support people track product
31

32
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,030
suggestions coming from different channels, like your health 
platform, and your Slack, and your email, and so on.
32

33
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,190
Product managers would love this. Your tool, let's say, 
helped organize and prioritize all the ideas that come in.
33

34
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,610
Product managers would love this. Your tool, let's say, 
helped organize and prioritize all the ideas that come in.
34

35
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,310
Now, in order to drum up some
interest and followers on Snapchat,
35

36
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,520
well, let's say you decided to do a giveaway. Five random 
followers will each get a free six month basic account,
36

37
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,130
whatever that is,
37

38
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,760
and that is worth sharing.
38

39
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,100
Now, let's say this is the requirement.
39

40
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,230
All people have to do is just follow you on Snapchat 
and at noon tomorrow you'll pick five people and
40

41
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,330
give them codes for, you know, the six months of access.
41

42
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,280
Easy as that.
42

43
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:22,810
If you wanted to,
43

44
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,980
you can also ask that they send a snap of 
winning it in order for them to redeem it.
44

45
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,580
So this promotion is what's known as a giveaway.
45

46
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,030
You don't require any purchase,
46

47
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,940
no extra steps beyond simply following
you on Snapchat. As a promotion,
47

48
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,100
it's very straightforward, easy to understand, and 
probably would get you more followers in a contest,
48

49
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,820
which requires people to take 
additional steps to try to win,
49

50
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:49,170
and we'll mention that in a sec. Now, the problem though 
could be that you might get a lot of people who aren't really
50

51
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:55,890
qualified, that is, don't really know anything about 
your brand or, you know, if your product would be a
51

52
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:01,140
good fit for them. Now, you'd hate to go through all of 
this effort just to give six months of service to some
52

53
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,390
random person that doesn't need it or use it.
53

54
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,890
The other problem is if you're picking a winner from 
your new followers, it's possible some of them didn't
54

55
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,230
actually follow you because of the contest.
55

56
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,720
So they might not even want the prize.
56

57
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,010
In some cases, of course, they 
would, but in others, who knows.
57

58
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,040
It is possible, is all I'm saying.
58

59
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,660
It is possible, is all I'm saying.
59

60
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,860
Now, if you wanted to do the same kind of thing, get 
new followers and give some of them a prize, but you
60

61
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,430
wanted to qualify them first,
61

62
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,860
you could do a contest.
62

63
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:31,200
A contest is where you require people to enter the promotion 
by taking an action, ideally something straightforward,
63

64
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,970
but requiring some kind of skill or thinking on their part.
64

65
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,720
It could be a free T-shirt to the funniest comment 
on the thread, or maybe it's a discount code to the
65

66
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,150
person who answers a trivia question first.
66

67
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:47,880
Maybe you do a themed contest during a holiday,
like a picture of a Halloween costume that
67

68
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,560
cleverly includes the product in it somehow.
68

69
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,020
In our earlier example of the company helping
you track user suggestions across platforms,
69

70
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,920
maybe their contest would require people to follow 
them on Snapchat and then create a snap where they
70

71
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,990
do a quick video explaining their biggest pain point or 
why they need a solution like this one in the first place.
71

72
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,420
do a quick video explaining their biggest pain point or 
why they need a solution like this one in the first place.
72

73
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:10,150
And then you pick the five best suited ones according 
to your own criteria and give them the prize.
73

74
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,250
Either way, whether you do a giveaway or a contest, you
must adhere to Snapchat's official rules on promotion.
74

75
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,910
You can and should review them for yourself,
75

76
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,510
but the long and the short of it is this.
76

77
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,170
Make it easy for people to take part in it.
77

78
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,130
Include instructions that are super easy to understand, 
and state in your rules and in any promotion that you
78

79
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:35,370
do that Snapchat has nothing to do with the contest, and 
that means don't use obviously any Snapchat logos or
79

80
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,520
names or anything like that, and don't encourage
users to do bad stuff as part of your contest.
80

81
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,200
Obviously, bad stuff being anything 
that's generally illegal or just in bad taste.
81

82
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,750
Those rules are really simple and really clear.
82

83
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,350
Number one, people might just not enter.
83

84
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,580
Maybe they just don't get it,
84

85
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,980
don't have time to figure it out, and they just pass on it.
85

86
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,330
Number two, people might get angry.
86

87
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,730
You know, why didn't I win?
87

88
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,500
I did what you asked, didn't I?
88

89
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,700
My thing is great.
89

90
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,190
Well, complainers might make you look bad as well,
90

91
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,030
so keep that in mind.
91

92
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,430
And then number three, it's an outside chance, but 
maybe you could get sued. In general, just try to avoid
92

93
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,560
this drama at all cost and just make sure that
your instructions are super clear and idiot proof.
93

94
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,390
A lot of times, contests will actually 
type out the steps 1, 2, 3 in a picture,
94

95
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,600
so it's as obvious as possible. "For a 
chance to win a FREE Pokemon T-shirt,
95

96
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,340
follow us at @PokeShirts on Snapchat 
by noon Eastern on Wednesday, April 15.
96

97
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,500
We'll pick five new followers at random and, you know, contact 
the winners for shirt size and delivery address." Whatever.
97

98
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,490
We'll pick five new followers at random and, you know, contact 
the winners for shirt size and delivery address." Whatever.
98

99
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,240
Very clear.
99

100
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,380
More detail, the better.
100

101
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,010
Now, in addition to clear instructions,
you also need official rules.
101

102
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,830
Now, rules are not the same as instructions.
102

103
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:47,280
Official rules include all the legal stuff to define the
terms of your promotion, especially to protect yourself
103

104
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,250
in case someone raises an argument of some kind.
104

105
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,400
Now, how can you create official rules? Generally 
you just have to do some basic research.
105

106
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,630
Some people go as far as to hire a lawyer.
106

107
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,600
* Better call Saul. *
107

108
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,230
I'll give you a bit of a shortcut. If you want to see what 
rules and what rules templates generally look like,
108

109
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,860
I'll give you a bit of a shortcut. If you want to see what 
rules and what rules templates generally look like,
109

110
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,740
check out Short Stack, because it created one you 
actually might be able to edit and just use it yourself.
110

111
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,060
But again, my advice is just to be careful.
111

112
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,750
So once you're ready to roll out your contest 
or giveaway, you'll need to promote it.
112

113
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,770
People need to know about it, so let them know what it's
for or when it's happening, deadlines and all the basics.
113

114
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,290
People need to know about it, so let them know what it's
for or when it's happening, deadlines and all the basics.
114

115
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,090
But - and this is important -
115

116
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,400
if you're giving away something that
involves a different brand or a company,
116

117
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,800
you cannot mention their name, unless of 
course they've given you official permission.
117

118
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:38,760
For example, if you're giving away a new Samsung Galaxy 6000 or whatever, you can't promote this as a Samsung Galaxy
118

119
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,490
giveaway, technically. You can list it as a prize,
119

120
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,850
giveaway, technically. You can list it as a prize,
120

121
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,170
that part is perfectly fine, but you can't make it look 
like Samsung or some other company is actually
121

122
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:52,080
endorsing it or putting on the contest. So make sure 
you have a plan to spread the news of this promotion
122

123
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,040
to your other channels and then on Snapchat make 
sure in the days leading up to it you do plenty of
123

124
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,690
promotion and reminders.
124

125
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,190
Want a tip?
125

126
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,450
Well, here's something that actually works 
decently well with Snapchat giveaways.
126

127
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,530
Well, here's something that actually works 
decently well with Snapchat giveaways.
127

128
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,830
You actually run a Facebook ad. 
Snapchat doesn't have ads yet,
128

129
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,440
or maybe they do when you're listening to this,
129

130
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:15,360
but you can run a Facebook ad, and since it's a 
giveaway, it generally will get a lot of attention, and
130

131
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:22,050
if you make it relevant enough, well, that's some really 
cheap sign-ups. Now, when your deadline has passed
131

132
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,040
and it's up for you to pick your winners, do that quickly 
and announce the winners, so you can maintain
132

133
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,620
the momentum that you've built up. After your promotion,
133

134
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,750
see how many followers you did get or how much website 
traffic or sales you got from a rebound from that account.
134

135
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,770
see how many followers you did get or how much website 
traffic or sales you got from a rebound from that account.
135

136
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,610
Now, did this make any impact at all?
136

137
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:41,040
You might find that the occasional promotion like 
this can even out the growth of your followers on
137

138
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,970
Snapchat and you can apply some of what you've learned 
to running promotions on other channels as well. We'll actually
138

139
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,500
talk about this with Instagram.
139

140
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,830
So one last thing.
140

141
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:53,520
Remember how I mentioned earlier you could give away 
a code or a discount and how that's basically marketing
141

142
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,540
or sales promotion?
142

143
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,230
Well, if you're freaked out by the complexity or the
legality of running a contest, you can actually just
143

144
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,050
try this one instead.
144

145
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,360
It's a lot more straightforward.
145

146
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,240
Snap a code or coupon that your followers 
can use to get a discount or a free item.
146

147
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,900
Now, here's what you could do.
147

148
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,440
You can announce on various channels at the beginning 
of the week you'll be sharing a code or coupon on
148

149
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,870
Snapchat on Wednesday, or 
Wednesday at noon, or at noon today.
149

150
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,130
Let people know when to look,
150

151
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,770
then snap and share the code.
151

152
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:23,370
Since your snap will be gone after a certain amount
of time, it's basically a limited time offer.
152

153
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,590
Make the code unique to Snapchat so you can track the 
result and make it simple so they can remember it.
153

154
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:28,760
Make the code unique to Snapchat so you can track the 
result and make it simple so they can remember it.
154

155
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,760
Not too simple though.
155

156
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,070
Don't make it obvious like SNAPCHAT, because 
obviously people will just guess that. Anyway,
156

157
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,910
see how many people use the discount code.
157

158
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,020
It's pretty easy to track when you do it that way.
158

159
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,940
If you get good results,
159

160
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,120
maybe that's the kind of promotion you could run 
periodically to get people over to Snapchat.
160

161
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,280
It's straightforward and it could work for you, especially
if you're selling a digital product with high margins.
161

162
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,730
It's straightforward and it could work for you, especially
if you're selling a digital product with high margins.
162

163
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,350
Let's be real.
163

164
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:48,870
So there you go.
164

165
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,510
There's a few ways to run promotions
on your Snapchat channel.
165

166
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,120
Good luck.
166

167
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,450
Hopefully you figure it out.
167

168
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,460
See you guys in the next lecture.
