00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.450
All right guys welcome back to the courts.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.390
Last hour four or five six lectures whatever.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.170
What are the basics of video production.

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.120
Right so you have your lighting you have your audio and then you have your video.

5
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.290
That's kind of the trifecta.

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.590
You have to figure out in order to make a good video in each case there are terms that are helpful info

7
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.430
and equipment that maybe you didn't know the name of or what it did.

8
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.790
But well now you know what comes next is figuring out which of those pieces of production equipment

9
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.370
you'll need to make your videos.

10
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.970
And this is what we're going to talk about in this lecture how to put together a production set up based

11
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.030
on your needs but especially based on your budget.

12
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.200
Now here is the kind of wonderful thing about video production.

13
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.760
No matter what kind of videos you want to create you can pretty much work with any size budget larger

14
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.020
budget to make it easier.

15
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.720
And sometimes you can make better stuff but if you're crafty and creative you can pull it off on a shoestring.

16
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.680
That was a lot of people out there doing amazing things with barely any budget but it's generally because

17
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.750
they know how to work with the stuff that they've got how to use their equipment and how to use software

18
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.570
and the fundamentals of videography.

19
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.160
But the flip side is you have people who have you know spent tens of thousands of dollars on high end

20
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.080
stuff and they make crap videos because they don't understand how to use it or really how to tell a

21
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.850
good story.

22
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.640
Well look at every crappy Michael Bay Transformers movie I think you'll see what I mean.

23
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.950
But they better stop creating them now if you can write content Well you can write a script and if you

24
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.780
can tell a story you can make videos.

25
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.400
It just takes practice to make the camera produce what you've got in your hand and greatly improve your

26
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.730
video making is honestly just to hit record.

27
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:48.350
Just start making videos try your best do not obsess over perfection just get out and try and immediately

28
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.920
you will start learning things.

29
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.800
But of course you need the equipment to get started.

30
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.050
So in this lecture I want to give you three options for three ranges of budgets.

31
00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.940
Some of you are going to want to start on the absolute lowest end possible and that's totally fine.

32
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:08.300
And so what I'm going to do is try to give my best advice for what's the absolute cheapest set up I

33
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.720
think you could potentially make good videos with.

34
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:20.210
Now what I mean the low end I try to keep it under say 500 to 1000 because it's really really hard to

35
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.360
get everything for under 500 unless you're really starting to substitute parts to the point where it's

36
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.850
getting kind of ridiculous.

37
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.490
But I can give you an ultra slim budget right up front that should be under 500.

38
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.050
But then we'll talk about a real cheap budget that's between 500000.

39
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.100
It's just in hard.

40
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.300
You have to have a camera.

41
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.850
You have to have audio.

42
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.250
You have to have lighting of some kind.

43
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.260
You're going to have to have basic accessories for like recording the audio and there's just a lot that

44
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.010
you have to get.

45
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.060
So it kind of adds up.

46
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.080
They don't know is it going to be some midrange options.

47
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.960
There going to be between 1000 and 3000 which is good if you have a little bit of experience making

48
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.700
videos or maybe you own some of your own low end equipment and you want to upgrade or you're just a

49
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.230
little bit more serious about getting into videos.

50
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.480
And like worst case scenario is hey I like to play with this stuff.

51
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.890
Anyway that was my attitude.

52
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.050
Gotten a video.

53
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.180
I bought some nicer stuff than I knew how to use.

54
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.760
However I as a hobby also just learned how to use it because it's just really fun.

55
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.760
I like technology.

56
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.370
And then of course if you're ready to rock out some really high end video.

57
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.580
Well I've got some equipment that you can consider that will take you well above the $3000 limit.

58
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.890
But we're still going to focus on things that are expensive but reasonably So we're going to talk about

59
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.920
the ones that $6000 just because we're going to focus on getting the most bang for your buck if you're

60
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.390
in that 3000 to 5000 range.

61
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.690
Now DRIESUM really high quality stuff with this.

62
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.840
Like not Avatar or anything like that.

63
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.250
But when you compare your marketing videos other marketing videos it might look like the avatar of marketing

64
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.560
videos.

65
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.970
OK.

66
00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.800
All right let's let's go over this and let's start with what I call the ultra slim package and we'll

67
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.530
transition that into the basic package which is starter.

68
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.780
OK so this is the absolute cheapest I think you could possibly do it and you'd get the Evan stamp of

69
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.310
approval.

70
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.120
It would be me grinning and not super happy about it.

71
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.970
But you get it.

72
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.560
So the first thing I would say is shoot your smartphone.

73
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.090
OK.

74
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.440
Well I now this is kind of a loophole because if you don't have a smartphone you have to buy them and

75
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.210
everyone has one.

76
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.080
What I would suggest doing though is shooting with some of the better stuff.

77
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.640
So if you have a friend who has an iPhone 7 that's a great place to start.

78
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.310
Six is an ass.

79
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.970
Ease also shoot pretty well.

80
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.960
And then of course the Samsung Galaxy is really nice cameras.

81
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.190
They kind of put the iPhones to shame sometimes so if you have access to one of those that's also a

82
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.420
great place to start.

83
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:51.770
Generally what you want to look for is say the Impey megapixels and some of these higher end ones can

84
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.830
shoot in massive megapixels and that just means you know mega or God is a thousand pixel whatever it's

85
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.010
just a lot of pixels.

86
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.730
If you have a lot of pixels while then you're kind of closing the gap between what a cheap smartphone

87
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.690
can do and what a fancy camera can do.

88
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.600
So what I would say is try to borrow someone's iPhone 7 or their Samsung Galaxy or something like that

89
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.490
because those shoot well over like 25 megapixels.

90
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.120
And that's way more than you would need for this.

91
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.360
Never earlier when were talking about how you kind of to make up for the fact using a smartphone but

92
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.830
using other things.

93
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.750
Well that's pretty important as well here.

94
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.150
But we'll try our best.

95
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.380
OK.

96
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.260
So video is going to be on your iPhone.

97
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.720
OK.

98
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:42.200
What I would suggest is for audio I would probably go real cheap with this one.

99
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.060
So either get one of those audio attachments that plug into the bottom of your iPhone and then record

100
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.730
into it or get a zoom.

101
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.200
Each one recorder.

102
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.340
Now what does zoom H-1 or quarter is is it's just like a handheld recorder.

103
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.650
But it's really small and the audio quality is pretty good.

104
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.560
And so what you're going to do is treat that like any other shotgun mike.

105
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.700
These only cost like 80 bucks.

106
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.590
And then what you can do is just kind of put it on the table when you're filming something or put it

107
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.450
directly out of view or you can hoist it up and hold it if you want to hold it up.

108
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.490
Then what you can do is get a boom stand.

109
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.810
Now a boom stand.

110
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.690
There's a million and one of them I mean I use one called onstage stands on Amazon.

111
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.850
I think that 25 bucks something like that it'll break.

112
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.740
Of course it will break constantly but if you're really really cheap and you can keep repairing it so

113
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.400
get that and then use a zoom recorder and just hold that above their head.

114
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.550
Another great thing with the zoom H-1 key H-1 the bottom model is that it records everything internally.

115
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.790
Right.

116
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.300
So you don't have to like going to record or going to something else.

117
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.120
It can just record internally and also has a pretty good battery.

118
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.050
All right so that's your video and your audio.

119
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.550
So you just borrow a smartphone.

120
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.920
$0 and 25 bucks for your boom stand and then your zoom H-1 is about 80.

121
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.930
So now only about $120 at this point for your lighting.

122
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.250
I'd say there's two options.

123
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:10.600
One is you can go to a hardware store and you can actually just shoot with regular light bulbs.

124
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:17.180
Now you said that before it's not a good idea but we're also assuming that you were not completely broke.

125
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:23.030
A lot of times what you can do is go get these things called Colet grommets that basically what they

126
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:28.360
are backings to light that are made out of aluminum and are reflective.

127
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.140
OK.

128
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.710
And the oftentimes clips on them.

129
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:39.080
So what you have is a clip and then a kind of comb shape aluminum reflector you put in a light bulb

130
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.940
and there you go.

131
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.090
It's just getting a better light bulb.

132
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.140
You can use a regular light bulb.

133
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:52.190
The problem is just that they're not going to be very bright and see our eye the color temperature the

134
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.550
accuracy of the color is going to be pretty weak.

135
00:07:54.780 --> 00:08:00.550
Soooo what I would suggest in that situation is if you can't access the Amazon like for instance there's

136
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:07.040
a one called Lemos studio and they have these daylight full spectrum bulbs and they're like $15 a bulb

137
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:12.050
but they give off way more lumens than any other regular light.

138
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.390
Actually very bright.

139
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:20.690
And if you get say like three or four of those and you stick those up in where you need them in the

140
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.860
right angles in the right places you can make it work.

141
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.750
And the reflector in the back actually push it towards the person.

142
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:32.150
Now the next thing you can do and some people other video will absolutely cringe to hear this but I

143
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:37.760
will suggest that sometimes you can use things like wax paper for diffusion on top of the bowl.

144
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:42.950
Now you don't want to expose bulbs just staring right at you it's too bright and the lights just going

145
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:43.730
to go everywhere.

146
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:51.560
So sometimes that you can do is just use tape and wax paper or if you buy like diffusion paper at art

147
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.780
stores it's really rich sheeplike $5 you can wrap that in a bulb around it.

148
00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:59.590
And that works out pretty well for diffusing it.

149
00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:03.980
Although again people snobs who will be like mad for using it too much but who cares.

150
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.130
It's better than not using it.

151
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:09.560
So yeah I think you could get that done for like $150.

152
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:17.020
Hundred and ninety dollars maybe pass that way you can do is you can buy some really cheap LCD light

153
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.880
panels unlike Amazon for instance.

154
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.740
They these ones are like four inches by two inches and you just use double AA batteries there.

155
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.330
I think $25 $30 something like that.

156
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.530
And if you have two of those that also could work as well.

157
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:35.120
You can use those instead of using those comments with the clips past that.

158
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.800
I would say just get some lights dance.

159
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.020
That's it.

160
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:41.530
You know again Nestle I have to use light stands but usually only like $10.

161
00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.150
The cheapest ones.

162
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:47.530
And then what you do is you take your grommets and attach them to it or attach to the Ltd's that you

163
00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.680
bought that use the double AA batteries.

164
00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:50.980
Then pass that.

165
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.580
How do you get a hold the smartphone.

166
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:58.550
Well what I'd suggest is either just having someone hold it and then use Adobe Premiere and we'll talk

167
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:59.200
about this later.

168
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.250
That thing called warp stabilizer which can actually stabilize it for you is it perfect.

169
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.770
No but then again the scenario is not perfect.

170
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.350
You can also get like a gorilla pod.

171
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:15.340
Like $20 and they're just these really useful goofy looking things that can hold a phone and whatever

172
00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:20.330
position you want and you can wrap them around something so you can wrap them around a light stand and

173
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.290
then point those wherever you need to actually point the camera.

174
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.530
That's my suggestion for your lighting your audio and your camera for the ultra cheap version.

175
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.770
Good link in the resources to some people there are some pretty good guides on how to shoot well with

176
00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.960
the absolute bare minimum.

177
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.200
It gets pretty tricky but you can do it and I'm not the master working with it.

178
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:45.490
Nothing like a hundred dollar budget but this is one way you could do it if you take more time finagling

179
00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:46.870
it to get it to work.

180
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.090
But you don't spend a lot of money.
