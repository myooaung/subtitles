Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.410
Hey I'm popping in here to give you a quick tip.

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.480
Throughout this process for something that is really a great resource but I don't really know how exactly

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.660
it would fit into the rest of the section.

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.410
OK.

6
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.400
So there's a site out there it's been around for quite a long time and it's pretty well known and it's

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.700
a great kind of shortcut to getting press coverage or at least getting mentioned in press not site is

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.940
called Help a reporter dotcom.

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.720
It's also referred to as Horo constantly you'll see that h a r o.

10
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.070
Now the idea behind this is that there are a lot of journalists out there writing stories now they don't

11
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.720
know where to get sources for their material.

12
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.140
Let's say someone is writing about solar power and how it affects a specific state will say Are they

13
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.220
an expert in that state.

14
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.460
And are they an expert in solar power.

15
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.250
Probably not.

16
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.810
Do they know off the top of their head who they can call to get an expert analysis or to answer some

17
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.370
really specific question.

18
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.000
No.

19
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.400
So what the spacing this web site does is they have something like fifty five thousand journalists pretty

20
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.330
much all major publications use this website and what they'll do is when they need a source they'll

21
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.080
post on there.

22
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.290
They say I need a source that's an expert in this.

23
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.900
And then what you can do is you can pick that pitch them and say here's my answer or pitch them on why

24
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.310
you're a good expert.

25
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.610
And then they can either set up an interview with you or just take what you wrote and then use that.

26
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.930
So when you do this it's pretty easy just going to help reporter dot com.

27
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.520
You have somebody you have to do a subscription I do believe the free trial so you tried out to see

28
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.370
if you'd like it.

29
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.110
Well they're doing is they send you an e-mail three times a day based on some of the information they

30
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.530
give you.

31
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.850
They'll tailor it a little bit.

32
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.860
So if you keep checking your e-mail you might see very quickly that someone's asking a question that

33
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.330
might be relevant to you.

34
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.650
And if you can't answer that question well then actually try and do it.

35
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.750
So what ends up happening is if you do do it we'll either call you to an interview and then you'll have

36
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.960
a quote or even a paragraph if you're lucky or you know you pitch them the information and same thing

37
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.950
like they'll have a quick blip saying this is your name.

38
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.060
What your company is does and this is what they said.

39
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.190
Oftentimes that is a great driver of traffic and it's a fantastic way to get SEO value.

40
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.300
I know not as CEO yet but those are links back to your Web site.

41
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.910
So if you're quoted as an expert on something not only is that look great for your brand you your personal

42
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.480
image but it also has a big link coming from a big domain to your site.

43
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.100
So that's a pretty cheap and easy way to do this.

44
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.590
It's really low hanging fruit.

45
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.180
Don't think that you're going to hit it out of the park the first time you do it is certainly one of

46
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.960
the ones that you should just give it a couple days to comb through some of the e-mails or you actually

47
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.160
go in their system and just look through the database of them.

48
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.850
Keep in mind that these are timely.

49
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.040
That's why I say make sure to check your e-mail read them and quickly decide yes or no.

50
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.480
Oftentimes they're running a story and they need a source right now and they need to publish tomorrow

51
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.140
and that's more often the case than you know I have a question and you can answer it in a month.

52
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.550
So just keep that in mind if you can answer this quickly and do a good job.

53
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.650
And this is basically free press for you anyway I check it out it's Horo or help a reporter dot com.

54
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.050
Been around forever.

55
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.980
It's really cheap and easy way to get into big outlets like The New York Times The Wall Street Journal's

56
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.430
The Economist like just huge huge outlets out there.

57
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.920
All right guys I'll see you in the next lecture.
