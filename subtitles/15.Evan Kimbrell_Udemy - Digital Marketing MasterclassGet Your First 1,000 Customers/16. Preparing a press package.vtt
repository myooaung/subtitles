00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.860
All right guys welcome back to the course so far in this PR section we've talked about reporters and

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.030
the steps you should take to find contact and pitch them your story.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.350
Now remember that part where we mentioned how lazy reporters are.

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.640
Well I think we've mentioned this several times but he and them being lazy means you have opportunities

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.710
to jump in and take advantage of their Salafi ways by giving them what they need.

6
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.020
Now in this lecture I want to go over how to prepare a press package.

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.420
Another one of those ways you can appeal to the laziness of your reporters to provide them with prepackaged

8
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.190
information about you and your business.

9
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.750
But it's also a means to prepare and perfect all the things reporters will be asking for from you every

10
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.140
time.

11
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.650
They actually want to engage in a story or hear more about it.

12
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.350
Now here's what I mean.

13
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.900
Reporters do research you know on top of writing and dealing with crappy pitches and being lazy and

14
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.940
all that part of that research is figuring out the Who What Where When Why and how the subjects of pitches

15
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.380
and stories basically they need all the information that tells them who you are what you do what you're

16
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.190
all about.

17
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.370
And then you this info is quickly and easily as possible.

18
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.040
Now press package sometimes called a press kit or a media kit.

19
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.680
There is a group of information and documents you put together to answer all these questions and to

20
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.610
provide reporters with approved content like pictures of your products your CEO if you have one your

21
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.270
store and these days press packages might also include videos that you produced.

22
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.260
Now for example check out this media kit that buffer prepared buffer as a social media management tool

23
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.870
a platform pretty much any one can use do stuff like scheduling tweets to sharing ownership of social

24
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.790
media profiles within a company.

25
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.500
Now they've created this downloadable media kit so reporters interested in the company have images they

26
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.060
can use and their stories pictures of their CEO the CEO and the team in Hawaii.

27
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.990
Wow that's really nice.

28
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.060
Plus there's a few different versions of their logo.

29
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.320
Branding is important and you obviously don't want Joe Schmo reporter doing a google image search to

30
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.230
find that one image of your logo that's totally out of proportion and grainy and ugly and you provide

31
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.440
the media with these images.

32
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.120
Well then they don't have to dig around for them and it's one less barrier to them possibly publishing

33
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.440
a story about you that maybe your company isn't the big story maybe you're trying to pitch and promote

34
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.550
your big product into productivity app or the latest version of your phone made for people with very

35
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.730
small hands like Don Trump Samsung created a press kit specifically for the Galaxy Note seven with a

36
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.750
pair of official press releases 20 different photos and the video content as well.

37
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.560
Now the reporters covering this product this kit provided plenty of material they could use.

38
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.340
Unfortunately none of those photos showed the No7 catching on fire.

39
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.310
So reporters had to dig up those photos and videos themselves.

40
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.760
Still the kit was a way for the company to provide lots of official info in one spot without having

41
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.880
to repeatedly pull it all together.

42
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.610
Each time reporter asked for it and that right there is the big benefit of a press package.

43
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.620
It saves you time in the long run each time a reporter or member of the media needs info.

44
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.850
It also allows you to fair official statements photos and other content in advance and to put it in

45
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.630
one place.

46
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.910
Now sometimes it can get confusing internally when different people and company get across for official

47
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.320
info.

48
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.380
Put everyone to the press package online and you'll know that everyone is seeing the right stuff.

49
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.540
If you're looking for more ideas for your own package or press area online cocacola had a pretty impressive

50
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.800
one.

51
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.670
I know a big company they probably should in their press in our Coca-Cola provides a list of press mentions

52
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.050
leadership profiles video and image libraries and press contact list.

53
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.120
Now reporters generally don't need more than this when they're looking for official assets things like

54
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.380
Logos and pictures and descriptions of your products.

55
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.150
If you can provide these things in a central location while you're doing them a favor and saving pretty

56
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.190
much everybody some time.

57
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.770
Sounds good.

58
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.830
OK then we're going to wrap up our thoughts up here in the next lecture.

59
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.520
I'll see you then.
