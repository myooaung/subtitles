00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,070
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,980
So how is it that a new company gets customers?
2

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,980
Well, I mean, every company on the planet has started
out at some moment in time with zero customers.
3

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,620
So how did they go from zero to the first one, and then
to their first hundred, and then their first thousand?
4

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,840
In this lecture, I'm going explain how virtually all
businesses start out getting their customers and
5

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,730
how we're going to use that exact
model as a guide for this course.
6

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,950
Now, I'm sure all of you know someone that has started,
let's say, a small business, and I mean started, not
7

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:38,940
inherited, not bought, started from scratch. And yes,
we are technically talking about people like Richard
8

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,130
Branson and Donald Trump,
who did start their businesses,
9

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,810
but, I mean, they started it with a couple hundred million
dollars in inheritance, which tends to make things easier.
10

11
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:49,730
but, I mean, they started it with a couple hundred million
dollars in inheritance, which tends to make things easier.
11

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,230
Let's use the example of a normal person
that has started an online clothing shop.
12

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,950
Let's say he likes to design clothes,
so it was a natural fit for him.
13

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,700
When you look at that business from an outsider's
perspective, it appears that they are doing several
14

15
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,030
large things that get them customers.
15

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,880
Maybe they're buying and designing magazine
ads, maybe they're putting out flyers,
16

17
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,680
maybe he has sponsorship somewhere, etc.
17

18
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,560
What you need to understand is that you are looking
at this business as it is today, and what it's doing
18

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,830
today to get customers is almost never
the way it got customers when it first started.
19

20
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:31,050
It's very, very rarely the case that you'll see someone
conceptualize a business and then just go all in
20

21
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,030
with full blown marketing.
21

22
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,770
I would say you've never seen a brand
new startup make, say, a Super Bowl ad,
22

23
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,370
but I'm sure Silicon Valley has
plenty of embarrassing examples.
23

24
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,290
Or I guess I should say you very rarely see
successful businesses that do that.
24

25
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:52,740
When your friend started his clothing shop, he didn't
write those magazine ads on day one, he didn't pump
25

26
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,790
out the flyers by the hundreds.
26

27
00:01:54,870 --> 00:02:00,600
He probably did things that were much, much
smaller, and required more manual effort.
27

28
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,080
And this is no different for you.
28

29
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,120
Your business will go through distinct phases where
you get your customers from different sources, means,
29

30
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,650
and different strategies.
30

31
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:17,070
But the one thing that ties all of these phases
together is this lovely graph. Enter the all-knowing
31

32
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,830
graph of business growthdom.
32

33
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,300
Now, this is a way of understanding all of the marketing
strategies you're going to learn in this course.
33

34
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,050
Some strategies are going to be low effort, uncomplex,
34

35
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,470
and as a result only get you a few customers,
and then some strategies are going to be really hard,
35

36
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:40,540
really complex, long term, but if done right
will get you a metric ton of customers.
36

37
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,850
What you need to understand is this:
all entrepreneurs start small
37

38
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,220
and over time get complex. When you first start out
with your business, you will not have a great idea
38

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,650
who exactly your customers are, what they want to hear,
39

40
00:02:53,670 --> 00:03:00,600
if your product is great or only meh, if your page is
optimized, if you're even going to be profitable. And
40

41
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,060
this uncertainty means you need to try to preserve
your resources and test the waters a little bit
41

42
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,160
before you jump right in. To do this,
42

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,690
you're going to focus on manual strategies, and
that's everything we're going to do in section 1.
43

44
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:19,440
It's also known as "Your first 10 customers." After
you've gotten your first 10 customers, a little more
44

45
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,110
feedback, a better, but not fantastic understanding of what
people are responding to, how to angle your messaging,
45

46
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,160
feedback, a better, but not fantastic understanding of what
people are responding to, how to angle your messaging,
46

47
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,610
you move up the chart and start some mid-term strategies.
47

48
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,560
This is what we do in the next section.
48

49
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,820
We focus on strategies that are still pretty easy,
but will get you a hundred customers if done right.
49

50
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,950
They're also less manual and generally
more complex, but only slightly.
50

51
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,090
Then you can pretty much guess
where I'm going with this.
51

52
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,590
We now have more data,
52

53
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,050
we know roughly how popular our product is,
53

54
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,460
what are the major consistent complaints from
customers, how to match their needs after they use the
54

55
00:03:53,460 --> 00:04:00,030
product. You're going to start going for more long term
strategies at this point, and that is our section 3.
55

56
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:00,640
product. You're going to start going for more long term
strategies at this point, and that is our section 3.
56

57
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:06,930
It's "Getting your 500." Finally, we'll move on to phase number
four, where we know decently well what we are working
57

58
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,520
with, and we have the confidence to spend a large
amount of time on some more long term strategies.
58

59
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,560
These are the strategies that carry you from
the 500 to the thousand plus and beyond.
59

60
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,990
There really is no end in scope
for these strategies, if done well.
60

61
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,040
These are kind of the end all be all.
61

62
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:29,280
You can support these long term growth strategies
at this point because you will, you know, have cash
62

63
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,590
from the previous strategies. Over time, you'll add
complexity, effort, and a more long term focus to your
63

64
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,430
customer acquisition strategies.
64

65
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:42,480
That's how you minimize risk, lower how much money
out-of-pocket you have to pay, and quite frankly, make
65

66
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,030
sure that you have a tight well-oiled machine that's
ready for thousands of customers, and you won't
66

67
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,220
have any major surprises when you actually
go out there and get a big surge in traffic.
67

68
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,940
So that's exactly how our course works. Four phases,
four different types of strategies that fit on this continuum.
68

69
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,810
So that's exactly how our course works. Four phases,
four different types of strategies that fit on this continuum.
69

70
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,340
Now, I know some of you might be saying "I don't want to do
manual strategies if I'm just going to get rid of them later.
70

71
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,770
Now, I know some of you might be saying "I don't want to do
manual strategies if I'm just going to get rid of them later."
71

72
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,270
"That doesn't scale." Well,
72

73
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:13,220
as it turns out, businesses that refuse to do these
manual grunt work strategies in the beginning of
73

74
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,510
their business are something like
five times more likely to fail.
74

75
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,690
There's actually an article attached in the resources,
75

76
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,700
I strongly suggest reading it, it's from Paul Graham, the founder
of Y Combinator, called "Do things that don't scale."
76

77
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,470
I strongly suggest reading it, it's from Paul Graham, the founder
of Y Combinator, called "Do things that don't scale."
77

78
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,290
You can kind of guess what he says.
In the next lecture,
78

79
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,430
let's hit on a quick concept about growth that will help
you understand how these later strategies work together.
79

80
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,690
let's hit on a quick concept about growth that will help
you understand how these later strategies work together.
80

81
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,460
All right, see you then.
