00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,370
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,710
So I just talked about all the reasons you should create canonical long form content so if you're here

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,050
that means you want to see how it's actually done.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,300
So let's get actually down to it when you're thinking about putting together a long form piece.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,260
You have some choices to make while five choices to make in fact.

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,960
First off what is your goal with the piece.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,670
What do you want to accomplish with a big piece of content to it more leads you know lots of downloads

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,820
more registrations your newsletter or for a web in our what is it.

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,690
This goal needs to be crystal clear and actually measurable.

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,770
For example I want 1000 new sign ups is much clearer than I want to get more subscribers.

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,690
And whatever you create should support this goal.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,910
Secondly what is your topic going to be what's this long form piece going to be about.

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,660
Just like any blog post you want to make sure whatever you choose is relevant to your audience's needs

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,620
and interests.

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,780
But if it's a long form piece it'll need to be something broad enough you can devote a big chunk of

16
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,660
attention to.

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,620
You're probably not going to do a long form definitive guide to signing up for Facebook but you might

18
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:11,070
do one for how to create an e-mail marketing strategy for a band you might do it for an expert's guide

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,260
to launching a successful Kickstarter or even how to install a dishwasher.

20
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,500
I could be an ultimate God.

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,870
There needs to be enough depth to the subject so that a long form piece would make sense.

22
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:26,820
Third what is the format going to be and by formant I do mean is this an ultimate guide or a definitive

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,450
guide type of document or something different.

24
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,980
But I also mean how will it be published.

25
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,510
Is it one big blog post.

26
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,030
A section of pages on your site.

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:42,090
A mini site that a PTF download or some combination of those in some cases you might see this as a special

28
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,610
super long blog post and that's perfectly fine if it makes sense on your blog.

29
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,600
That's great but maybe you're putting together something that you anticipate will be searched for and

30
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,750
viewed many times like reference material long form walkthrough guides of how to use your photo editing

31
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,820
app might make more sense and a Resources section of your website rather than a blog post.

32
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,820
You want to ensure people find the peace plan to put it somewhere special.

33
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,750
The same goes if you want to be able to download it.

34
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,110
You'll need to produce a PDA for some kind of downloadable document that looks good reads well and just

35
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,630
be OK with the fact that some people might actually share it with their friends.

36
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,270
Print it out or I don't know post it on some file sharing Web site.

37
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,010
And of course that reminds me.

38
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,360
Number four which is what kind of access will this piece have.

39
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,930
You need to decide whether or not this will be available to anyone and everyone.

40
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,880
Or will you get it requiring an e-mail address or other fields of data to download it.

41
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,220
It's relatively easy to add an email gate onto your blog post.

42
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,890
You can also do it with videos as well so you can't launch into the type in your email address.

43
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,680
Either option is perfectly reasonable.

44
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,930
You just need to decide this based on your goal.

45
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,570
Are you creating this Ultimate Guide to collect more leads.

46
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,650
Well then you probably want to get it.

47
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,920
Are you trying to get as many people to view this content as possible.

48
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,450
Then don't gate it.

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,510
Consider your goal and then just make your decision based on that.

50
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,650
And the last of choice that we need to go through is that you need to decide when you're creating a

51
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,680
long form piece.

52
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:14,830
How are you going to make this thing bigger content projects sometimes require the help of others.

53
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,480
Maybe you're an artist or designer.

54
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,840
Another writer to help you research it an expert answer your questions are some let's say current customers

55
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,370
to help you test it out.

56
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,990
Consider the resources you'll need to create this long form piece and whatever cost or time constraints

57
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,960
you might run into.

58
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,430
So just to recap there's five important questions you should answer.

59
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,250
What's your goal.

60
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,180
What's your topic.

61
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,910
What's the format going to be what kind of access will this piece have and how are you going to make

62
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,340
it.

63
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,810
What's considered a quick example so you can better understand these questions.

64
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,520
Let's say that you provide consulting services for small businesses and specifically their email strategies.

65
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,580
Now this could be individuals with newsletters they're trying to create or grow or it could be actual

66
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,010
companies with clients and customers they're trying to reach through sales and marketing e-mails.

67
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,180
You know a lot about this topic and all the tools out there.

68
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,480
And while you have some clients you decided you like to put yourself out there as an expert.

69
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,790
Maybe someday speak at some events write a book someday.

70
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,060
But before you do all of that you want to create some big content and get yourself noticed in the industry.

71
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,400
OK so what's your goal.

72
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:21,510
You want people to share your content and you hope that will lead to more opportunities as your profile

73
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,160
grows.

74
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,550
But let's be more specific.

75
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,800
Let's say you want to get five hundred shares across social media platforms.

76
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,800
You can measure that.

77
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,500
And for example that will actually work.

78
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,890
Then what is our theoretical topic going to be.

79
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,340
Well you've got one in mind already so let's just roll with that.

80
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,870
The Ultimate Guide to email marketing for small businesses now it's pretty clear what this is going

81
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,100
to be about it's an ultimate guide and it needs to be comprehensive.

82
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,600
So we can expect to cover a lot of ground here.

83
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,800
We have to cover things like how to get started.

84
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,710
We have to do things like tools and platforms to use reprogrammed to judge which ones we like better

85
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:02,880
how to design emails how to write them probably how to build lists so on well you have all of this experience

86
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,940
presumably if you're writing the guy in on it and you know where to look online for more information

87
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,860
if necessary so you probably shouldn't be worried unless you're a fraud and you're writing about something

88
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,120
you have no idea what you're doing.

89
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,470
So on to the next question What's the format going to be.

90
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,350
Well so the goal here is five hundred shares then this needs to be shareable and maybe you don't want

91
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,710
a PTF because it's a hassle to create and that's perfectly fine.

92
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,780
You're probably leaning towards having all of this live on like a resource page on your site because

93
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:34,510
you like the idea of people coming to your site and maybe contacting you after they see it maybe if

94
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,610
you and social sharing buttons to the page then you can get shares that way and you can certainly support

95
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,550
your goal is specifically getting shares.

96
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,710
So then what kind of access will you put on this content.

97
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,850
Let's say you decide on free open access free love for everybody.

98
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,560
So no gating of the content you want as little friction as possible when people arrive.

99
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,440
You want them to jump right into this guy.

100
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,300
Now that's up to you.

101
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,300
But certainly the fewer barriers in the way the more people will check it out.

102
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,220
No gating means you may not know who visits and maybe competitors will see it.

103
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:06,610
I don't know.

104
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,110
Who cares but if you're concentrating on Cher's new gaiting will obviously improve your chances.

105
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,460
People don't like to share stuff that their friends go to you know like oh they're just bait for my

106
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,630
email address.

107
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,670
And then finally how are you going to put this together.

108
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,300
We already establish that you have the knowledge and experience right.

109
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,680
Most if not all of it you might have to refer to some online sources for the latest info and a few things

110
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,630
you know you can do it all yourself.

111
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:33,760
Now it comes to whatever long form content project you create your answers to these questions could

112
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,070
be completely different.

113
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,560
But it's important to answer them all.

114
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,660
As you've seen in the previous example the goal can help you figure out the format and access and certainly

115
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,890
the topic will help you determine if you can actually do it yourself or if you need help.

116
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:53,020
So now that we have our examples here let's keep walking through this and go through the first few steps

117
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,170
and how you would at least put something like this together.

118
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,610
Now I obviously can't write it for you but I can kind of walk you through the creative process of how

119
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,510
you go by section by section.

120
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:07,300
So for a long form canonical piece of content you might be tempted to just open up a new Google doc

121
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,490
or something else and just start typing.

122
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,780
However comfortable you feel with this topic you've chosen by all means get to work on it.

123
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:20,200
But one thing I suggest is before you dive in you need to check first at what already exists out there

124
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:26,920
and then use those as kind of a baseline to make your god your guide has to be better and more comprehensive

125
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,060
than what's already out there.

126
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,620
One of the first questions you ask yourself at this point is has anyone else created this exact same

127
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,450
piece of content.

128
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,310
I want to make.

129
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,670
If the answer is yes it doesn't mean you should hit the brakes on the idea what this search will do

130
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:44,080
though is help you see how many people have tried to create the same content before.

131
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,140
You'll see if they were successful or not.

132
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,200
And what's even cooler is that you'll see how you can outdo them.

133
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:55,150
You just look at it and just see how you can do it better and ask yourself that can I do this better.

134
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,440
All right so let's fire up the world's only search engine Google and search for e-mail marketing small

135
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,270
business guide.

136
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:06,790
OK so what I search for this is what I see I see shopkeep dot com has one on their landing page.

137
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,040
I can see a brief outline of it.

138
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,210
Why email marketing matters.

139
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,670
How to Choose the right email marketing tool for your business.

140
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,000
The anatomy of a great e-mail is a lot of the things that we covered before and you're theoretically

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,850
choosing our topics how to measure the success of your emails and then if nothing else do this and this

142
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,770
is like the.

143
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,980
Email marketing.

144
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:32,380
The kind of catering to people who just want a crash course a shorter version to get in and out more

145
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:32,960
quickly.

146
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,320
Now it seems interesting and it's something I want to check out.

147
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,600
So while their guy is gated and they ask for your name and email and they also asked me if I was looking

148
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,030
for a point of sale.

149
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,370
Thank you just the guide please.

150
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,530
So I submit that and I get an email from them with a link to the guide.

151
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,580
I open it download it and I can save it for later.

152
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,300
There's you guys out there who don't want to give out your e-mail address.

153
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,200
There's some pretty cool apps out there.

154
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,910
One's called throttle.

155
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:04,330
You sign up and then it ends up happening as you give a good fake auto generated e-mail to all of these

156
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,860
newsletters.

157
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,710
It still makes it to your e-mail inbox.

158
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,160
But then you can log in to throttle and just turn them off when you want to stop getting stuff from

159
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,010
that sender.

160
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,980
OK so the next search result I see is from the U.S. Small Business Administration.

161
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,880
Well this is actually a government Web site so honestly my expectations are pretty low here.

162
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:27,550
A lot of times government websites are pretty badly outdated badly designed and it's really hard to

163
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,990
find anything on them.

164
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,350
But I'm going to click through anyway just to be sure and well yeah you can see it's one page about

165
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,120
email marketing with some questions not exactly what I was looking for.

166
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,920
OK we're going to hightail it backwards back to the search results.

167
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,240
OK.

168
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,000
And I'm actually going to stick with the results that have guide in the title.

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,380
I want something comprehensive.

170
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,980
So I'm skipping this overblow one because it just looks like a blog post not an actual guide.

171
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,930
I don't know why they call it a guide.

172
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,620
So let's click on this hatchback one.

173
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,990
It's called the small business owners guy e-mail marketing introduction or because I'm scanning this

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,890
to see what kind of structure this has if I can spot what they're offering here I mean it looks like

175
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:12,140
a post is an introduction and offer some decent advice small businesses should keep in mind.

176
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,120
Make your copywriting count.

177
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,220
Don't be passed things like that.

178
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,040
And then here at the bottom the rest of the series covers different kinds of e-mails.

179
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:25,070
So we have introductory lead nurturing upswell referral and Windebank.

180
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:25,400
OK.

181
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,450
So that looks like some helpful content but it's not how I would have set up an Ultimate Guide.

182
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,780
However this kind of content might be great for a section in the guide about email design or messaging

183
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,970
so I'll certainly keep a link to this.

184
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,460
Let's go back to the Google results and keep looking.

185
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:40,740
OK.

186
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,280
Further down I see a source that I know should have good content.

187
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,400
I'm going to click through here and what we find is a guide for small business on how to use MailChimp.

188
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,350
That's not bad.

189
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:56,180
Yes this will have a lot of MailChimp specific info but also I'm saying a general outline that can be

190
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,270
helpful as well.

191
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,420
So let's go back to Google and let's look at one more.

192
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:05,610
OK here's a result I see from thrive high culture email marketing for small business owners exactly

193
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,680
what we're looking for.

194
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,000
We'll click that one and give it a look right.

195
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:14,030
It says right here in this ebook you'll learn how to develop your you know marketing program and it

196
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:19,250
includes e-mail newsletter basics types of e-mail newsletters advanced email marketing techniques how

197
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,520
to measure email success and more.

198
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,750
I might be tempted to download this but this form asks for a lot of information at once.

199
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:33,660
Name Company email and phone and those are all required so I'm just going to say no on that one.

200
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,690
It's really not that important to me.

201
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,190
I can probably find the content I want elsewhere.

202
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,950
Well once you've researched what's out there already you can get an idea whether or not anyone else

203
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,150
has covered your topic the way you want to or has thoroughly as you want to.

204
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:51,460
So far I've found a few different long form pieces where each one has a different focus.

205
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:57,590
Shopkeeper is more general hatchbacks book focuses on types of emails you'd send like in an actual sequence

206
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:02,900
and male chimps kind of focuses on while MailChimp for example I like we should probably start with

207
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,650
that shopkeep example and use that as a guide to make our guide.

208
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,630
Now it doesn't mean anything is set in stone.

209
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,180
We just want to get something started.

210
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,360
We can build off of that.

211
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,880
So let's open up that document and tear through it.

212
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:19,760
Well we can see it's like a 20 page PTF and we've got those five second section as we mentioned before.

213
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,970
Why email marketing.

214
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,880
How to choose the right email marketing tool for your business.

215
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,270
We have the anatomy of a great e-mail how to measure the success of your emails.

216
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,740
If nothing else do this to me.

217
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:34,130
Cheater's guide to email marketing essentially without all the fancy words you could boil their outline

218
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,440
down to the benefits of email.

219
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,970
The tools you could use.

220
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,230
How to Design emails how to measure emails and tips to help you get started.

221
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,060
OK I like that outline and it's something I can start with I might decide I want to add more sections

222
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,510
later.

223
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:52,310
Like something about building email lists or how that specifically works or maybe you'd like a quick

224
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,540
thing on AB testing emails outside of the design discussion.

225
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,370
Whatever I decide to do though I can get inspiration from other sources I've already created and use

226
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:06,740
their examples to help me decide what to do and what to cover from here perhaps what I do is I open

227
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:12,590
up a brand new Google doc copy in that basic version of a shopkeep outline and then start fleshing out

228
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,510
with details from there.

229
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,330
Then as I keep developing it I can look at those other sources I found.

230
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,480
Or do new more targeted searches like you know if I wanted to develop a section about email design I

231
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:30,100
could search for email marketing design or specifically email design small business see what comes up.

232
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,830
Ultimately what you want to do is make content in your own.

233
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,940
No matter what topic you are covering.

234
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:40,280
It's certainly been covered by someone else before but who cares.

235
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,430
Bring your own angle and bring your own experience to it.

236
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:48,620
If you're down with creating a long form content piece about whatever anything then you clearly have

237
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,360
something you want to talk about.

238
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,520
Keep that core message in mind when they are trying to make email marketing easier for small businesses

239
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,470
or dishwasher instillation easier for do it yourselfers.

240
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,590
Make sure that message gets delivered in the long form piece you make.

241
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,490
Now remember you want it to be canonical meaning.

242
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:11,780
Final word final word when it comes to this topic so make sure it is the final word.

243
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,440
It's better than all the guides are using as reference.

244
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,220
Got it.

245
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,070
OK great.

246
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,770
Well then my final word is going to be peace.

247
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,840
I'll see you in the next lecture.
