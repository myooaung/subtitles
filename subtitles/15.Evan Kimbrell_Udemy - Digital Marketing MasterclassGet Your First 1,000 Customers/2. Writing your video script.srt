00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,700
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,180
So far we've been discussing how to come up with ideas for videos.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,260
That process includes defining what your goals will be for each video and then figuring out what type

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,210
of format and what type of video you want to make.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,700
Well you go into your ideas goals and even potentially did some keyword research.

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:24,070
I'd say you're at the point where you can start developing your idea into an actual video project.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:30,430
Now the first step in most video marketing projects is going to be writing a video script and that's

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,140
what we're going to cover right now.

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,490
Now the reason why I say most is that not every single video project absolutely require a script.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,770
Sometimes when you're doing tutorial videos walk through F.A. cues you might not necessarily have a

11
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:50,570
script however a script almost always will make your video better.

12
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,780
And especially if you're trying to make something for your company I generally think that it's a good

13
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,260
idea.

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,880
The only exception where I would not script something necessarily is if you're trying to make a behind

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:07,270
the scenes video or something where it's supposed to be spontaneous and hand and leaning heavily on

16
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,320
its entertainment value.

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,280
Come on.

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,120
I don't know what to do or say

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,020
all of the situations.

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,000
I definitely think it's worth scripting.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,320
So you probably know from watching movies and TV shows that the script is what people use to help make

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,660
all that Hollywood magic happen.

23
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,590
A script is a written document that includes all the elements of your videos.

24
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,150
It's going to have the words being said the people in it the actions they take and any other elements

25
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,820
that you need to describe to completely tell your story and maybe your story is about how some British

26
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,680
kid learns magic can takes down a dark wizard.

27
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,040
Or maybe your video is about how to navigate the many magical features of your new app.

28
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,150
You just launched pretty much the same thing.

29
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,610
Either way a script can help me prepare everything that needs to be in your video before you start making

30
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:53,790
it.

31
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,740
Now if you want to make a video about your app explain the concept of paper click advertising to your

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,520
audience or marketing professional.

33
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,880
You don't really need to write a 120 page script to prepare everything you need to write something much

34
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,990
shorter maybe just a few pages maybe even just a page.

35
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,550
But we can take a lot of lessons from those Hollywood movie scripts to help us prepare our own.

36
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,840
Now one of those concepts is how to write a scene.

37
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,740
Now you're not obviously going to be detailing scenes for every single script you write if you're doing

38
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,020
a walkthrough video you're not going to write out.

39
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,170
This happens in my living room up against a wall is narrowly.

40
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,140
There's no point to that.

41
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,930
But in other situations you're making an ad and you're doing something or there's dialogue or interaction

42
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,570
between multiple people or you just switch scenes which a lot of the is you'll do this that's where

43
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,750
you want to be able to write scenes now in the case that you use multiple shots or multiple locations.

44
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,360
Scripts can be broken down into scenes which are individual parts of the video.

45
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:57,520
A lot of our marketing videos are really just going to be one scene or essentially one section of content.

46
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,790
So if it's an expert standing in front of a camera explaining a concept for two or three minutes like

47
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:09,630
me except I never seem to keep it under three minutes and you don't really show or do anything different

48
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,850
than just stand there and talk well that's basically one scene if you have a longer video with multiple

49
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:20,040
sections of content like you showed your expert and then you showed him talking to people in an office

50
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,680
and then you showed a screen cast with the expert narrating something.

51
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,890
Well those are multiple scenes notifying those separate seems just makes it easier for you to plan your

52
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,980
video production out.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,690
So each scene in a script has these elements that can help you set up and prepare now within each scene.

54
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,300
First you want to list off your setting.

55
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,550
Tell us very quickly when you write this out when and where your scene takes place for movies you might

56
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,280
write something like interior Deathstar day.

57
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,270
I mean that tells us everything we need to know.

58
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,040
We're inside.

59
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,490
Location is the Death Star.

60
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,540
It's day time although narrowish you know it's day or night in space.

61
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,880
There's probably a clock somewhere anyway for marketing videos you might write something like interior

62
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,780
White Room day if you wanted your expert to be standing in one of those blank white rooms again.

63
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,550
Settings help for planning purposes because you can see where your surroundings will need to be shot.

64
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,800
And if you have multiple scenes set in the same place you can shoot all of them at the same time.

65
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:24,480
Basically you can keep stacking your scenes together saves you a lot of time and hassle.

66
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,250
Now after you list off the set and you want to write up a description for your seat when the scene begins

67
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,360
what do we see.

68
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,290
What does our location look like.

69
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,250
Who and what are already there.

70
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:39,420
You're establishing the visual even if you just write our Speaker John Smith is standing in front of

71
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,480
a white background.

72
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:45,150
You're still telling us everything we need to know to start the scene detailing the stuff out.

73
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:50,970
Also can be incredibly helpful if you ever start turning this into a multiple person production.

74
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,080
If you hire help from someone to help you shoot these.

75
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,360
This is going to be a lifesaver because they don't know exactly what you want at every given moment.

76
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,060
Now the next thing you might write for a scene is then going to be the dialogue.

77
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,250
Now this is a dialogue between assuming two people talking with one person Well it's very similar.

78
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,890
This is the stuff people say.

79
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,160
And when you write dialogue you also make a note who's saying it Evan hey it's me.

80
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,370
Welcome back to the course.

81
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:21,420
I only said that ha probably 400 times each time someone says something you write that dialogue into

82
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,130
the script.

83
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:27,610
Now that helps the speakers or actors if you actually didn't fancy you know when they need to say something

84
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:33,300
and always say to memorize it if necessary if in the case that you're not memorizing it and you're using

85
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,120
say like a teleprompter well then you would take these scripts and nesses what you would put into the

86
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,260
teleprompter.

87
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,060
And that saves you a lot of time.

88
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,790
You also write some action into the scene.

89
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,300
When I say action I don't really mean a car crash or a shoot out although that would be pretty cool.

90
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,630
But this excitement is over from the circuits and my comes about here.

91
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,930
What I mean is after the scene begins what happens.

92
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,580
So it's talking if there's something specific you're planning.

93
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,290
Well you need to write it into the scene.

94
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,010
Evan reaches off screen to grab something when his arm returns into the frame we see he's holding a

95
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:05,920
cup of coffee.

96
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,420
So he slips it smacking his lips when he's done.

97
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,960
Let's have a cup of coffee.

98
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,720
Oh that's probably over descriptive you could easily just right Evan grab the coffee and takes a sip

99
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:21,410
movie scripts have plenty of descriptive detail but we're not making a movie we're not even Spielberg.

100
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:26,570
We're making marketing videos and you might only need to write things like we see a screenshot of the

101
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:31,100
Google Analytics main dashboard or something like that would save your editor down the line.

102
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,600
A lot of time now of course this all is going to depend on what your scene is about and what's happening

103
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:41,150
now what I think you might include for your scene in a script as a transition how you get from the end

104
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,570
of one scene to the start of the next one will you fade out to black.

105
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,180
Will you dissolve into the next scene or some other fancy transition.

106
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,720
A lot of times you might just say cut to the actual next scene and it just begins.

107
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:58,470
What are a transition you use it's good to know when you're editing the video and post-production.

108
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,360
You don't have a strong opinion about transitions.

109
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,460
Well there's an enormous amount of literature about how transitions make people feel and what emotions

110
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:13,550
you're trying to convey and really what's cutting edge and what's just kind of cheesy now don't really

111
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,870
worry too much about that one.

112
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,820
But you know in the future when watching YouTube videos see if you can actually notice the transitions

113
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,510
people use

114
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:27,100
it is over many videos created for content marketing purposes you won't need all of these elements.

115
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:32,500
But the more detail you can provide the easier it will be to create whatever you have a vision for hopefully

116
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,200
in the resources.

117
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,830
We've attached a template.

118
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,150
Right.

119
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,830
So you can just fill it out.

120
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,630
Speaking of detail and vision you might have heard of another kind of document related to a script called

121
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,590
a storyboard.

122
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:49,130
Now a story board is a document that takes your script and essentially add sketches or drawings of what

123
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,390
your video should look like.

124
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:55,370
Each time you record a new shot within a scene it can help you see what the writer or director has in

125
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:55,820
mind.

126
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,470
Like where people should be standing the angle of the camera and any other elements.

127
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,440
Now storyboards are essential for Hollywood movies and huge productions because there's a lot of people

128
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:12,740
who work the camera do the lighting and do the editing and need to know exactly what it's going to look

129
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,810
like before they even show up to set.

130
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:20,120
But for marketing videos storyboard is usually much less important of a requirement.

131
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,640
You know may be a good idea to make a couple of drawings of specific things you want or take screenshots

132
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:29,510
of things on your computer you want display like if you're you know doing a video explaining how a feature

133
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,700
works on your platform.

134
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:35,420
But for the most part you really shouldn't need a storyboard rebirth can save you enormous amount of

135
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,740
time if you start working with like videographer's though because you know you're kind of the director

136
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,980
there and they're the shooter as they call it in cool speak.

137
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,090
But having the actual sketches of what you've seen looks like it just kind of is a huge shortcut for

138
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:50,790
the two of you.

139
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,590
Now this leads me to a question I've gotten several times which is what about when I'm doing like a

140
00:08:54,590 --> 00:09:00,320
live stream like Facebook Live or whatever like a webinars in those situations.

141
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,490
I want a storyboard and or write a script in those types of situations.

142
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,130
You don't always want to script everything because maybe you don't have enough time maybe it's too awkward

143
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,470
when you know of the equipment.

144
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,290
But my suggestion is to script as much as you can.

145
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:21,140
There are varying degrees of scripting so you could have something as minimal as to just writing out

146
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,050
a topic and then having you adlib it knowing that this is the topic and the next one and the next one.

147
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:31,700
In that case it's kind of like an outline right if you know the stuff up front and you know you're talking

148
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,970
out that's usually enough.

149
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:41,090
Now a step up from running these just vague outlines would be a technique that I used for the first

150
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:46,430
eight of my 16 courses and that's what I call kind of the two sit ins technique are the two sentence

151
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,440
technique is where you write a Simmie script.

152
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,260
However you only write in two sentences at a time.

153
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:00,440
So if I were recording something instead of reading off a teleprompter script or memorizing something

154
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,240
or just adlibbing it I kind of have something in the middle where I would write down two to three sentences

155
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,060
at a time.

156
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:12,320
I would look at it read it get the gist of it and look back at the camera and talk through it and would

157
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:19,360
never be word for word but I made sure that I always got the point from each two or three seconds chunk

158
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:25,760
then a step up from that is literally writing a script where every word you write down comes out of

159
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,380
your mouth.

160
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,840
So back to that question which was how do you do it in live video.

161
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,330
Well script as much as you can.

162
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:37,370
So if you can't do a full script try doing two sentence techniques where you just have to get the gist

163
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,970
of and spit it back and you can't do that then just do a rough outline.

164
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:45,500
Worst case scenario if you're doing it and you don't know what you're supposed to talk about next or

165
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,540
something unexpected happens you always have that safety net to fall back on to look at and go oh.

166
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,120
Now we're talking about the next topic for your marketing videos.

167
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,950
Your hope is to create something with lasting value to make sure you deliver that value.

168
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,880
Writing a script is a really really good idea.

169
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:05,420
That preparation can save your video from looking and sounding boring and weak.

170
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,620
It can also make the process of shooting and editing the video much easier because the script is your

171
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,820
guide for everything.

172
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:17,360
What are the worst things in the world to do is to set up have everything ready cameras on you and you

173
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,490
don't actually know what you're supposed to say.

174
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:24,530
That is the worst time to figure out what you have to say when you're being blinded by lights and everyone

175
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,480
staring at you.

176
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:31,670
Tell you a secret if you guys ever took my become a product manager course in our promo call and I did

177
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,450
not have a script and we kind of had to make it up as we went.

178
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,410
And it took four times as long as it should have.

179
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,720
So anyway when in doubt script it out and you can put that on a poster or a T-shirt.

180
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,650
Give me royalties.

181
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,420
OK so far we've talked about the parts of a script but you might still be wondering how do I know if

182
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,560
my script is good.

183
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,410
Well that's a good question if you're writing a video script for the first time.

184
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,260
Now the idea here is to create a document so that when you read it you can easily visualize everything

185
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,050
in your head.

186
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:03,250
You can read all these elements and then you know see the setting understand when and where people appear.

187
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:08,160
You see what they say what they do and how everything flows together from scene to scene.

188
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:13,020
In fact writing a video script is a lot like running a blog post or any other written piece of content.

189
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,580
But really what's the difference between the two.

190
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:21,680
Well it's kind of hard to define but in a video script you're going to be writing in a more conversational

191
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,790
manner whereas a blog post you can write more like you're doing an essay.

192
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,030
There are certain words that fly on blog posts and certain words that just simply will not work.

193
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:39,880
And a video script if I said you I've investigated a plethora of solutions you would think that I'm

194
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,210
a robot or someone putting words in my mouth because I don't speak like that.

195
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:49,540
If you haven't noticed if you are stuck in thinking that your writing is too robotic Well here's five

196
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:54,910
tips that I can share with you to give you some ideas of how to put a script together that works for

197
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,240
video number one.

198
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,570
And you know this might be tried at this point but marimba who's watching your video.

199
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,280
What do they already know.

200
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,550
Why did they decide to watch this video and what needs to be communicated here.

201
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,690
Make sure you keep your audience in mind when you write your dialogue or put different elements on the

202
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:15,270
screen that use a word you haven't established yet or they haven't heard of yet.

203
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:21,370
Usually it's a good idea to define that if whatever you and helps the audience wild and doing the right

204
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,630
thing and really helps.

205
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,700
Imagine watching the video as someone who's knows nothing about what you're talking about.

206
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:31,010
And just imagine that scene in the script you would have gotten confused at some point.

207
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,980
Number two is defying your scope.

208
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,490
How much detail do you really need to go into.

209
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,960
How long is the video going to be.

210
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,580
This is what an outline comes in handy because you could make note of all the things you want to cover

211
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,450
and as you write you can actually stay focused.

212
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,980
Or three is right in a natural voice.

213
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,740
Now this obviously you were saying before it sounds like a reasonable thing to do when you're running

214
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,110
a blog post because you want it to be more readable.

215
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:58,060
But is even more important when you're writing a video script because someone will actually be saying

216
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,660
the word.

217
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:04,630
So again in some situations maybe you want to write a loose script or an outline because then people

218
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:11,950
can interpret that into actual language and just habitually when we speak we will speak like we speak

219
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,220
not how we write.

220
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,010
One way to help you get closer to that is to do what's called a table read.

221
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:18,250
Right.

222
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:24,520
So when you write something before you actually go and perform it or film it try reading it out loud

223
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,380
either to yourself or to someone else reading something and in your head versus saying it out loud you

224
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,130
just will get a natural reaction when something is just unnatural.

225
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:38,890
The fourth tip I can give you is that in marketing videos especially really really need to focus on

226
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:44,760
the first 10 seconds you really need to focus on hooking your audience's attention really quickly.

227
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,180
The A in the idea.

228
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,800
Now you don't need a long and elaborate intro to your video.

229
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:54,610
No one really has time for that and in fact you'll lose a lot of viewers but you do want something at

230
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,540
the beginning that looks good and is easy to understand.

231
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:03,280
So this should help assuming the viewer will have arrived at your video with no idea what to expect

232
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,760
because sometimes that happens when things get shared online.

233
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,880
What you do in those first 5% seconds are crucial.

234
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,990
And if someone's trying to watch this in order to learn something figure out what you do figure out

235
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:21,130
how to do something it's really helpful to either establish credibility show your logo or to tell them

236
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,940
what exactly they're going to learn and what they can do with the end of the video.

237
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,890
And the last ever to give you is give them something to do at the end.

238
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:33,040
Make sure you went through all your effort for some kind of pay up.

239
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,570
Is there an actual called action when you write this out.

240
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,630
It's really easy to forget to do that.

241
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:43,430
Do you want to watch next video download this purchase that the clear.

242
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,940
Obviously don't be too pushy.

243
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:49,420
Hopefully everything you wrote and did in your video will lead naturally to whatever the call to action

244
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,460
at the end is.

245
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:55,930
So keep your goal in mind as you're writing hopefully that helps a little bit know your audience know

246
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,900
your scope.

247
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,680
Make sure you write in a natural voice and if you having trouble do a table read.

248
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:06,640
Start off with something that hooks their attention with credibility or letting them know what value

249
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,740
you should get by watching this video.

250
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,660
And then the last thing is just make sure you don't forget to write in a call to action at the end of

251
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,290
your script.

252
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,680
If you can do those things and your video scripts should come out well.

253
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,210
All right guys I'll see you next Lutter.
