Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.180
So if you remember back when you created your 
account, there's no real profile picture on Snapchat.
2

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.710
You don't get to upload your logo 
or Snapcode, which kind of sucks.
3

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.350
The only way to customize it at this moment,
4

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.080
depending when you guys are listening to this, is to connect 
to an app that's called Bitmoji and then create a cartoon
5

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.730
kind of avatar for yourself.
6

7
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.250
Doesn't really work that well for brands or businesses, 
since all you can create is a boy or a girl, so, you know,
7

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.090
you're basically left with a ghost icon and a yellow box,
8

9
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.020
unfortunately. Well, your Snapcode isn't completely 
useless, and for people in your audience out there
9

10
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.040
who are on Snapchat and haven't discovered 
you yet, that actually can be pretty useful.
10

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.520
Now, first things first, go into the Snapchat app,
11

12
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.850
click on the icon in the upper left 
and you'll find your Snapcode.
12

13
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.130
Click on it and select "Save to camera roll" or "Download" 
or whatever option your phone has - it's different
13

14
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.370
based on the operating system you're on.
14

15
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.470
Now, here's one thing you can do with your Snapcode. 
Add it to any list of social media links you provide
15

16
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.510
on your website, in your emails, or other platforms 
where you have a presence. If your blog has a sidebar,
16

17
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.750
place it in there so people can easily 
see and scan it with their phone.
17

18
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.250
Another way to use your Snapcode is to make it 
your Twitter or Facebook profile picture, I actually
18

19
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.590
mentioned this before, but it's a great way to let everybody 
know for a short period of time, "Hey, we're on Snapchat."
19

20
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.370
mentioned this before, but it's a great way to let everybody 
know for a short period of time, "Hey, we're on Snapchat."
20

21
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.870
In general, when you do that, Snapchatters will know 
that they can just take a photo of the code and
21

22
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.330
then they'll add you as a friend.
22

23
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.860
That's the easiest way of finding you versus searching
for you and hopefully they know your handle.
23

24
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.000
You can also feature the Snapcode inside of a larger 
image on Facebook or Twitter where you promote
24

25
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.920
your Snapchat profile. And if you guys have any physical 
signs, packaging, or other stuff you're producing for
25

26
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.790
people to see in person, well, place the Snapcode someplace 
where they can easily snap it. Like if you have a physical store,
26

27
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.590
putting it in a store window or by your 
checkout area makes a lot of sense,
27

28
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.890
spots where people usually 
have their phones out already.
28

29
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.330
If you're already going to be at an event, well, make 
sure it's on your signage or make some stickers
29

30
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.510
of it from an online place like Sticker Mule.
30

31
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.870
They can make easy freebies to give away and promotional 
helpers. Just don't put Snapcodes in places
31

32
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.110
that don't make sense, like on vehicles or billboards,
32

33
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.020
when people really should not be using 
their phones, specifically when driving.
33

34
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.290
My favorite actually is when 
people put it on their packaging.
34

35
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.720
So when you buy something, you get the package, and 
then it has the Snapcode, so the idea is like, I'll take
35

36
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.450
a photo of the Snapcode and I'll follow 
you for promotions in the future.
36

37
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.140
But you know what?
37

38
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.300
Why promote yourself with a boring old Snapcode 
when you can actually create a custom one?
38

39
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.170
Now, at the moment, you can't really do any customization
in the Snapchat app itself, but that doesn't
39

40
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.820
mean you can't create a custom 
one to use everywhere else.
40

41
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.620
All you have to do is ensure the black dots in the Snapcode 
are the same and the code should actually work.
41

42
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.050
All you have to do is ensure the black dots in the Snapcode 
are the same and the code should actually work.
42

43
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.230
So here's how you create a custom Snapcode.
43

44
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.230
Check this out.
44

45
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.320
Go to snaptageditor.com,
45

46
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.250
enter your Snapchat username and it'll populate all 
the little black dots that make up your Snapcode.
46

47
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.270
Then choose a background color you like 
instead of that yellow one that everybody has,
47

48
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.050
everyone sees it, it just blends in.
48

49
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.310
Pick something that matches your logo color,
49

50
00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.700
that's generally a good idea.
50

51
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.380
Now, here comes the tricky part.
51

52
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.600
You could put a background image in there,
52

53
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.490
but here's my advice.
53

54
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.170
Don't put an image in.
54

55
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.790
Just download the free copy of this 
from the site with the URL in the middle.
55

56
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.140
Backgrounds just don't work as well, it's harder 
to see the code or know that it's a Snapcode.
56

57
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.780
After that, use a photo editing app like Photoshop or,
57

58
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.200
I constantly use Canva, Canva is a great example,
and then just remove the URL yourself.
58

59
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.950
Then if you want, add a custom image into that,
highlight or select the white middle ghost part, delete it,
59

60
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.870
and then superimpose the custom Snapcode
image over another picture, like your logo,
60

61
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.030
then download this. And then, boom, there you go.
61

62
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.350
You have a custom Snapchat code.
62

63
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.090
Why they made it so hard to do this, I don't know.
63

64
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.760
Why they made it so hard to do this, I don't know.
64

65
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.900
Just a safety tip here.
65

66
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.200
Don't edit those black dots at all, that makes up your 
code, so your Snapchat code actually works, if you
66

67
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.540
move the dots in any way, it screws it up.
67

68
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.030
Now, you can add anything inside the ghost outline,
68

69
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.580
just don't touch the dots.
69

70
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.390
So now if you want to share your custom Snapcode
in different places, like, say, your Twitter or your
70

71
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.710
Facebook icon, it will look actually cool and not just 
look like a blatant advertisement for Snapchat.
71

72
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.750
There you go, make your Snapcode visible,
72

73
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.830
use it to promote, and customize it 
with tools to make it eye catching.
73

74
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:17.430
Have fun.
74

75
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.370
See you guys next time.
