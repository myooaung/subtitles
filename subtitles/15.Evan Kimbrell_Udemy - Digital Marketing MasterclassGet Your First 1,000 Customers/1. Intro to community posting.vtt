Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:01.940
OK.
2

3
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:08.370
So in the next several lectures, we're going to be
focusing yet again on forums. In case you didn't get
3

4
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.670
enough of self-righteous 20 year-olds arguing
over video games, we're going back to Reddit.
4

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:22.080
And in case hearing a multiple tab terminal emulator
implemented in Python, or dot net garbage collector
5

6
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.210
basics and performance gets you hot and bothered,
6

7
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.540
we're going to cover Hacker News. And in case you are
the type that sneaks away from your family to hide
7

8
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.360
in a closet and look at photos of mobile app user
interfaces, we're going to cover Product Hunt.
8

9
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.490
And in case you have severe FOMO and
just want to try everything out there,
9

10
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.070
we've got Beta List as well.
10

11
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.460
In the next set of lectures, we're going to step up
our community posting game and graduate from the
11

12
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:55.430
casual low risk, low reward game of manual direct
messaging and replying, and get into the world of posting.
12

13
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.830
It sounds simple, but then again, if I were to ask
you what's the difference between a post that gets
13

14
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:10.400
one upvote and 15 views and a post that gets 1,500
upvotes and 300,000 views, what would you say?
14

15
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.380
Yeah.
15

16
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.660
There's a lot more to it than you think.
16

17
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.720
We're going to cover these four community groups,
17

18
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.300
what's special about them, what works, what doesn't,
and how to put together a strategy for tackling them.
18

19
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.690
I suggest everyone tries this section, but of course,
dabble a little bit and decide if you want to try this tactic.
19

20
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.770
I suggest everyone tries this section, but of course,
dabble a little bit and decide if you want to try this tactic.
20

21
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.060
Otherwise, move on - the next section,
we're talking about emerging platforms.
21

22
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.540
All right, guys.
22

23
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.050
Next up on deck, the wonderful world of Reddit. And
trust me, I promise, we'll only spend a minimum amount
23

24
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.360
of time looking at Nicolas Cage memes.
24

25
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.600
All right. See you then.
25

26
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.260
All right. See you then.
