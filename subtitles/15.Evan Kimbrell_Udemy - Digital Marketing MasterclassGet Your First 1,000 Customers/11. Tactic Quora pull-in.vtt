00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.710
All right guys welcome back to the last lecture we talked about getting the attention of reporters and

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.910
other media types interacting with them in some constructive way like answering questions or sharing

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.400
helpful data is a lot better than emailing them cold or getting in their face when they all collapse

4
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.790
Twitter message that says hey write about my product bro.

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.830
Well in this lecture I have a specific tip that can help you get the attention of reporters who might

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.360
spend time on platforms like Corra or Reddit.

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.850
Both of those sites feature a lot of opportunities for people to answer questions and give feedback

8
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.130
on things they know about.

9
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.240
Read it has lots of sub Bretta it's about specific subjects and threads plenty on the finer details

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.610
of how to use photoshop to make logos what version of Minecraft people like most or the best mobile

11
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.180
apps for assembling a shopping list.

12
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.390
Now they've got opinions to share but also experience that makes for good research material for reporters

13
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.820
needing some insight for a story.

14
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.230
So if one of the reporters on your radar is writing a story on something and you know that they have

15
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.960
questions or they're asking questions oftentimes on reddit you can just find crowdsourced information

16
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.790
and you pick and actually choose some of the better stuff and then present that to them.

17
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.380
Doing that job of ferrying information from different sources that they might not be aware of is quite

18
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.940
valuable and that's pretty helpful.

19
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.440
Now Cora is very much the same way where they have people who are asking questions.

20
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.760
People answering those questions.

21
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.140
And the best response is get uploaded.

22
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.410
So in a similar vein you can use these as research in order to help reporters out.

23
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.880
But there's another way you can use Corra to get a reporter's attention and this is a this is a tactic

24
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.320
I've seen work repeatedly what we're going to do on as we're going to find a question that relates to

25
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.740
our product or service or the industry we're in or where our industry and our interests overlap with

26
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.770
the reporter that we actually care about.

27
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.310
And then what we're going to do is we're going to ask that reporter to check out that question and give

28
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.090
some feedback.

29
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.220
Now this is a move some people have called the coral poll and actually it's just a name I came up with.

30
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.820
We're going to roll with it anyway.

31
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.860
Here's how it works.

32
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.350
You start with a search on for your related topic.

33
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.020
For example are using the iPhone example you type in iPhone accessories up top and you'll see the official

34
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.950
core topic page.

35
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.220
Post pop up if we scroll down we see some questions or threads about cases headphones whatever we want

36
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.660
to coverage for an iPhone case.

37
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.540
We designed well this would be the right place.

38
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.290
But what exactly are we looking for a thread we can take part in something we're actually qualified

39
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.810
to answer and at some knowledge to what we don't want to do has turned this into a shameless plug of

40
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.090
your product for example.

41
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.200
Check this one out.

42
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.820
What are some beautiful car mounts for portable devices.

43
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.380
Sure enough the top responses from people who are plugging their products I'm not saying that's a no

44
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.630
no.

45
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.940
But if you intend on sharing this with a reporter and asking them for their feedback on it they're probably

46
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.380
going to think they are just trying to get coverage for your product which you are and that's not what

47
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.220
you want them to think so probably ignore you.

48
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.670
Get a better way of doing this.

49
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.420
Maybe you've invented your own iPhone accessory for taking better selfies or a case that's got.

50
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.210
I don't know one of those tracking chips in it.

51
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.460
You never lose your phone whatever.

52
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.160
But be kind of cool.

53
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.320
Yes I know there's a find my iPhone feature but what if you don't want to use it for some reason.

54
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.630
I don't know that this is not a bulletproof idea.

55
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.590
So we've made this iphone case with the tracker.

56
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.850
The anti find my phone and you'd like to get some coverage about it.

57
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.880
So we'll go to Corra and find a related topic we can participate in so we can pull a reporter in later.

58
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.300
Now one topic though would make sense is the Find My iPhone feature which is something that we can type

59
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.140
in to Corra And there's the topic itself.

60
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.750
Let's click in there and see what's going on.

61
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.080
OK.

62
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.310
Here's a thread we can add to how does Apple's find my device compare to Android device manager.

63
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.380
Like let's assume your knowledge both these apps.

64
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.980
Hopefully you do because this is your industry which you probably could if you designed a case that

65
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.140
does the similar thing find an angle for yourself in this thread and contribute some thoughts.

66
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.830
Now try to offer at least one unique point that sets your answer apart from the others.

67
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.340
There.

68
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.070
Now once you do that it's time to use the core a Poland tactic.

69
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.600
Now what you do at this point is you go to your target and you say hey I've answered this question to

70
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.050
the best of my knowledge.

71
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.790
And then you just say you're an expert on this.

72
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.490
People respect your opinion or I can see that you clearly know a lot about this.

73
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.400
Is there anything you could add to it.

74
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.590
Now the way you invite them is one of two ways.

75
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.800
One you can e-mail them or tweet at them depending if you have access to that hopefully at this point

76
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.710
in time your research you have that end or what you can do is use Coras built in feature to invite someone

77
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.710
to answer a question.

78
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.970
Right.

79
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.090
So basically that is isn't asked to answer.

80
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.050
So people call it a it's usually up at the top of the question you can invite someone to answer.

81
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.180
You actually have a limit I think per month on how many times you can do this or something like that.

82
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.500
But anyway so you've answered it what you can do is go ask to answer that will send an email to that

83
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.870
specific person and then so I suggest that you can follow up with an e-mail if you have access to them.

84
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.760
Now here's something you could say in that e-mail.

85
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.340
Hi reporter guy or gal.

86
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.750
You know whatever their name is.

87
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.590
I know you've written a bunch of times about iPhone security or find my iPhone feature whatever film

88
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.470
is part on the iPhone.

89
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.790
Phone blog whatever site they're using.

90
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.290
I just had a quick question for you.

91
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.000
I'm researching the differences between find my iPhone and Android Device Manager whatever sounds plausible

92
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.370
for a new post I'm running.

93
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.460
And just answer the question score about it I was hoping you might be able to provide a quote from a

94
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.240
post by weighing in on my core a response.

95
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.500
You can insert it here insert link here.

96
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.370
You can also Alternatively just ask them for feedback if it's correct.

97
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.760
If they have any opinions on it or assume they want to contribute.

98
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.090
Probably the easiest thing to do is just ask for a quote then you'd say I'd appreciate any help you

99
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.510
provide.

100
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:19.730
Thanks so much Evan.

101
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.490
Or you know whatever your name is.

102
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.380
So what we're doing is giving our source a heads up about a post they might find interesting and an

103
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.130
opportunity to feature Nepos we're going.

104
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.510
Right.

105
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.590
I realize this might sound backwards to you since you know you're the one that wanted to be featured

106
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.790
in an article they might want to write about but what you're doing here is basically just starting a

107
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.660
relationship and you're starting it on a really good footing.

108
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.780
You're basically complimenting their expertise bringing them something that is relevant to them and

109
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.810
something they might actually care about.

110
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.740
And you know a little bit you're getting them a little bit of exposure.

111
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.980
Now it's a core post and if they're active on the platform which you know your research already confirm

112
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.930
if they are or not that they'll be more apt to respond.

113
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.260
When people basically hand them opportunities to provide quotes for a post some people jump at the chance

114
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.450
do it without even thinking.

115
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.170
So for some of your leads and for you this could be a win win.

116
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.060
So what's the potential end result here.

117
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.840
Well one you can enter the source directly and now you're on the radar too.

118
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.110
Maybe you get a quote from them for a post.

119
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.510
You can write about N3.

120
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:19.440
Yes you can now write this post with their quote posted and link to them and or for this gives you an

121
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.070
excuse to contact the source again thanking them and reconnecting with them again down the road.

122
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.080
There you go.

123
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.010
Mission accomplished.

124
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.050
They now probably know who you are.

125
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.740
So there you go.

126
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.760
All of the set of instructions for Corra or actually do it you can also do this on reddit.

127
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.260
Either way you can use these for mining answers to help them.

128
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.420
Or do Pullens.

129
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.810
Both are common places where writers hang out ask questions get answers.

130
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.100
Now obviously remember not to be too Salzer with your response or your pitch and use this experience

131
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.310
as a way to build a relationship before you do the big ask and pitch them on your product or idea.

132
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.840
Already guys.

133
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.770
That's it for this lecture.

134
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:50.550
I'll see you in the next one.
