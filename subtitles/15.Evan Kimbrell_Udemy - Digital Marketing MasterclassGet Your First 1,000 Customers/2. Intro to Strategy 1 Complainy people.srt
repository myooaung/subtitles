Hey guys, welcome back to the course. In this lecture,
1

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:09,730
we're going to get introduced to our first strategy,
strategy numero uno, the strategia (?) -
2

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,520
I don't speak Spanish.
3

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,040
So this strategy is going to be manual,
4

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,940
it's going to be direct, and it's going to be
pretty basic, but it does consistently work.
5

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,430
One of the wonderful things about
the Internet is that it is indexable.
6

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,840
Now, what do I mean by that?
7

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,810
Well, let's say I'm driving my
Toyota Prius down the highway,
8

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,140
and for whatever reason the accelerator gets stuck.
9

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,850
Maybe later, if I'm alive, I might go online and complain
about it saying that when I hit the accelerator,
10

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,990
it doesn't seem to un-accelerate. Well,
because of the way that the internet works,
11

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:49,230
anyone who is looking for people complaining about
that specific braking and acceleration problem will
12

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:56,430
probably be able to find what I said online, regardless
of whether or not they saw exactly where I posted
13

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:04,170
it, when I posted it, or if they organically stumbled upon it.
That indexable-ness - yes, I just made that term up -
14

15
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:04,760
it, when I posted it, or if they organically stumbled upon it.
That indexable-ness - yes, I just made that term up -
15

16
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:10,920
is what we're going to exploit with this strategy. Now,
this strategy really only takes like 30 minutes to do,
16

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,700
is what we're going to exploit with this strategy. Now,
this strategy really only takes like 30 minutes to do,
17

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,300
and if it works for you, it is something that
you can replicate in a small scale fashion.
18

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,810
Now, in the last section, we had a lecture on
understanding your customers' pain point.
19

20
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,260
And if you haven't watched that lecture,
please pause this one, go back and watch it.
20

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,190
That one is crucial to understanding so much of what
we do later in this course, you're not really going
21

22
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,300
to be successful at getting customers if you don't
understand why they're buying your stuff.
22

23
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:42,330
What you should have gotten from that lecture is 1-2 general
ideas of what problem your product or service solves.
23

24
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,830
What you should have gotten from that lecture is 1-2 general
ideas of what problem your product or service solves.
24

25
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:50,760
If you also remember from the lecture, we know that
all products and services, all business ideas spring
25

26
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,550
from solving problems, they all solve
problems, even if you don't think it's so.
26

27
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,740
Even products you wouldn't associate
with being problem solving still do.
27

28
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,100
Let's take an example.
28

29
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,220
You're playing an iPhone app, let's say you're playing
Flappy Bird or Angry Birds. What problem does that solve?
29

30
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,930
You're playing an iPhone app, let's say you're playing
Flappy Bird or Angry Birds. What problem does that solve?
30

31
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:15,390
It solves boredom, more specifically, boredom when
you're riding in a car or boredom when you're waiting
31

32
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,650
for your doctor's appointment,
32

33
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,810
short periods of time in which you are bored. Now,
when you combine the fact that all ideas spring from
33

34
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,630
problems and that the internet is wonderfully
indexable, I think you see where I'm going with this.
34

35
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:34,200
We can find some customers that have our specific
pain point. And if they have an itch and our product
35

36
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,000
is the ointment for that itch, you'd better believe than if
we just connect the dots for them, they'll buy our stuff.
36

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,550
is the ointment for that itch, you'd better believe than if
we just connect the dots for them, they'll buy our stuff.
37

38
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,230
So what we're going to do is we're gonna get
into the mind of our potential customers,
38

39
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,810
figure out how they would verbalize their problems,
and then we're going to use that as a way to find
39

40
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,290
them and potentially get them to buy our products.
40

41
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,590
All right.
41

42
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:58,800
Now that you know the name of the game, next lecture, we're
going to cover how exactly we find these paying customers.
42

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,820
Now that you know the name of the game, next lecture, we're
going to cover how exactly we find these paying customers.
43

44
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,690
All right. See you then.
