00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,390
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,000
So if you've got our list of sites to approach it's time to prepare your pitch now.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,960
Accepting outside submissions are kind of like hiring managers.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,590
They don't have the time to figure you out.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,100
You need to tell them exactly what you can do for them and in the right format.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,990
So a great way to start is by meeting any basic requirements you can find.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,850
You might find information on a guest blogger page or a contact page or a sidebar on their blog.

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,650
Most places that accept outside work will say something like we accept this or tell us this or that

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,500
about yourself.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,230
For example on the ninety Ninety-Nine you contact page there is another blog.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,740
They've got a short well section of the top that says what to write for ninety nine you do include writing

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,480
samples from other publications on a specific pitch on what you like to write about.

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,250
So right there you know what you need to include samples and a pitch that can include that.

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,720
Well then just don't bother.

15
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,770
Quick side tip.

16
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,320
What if the requirements include links to online samples of your previous post and you don't have any

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:01,940
yet.

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,040
Well one option is to write an article and instead of posting it on someone else's blog or your page

19
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,700
posted on Linked In.

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,020
It's actually a quick and easy way to get something online for free.

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,450
Maybe get some engagement that at least shows something you can add to your new and growing list of

22
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,590
online posts.

23
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,320
It's a great stopgap and a lot of people see it and think that it was published by Linked In.

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,320
I don't know for some reason it works is the same thing goes for using medium dot com.

25
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:34,400
And here's another tip that I think worth remembering every blog is different so every pitch you send

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,970
to them should be different.

27
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,950
Please do not email the same thing to ten different places.

28
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,600
You're just wasting your time.

29
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:46,200
Take the time and create a unique message each time and call out those relevant topics on their site.

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,770
Mention a recent post of yours you thought was cool and perhaps related to your idea.

31
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,070
Showing that you have been to their site and actually read some of their material can really help you

32
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,670
because you'd be amazed how many people pitch and they've never read the blog.

33
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,310
Now you might have one great idea.

34
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,930
You are really excited about.

35
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:08,220
You want to go all in on this idea but when you get to their contributor page here in the form it asks

36
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,980
What are two or three specific article topics you would write.

37
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,440
Well be prepared to pitch multiple ideas.

38
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,880
You might also have to dip into that list of ideas we generated before.

39
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,890
But remember make them relevant to this site not just your audience.

40
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,260
If you need help validating an idea then just do a search on the site's blog and look for similar titles

41
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,960
or post you might see something that covers your idea or an opportunity for you to present it.

42
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,130
The point is you just want to make sure that you're pitching something that's not completely in outer

43
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:38,730
space.

44
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:44,550
Remember that a Gor a pulse blog from our last video will block covered all kinds of social media topics

45
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,850
and relevant categories.

46
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,020
So they asked you what are two three things you might write about.

47
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,220
Don't say well I can write about social media.

48
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,620
Email Marketing and viral marketing.

49
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,830
Don't go outside the scope of what they want.

50
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,240
Look at their posts in categories and find inspiration there and be specific when they ask for ideas.

51
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,050
Give them actual titles you're thinking of using Not big topics.

52
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:12,450
When you think about the headlines go back to the best practices we covered with headlines console that

53
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,490
they don't have to be the best thing ever.

54
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,960
In fact most publications will edit them for you now when you're ready to submit your information or

55
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,860
send your email.

56
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,960
Your pitch should be short and sweet and cover all of the basics from those basic requirements you talked

57
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,950
about earlier.

58
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,590
Double check and make sure your messages include them all.

59
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,030
As an example let's say you wanted to write a tech post somewhere because you're an app developer and

60
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,680
you've got some experience you want to share about say I don't know ways in which developers use mobile

61
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,180
apps that are different from other people.

62
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,690
Fascinating one of the blogs you follow is business insider which writes plenty about tech topics.

63
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,740
In fact though bright about anything that's Takk And guess what they accept a guest post a lot of them

64
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,720
actually their site says send the final draft of your piece.

65
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:58,770
A proposed headline brief bio and links to any other pieces you've published to contributors at Business

66
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,560
Insider dot com and I'm OK giving out their email address it's public.

67
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,340
So if you were to respond to that email what do you think you would say.

68
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,160
Well here's what an email could look like Old Business Insider.

69
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,270
I'm a longtime reader of your blog post about app development are really helpful especially in insert

70
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,560
title here.

71
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:21,300
You don't have to go into too much detail you just add something quick like love the checklist or refer

72
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,330
back to it all the time or he was a quick thought.

73
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,890
I had on the value delivered then you could say I love to contribute a post to Business Insider and

74
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,480
as an apt feel for myself I think it speaks to the needs of your audience.

75
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,310
It's called.

76
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,920
This is where you actually would say this is my headline for what I'm proposing and then give it a short

77
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,430
description because it's not immediately obvious from the headline.

78
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,480
As requested I've attached a copy of my post and a Bible as a Word document.

79
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,160
You can also just use a Google doc link or Dropbox or whatever you want.

80
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,170
Generally speaking I prefer to send out a link to like Dropbox or Google Docs for this information because

81
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,190
if you attach it to the email it's more likely to go to spam.

82
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,040
But it actually reminds me check out tool attached I can actually tell you when you send an attachment

83
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,450
if the other person opened it and read it.

84
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,430
I think it's pretty neat.

85
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,790
Anyway back to the e-mail also.

86
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:14,990
Here are a few guest posts I've written before to give you a look at my style and engagement your links

87
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:15,500
right there.

88
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,790
Thank you for your consideration.

89
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,900
Please let me know if you have any questions for me.

90
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,410
Cheers me.

91
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,500
Now obviously don't use that one word for word but that is basically the template you should use.

92
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,350
Try spicing it up and but for the most part just meet the basic requirements.

93
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:32,220
So in the end your message should be professional and concise.

94
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,940
Of blogs actually tell you what to expect after you submit such as how long you might have to wait.

95
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,850
Be patient no matter where you pitch your idea.

96
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:46,790
Some of these blogs are just ridiculously busy and you might not hear back from them for weeks if at

97
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,980
all in fact a lot of them will not respond.

98
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,850
Other places may get back to you right away.

99
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,970
Either way be prepared to actually write the piece if you've offered a pitch and in the case of other

100
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,940
larger publications Well you already wrote the pitch.

101
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,670
If they don't like it then maybe try pitching it to another one.

102
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,440
It's in our next lecture We'll talk about actually writing the piece and making it fit for the blog

103
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,940
that it's going to find a home on.

104
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,790
All right I'll see it.
