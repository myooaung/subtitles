00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,370
Hey guys welcome back to the course and welcome to The New Video Marketing section.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,060
You're finally out of the woods with content marketing.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,550
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,200
So long.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,690
Now there's no denying the power of video these days.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:19,530
You know it used to be the case that making video was kind of a novelty but now everybody's got video

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,350
or at least their toe in video when you're on Facebook.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,630
What do you engage with more often videos when you're on Twitter.

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,770
It's the same thing.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,560
Nowadays a lot of people even get more of their information from YouTube than really any other source

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,120
myself included have taught myself an enormous amount of things to YouTube and it kind of makes sense.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,630
Video is a much more efficient way of getting information across not only can you say more in less time

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,580
but it's also much easier for the viewer to actually engage with and digest.

14
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,680
There's a quote that says a picture is worth a thousand words.

15
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,000
Well if a picture is worth a thousand words how many words do you think video is worth considering.

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,840
Every frame has an image and every second is 24 images so the section we're tackling.

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,780
Video Marketing how to get into it how to manage it and how to use video in this new medium that everybody

18
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,770
seems to love to get your message across and to bring in more customers.

19
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:22,500
Now video marketing comes in a lot of different forms from the short ads to longer explainer videos

20
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,480
to the much longer walk through.

21
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,630
And really a lot more.

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,080
So there are plenty of ways you could use video for whatever business venture you have in mind and that's

23
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,200
what this section is really going to be about.

24
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:40,170
How can you the layman the non videographer jump into video and use it to reach your goals.

25
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,560
I'm here to give you the tips and advice on how to do exactly that.

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,060
So in the next set of lectures we've got our God probably 20 of them we're going to cover what you need

27
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,860
to know to plan and produce your own videos for marketing purposes.

28
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,490
We'll talk about things like the most common types of marketing videos and what you might consider for

29
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,350
yourself.

30
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,940
We'll talk about how to meet business goals specifically with video how to angle the video depending

31
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,140
on what you're looking for if it's like awareness of its shares or its conversions.

32
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,660
Also jump into pre-production where you plan out your video and you talk about how you know how you're

33
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,460
going to write the script and how you're going to plan the storyboarding.

34
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:22,340
We'll discuss the importance of YouTube and then how your strategy for video needs to change.

35
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,460
If you are going to pursue YouTube and then of course there's production which is how do I actually

36
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,550
plan and make these videos.

37
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,950
What kind of cameras do I use lighting what audio equipment do I need.

38
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,070
How do I save money in this process.

39
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,300
Don't worry I got you covered.

40
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,260
We're going to cover how to use video and different step tiers of budgets.

41
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:46,350
I've also got three great video setups that we can actually look at and see how everything is set up

42
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,090
and what it produces at the end.

43
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,140
And then of course we're to cover post-production which will talk about things like editing how it works

44
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,050
what to use what are different styles we can try out.

45
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,490
And then of course if you don't want to edit it how do we hire someone to do the editing.

46
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,910
We'll get into where you can find people to help you in your stock.

47
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,180
And then also how to use things like templates to save you time and money.

48
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,950
The goal here is to set you up in the knowledge you need to understand video basics how it works how

49
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,520
to pick the right equipment and how to get the results you want.

50
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,240
You should finish this section of the list of ideas of what to make what to use and how to integrate

51
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,080
all of it into whatever content strategy you've already got started.

52
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,830
All right sounds good.

53
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,400
Let's do it.

54
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,140
See in the next election.
