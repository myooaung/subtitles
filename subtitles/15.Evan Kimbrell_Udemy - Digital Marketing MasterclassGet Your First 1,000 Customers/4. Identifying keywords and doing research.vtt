00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.270
All right guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.000
So in the last couple lectures we talked about how search and Google work and what longtail CEO specifically

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.940
is all about.

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.480
Now basically if we want to get our website found by anybody out there we need to create content that's

5
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.620
going to get ranked for the keywords our potential customers are searching for.

6
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.810
So an important part of our plan is going to be the identification of the keywords we want to focus

7
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.470
on.

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.390
That's what we're going to talk about in this lecture.

9
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.980
Now the goal of keyword research is to come up with the keyword list that guides the creation of your

10
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.550
articles.

11
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.480
Post videos and other pieces of content.

12
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.780
It's really kind of a one two punch with content marketing now with content marketing you can write

13
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.450
whatever you want and then focus on other ways promoting it.

14
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.120
But if you want to use search and you won't be you find it through Google while you're going to have

15
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.120
to do keyword research and then start writing articles.

16
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:55.040
Now you might have a singular focus meaning that your web site is devoted to say one topic a product

17
00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.020
or service or you know the one topic you write about exclusively where you might have a group of things

18
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.960
you focus on maybe you're a blogger or a podcast there were five main topics or you have multiple groups

19
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.050
of products or services that covered different areas of interest.

20
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.620
Either way your first step is to identify the categories you'll be writing about.

21
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.160
It could be one or many but this is how you get started.

22
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.000
A Productivity and organization app like let's say Evernote for example really has a singular focus

23
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.030
productivity.

24
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.770
There are obviously related terms like organization or idea capture or like diary and writing things

25
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.440
down.

26
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.100
But really there's one thing the app focuses on and one specific topic there are articles and blog posts

27
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.580
focus on having one main topic you write about is great.

28
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.610
Now it provides some focus so that can be a good thing.

29
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:50.750
The downside obviously though is that you can only rank for that topic and so you do have a bit of a

30
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.340
ceiling depending on the keywords you're going after.

31
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.100
Of course if you do this well it's really not going to matter.

32
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.000
The ocean of search is so vast that is the last thing I'd be worried about.

33
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.000
Now a counterexample would be something like Shopify which covers a lot of topics Shaab Vihear Lunda

34
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.550
their blog or the site they provide e-commerce solutions for all kinds of customers.

35
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.820
But the content they write goes beyond e-commerce.

36
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.250
They write articles and blog posts about how to run a business enterprise solutions marketing branding

37
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.750
and podcasting.

38
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.820
They've got a much wider focus so if they wanted to create content that ranked highly Well they'd have

39
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.650
to focus on multiple categories full of keywords for each category you have you want to follow a plan

40
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.210
to do keyword research and generate keywords to focus on.

41
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.350
Our plan goes a little something like this.

42
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.090
Now number one step number one is you have to think up some keyword ideas for your category.

43
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.910
Usually you want to start with 10 to 12.

44
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.440
Number two use some free tools to expand that list and then you'll end up with potentially hundreds

45
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.290
of keywords.

46
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.860
Now don't panic we're obviously in a filter those out.

47
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.540
Number three is going to research the expanded list and Google to see what the traffic numbers and trends

48
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.990
look like and then number four decide which key words are the ones we want to focus on.

49
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.080
So in the end will a short list of key word phrases and terms we can use to guide our efforts as we

50
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.930
create articles and write other pieces of whatever.

51
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.140
So the first step is you brainstorm and come up with Hiebert ideas.

52
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.390
Now a list of 10 would be ideal to get us started.

53
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.360
And it shouldn't be too hard since you know there's probably going to be some overlap.

54
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.650
Now go back to Evernham.

55
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.290
Let's use that for example if your brain's stimulus forever.

56
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.420
Well we might come up with something like this Evernote app productivity app organization app mobile

57
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.580
organization mobile productivity.

58
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.880
How do you use Evernote Evernote features how to improve productivity app how to be better at things

59
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.920
whatever and such and such and so on.

60
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.590
Now each one isn't too different and that's fine.

61
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.330
You should definitely focus on the easiest ways to describe your product your app or your service for

62
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.440
the most obvious ways people would search to find you if you're struggling at this point to come off.

63
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.070
Ideas that's perfectly OK.

64
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.330
Now go to Google and type in your first keyword and scroll to the bottom of the the R.P. and look at

65
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.790
the list of searches related to that specific keyword.

66
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.950
Now I should be like eight of them there.

67
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.510
And if you need a kick in the brain to get you going that can potentially help.

68
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.770
That's a really easy kind of shortcut.

69
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.590
Now it might be the case that if you know you have your 500 customers already some people are aware

70
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.280
of you and some people will be searching for you.

71
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.150
So in that case you have situations where some of the key words are going to include your brand name.

72
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.550
So try your best to write down 10 to 12 key words for what you would imagine people are searching for

73
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.400
or at least how you're angling your product.

74
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.420
How do you describe your product how would you describe it.

75
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.570
Most generically most blandly if you were to describe the category let's bring back one of those sections

76
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.250
We're back and PR if we were work out.

77
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.820
Remember it was an app that you run with and it tells how fast you're running and changes the tempo

78
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.450
of a song you're listening to what would we search for if I was a customer why would I search for if

79
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.510
I was looking for them.

80
00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:02.150
One of the keywords might be listen to music while running or running customized music or just music

81
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.230
for running any different combination of something like that.

82
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.770
Exercise music.

83
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.780
Best exercise music.

84
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.960
Things like that.

85
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.060
It doesn't really matter.

86
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.290
We're always going to whittle these down later but try your best to get 10 or 12 that you think would

87
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.640
be the main way someone would find you.

88
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.150
Once you do get those 10 or 12 key words pause right there now you don't need perfect ideas right off

89
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.540
the bat.

90
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.220
This is why we're doing research.

91
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.530
Now you can go out and use some free tools to expand this list especially if you're stuck.

92
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.710
Will need a lot more keyword phrases to do research on traffic.

93
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.370
So let's jump out to our first tool which is called keyword tool.

94
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.140
Io.

95
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.460
Now if we plug in we're going to go back to our Evernote example productivity app well where you get

96
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.370
over 250 key word results.

97
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.270
Now these are all related variations on the term we put in and we'll be able to use this list to help

98
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.480
us figure out which specific phrases are the best for us to focus on.

99
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.340
Remember the long tail we don't necessarily want to focus on the most popular keywords.

100
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.860
Instead we want to find the best specific ones.

101
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.290
We have a chance of ranking for.

102
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.090
So what do we do with a list of key word results from the key tool.

103
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.130
I go wow.

104
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.080
Copy the phrases and paste them back into your spreadsheet.

105
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.110
What are a spreadsheet or where you wrote down your 10 or 12 keywords to begin with.

106
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.430
Google sheet Excel whatever.

107
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.630
Now keyword to has this free version that lets you copy all of these phrases or you could use another

108
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.830
tool like Oubre suggest google suggests is another one.

109
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.800
They have a free tool but I believe they'll have a paid tier.

110
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:33.020
Usually you can get everything you need out of the free version and if that is a working noise you are

111
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.060
free trial and of course and you really do love it.

112
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.100
You can end up paying for it.

113
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.340
So after you copy and paste the phrases for the first keyword move onto the next one in your list of

114
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.370
10 to 12.

115
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.560
Once you're done with that well you'll have a massive pile of keywords which we can start whittling

116
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.070
down on.

117
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.390
At this point what we want to do now is I want to jump over to Google's keyword planner Now Google's

118
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.880
keyword planner is kind of the granddaddy of all keyword pointers.

119
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.610
It's comes from Google because they have all the information about who's searching for what all these

120
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.550
other third party services technically don't have the data.

121
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.310
They're just guessing based on what Google let them know.

122
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.960
Now of course Google doesn't want to tell you 100 percent of the truth because what's the point that

123
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:14.120
everyone would just focus on the only keywords that were getting traffic and everybody would ignore

124
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.770
all the other kind of corners of the Internet universe.

125
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.070
But anyway with Google Keyword planner the purpose here we're going to do with it is going to work on

126
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:27.320
plugging that giant list of keywords and variations into it and then we're to see which ones actually

127
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.220
get decent traffic and also feel like a good fit for you to focus on.

128
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.790
Now Google's keyword tool it's called keyword planner.

129
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:40.270
Now it's usually like add words Google dot com slash tool slash something like that.

130
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.820
Generally I just Google it just Google Google Keyword planner.

131
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.980
Always be the first results.

132
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.430
Now the traffic analysis they give you when you plug in your stuff and then just search for traffic

133
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.960
is going to give you some data.

134
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.860
But you still have to look at these terms and decide if they seem like a good match.

135
00:07:54.860 --> 00:08:01.820
So if you jump into that keyword planner and just Google it first result click on the button that says

136
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.920
Get search volume data and trends.

137
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.130
Now you'll see a window where you can paste your keyword in there.

138
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.630
You can actually copy and paste the entire list of the hundreds of keywords you've got.

139
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.030
And I'd like to save you enormous amount of time that what you do is just click get search volume and

140
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:15.910
at the bottom.

141
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.660
Now what is going to do is produce a long list of results.

142
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:24.200
But the easiest thing to do is to just export that list right out to Excel or whatever spreadsheet you

143
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.450
use you can analyze it.

144
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.690
So use the export function.

145
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:32.840
And then once you have that export it open it up again once you're in your sheet or your Excel or whatever

146
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.790
you guys use your air table whatever you can basically begin by eliminating terms with high volume that

147
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:39.060
are too competitive.

148
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:45.170
Now let's not obviously shoot for terms that huge companies are battling for sort the data by column

149
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.050
says average monthly searches.

150
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:52.880
Now any term with over 10000 volume like productivity apps or organization apps in our example.

151
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.100
I mean they're accurate and that's good.

152
00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.540
But you have to look at the competition of the competition high.

153
00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.700
And unfortunately it's just not something worth focusing on right now.

154
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:07.010
You can also ignore the terms that have low volume because of a lack of interest or include specific

155
00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:11.300
terms that you just don't necessarily want to include like you know messaging her organizer app and

156
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:16.320
someone search for room organizer or app or team organized organization app.

157
00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:22.060
Well those don't technically apply and that's kind of the game you play with these loose keyword matches.

158
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.470
So this might take a little bit of time.

159
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:28.370
Get rid of those ones that are way too competitive and then get rid of the ones that just don't get

160
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.590
enough traffic for you to really care.

161
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.400
Or you know the ones that just don't make any sense.

162
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.960
So one of the turns it starts to look interesting is organizer app.

163
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.980
Well it's slightly different from Organization app but different enough that the search volume is lower.

164
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.560
So might be a term we might look into.

165
00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.650
If I had to guess it's probably because it doesn't really make sense like why poets are in search for

166
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:49.720
organizer.

167
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:56.460
Usually it's like a task organizer app or task list or get organized or something like that.

168
00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.360
That's my guess but it seems like people are searching it now to get some more info on it.

169
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:05.690
Let's head over to Google trends so we can see how some of these promising terms of performed recently

170
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:10.940
nerver we use google translate a long time ago but it's pretty easy Google dot com slash trends pretty

171
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:11.480
straightforward.

172
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.700
Once you plug it in just answer the question.

173
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.290
Are they trending up or down.

174
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:20.360
Now ideally we want to go with keywords that are trending up or at least are holding steady and avoid

175
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.980
the ones that people are showing less interest in than before.

176
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:27.710
Because remember SEO is a long term play takes a lot of effort.

177
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.230
We don't want to work on something Finally rank in it.

178
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.460
When people stop using it.

179
00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:38.060
So let's type in productivity up organization app organizer app how to use Evernote into the field up

180
00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.550
top and see what it returns by default.

181
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.230
Stats for the last five years so let's go to the date range and change it to the last 12 months to see

182
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.270
if there's any more detail we can see.

183
00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:51.350
Well it's interesting because while all the terms of pretty steady interest I can see that organizer

184
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.120
has consistently had more interest than Organization.

185
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.010
Well it's a slightly different term but apparently that makes a big difference.

186
00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.850
You'll see this all over keywords you never thought would be more popular.

187
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:07.400
So if I were Evernote I want to make sure I added organizer to the list of keyword phrases I was using

188
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.780
in my articles and post.

189
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:13.250
Now repeat this process for each of the key word phrases you come across in your research that looks

190
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:18.590
promising promising meaning there's a difference between the competition and the search results.

191
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.480
It's in a healthy range of not too many searches not too few.

192
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.170
And the competition is manageable.

193
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.010
So really it's just these three steps.

194
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:31.310
If you read the key word phrase it should sound like something someone would use to try and find a product

195
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:32.450
or service like yours.

196
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:37.550
Then too the data should show that it has a decent search volume too high is too competitive and too

197
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.080
low means low interest.

198
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:45.290
And then three according to Google Trends we use that the interest should be steady or trending upwards.

199
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:50.420
Keywords that meet these three criteria should be the ones you consider focusing on when writing articles

200
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.920
and post for your website or blog.

201
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.840
As I've mentioned here are all free.

202
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:58.170
They'll pay for some other tools like SVM rush or words stream.

203
00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.950
While you can get more detailed information for keyword phrases.

204
00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:02.230
Now is it worth paying them.

205
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.030
Well if you're running a lot of content it might be.

206
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.810
But if you're just starting out or trying to expand or you've already been doing going through steps

207
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:14.330
like these might reveal new keyword phrases you didn't consider before the process after this is really

208
00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:19.880
better than picking the ones you think are the most promising have the biggest opportunity and then

209
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.770
you start preparing content or angling some of your old stuff for it.

210
00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:24.370
Sounds good.

211
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.410
OK let's posit here and end our next lecture.

212
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:30.600
We can take another scenario for a test drive to try and find more keyword phrases.

213
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.010
So either.
