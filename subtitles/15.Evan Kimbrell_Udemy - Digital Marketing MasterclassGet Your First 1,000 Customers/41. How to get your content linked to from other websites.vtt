00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.610
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.740
All right here we go one more time with info on how to promote your content.

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.250
So far we've talked about the ways you can promote your posts using social media channels and specifically

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.220
social media scheduling platforms like buffer and meet Edgar.

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.590
And we talked about how to promote your work by approaching and working with influencers.

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.700
Well there's one more tactic for promoting content that I want to tell you about and it's about getting

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.660
people to link to your stuff from their posts.

8
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.430
Those three promotional tactics we're talking about now are pretty much the big three.

9
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.110
If this record is dedicated to content marketing we might go into 15 different ways.

10
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.970
More specifically however we're just trying to get our first 500.

11
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.430
So these first three kind of bedrock foundational promotional strategies are really all you need to

12
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.000
stick with.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.380
Now if you didn't know even the slightest thing about the Internet or SEO or content marketing what

14
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.090
I could tell you is hey guess what.

15
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.790
When someone links from their page to your post that is generally a great thing.

16
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.330
Search engines see these links as endorsements.

17
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.130
So each link your posts get is like kind of getting another vote.

18
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.070
And as far as content marketing goes that's good because more people will find it through search.

19
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.670
But then also people who read that other article might see the link click through and then find yours.

20
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.720
This is all great.

21
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.410
And guess what.

22
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.470
People included links and their stuff all the time because they want to be valuable to their audience

23
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.530
what's more valuable than giving them lots of resources saving them the time of finding a great article

24
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.980
that elaborates on something they're just talking about.

25
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.280
So you know there are a few ways that you can get these magical links to your new post.

26
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.170
Now the first step to getting people to link to you is to figure out which of your post first of all

27
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.240
you're going to try and get links for.

28
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.440
It's relatively hard to work with multiple posts at a time trying to get links to way easier to just

29
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.440
pick one.

30
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.090
And really kind of drill down on it whatever it is for your first one and make sure it's one of your

31
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.980
better ones I'll make this whole this whole process a lot easier.

32
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.510
Now I'm sure you're proud of all of your work but when you're trying to get other people to link to

33
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.220
you you need to approach them with the best of your stuff.

34
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.120
OK so if you have some post in mind if you don't just kind of flip through whatever it is that you produced

35
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.140
at this point.

36
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.470
The second step is to find popular posts that are related to yours now being related to yours can sound

37
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.720
a little bit vague but not really.

38
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.010
What did you write about.

39
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.430
What conclusion did you come to.

40
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.610
Generally speaking there's going to be other ones out there that are similar.

41
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.720
When you wrote this one you probably were comparing it to other posts out there that were similar so

42
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.250
you probably should already have a list of ones out there.

43
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.450
You don't just get googling or using buzz sumo.

44
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.260
Now once you have a list of them there's a few ways you can approach this because there are different

45
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.600
kinds of value you could offer at the people who wrote those other posts.

46
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.720
That's the big question.

47
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.830
If someone wrote about it and I want them to link to me and that kind of awkward how do I get them to

48
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.200
do it.

49
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.140
Well really you're just going to try to connect the win win for them are going to convince them that

50
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.410
this will add value to their post.

51
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.650
And again of the content marketing or running their posts that's probably what they care about.

52
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.870
So let me go through each angle that you can use to get them to link back to you and you'll see what

53
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.350
I mean.

54
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.960
Now first of all you could ask that person who made a post to be included in a listicle that links to

55
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.180
other posts similar to yours.

56
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.480
Let's say you wrote a post about how to create a WordPress template from scratch real original.

57
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.340
Well there's bound to be some top 10 list or others like it that linked to similar tutorials like the

58
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.040
top 10 ways to create or add plus templates or something like that.

59
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.520
Somebody who wrote an ultimate guide about WordPress probably addressed the fact that the beginning

60
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.240
you might start from scratch.

61
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.720
Someone out there is probably compiled a resource collection that list off all the great things you

62
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.940
can find if you're just getting into Wordpress or from soup to nuts start to finish WordPress.

63
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.100
Now you could use buzz Zumo to help find some of these you Grimbal buddy help you find popular engaging

64
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.600
posts about your topic.

65
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.490
You could use Buzz Summa or you could even go to Google if you had to and just search for posts relevant

66
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.490
to your post.

67
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.090
In this case you'd look for things like you know ways to create a WordPress template or Wordpress template

68
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.830
tutorials.

69
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.480
Or you could do what I just said before and do WordPress template tutorial ultimate guide or stick some

70
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.320
of those things in there.

71
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.210
Top 10 top 8 WordPress whatever.

72
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.910
If you just fish around you'll find stuff that you can find any popular list or resource pages that

73
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.960
link out to multiple tutorials and you've got a great lead.

74
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.240
So contact the author of the post or the person who runs the blog.

75
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.020
Shoot them an email or other kind of message and then tell them about your post.

76
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.390
How are you going to contact with them.

77
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.500
Well generally they have a contact information on their page.

78
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.210
If they don't generally you can do a contact form or you can post a comment on their post or you can

79
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.330
always do email hunting which we covered in a different lecture email.

80
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.580
Hunting is basically just guessing their email address because as it turns out you can guess probably

81
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.760
90 percent of people's email addresses.

82
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.490
Now when you actually do get into contact with them let them know that you think their post is great

83
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:02.800
but you'd like to know if they can maybe add in yours obviously you don't make it that straightforward.

84
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.740
You say maybe it's missing something or maybe this section could be improved.

85
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.320
Here's a great way to do it.

86
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.150
In some cases authors are going to be more than happy to add links because it increases the value of

87
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.020
their post.

88
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.640
Other times they're just not going to want to touch it because they're busy and not want to go back.

89
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.540
In the case of them being too busy or they want to do it though you might be able to add a comment to

90
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.610
their blog post or suggest your post as another source of value for anyone else as are checking things

91
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:27.110
out.

92
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.920
Do you really think of this as a kind of a last resort.

93
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.600
But if you're trying to get links from say like a really old post and they're just not motivated to

94
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.960
do.

95
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.310
You're not getting responses or this flat out say no.

96
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.100
Well this is one way to do it.

97
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.110
Post in the comments.

98
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.140
Either way the people seeing that popular post may begin then checking out your post.

99
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.390
So that's one way to promote your work.

100
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.870
Find people who have lots of links coming out their page that are remotely relevant.

101
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.550
Try to get into contact with them see if they can add this as a value add to their thing.

102
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.130
Try to make it as easy as possible for them.

103
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.540
If they say no.

104
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.680
Just try to sneak it in on the comments.

105
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:07.110
So let's say that you've written a post about a specific strategy or a single step that's part of a

106
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.150
much larger process like for example you might have some great ideas about how to deal with people who

107
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.390
complain on Twitter.

108
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.740
You've got specific tips or maybe some tools or templates you use.

109
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.680
So you write a post about dealing with those Twitter trolls.

110
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:20.730
There's so many of them.

111
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.160
Well you know some people out there have written higher level posts about the same topic.

112
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.460
What I mean is that the post isn't as specific as yours but it covers a broader area so maybe there's

113
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.950
a really popular guide for some big web site about how to use social media to engage with customers

114
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.680
in general and one much smaller part of that guide deal specifically with your topic.

115
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.040
The Twitter trolls oftentimes that big guide will not want to spend a lot of time getting into the weeds

116
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.290
of something so specific.

117
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.670
So it's very easy and very rational for them to instead link out to something that specializes in it.

118
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.110
Well your post goes in a greater detail than that broader gargled and you've got a great opportunity.

119
00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:00.000
You can contact that offer of that god and again tell them how great their stuff is but then alert them

120
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.270
to this opportunity.

121
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.310
I happen to have a post that's all about dealing with the specific point you mentioned and I bet your

122
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.630
readers would appreciate reading it.

123
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.010
So I was hoping you might consider linking to it now.

124
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.440
You're not just asking for something you're promising additional value for the bloggers readers and

125
00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.140
in that way it's a win win.

126
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:20.010
If you want to find these guides you'll want to fire up buzz over google again and do some searches.

127
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:24.990
In this case you have to think about where your posts would fit if it was a part of a larger group of

128
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.070
post or guide.

129
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.030
Now take this idea and then just flip it on its head.

130
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.650
What if you're the one that wrote the broad piece if you linked out to posts with specific detail where

131
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.560
you can actually then ask them for a link in return.

132
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.560
Great way to open up a conversation is hey of your stuff.

133
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.660
I wrote a really big blog and I immediately thought of you I like your stuff so much that I link to

134
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.990
you here and I know people enjoyed it and click through because I have the stats here.

135
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.110
Oh by the way I wrote something it's very similar we have similar audiences would you be able to link

136
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.160
to me in return.

137
00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.360
No that's not really a weird conversation so let's say you wrote a beginner's guide just starting an

138
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.330
email newsletter.

139
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.830
You mentioned all the important things you list some email providers.

140
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.070
You talk about building a list setting up a forum for subscriptions.

141
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.870
All that stuff.

142
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:13.920
Well if you decided not to go into great detail on any of these points then you could link out to great

143
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.650
posts that offer the details for you.

144
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.790
And nothing is stopping you from searching for those great sources and then linking to them.

145
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.450
But when you add a link you could also contact those sources and let them know hey I've written this

146
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:29.070
Beginner's Guide and I've added a link to your post on how to manage email us because it's a great resource.

147
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.040
Then ask them to link back to you.

148
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.930
I hope you'd consider linking back to our posts from yours.

149
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:34.800
We'd appreciate it.

150
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:40.980
So each of these three outreach strategies looking for someone with a guide that has lots of different

151
00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:45.870
sections and then you write something specific that fits in that section you get a link from them.

152
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:51.710
The other one is just looking for relevant post and just act asking them directly or posting their comments.

153
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.880
And the third one is you write a large post because then you can link out curry some favor with other

154
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.270
people and eventually use those to cash and links backwards.

155
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:04.350
Now each of these three we need to search for posts that are obviously relevant are complimentary to

156
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:04.890
our own.

157
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.740
Finding people that are relevant.

158
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.070
It's pretty easy and there's no real magic to it.

159
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.620
It's just the amount of time you take this under you you'd easily outsource anyone who can understand

160
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.960
