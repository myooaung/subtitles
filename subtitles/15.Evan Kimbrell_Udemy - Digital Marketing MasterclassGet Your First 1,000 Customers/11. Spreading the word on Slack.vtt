Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.780
OK, the last two lectures we seeked out,
2

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.880
sooked out, that word will always forever haunt me,
3

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.460
sought out and destroyed some forum communities.
4

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.530
Tons and tons of them out there,
and it's really low hanging fruit.
5

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.250
It just takes some time to find them,
6

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.890
then find the people you need to message.
7

8
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.010
Now, in this lecture we're going to explore a relatively
new crop up in communities called Slack. Slack, for
8

9
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.010
those of you who are not cool, is a team productivity
tool that's gotten really popular amongst tech
9

10
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.090
companies for interdepartmental chit-chat. Slack is
basically a chat room, except with cool colors and
10

11
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.040
smooth interaction design.
11

12
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.810
In reality, it's really just like a re-skinned ICQ
or AIM chat room from the 90s, but it's made
12

13
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.700
such that it works a whole lot better.
13

14
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.190
You can kind of get a hint of their
origin by looking at their logo.
14

15
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.590
Yes, that background is plaid,
15

16
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.230
the unmistakable mark of a hipster or, my new favorite
term, lumbersexual, who only uses something if
16

17
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.420
it's pretty and expensive.
17

18
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.590
Check and check.
18

19
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.110
Anyway, what Slack wasn't predicting was the online
revival of free communities using their platform
19

20
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.980
for water cooler talking. And well, here we are, getting
ready to use those same communities to sell our stuff.
20

21
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.480
for water cooler talking. And well, here we are, getting
ready to use those same communities to sell our stuff.
21

22
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.040
So the first place to look for a Slack community
that might fit your space is to simply google any
22

23
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.260
of the keywords you were previously using plus slack.com.
23

24
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.190
of the keywords you were previously using plus slack.com.
24

25
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.910
If that doesn't really work out for you,
25

26
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.580
try .slack.com instead.
26

27
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.230
That sometimes works. And if neither of those work,
then we can use one of two or three community lists.
27

28
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.550
First, there is a slacklist.info - it, as you can guess, lists Slacks.
28

29
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.970
First, there is a slacklist.info - it, as you can guess, lists Slacks.
29

30
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.410
Yes, I know, real original.
30

31
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.770
If you can't find what you're looking for on that website,
then I've listed in the resources some Medium
31

32
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.070
and Inc.com posts that have attempted to one up each
other in terms of "how many Slack groups can we
32

33
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.980
list." One of them has listed like 400,
so you can probably find one.
33

34
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.810
I've also linked to some ultimate lists that only have 200.
34

35
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.100
So it's fair to say that it's ultimate more in the way that
Frisbee can be ultimate. Slack is currently new-ish,
35

36
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.810
So it's fair to say that it's ultimate more in the way that
Frisbee can be ultimate. Slack is currently new-ish,
36

37
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.440
so the ease at which you can find
communities on it is pretty limited.
37

38
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.060
Later on when you guys take this course,
38

39
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.170
maybe there's a search engine for Slack
groups, but right now, it's pretty limited.
39

40
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.190
Oh and also, side point, I'm not even sure if the company
wants people to be using their system like this.
40

41
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.550
Anyway, brush that off, grab a handful off
of the community posts or slacklist.info
41

42
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.390
or just through googling, the ones you
think will actually work, and then join them.
42

43
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.760
If you haven't used Slack before, well, now is the
time to try. Go to Slack.com and you just install it.
43

44
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.000
If you haven't used Slack before, well, now is the
time to try. Go to Slack.com and you just install it.
44

45
00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.030
It's really one of the easier things ever to install,
but it takes maybe an hour or two to get used to
45

46
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.970
how to use all of its features and how to talk correctly.
46

47
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.730
Slack works on your phone, it works on your browser,
it works on your desktop, it works on your iPad,
47

48
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.010
and of course, it also works on your Palm Pilot.
48

49
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.010
Once you're in it, it sort of looks like this.
49

50
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.400
You can see it on the screen.
50

51
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.500
Groups are divided into channels and will kind of light
up white when there's new activity, when someone
51

52
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.990
just said something. The name of the game here
in Slack groups is relatively simple, and it's for the
52

53
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:34.050
most part exactly like the forum game we just really
went over. Slack absolutely does allow direct messaging,
53

54
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.330
and currently there's no real system limiting
you from taking advantage of that.
54

55
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.100
Obviously, don't be obnoxious with it.
55

56
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:48.090
Try watching discussions and when you identify people that
you think are actually worthwhile, then reach out to them.
56

57
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.660
Try watching discussions and when you identify people that
you think are actually worthwhile, then reach out to them.
57

58
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.640
Please, God, do not just go and message
every single person in a group.
58

59
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.420
You'll get banned very quickly.
59

60
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.870
Again, use the same techniques we
talked about before, ask for feedback,
60

61
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.240
or again, try to say something they said and build off of it.
61

62
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.080
Now, alternatively, yes, you can join in on the conversation,
but be aware that these conversations are pretty ephemeral.
62

63
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.920
Now, alternatively, yes, you can join in on the conversation,
but be aware that these conversations are pretty ephemeral.
63

64
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.170
People see them and then they get
buried pretty quickly in the feed.
64

65
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.200
So it's not enough to do essentially a drive-by post
and post one thing and then just leave. In order
65

66
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.280
to be effective and to get people to actually go to
your site, you really need to stick around and field
66

67
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.540
questions or follow up or, you know, just be there.
67

68
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.030
Otherwise, it's just the case that enough people
probably aren't going to focus on your link
68

69
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.080
or they might just see it once and not think anything of it.
69

70
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.210
Slack is, especially in some of the
generic entrepreneurship sections,
70

71
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.880
a great place to play that feedback
card that we talked about before.
71

72
00:04:42.905 --> 00:04:48.186
In the other communities, if there's a channel labeled
something like #feedback or #help or #questions,
72

73
00:04:48.211 --> 00:04:55.717
then you're generally good to go and post in there saying what
you've done, why, and then ask for feedback on your thing.
73

74
00:04:55.742 --> 00:05:01.631
Again, don't just post one sentence, two sentences, give
some background, explain what you're struggling with,
74

75
00:05:01.656 --> 00:05:03.217
say something interesting.
75

76
00:05:03.242 --> 00:05:08.462
If the community you're looking at doesn't have
something like this, then just be a little more careful.
76

77
00:05:08.487 --> 00:05:12.553
if you're going to post in something that's not
designated for feedback, or sharing what you're doing,
77

78
00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:15.264
it definitely helps to preface your post with something like,
78

79
00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:20.577
"Not sure if this is the right place to post this,"
and potentially at the end even ask if
79

80
00:05:20.602 --> 00:05:22.710
"Hey, is there a better place to post this?"
80

81
00:05:22.735 --> 00:05:25.022
Again, we trick people with vulnerability.
81

82
00:05:25.047 --> 00:05:27.835
In general, with Slack, just because
of the way the chat dynamics work,
82

83
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.374
try to keep your posts short,
3-4 sentences are pretty much ideal.
83

84
00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:36.960
Anything over 3-4 sentences and you're
going to be taken for kind of like a ranter
84

85
00:05:36.985 --> 00:05:39.835
and not as many people will read it,
they'll see it's long and just skip it.
85

86
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.647
Okay, that really just about wraps up Slack chats.
86

87
00:05:42.672 --> 00:05:48.155
They're really just a new form of a forum,
but because they're free form and real time,
87

88
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.702
there are a lot of opportunities to get in
and get your information out there.
88

89
00:05:51.727 --> 00:05:56.264
I strongly suggest you take some time
to feel out the groups just a little bit
89

90
00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.655
and to contribute to the discussions
a little bit before you post.
90

91
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.381
For instance, if you know you're going to be
posting in, say, like the #random channel,
91

92
00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:09.295
then try to join a conversation with some
of the more frequent talkers of that channel.
92

93
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.025
Those people are more likely than not going to be
the first responders when you post something
93

94
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.463
about your business or about your product,
94

95
00:06:16.488 --> 00:06:18.853
so make sure they've actually seen you once,
95

96
00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:21.142
so they don't think you just joined, posted, and left.
96

97
00:06:21.167 --> 00:06:30.127
And by all means, under no circumstances should you ever
write @everyone or @channel or @here in your posts.
97

98
00:06:30.152 --> 00:06:33.127
What that does is it blasts literally everyone in the channel
98

99
00:06:33.152 --> 00:06:36.791
and it will result in the gods being
very, very angry with you.
99

100
00:06:36.815 --> 00:06:42.453
I'm pretty sure that the incorrect usage of
@everyone is exactly how black holes are formed.
100

101
00:06:42.477 --> 00:06:44.477
Check it out. It's a fact.
