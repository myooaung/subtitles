All right, and we are back. In this lecture, we're
going to get to understand Reddit just a little
1

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.690
bit more, so we can understand how it works,
2

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.290
and of course, why it could be great for
getting traffic to your product or service.
3

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.120
Now, we've covered in passing quite a bit about
Reddit already. Reddit's byline is "the front page of
4

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.400
the internet" because it's essentially
a gigantic community generated forum.
5

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.650
When you first log in, you'll see what they call the
front page, which is for the day the most popular
6

7
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.340
posts from all over the website,
7

8
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.420
so it's effectively like the front page of a newspaper,
8

9
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.000
if the newspaper was Reddit, which would be a really
weird newspaper. Reddit, like all online communities,
9

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.520
has its own personality,
10

11
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.600
but it's often hard to generalize the entire group as
one thing. Since we know that Reddit is broken into
11

12
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.030
subreddits, also known as subs,
12

13
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.900
we can get the gist that it's really just thousands and
thousands of communities all under one header.
13

14
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.980
Each community could be entirely
different from another community.
14

15
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.140
My favorite thing about Reddit is what they call Rule 34 from their
list of rules somewhere. If it exists, there's a subreddit for it.
15

16
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.040
My favorite thing about Reddit is what they call Rule 34 from their
list of rules somewhere. If it exists, there's a subreddit for it.
16

17
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.450
I challenge you to think of the most obscure thing
you do or hobby you know of and search to see if
17

18
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.090
it has a subreddit - it probably does.
18

19
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.750
Now, it's important to understand how 
their system works. At a thousand feet,
19

20
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.500
it's just millions of people sharing images, stories,
jokes, and links that they thought might be useful
20

21
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.800
or add value to each individual
subreddit or subcommunity.
21

22
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.570
If it's good, people upvote it.
22

23
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.310
If it's bad and doesn't fit the vibe
of the group, it gets downvoted.
23

24
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.510
The more you strike a chord with your group,
the more upvotes and the more exposure.
24

25
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.480
So that's going to be the name of
the game in the next set of lectures.
25

26
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.040
How can we introduce our product or business without
going against the grain of the specific community
26

27
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.710
that we target in Reddit?
27

28
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.370
Remember, if you do this right, you can get millions of views.
28

29
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.650
There are entire venture backed startups
that started from one popular Reddit post.
29

30
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.690
Now, the best way to tackle this is in five steps.
30

31
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.000
First, we want to raise our Reddit IQ so we don't sound
like your friend's mom when she wants to sound cool.
31

32
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.840
First, we want to raise our Reddit IQ so we don't sound
like your friend's mom when she wants to sound cool.
32

33
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.060
Second, we want to find our communities where
we think our target customers are hanging out.
33

34
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.840
Third, we want to perch from a distance, wait, watch,
and mumble to ourselves softly. Fourth, we want to start
34

35
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.750
participating by inserting our wisdom where we can.
35

36
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.360
And lastly, we want to start creating our own posts.
36

37
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.800
Unlike in the last sections, we have to do a lot more
homework and we have to be a little more creative
37

38
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.320
if we're going to pull this off correctly.
38

39
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.770
Keep in mind, a bad post in Reddit
can still get you a handful of customers.
39

40
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.510
It's just the ones that are done semi-well can then get you
hundreds and potentially could be repeated in the future.
40

41
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.460
It's just the ones that are done semi-well can then get you
hundreds and potentially could be repeated in the future.
41

42
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.410
So go ahead, and if you haven't already,
go to Reddit.com and create an account.
42

43
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.880
So go ahead, and if you haven't already,
go to Reddit.com and create an account.
43

44
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.630
It's free, because that would be sad
if you had to pay for memes.
44

45
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.270
It'll take five seconds. What do you name your account?
45

46
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.940
Well, I'll give you a hint.
46

47
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.340
Don't name it after your business.
When you first start posting on Reddit,
47

48
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.430
people will try everything they can to
figure out if you're what they call a shill.
48

49
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.290
So don't make their job easier.
49

50
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.010
In fact, if you're easily connected to your business
through like an About Us page or anything obvious
50

51
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.560
like your LinkedIn page,
51

52
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.840
then I would suggest using maybe something
like your first and middle name.
52

53
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.400
then I would suggest using maybe something
like your first and middle name.
53

54
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.520
So instead of Evan Kimbrell, it's Evan Earl.
54

55
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.680
Yes, my middle name is Earl.
55

56
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.810
I'm over it and we are moving on.
56

57
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.430
Or, alternatively, you could just give
yourself any random name you can think of.
57

58
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.320
What's that incredibly embarrassing name of
58

59
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.580
the first email address you ever had?
59

60
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.770
Yeah, that one. Use it.
60

61
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:44.320
Yeah, that one. Use it.
61

62
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.110
All right, we are set up and ready to move
on to the first step in Reddit domination.
62

63
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.670
Not really, but we're going to start.
63

64
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.120
See you then.
