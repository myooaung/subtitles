1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:00,930
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,740
Welcome back to the course, the last lecture, I give you the lowdown on Instagram.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,170
And for many of you out there, you're probably well versed already if you use Instagram and know all

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,920
the features and sections of it, please, for the love of God, skip this lecture.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,770
I don't want to hear you complain about it later.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,970
However, I'm going to go over the process of creating a business account for Instagram, which has

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,650
some advantages over the plain old regular account, just about as everyone else does.

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,230
So if you're an Instagram master, skip this.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,030
If you're curious what the difference in business, Instagram and personal Instagram is, maybe you

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,070
increase the speed to two X and watch it.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,520
And if you guys don't have Instagram account, well, I would suggest following along anyway.

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,290
So let's jump in for Instagram account.

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,020
You have those two options I mentioned that you can create and use a regular Instagram account or you

14
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,870
could create and use a business Instagram account.

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,610
Some of the additional features business accounts have are going to be contact buttons for your customers

16
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,660
that they can actually use.

17
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,230
And then it gives you access to insights, data with a capital.

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,420
Which gives you data about your post, your followers and really any promotions that you've run.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,510
Now, Insight's is the same data that's used on Facebook.

20
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,340
So if you want a business account and access to this extra data on your followers as well, which is

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,260
generally a good idea, well, then you must have a Facebook page, unfortunately, to connect it to.

22
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,150
So if you want a business account, but you don't have a Facebook page yet, go set that up right now.

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,970
Really, really simple.

24
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,300
Takes two seconds.

25
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,830
No one actually sees the page.

26
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,240
So you have to do is fill it out.

27
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,830
You don't want to put a photo or anything.

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,970
Just go to Facebook dot com slash pages and then just follow those steps.

29
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,340
Again, you do have to customize it young to post.

30
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,100
Should honestly take it two minutes and I will wait.

31
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:38,580
OK.

32
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,770
Now let's get you hooked up with an Instagram account whether you want a business or a regular account.

33
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,590
Either way, you need to sign up for a regular account first.

34
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,210
Now, here are the first steps.

35
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,690
Now, guys, if you've done this before, please don't watch this lecture.

36
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,690
But otherwise, let's do it.

37
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,510
Number one, you got to download Instagram.

38
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,120
Got to do it on your iPhone or your Android.

39
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,640
Pretty sure they have an app for every platform.

40
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,630
Just download it.

41
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,650
You have to do it on your phone.

42
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,790
You can't do it on the web.

43
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,730
Number two, start it up and then tag right there on sign up.

44
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,580
Number three, then, as you know, since this is going to be your business.

45
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,370
Well, enter your business name and your business email address.

46
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,810
You'll get confirmation email.

47
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,400
Always make sure to verify that the number four is if you already have an Instagram account and you

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,170
want to turn it into a business account.

49
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,610
And it's generally a good idea, although, you know, if you use it for personal things has nothing

50
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,620
to do with your business plan.

51
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,600
I generally suggest keeping these separate, but kind of weird.

52
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,420
If all your friends are following you and you just turn into a business.

53
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,860
But if you wanted to do that.

54
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,420
Well, and just follow these next steps.

55
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,560
Now, if you want to just use a regular account and then not link to a Facebook page, you can actually

56
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,970
skip these steps.

57
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,770
Again, I don't generally suggest doing that, but if you want to save time, you could.

58
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,070
OK.

59
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,510
So if your regular account is set up, then just go to settings and then choose change to a business

60
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:51,810
account.

61
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,340
It's actually really that simple.

62
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,160
Pick the Facebook page you want to link to for this account.

63
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,570
That's kind of it.

64
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,910
You just then have to fill out a business profile your friend and put in contact info and at a minimum,

65
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,860
you put in a different email address.

66
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,830
But, you know, add your address if that actually applies to you.

67
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,970
Now, if you connect your Facebook page to your Instagram account, you should get a notification in

68
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,840
Facebook to connect your Facebook page to the new Instagram account.

69
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,490
Now, it's just another connection that should help you when you're doing stuff on your Facebook page.

70
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,350
So go ahead and just do that.

71
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,640
If you see it now, if your Instagram account is brand new, well, then you just have to add in the

72
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,080
basic info to your profile.

73
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,330
Short description, you are l a profile picture now in Instagram.

74
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,160
You can't actually just upload a logo and you know, if it's on your phone, well, and just go for

75
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,220
it.

76
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:35,940
But while you're here.

77
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,220
Be sure to include a specific call to action.

78
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,730
What are you hoping Instagram followers do when they come across your account?

79
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,810
The way that describes generally works is that it's just like any other content marketing.

80
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:51,240
You're going to make photos or videos that are interesting, attractive and somehow related to whatever

81
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,020
your topic is.

82
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,220
People see your account.

83
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,570
They follow it for updates.

84
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,280
And occasionally they'll see that you're going to try to link them back to your site or link them to

85
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,330
something that you want to sell.

86
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,940
A lot of business discovery happens on Instagram now.

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,890
So do you want them to go to a landing page to, say, sign up for an event or something like that?

88
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,640
Or are you trying to get them to say, subscribe to an email newsletter?

89
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,390
Maybe.

90
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,000
Do you want them to contact you directly through e-mail?

91
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,970
Or is there some other goal that you want to get out of this?

92
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,820
This call to action should be the last line of your profile.

93
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,720
Let's look an example.

94
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,960
Michelle Melchor as an artist who you can commission for art.

95
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,860
But on her Instagram account, the last line of her profile says for print purchases, visit her Web

96
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,170
site.

97
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,840
OK, well, her goals pretty clear here.

98
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,910
You like what she see?

99
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,440
You see?

100
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,620
Well, you can buy it from Irv's click that link.

101
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,820
So what's your goal?

102
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,550
Decide on your goal and included in your bio.

103
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,490
So this Instagram account can get you the results you want.

104
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,270
Really?

105
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,620
It's quite simple.

106
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,300
If you guys want to do really simple stuff, then I'd say make a quick landing page that they can then

107
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,200
go to and then give you your email address.

108
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,240
You can sell them later.

109
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,020
But if you're in like e-commerce and you're selling something from the front of your page, they just

110
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,780
put a link to that.

111
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,670
This called.

112
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,910
All you have to do is click on the edit profile from your profile screen to see a spot for you or you

113
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,300
are L.

114
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,830
So if you're driving people to a landing page or some other, you are l enter it right there, then

115
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:16,250
add a line at the end of your bio and use this trick at a colon at the end, something like use code

116
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:21,800
instead 20 to see that my store or contact me for a free quote here, didn't I?

117
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,640
It's pretty important that you give them some kind of an incentive to go right.

118
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:32,270
Otherwise, it's just a link and it's not enough for them to go from, like, browsing on their phone

119
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:32,580
to you.

120
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,130
I actually want to go purchase something.

121
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,310
Now, what's cool is here you are.

122
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,220
I will always show up right after the end of your bio.

123
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:43,340
So by adding that colon at the end, it actually makes it look like the two things are connected.

124
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,930
I mean, they obviously are.

125
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,220
But now there's a clear reason to click because you added that text in your bio.

126
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,300
Now, once you've got your account set, it's a good time to explore what you can do here.

127
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,730
Now, here's a quick rundown of Instagram's features.

128
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,610
Take a stroll left to right along the bottom icons with me now.

129
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,470
Home shows you your feed of people you follow and their pictures.

130
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,870
For some reason, Instagram doesn't show these in sequential order, which they used to.

131
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,170
And I'm not sure why they did it.

132
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,590
Now, for whatever reason, it's a feed run off of their own algorithm.

133
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,440
So it's in some kind of logical order.

134
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,290
And it does now include ads.

135
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,090
Still a great way to see what people are posting.

136
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,350
However, a lot of times don't even notice that the timeline is kind of screwed up.

137
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,790
Now, the next thing on the bottom bar is a search, and that allows you to search for people by their

138
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,900
name or handle.

139
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,480
And you can search for past tags as well as places.

140
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,220
It also shows pictures that are popular right now, usually influenced by your history.

141
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,020
For example, you might see a note at the bottom of the picture that says based on photos you liked.

142
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:49,220
Now, the third icon is to post and you can choose a picture or video from your phone or take one.

143
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,530
Now you have the option of choosing multiple pictures to make a gallery that can be swiped through.

144
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,360
Once you've taken or chosen a picture, you can apply filters to adjust the colors.

145
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,800
Do mild editing like cropping, changing the brightness and contrast.

146
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,590
And then you add the info, a caption, you know, you can try to tag people in it by linking to their

147
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,550
Instagram profile.

148
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,990
You can say tag it with location and then it shows up when people are searching for that location.

149
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,060
And if you want, you can cross posted on any linked profiles you have, like on Facebook or Twitter.

150
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,930
Now we'll get into what you should post and ideas for captions and tags later.

151
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:28,040
But for now, let's actually just continue on our tour so that we're not completely clueless about how

152
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,730
Instagram works.

153
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,680
Metaphors icon on the bottom is that heart, but it's basically your engagement activity.

154
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,560
Who started following you?

155
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,140
Who left your post, who commented on your posts and who liked your comments?

156
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:43,820
Now, if you click following up top, you can also see stuff like the people you follow.

157
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,850
It's a way discover new stuff that you might not have noticed because their usual feed is pretty mucked

158
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,030
up.

159
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,260
The last icon is your profile and it's important page, since people will be checking this out to see

160
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,100
who you are and what you've posted with a personal Instagram account.

161
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,700
You'll see a profile picture and name, bio link and all your posts, along with the number of followers

162
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,500
and people you follow on a business account.

163
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,200
You'll also see a category under their name like Target.

164
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,900
We'll show retail company or Domino's Pizza.

165
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,720
We'll show garbage company with a new account.

166
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,060
It makes sense at this point to start following people.

167
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,400
When you follow someone, they'll get a notification.

168
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:23,390
So it's a way to give people a heads up that you're now on the platform.

169
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,370
So this is hardly follow anyone.

170
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,850
But following people can only increase your chances of getting a follow back.

171
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,080
So I say go for it.

172
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,280
The basic premise behind Instagram bots, if you're curious, is that there are these programs that

173
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,880
will just follow people that have certain interests and then those people get ping that you follow them.

174
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,410
And a lot of times they'll then check out your profile and follow you back, or they might actually

175
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,970
just click through your your app.

176
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:51,380
Now, one important way is you get your first batch of followers is just to promote yourself to your

177
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,150
own audience through your other channels.

178
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,980
Generally, I say just get on Facebook, Twitter, email and your blog and let people know that, hey,

179
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,540
I now have an Instagram account.

180
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,880
Be sure to include what they can expect.

181
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:08,060
You to post tips, videos behind the scenes stuff, give them some kind of clue why they should care

182
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,970
and why they should go and take the five seconds to add you.

183
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,270
If you're not sure what to post, well, we'll cover some ideas in the next lecture.

184
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,130
So just stay tuned for a little bit longer.

185
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,470
Not work for new people you can follow right on Instagram, search by name if you know them, or search

186
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,250
by hashtag and see who's posting about things that are relevant to you.

187
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,890
And you sell custom design t shirts through your online store.

188
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,090
Maybe start by searching for hashtag t shirt and see what comes up.

189
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,660
Don't just look at the pictures, though.

190
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,760
Look for other related hashtags in the descriptions of these pictures.

191
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,250
Maybe hashtag streetwear is maybe your style or passion.

192
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,530
Funny t shirt could be a little bit closer.

193
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,880
Kind of depends what your angle is.

194
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,170
If you see people posting pictures that might relate to you or your product will follow their account,

195
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,990
maybe even like when their photos or maybe even leave a comment.

196
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,040
Don't obviously go for the hard sell and say, hey, check us out and buy our t shirts.

197
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,750
Just generally doesn't work.

198
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,540
Just generally compliment them, make sure that they are aware that you exist.

199
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,680
And then just move on.

200
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,760
Let the engagement you do marinate a bit and the result will eventually come.

201
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,160
It will take a little bit of time, though.

202
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,800
Now, if you wanna be sneaky about getting fallers, try this one out.

203
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,630
Search for your competitors on Instagram.

204
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,040
Click on their profile and then click their followers number and you can see who follows them.

205
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,380
Well, then go through and follow a whole bunch of those.

206
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,650
Usually Instagram limits you.

207
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,570
I think it's 200 followers a day and you don't generally want to get that close.

208
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,110
So maybe you do 50 or 100 a day.

209
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,770
What should happen is you'll get some followers back from some of those people, specially if they have

210
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,370
an interest in that competitor and they realize that, hey, you're a similar product.

211
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,320
Here's another thing you can do with competitors.

212
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,770
Look at their recent posts and then see who's left comments.

213
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,420
If you see a comment from someone who looks like they might be a possible follower for you, like their

214
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,770
comment or follow them.

215
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,240
Now, Shopify didn't experiment like this where they found competitor followers and followed them,

216
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,430
liked one of their pictures and they just commented on one of their picks.

217
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,660
In each case, it increased the chances of a follow back.

218
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,860
And if he did all three, well, there is something like a thirty three percent chance they'd follow

219
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,140
you back pretty much within 24 hours.

220
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,780
That's probably works better if you have pictures on your account.

221
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,930
So maybe keep this tactic in your back pocket for now.

222
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,020
No one likes to go and see an empty account because they're not going to follow that.

223
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:21,220
Not only does this get you followers who are interested in your type of product, but it's a way to

224
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,800
stick it to a competitor as well.

225
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,960
Instagram is for posting pictures and videos.

226
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,700
So in our next hour, we'll talk about taking pictures and then getting the promotions rolling with

227
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,090
those.

228
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,450
All right.

229
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:30,930
See you then.
