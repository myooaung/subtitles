00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,290
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:08,730
OK Sue we just covered making a system for tracking your content ideas pretty important to list them

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,680
out and to have something that you can easily input them.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:20,430
When the idea actually comes to you in in lecture what we did I think we used Google sheets to just

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,310
list them out.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:21,590
Right.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,960
And then I gave some criteria that you could use to sort them or at least label them so that later on

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,290
you can find whatever you're looking for.

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,920
It's really important that you do label these out because later on when you have 60 70 ideas and let's

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,230
say you only have enough time to do a short post or how you can determine which of those are theoretically

11
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,110
short posts you know spending hours just going through all of them to pick the one that you wanted.

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,700
It also helps if you can give them readings so you can prioritize and focus on the ideas you think are

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:01,510
the most obviously valuable and the ones that you think are more easy to promote Really.

14
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,540
You know the day content is all about promotion.

15
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,860
So your resume is great but it just doesn't make any sense for how to promote it you know idea.

16
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,880
OK let's not nearly as good as something that's half OK but it's really obvious how to get distribution

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,510
how to get people looking at this.

18
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,810
Anyway so this is what I use and it's a bit old and outdated.

19
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,750
If anybody's been following my blog I don't blog a lot.

20
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,150
I tried doing it but it's just not something that I Wike doing.

21
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,300
And I'm not consistent enough.

22
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:30,600
Right.

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,460
So this was a channel I explored put some work and effort into it and then just kind of realized it's

24
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,380
not really worth it anyway so I use air table and now is something you mentioned before.

25
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,800
This is the way I've set it up.

26
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,400
So this is my content pipeline over here.

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,230
I list the names of all of my content ideas.

28
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,330
There were a lot more in here but I guess I actually finished a lot of them.

29
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:59,460
This is where I put the status so I could sort by editing it and my writing it.

30
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,180
Am I just planning it where am I at.

31
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:07,370
And then the date would be the launch date and rate so I could list these out.

32
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,000
I want this in this month or on this specific date.

33
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:16,520
So if I were just looking at what I need to get done now I would sort by this I put summary notes right

34
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,390
here because its really helpful because a lot of times you'll put down an idea and then later on you'll

35
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,630
come back to it and you're like what does that mean.

36
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:30,040
I have no idea what I'm talking about like this introvert OK wat is that me.

37
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,630
So I put some notes as an opportunity to do that.

38
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,700
I put an approval column.

39
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:41,490
The reason I did this is because I was working with other people and so they were doing research and

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,470
editing and things like that so I would have to prove it to say yes I want I think this is good enough

41
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,370
to go on my blog or go to the next stage and the next thing I did is a format.

42
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,180
Now the format I think is really important to tag them like this.

43
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:02,130
And if you guys use our table to really easy to tag I literally can just go in here and add whatever

44
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,230
I want.

45
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:09,450
Not logged into this I got it but so what I did was e-mail I guess like guest posting.

46
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,050
Cora for making long court posts they then copy to my blog.

47
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,720
Now they have things like a public publish on medium or some of these are actually mini sites.

48
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,080
So this one's a mini site.

49
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,050
And so I did end up actually launching this one.

50
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,680
This is what it ended up looking like.

51
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,340
If you guys saw it on product thought or not so I would have checked this one off.

52
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,510
But anyway so what I can do is like I a lot of time and already something big I get sort by this and

53
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,360
look for my mini site ideas if I had something I was really short I could just look for blogs or core

54
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:44,340
posts or something small then what it is I put them in the category thats obviously really important

55
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,260
that you know which categories your audience wants.

56
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,450
And so I had entrepreneurship business and strategy and then I had kind of a catch all for everything

57
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:58,130
else which is like technology but all my stuff probably kind of falls in that category.

58
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:04,110
This was how it relates to each course I make use of you know to do that and then I put kind of a sub

59
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,530
where I explained how I thought at least what I thought the angle of this post was going to be so I

60
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:10,740
put.

61
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,810
Op Ed if I was going to write a post and its not like a research article its something that I was going

62
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:23,880
to just give my opinion and wax on about op eds you see these all the time in like newspapers.

63
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,180
This would be like a how to guide so would be more instructional.

64
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,010
Do this this this this and this and then this And so that also would mean and probably need more graphics

65
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:37,330
and videos and other kind of supporting information innovation.

66
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,830
I think it is more of like a series I was thinking about doing focusing on innovations.

67
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,640
Case studies.

68
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,550
Okay so then I get to read a case study this way and it probably me a lot longer it's probably going

69
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:55,650
to involve a lot of research and involve doing interviews and talking to people trend analysis.

70
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,510
You know I thought that was another common one might do and then list like good all this tickles and

71
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,880
then other than that I put things like targets goals you know you don't do all this stuff.

72
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:06,980
CTA is.

73
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,230
So what was my goal.

74
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,740
Well you know if I'm making something for a read it that's my my target.

75
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,170
Well then karma or it might be my goal or my goal might be click or it might just be building my where

76
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:24,160
my brand on that platform so that later on I can use it click through.

77
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,160
So by CD-R's are usually kind of the same thing.

78
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:32,140
I hadn't really narrowed down what exactly I wanted them to do and this is actually one of the problems

79
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:38,110
with this was I just made this for fun and I wasn't really trying to drive people to sign up here but

80
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,820
had I done that had I focused on it then I would have gotten a lot more e-mails.

81
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:49,840
I think this only got like 4000 emails and how I focused on it I probably would convert it a lot more

82
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,390
people.

83
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:57,140
So for me I call actions are usually like joined my slack if I'm promoting it go to my blog Good on

84
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,950
you and the pages.

85
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:05,880
I don't really have that much else going on and repurpose these are just plans that I had for repurpose

86
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,890
Right right.

87
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:13,030
We'll talk about this later on but if you write a blog repurpose thing is pretty important.

88
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,890
Where can I chalk this up and put it out.

89
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,550
And then over here is this is these are the things I put for ranking them.

90
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,980
So how easy is it to promote.

91
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,790
How well does this fit with my brand and how original is it.

92
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,230
I'd rank them and then give them a ranking that made it easy to sort.

93
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,920
Well take a cruise real fast from the other things going on here.

94
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,390
Those are my dream Raf's This is my actual pipeline.

95
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:42,460
So these were more of the post that I was actually kind of focusing on with more notes on what they're

96
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,090
about.

97
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,710
All filled out pretty much the same.

98
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:51,140
They rank them all so I could filter by this if I wanted to and then see.

99
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,120
Those are the worst ones the best one is the non-technical stack.

100
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,490
Ok so I had a idea for a post where I would kind of propose a stack of technologies for people who are

101
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:06,880
non-technical founders and then orated it based on like what I'd seen how original It is my brand.

102
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,630
Absolutely.

103
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,250
How easy is it to promote.

104
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:09,990
Pretty easy.

105
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,850
Oh and I just said other times this just kind of sorted everything by the month.

106
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,360
So this is what I'm shooting for for the month.

107
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:23,890
This is what I wanted and that was just a good way to look at a broader view of how I'm handling this

108
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:30,850
or what's coming up in the month like month whatever laundry was just a place where I put a bunch of

109
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,320
notes were put a bunch of notes on how to promote it are things to look into what do you think I think

110
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,110
is really important.

111
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:44,800
Was I set this up so that I could have different views and what I meant by views was that this is my

112
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,980
main view this is internal.

113
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,870
Anybody working with me can see this and we can collaborate on it.

114
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,710
However I need something for idea capture.

115
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,560
So I have an idea I need to write this down really quickly.

116
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,420
So what we had was an actual input page.

117
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,580
Now we can actually see this right now.

118
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,930
But it's a good read only mode is actually disabled.

119
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:09,850
But the idea was I created a form so what I could do is just go here and write in all that information

120
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,230
as I want it.

121
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:17,540
And it was all optionals like you put in the information like the title notes some kind of a subtitle.

122
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,500
I could even categorize it then I could rate it at the time.

123
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:28,150
But the point was it was really important to have just a sheet or a page that I can repeatedly go to

124
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,910
just input it and be done with it.

125
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:35,980
OK guys so you don't have to be as crazy as I was with this but if you're really serious about content

126
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,420
marketing then and making something like this to handle the information especially you start working

127
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,830
with other people can be pretty crucial.

128
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,620
I like using air table because it just has a lot of features and it's kind of like Google sheets or

129
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,560
Excel but they just made it a lot easier to use a lot more user friendly.

130
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,720
And there's just a lot more features.

131
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,990
You know it can be a little overwhelming.

132
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,750
It does take a couple of hours to figure out how to use it.

133
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,190
But once you do that it's pretty awesome.

134
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:00,700
OK guys.

135
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,230
Well this is my content pipeline.

136
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,530
I might publish this in the resources if you guys want to look at it since I'm not really doing much

137
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,590
with it but otherwise in the next lecture.
