1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,290
Is when I come back to the course so for the last couple years we've been discussing landing pages.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,810
Well so far we know what they're use for and well we just checked out a bunch of really good examples

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,280
and the immediately previous lecture.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,670
Now this one I'd like to share some of the important do's and don'ts for landing pages.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,770
Things you should always do or include and then things you should really always avoid because they will

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,100
secretly kill whatever page you're making.

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,570
Now let's start with five things you should always do on a landing page.

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,180
Now reverse tip is to use your headline to highlight the value of your offer.

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,970
Sounds a little Obviously repackaged for you.

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:42,270
Use your headline to immediately tell them what they're going to get from the actual magnet that you're

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:42,820
offering.

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,330
If you delay telling them what the value is to something else the subtitle or description you'll get

13
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,190
a lot of people who just bounce.

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,760
The first thing people read is the headline and a lot of them will only read the headline.

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,400
So convincer visitors whatever you're selling here is worth it with a clear statement of value.

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,970
What will you do for them if they say complete the form what download will they get.

17
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,950
And why is the thing you're giving them so special.

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,150
Or what knowledge will they get from signing up for this event that you're promoting.

19
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,120
People need to know what's in it for them as soon as possible so use the headline to make it as clear

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,770
as possible.

21
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:25,210
For example buffer offers a 25 day email course it's called the 25 experts social media growth strategies

22
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,370
and they use a headline on a landing page that is very short and sweet.

23
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,930
Now the title is clear the tone of the message is friendly and the form is super short.

24
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,640
It's a solid landing page.

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,540
Look at that headline.

26
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,670
Now here's another landing page.

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,010
Tip provide all of the details needed to make a decision as good as your headline might be.

28
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,970
Don't rely on that do all the convincing for you.

29
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,780
If you're providing something to download include a description of the piece with specifics on what's

30
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,440
included.

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,720
Is there a helpful checklist a set of steps to accomplish something or a template they could use to

32
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,810
create something.

33
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,180
Make the value obvious.

34
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,640
Now notice I'm not giving you a word count or limit here.

35
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:08,790
When I say provide all the details certain pieces like e-books or email courses might require a lot

36
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:12,720
to convince people so give them as much as you can.

37
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,190
Here's the thing.

38
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,280
If you give them a lot of stuff it's not going to deter anyone.

39
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,200
People will read until they are satisfied and then they'll sign up so the more information you give

40
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,370
the longer you can continue to convince some of the holdouts founder.

41
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,550
Magazine and founder dot com it's like founder without an e.

42
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,490
Lavern ebook on how to get your first 10000 Instagram followers by breaking down all the info you'll

43
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,280
get in the book and easy to read.

44
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,410
Bullets leave it tell you they tried these tips themselves and it worked better than expected.

45
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,810
This is a pretty decent example of explaining as much as you can about why you should do this.

46
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,460
Now on the other hand if you want people to register for let's say a weapon are all they need to know

47
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,700
all the basics as well as like the date and the time how long it's going to last.

48
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,250
How they can attend just from a technological standpoint and what it's going to be all about.

49
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,510
Also who's in it.

50
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,060
Availability is another consideration here so be sure to include the web in our details as well.

51
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,190
All right here's my third tip for things you absolutely need to do.

52
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,530
Make your call to action obvious and pretty much on an voidable if you guys came for my MVP course.

53
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:19,010
Remember we talked about B-F BS and that sounds for big effing Borton.

54
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,710
It basically means that your call to action should be large.

55
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:29,820
I mean when you look at the page be one of the most obvious things on it that Google has some standard

56
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:35,380
for their buttons where if you stand six feet away from the screen and you look at it.

57
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,720
If you can still see the button you're good you can't it's not big enough.

58
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,350
So once you've convinced your visitor with your dynamite headline a convincing copy what do you want

59
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,280
to do on your landing page.

60
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,860
A download a white paper.

61
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,360
Register for webinars whatever that action is.

62
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,720
There should be a very clear and eye catching to action or CTA sometimes call it and that should allow

63
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,620
the page visitors to do that thing.

64
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,850
Now is there any mystery where the call to action on this page is.

65
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,700
Maybe it's bordering on noxious but its spirit is in the right place.

66
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,820
Tell people exactly where to click and what will happen so there's no doubt about what you want them

67
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,520
to do.

68
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:14,280
Now here's tip number four on the landing page to do is the user with a friendly confirmation.

69
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,810
Now once the visitor completes the landing page I'm trying to show a confirmation message so they know

70
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,040
it actually worked and then provide immediate details on what happens next.

71
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,670
Download your e-book here or you can get an email with wemen are details within the next few minutes.

72
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,730
And obviously thank them for trusting you with their personal info.

73
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,540
Take the opportunity to provide helpful links to other things I could download or more information on

74
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,700
a related topic.

75
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,400
Try not to go too crazy with that because you might actually end up distracting them from consuming

76
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,260
the thing you gave them.

77
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,680
Here's the confirmation page for an email course from enchanting marketing.

78
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,530
You pretty much know that an email will be on the way to get you started because the confirmation is

79
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,660
basically a thank you letter and it's a decently nice personal touch.

80
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,850
Here's Tip number five and it's something a lot of businesses surprisingly forget about.

81
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,090
Make sure your landing page used to work in the future now say with me I know that sounds a little obvious

82
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:09,960
but it's especially important if your landing page is a webinars that you make sure that it works going

83
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,750
forward.

84
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,600
After that event happens well you should use that landing page to provide like a recording of the web

85
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:22,290
or you could even use the same lead form to give visitors access to a public version of it.

86
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,550
Then you add a link to a page with an upcoming webinars so they can attend a live one if you want.

87
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,250
If you just take the landing page down but there are links to it from somewhere else.

88
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,250
Well visitors might arrive on a broken page until you lose a chance of getting a lead.

89
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,950
In fact a lot of marketers what they do is and this is really shitty but it's what they do for webinars

90
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,460
is they'll record a seminar and they act like it's live but it's not.

91
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,030
It's actually a prerecorded one.

92
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,290
So then anytime someone comes in they sign up for it and has a script that just keeps pushing the date

93
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,820
in the future they get an e-mail sequence and they watch the live webinars.

94
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,210
They ask questions but oh man they never seem to fail to get their question.

95
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,800
And I guess that's one way to do it.

96
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,640
For example here's a web page on physical education that took place sometime 2016.

97
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,360
Now shape America added Taxil visitors no recording was now available free for members or for purchase.

98
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,240
Blow your landing page is for a downloadable e-book white paper or an email course and you decide to

99
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,380
discontinue access.

100
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:21,810
Use some kind of redirect to get people on another page that can keep them interested in whatever else

101
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,620
you have to offer.

102
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,270
So those are the five pretty important tips that I think you should pay attention to for landing pages.

103
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,960
So just to recap news your headline to highlight the value of your offer.

104
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,180
Make sure that it's in the first sentence to provide all the details necessary to make a decision.

105
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,290
Don't leave anything out.

106
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,730
There's really nothing that can go wrong by giving more information.

107
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:46,210
Make a call the call the action your CTA as obvious and unavoidable as possible.

108
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:51,240
Number four make sure that you think the user at the friendly confirmation again you know they trusted

109
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,080
you with their information and then five make sure that it continues to work in the future and then

110
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,800
you have a plan for what happens after.

111
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,170
Let's say your webinars runs or your e-book is now out of date.

112
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:06,270
So following these tips should ensure your landing page is at least informative and effective now and

113
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,230
hopefully in the future.

114
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:11,190
Now the flip side there are plenty things marketers and designers do to make their landing pages less

115
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,930
than ideal and frankly just screw it up.

116
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,690
So here are five things that go over quickly to avoid with your own landing pages.

117
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,360
First of all don't force people to think too much.

118
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,300
People landed on your landing page for a reason.

119
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,680
They want what was promised to them and they clicked on a link in an email they got.

120
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,350
So they already have expectations or what they should find on the page.

121
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:33,750
Don't confuse them with a different headline or page copy that makes them hesitate about giving you

122
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,670
their info.

123
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:41,400
For example if you search for it landing page guide on for a Marchetto e-book shows up Marchetto landing

124
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,140
page guide.

125
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,730
Learn from the industry best practices.

126
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:49,680
Now this clearly sounds perfect so when you click through you naturally arrive at a page called The

127
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,700
Definitive Guide to digital advertising.

128
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,670
What the hell.

129
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,990
Now a quick scan of description shows no mention of landing pages whatsoever.

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,290
Did I just hallucinate.

131
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,420
Did Marchetto Just promise me a guide for designing waining pages and then take me to a completely different

132
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,830
landing page.

133
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:05,840
What's going on.

134
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,650
So the lesson here is make sure your headline your ad matches the one on your landing page in fact trying

135
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,430
to make them as close as possible.

136
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,640
The same goes for any links images or other elements you use to direct people to your landing page.

137
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,820
There should be no confusion whatsoever when they arrive.

138
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,900
Otherwise you interrupt your own momentum and make the visit or doubt pretty much everything they're

139
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,520
doing or the next thing to avoid on landing pages is don't ask for more than what you need.

140
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,570
In terms of the form gathering leads is an important process for your business but you don't need 50

141
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,200
fields of information about a lead for it to be a good one.

142
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,830
You especially don't need to ask for too much information about a person in the first time you meet

143
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,230
them on a landing page.

144
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,530
The friend introduces you to someone you know immediately ask them for their address phone number and

145
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,540
blood type.

146
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,800
Understand that landing pages can be and should be considered one of the many potential times you can

147
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,700
connect with someone.

148
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,800
So if all you get from a person in exchange for an e-book is their name an email address will consider

149
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,570
that a win.

150
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,890
Then build upon that first interaction in the future if you need it you can get more information to

151
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,970
get a collection of white papers on the future of battery technology from Enter tech.

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,640
You're required to enter your physical mailing address and I wonder how many junk mailings enter text

153
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:20,610
sends out to one to three fake street in Yemen because while forums like this what's the point.

154
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,560
Again if you want to do more with a lead Well then keep talking to them and offering them value.

155
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,330
If your work is truly worth something they'll be happy to give you more data or more information.

156
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,850
So be conscious of what information you need and just keep in mind you can get more from them later.

157
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,160
Business to business companies.

158
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,300
You can ask for a little bit more upfront because you don't need as many leads but if you're a consumer

159
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:50,820
company why are you asking them their age or their mailing address or their high school mascot.

160
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,920
It just doesn't make sense.

161
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:56,160
So don't ask for too much info and while you're at it here's another tip don't make the landing page

162
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,390
experience overly complex.

163
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,590
Now first there's a between long and complex you might need a long page packed with a lot of info that

164
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,250
kind of goes.

165
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,020
Tip number three.

166
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,950
But if it's presented in a simple way can still be very effective.

167
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,840
We're talking about a page being too complex.

168
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,050
I mean don't annoy them with extra steps.

169
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,440
Your landing page should be where people land to get what they want.

170
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,360
It shouldn't be a stop and a series of hoops you have them jump through.

171
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:29,020
Engineering and Technology Magazine has a white paper called a drone's life airborne battery management.

172
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,570
OK fair enough.

173
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:36,720
I'll just click the downloaded free white paper here button and now another landing page goddammit.

174
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,000
Same description although the bullets are slightly different.

175
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,800
Now there's a form a one and the cover of the White Paper says drones 2017.

176
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,030
Not drones the life.

177
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,530
I don't know if I'm in the right place know all the details need to be consistent in each step your

178
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:57,720
visitors have to go through but at the very least in this case engineering and technology magazine should

179
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,690
combine these two pages into one save us that extra unnecessary click and it will eliminate a bunch

180
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,420
of confusion and dramatically up their conversion rate.

181
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,490
All right here's another thing to avoid on landing pages.

182
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,800
Don't rely on a block of text to sell your lead magnet landing pages are perfect opportunities to use

183
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,910
the available space on the page you spell out all the benefits for your visitor.

184
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,510
You cram all the info into a block of text.

185
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:26,010
You're not really making things easy to digest if you're promoting an ebook or white paper or show a

186
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,570
picture of the cover.

187
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,100
You've got details to share with them break them out into bullet points or a very loose outline.

188
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,590
Show a few pictures of your messages from your email course or pictures of the speakers in your webinars.

189
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,680
Don't trap yourself within a landing page template thinking you can only put text in one spot.

190
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,250
Think outside the template.

191
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,790
For example the pages promotes their weekly webinars with all the details and highlights written out

192
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,250
but also includes a video preview as well.

193
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:55,280
It's a great selling point because videos are way more fun to watch than text is to read.

194
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,620
Plus it's short unengaging.

195
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,800
I personally like it.

196
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:02,720
Now here's one more thing to avoid and landing pages don't distracter visitors with competing called

197
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,490
actions when you design a landing page for your lead magnet.

198
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,830
Make sure the page has a clear focus and one.

199
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,110
Yes that is one called Action took up his landing page from training magazine training mag.

200
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,760
The goal of this page is to get people to sign up for Webinars on how to manage training costs.

201
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:22,140
However training man has loaded up the page with so many different calls to action.

202
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,370
You don't actually know where to look now above the details for this webinars.

203
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,030
And for another weapon or over on the right is a big.

204
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,060
What would you like to do menu but none of the choices are to actually register for the webinars.

205
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,260
The reason why I came here and registration button is pretty boring.

206
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,320
It's grey and in the middle of everything.

207
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,060
No training that should remove as much of this noise as possible including that stupid banner at the

208
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,640
top and perhaps even those buttons on the right.

209
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,360
As for the call the action are as you might remember from the first to do item.

210
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,500
Make a called Action unavoidable and obvious.

211
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:59,550
The main call to action on this page should be a bright color their blue orange or green or whatever

212
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,920
you guys want to argue about the best color for buttons.

213
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,590
Go ahead.

214
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,990
I'm going to step out of this.

215
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,590
The point is gray is way too easy to miss.

216
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,450
So let's recap the landing page no nos.

217
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,380
One more time.

218
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:10,830
Number one.

219
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,640
Don't force people to think too much.

220
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,570
Number two don't ask for more than what you need.

221
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,130
Figure out what you need ask for that.

222
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,390
Get the rest from later.

223
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,930
Number three don't make the landing page overly complex.

224
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,880
Now remember the difference string long and complex enough the same thing and before.

225
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,090
Don't rely on a block of text cell of the magnet.

226
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,790
Break it up.

227
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,780
No one wants to read a block of text.

228
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,410
They're trying to get a book they don't want to read a book to get a book.

229
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,970
Number five Don't distract visitors with competing CTX that one should be obvious.

230
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:42,580
Don't put a bunch of buttons and then expect them to only do one of them.

231
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,980
Make your learning they just focused.

232
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,330
Simple but rigid in the relevant details.

233
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,880
Answer questions for your audience to convince them of the value of what you're offering.

234
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:54,050
If they're not compelled to click your call to action wealth of failure so make your landing page a

235
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,600
success with these best practices in mind.

236
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,380
All right guys I'll see you in the next lecture.
