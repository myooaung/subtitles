00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.150
OK we are back in our last hour we talked about some of the On page SEO factors like title tag and even

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.210
the optional meta description field.

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.340
Well let's keep going and discuss a few more tags in this lecture.

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.520
You can use to improve your Osseo What are the things Google likes and a page is a logical organization.

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.910
Google's become smart enough that I can basically read a page and figure out what it's all about.

6
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.890
Scary right.

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.880
But if you can organize the tax and other information on page into a logical kind of structure Well

8
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.400
Google will see better and understand your intentions for your content and purpose of the page.

9
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.100
So you can use Hetter tags.

10
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.610
Now Hetter tags are like you know the section headers that help you organize and separate pieces of

11
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.440
information.

12
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.580
The best example of Hetter tags you'll find is actually on Wikipedia like this page for a kids show

13
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.390
called Sesame Street you might have heard of it.

14
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.310
The top header tag is also known as the each one tag and should be used one time on a page.

15
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.260
It's basically the page header and it's used to tell people what the page is all about.

16
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.470
Just like the title tag.

17
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.810
In fact a lot of times the title tag and H-1 tag are exactly the same and that's totally fine.

18
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.600
So on this page the H-1 is what you see at the top.

19
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.710
Sesame Street now in general pages have headers that are almost always going to have this H-1 equivalent.

20
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.970
And that's what tells people well what's this page about.

21
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.830
After the H-1 of course we have the H2B has only familiarity with t l H-1B to H-3 H2 tags can be used

22
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.620
as many times as needed to find the main sections of the page.

23
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.760
For Sesame Street well you can see just define pretty well.

24
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.150
Here we have history format educational goals funding and so on.

25
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.130
Then if there's subsections at age 2 then you use age 3.

26
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.130
Underproduction for example there's research writing and media that you can see what the tags look like

27
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.420
in the HD mail code.

28
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.260
By viewing the source code of the page Well this case looks something like this.

29
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.410
The subject of the page.

30
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.320
Well here's a main section of the page.

31
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.850
Here's another main section.

32
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.310
Now here's a subsection.

33
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.200
But when you view pages with headers you should be able to see where sections begin and end.

34
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.680
This provides added usability.

35
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.650
The person reading the page allowing them to better understand the information for Google and the index

36
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.350
page they can better understand it too by looking at the headers and seeing which terms are used.

37
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.740
Seeing what the structure of the page looks like.

38
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.190
As a result header tags can give the page and Su boost for the turns included in the same head attacked.

39
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.500
So how did target provide structure NSU value.

40
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.610
How valuable these are for your ranking changes a lot.

41
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.910
Right.

42
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.050
So don't be like that's all I have to do is change one of these two tags.

43
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.830
They use vi.

44
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.920
A really really important and they're getting less and less important.

45
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.040
Basically everything is getting more sophisticated Nescio And so the things that are easy and simple

46
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.650
and obvious are kind of treated like Legacy's are relics still important and still worth doing because

47
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.700
it's so abusable.

48
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.350
It's getting lower in importance.

49
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.130
Now another set of tags that do that on the page are bullets and or a list bullet list.

50
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.180
Well you've seen these a million times I'm sure.

51
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.520
It's a list that looks like this.

52
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.950
You know one item here.

53
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.020
Here's another on an oh yeah there's something else the code used to make this show up on a page is

54
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.530
going to look something like this.

55
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.380
Well looks like this.

56
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.430
You know one item here and there's not one.

57
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.170
Oh yeah.

58
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.170
Here's something else.

59
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.320
Now each set of tags refers to a list item but the tag stands for an ordered list or a list with no

60
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.300
numbers in it.

61
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.330
If you wanted an ordered list or a list with numbers for each item will you use a slightly different

62
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.760
tack and look like this.

63
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.750
Baby number one make an amazing plan to do stuff.

64
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.310
3.

65
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.980
Profit.

66
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.370
Great.

67
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.080
And it will splay like this can make an amazing play and do stuff and profit.

68
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.670
Simple right.

69
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.920
Naturally you want to use numbered lists for listing steps you take in order or like a checklist but

70
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.450
Google makes note of these lists and it seems that any time you organize information to make it more

71
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.890
orderly so to speak you're basically trying to improve the usability value of a page.

72
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.440
So they most likely give your page a slight boost when you use lists to structure information and doga

73
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.800
list.

74
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.730
Crazy though.

75
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.240
Just make sure you use them when it's logical.

76
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.310
If it helps your readers then use it.

77
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.240
Don't do it just because Google likes it.

78
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.950
Now what else.

79
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.540
Well adding bold and italics tax to key items can also help linking to other pages on your site to further

80
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.150
explain a topic can boost SEO as well.

81
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.950
For example you reference a product linking the name of the product in the text to the product page

82
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.600
provides a logical reference.

83
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.330
Now it's called a cross linking.

84
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.840
That's a great way to show Google how your sites pages relate to each other.

85
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.210
Now as an outbound Wingie an inbound linking outbound linking to somebody else but inbound linking is

86
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.290
linking to another page within your own site inbound linking is a good thing.

87
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:27.330
And Google generally likes that it helps there crawlers find your site more quickly but also again shows

88
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.870
you're more orderly.

89
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.420
You're more organized and you're more focused on usability.

90
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.360
Now outbound linking that's an entirely different topic now.

91
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.950
In fact anything you really can do to make your taxin other information more readable or easier to consume

92
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.750
should result in a boost.

93
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.790
It's kind of a quick lil tip here.

94
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.470
If you forgot all the rules Nescio like you just got amnesia after the second and only thing you learned

95
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.180
was try to make the page easy to understand for your user.

96
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.320
That is a lot of SEO.

97
00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.890
They just have quantified it and broken it down to a process really the kind of results and how easy

98
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.000
is your website to use.

99
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.890
Now in our next lecture We'll get into how to write more SEO friendly content.

100
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.630
So if you're ready to keep going we'll see then.
