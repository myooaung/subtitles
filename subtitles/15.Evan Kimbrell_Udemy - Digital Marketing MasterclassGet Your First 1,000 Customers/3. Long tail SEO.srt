00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,770
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,330
We begin our discussion of FCL and in our last lecture discussed how Google works and basically has

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,120
established many of the best practices and tools we use to understand SCEA today.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,340
Well one of the things we learned over the years of studying search data is the value of what we call

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,930
longtail SBO.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,700
Now let me talk about what that is.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,300
Takes a little bit of explanation.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,810
Now the simplest searches out there desk for example I don't know who search his desk but you know it's

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,770
a simple search are going to get more searches by users on Google than more complex searches like do

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,050
it yourself standing desk instructions.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,270
Bamboo wood the simple search term is very broad so there are tons of pages out there that could be

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,890
potentially relevant to it.

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,650
Almost a billion in fact.

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,230
But of course who can do anything with a search result page like that.

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,300
Also known as you'll see as canceling drives me nuts but it's S-C RPE for short.

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,550
Now as DRP as search engine result page.

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,760
So if you want to be cool and hip with the lingo lingo you can say CERP or as I call it sir.

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,250
Now syrups or S-E are peas with that many results offer too much information too much ground.

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,570
So we as human beings have learned to get more specific with our search terms in order to find what

20
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,070
we need.

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,860
We're trying to figure out how to make my own standing desk for example I might actually search for

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,400
do it yourself standing desk instructions instead.

23
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:19,260
And then from there I'll find that there's over a million results but still far less than what we had

24
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,570
before and are just searching for desk right now.

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,190
Here is where the data comes in.

26
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,170
If you took a number of results from those simple terms just desk and the other more complex related

27
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,450
searches with desk in them and graft it all out well that looks something like this.

28
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,220
You got a huge spike of search results for the simplest terms.

29
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,830
And then as searches get more complex more words and them basically more keywords You're a sharp downward

30
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:48,380
slope of relevant search results or what people Nescio call the Long Tail it extends basically for ever

31
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,210
for the rest of relevant searches.

32
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,530
So we say longtail we're talking about that section of the graph where there are really really specific

33
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,420
searches not as many people doing them but there's almost like infinite combinations of them.

34
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,950
Those are the ones that are low competition and they're easiest to rank for.

35
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,520
But here's why this graph is important.

36
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,140
All those simple searches of a ton of relevant results.

37
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,960
You don't want to try and compete for the mirror what happens if you just search for desk Well you're

38
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,800
going to get all sorts of stuff and it's pretty much impossible to read through it to find what you

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,190
want.

40
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,290
People can only find what they need if they type in longer and more specific search terms.

41
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,130
It also kind of goes without saying that if you're going to search through a billion pages the ones

42
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,400
that are show up or something of that vague are going to be enormous companies with enormous SBO value

43
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,960
and and possibly tens of thousands of other pages.

44
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,060
So yeah good luck in trying to rank for that.

45
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,590
Now those longer search terms that people use and they know specifically what they want or what are

46
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,560
found in the long tail and those are the searches that you generally are going to want to try for.

47
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,420
It doesn't make sense.

48
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,960
Now don't worry about rank and ask if you are producing an article about how to get put together your

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,670
own standing Yes concentrate instead on the needs of people who are searching for your content.

50
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,090
What questions are they asking.

51
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,470
What needs do they have.

52
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,070
How can you satisfy those needs for information or data or products with your web pages or blog post.

53
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,010
These questions should drive your actions and help you think about what kinds of posts and articles

54
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,000
to write and publish.

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,270
By writing great focus content that addresses specific user needs your work will naturally more and

56
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,600
be more relevant to longer more specific keyword phrases.

57
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,840
Now going back to our example.

58
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,990
Well if you were actually making a guide about building a standing desk Well you wouldn't even want

59
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,120
to go for desk people aren't going to find you if they're searching for a desk.

60
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,680
But you have a better chance of finding your own article you search for.

61
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,680
Build your own standing desk or DIY Danding desk or even things like how to make a standing desk or

62
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,340
hundreds of others of slightly different variations on that question.

63
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,370
Now these keywords are located well down that long tail of that crap and people are looking for those

64
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,020
terms will find you because well it's not crowded and they're really looking for you to read.

65
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,360
Your strategy is going to be looking for these longtail as the opportunities and then writing posts

66
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,820
and articles or retailing the stuff we already have to target those because we know well there's a good

67
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,060
chance we'll be featured in them.

68
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:05,610
So this leads to a good question which is how do we figure out which keyword phrases and terms to focus

69
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:05,960
on.

70
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,270
Well lucky for you this is a topic we'll cover and our next lecture.

71
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:09,720
See the.
