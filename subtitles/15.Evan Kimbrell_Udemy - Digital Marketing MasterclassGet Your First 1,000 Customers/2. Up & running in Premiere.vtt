00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.860
All right guys guys in this lecture we're going to jump into an editing program so I can show you what

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.860
many of the usual features look like.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.480
I'm going to go into Adobe Premiere and some of you may decide to use this one specifically.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.890
Some of you will but it's a powerful piece of software and it's a great example to show you what most

5
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.150
editing programs are like.

6
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.740
So for the next X amount of minutes we're going to go in Adobe for as if we never use it before and

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.350
get oriented with what you need to care about.

8
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.390
There's a lot of sections you don't need to know about.

9
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.990
So we're going to focus on how to get in and get stuff done.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.060
If you guys already know how to use a premiere for the love of God skipped this lecture.

11
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.030
If you're one of the people that complains when you watch a software tutorial in a course because you

12
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.800
think core shouldn't cover software tutorials in that case you can also skip it.

13
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.660
And in general guys you can just go to YouTube and YouTube has some really good tutorials on how to

14
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.620
use premiere.

15
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.210
The difference is going to be that there are going to be much much longer more in depth going to focus

16
00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.160
on a lot of things like pro video editors need but not something like what we need anyway.

17
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.000
So here we go.

18
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.910
Let's just jump in.

19
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.530
And this is what it looks like.

20
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.990
OK.

21
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.190
Get used to this because well if you're going to use it to stare at this for hours it's the first thing

22
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.340
you generally want to do is create a new project.

23
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.730
OK.

24
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.150
So when you open a new project and Adobe from your windows in a come up where you can type in a name

25
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.280
and potentially change some of these options.

26
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.140
But generally I would just say just leave them as they are for now.

27
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.840
We don't have to worry about them yet and frankly we don't even know what some of these mean.

28
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.190
Let's just jump right in and when the new project opens up you'll see a whole bunch of windows around

29
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.140
the workspace.

30
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.530
Now we discuss them as we go through this.

31
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.700
If you guys are using a different version from Erlick CSX the S5 or even C-s for it on how you installed

32
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.860
it you might have it it could look slightly different.

33
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.750
Adobe has this funny thing where for some reason every year they decide to move all their features around

34
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.110
in a big circle just to piss people off or make tutorials.

35
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.110
That's the only reason I can think of it they do it with Photoshop all the time.

36
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.520
They just take a feature and then every year they move around somewhere else it's in this tab or this

37
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.640
over here or now it's a shortcut way to get started.

38
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.110
I've got a few sample videos that Premier actually provided so we'll just use those as part of an example

39
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.010
video project.

40
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.510
So the first thing you want to do when you start up a video project is get your video clips into the

41
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.920
project and specifically a section called the media.

42
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.490
Now the easiest way to do this is open your finder on the Mac or explore on your PC and find the files

43
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.450
that you want to put in there and then just click and drag them into the lower left hand section of

44
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.210
Premier.

45
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.030
That's the media then and that will add those clips to your project.

46
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.410
So here we have three video files that we're going to use in this example.

47
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.680
Let's just click one and drag it over the timeline which is over here to the right.

48
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.390
Now the timeline is really the main area where you're going to be doing the editing of your video.

49
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.240
The timeline is separated into video and audio tracks which you can see here labeled with V.

50
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.130
A The one and a want video and audio one.

51
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.340
And when we drag the video clip onto it while it splits the video and the audio from the click apart.

52
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.700
And they put them in the corresponding tracks for you.

53
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.580
The timeline is a timeline.

54
00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.890
Right.

55
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.890
So if you look at the left part of the timeline the very far left that's zero seconds and he's moved

56
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.620
right.

57
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.470
That's one second two seconds three seconds all the way up to however long your video is going to be.

58
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.820
So by placing video clips here that's how you can decide what shows at what time in what order and what

59
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.440
sequence.

60
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.420
All right so here on the timeline you to see a vertical blue line at the beginning.

61
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.070
And if you click and drag it around you'll see what's going on at that particular point in the video

62
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.710
clip.

63
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.030
Now that blue line is called the play head and you'll position out where you want to make edits.

64
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.750
And the other cuts on your timeline as unsophisticated as I am will call it the scrubber but I know

65
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.530
that's not technically true but I just like to call it a scrubber scrubbers is a funny word.

66
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.000
You can drag it around and move it with the arrow keys or you can use keyboard shortcuts and premiere's

67
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.920
specifically the keys JKA and Al will allow you to shuttle through the video that's on the timeline.

68
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.210
Now I don't obviously use shortcuts because I have five fingers.

69
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.860
So it kind of makes it hard but for a 10 fingered Friends Well this actually is quite useful.

70
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.760
It'll save you actually an enormous amount of time a lot of time to be doing the same redundant task

71
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.350
over and over and over and over again whereas clicking it right clicking and doing whatever you want

72
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.670
with a mouse just adds seconds every time you do it.

73
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.880
And over the long term I can actually it hours to your life and you and you can try it out yourself

74
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.140
and see how it works.

75
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.380
Now Jay goes reverse and L goes forward and then K will stop.

76
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.350
OK so now that we have a video clip on the timeline let's actually click it and go to the upper left

77
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.000
hand corner and click on effect controls.

78
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.130
This is basically a property window that shows information about what selected here you can see the

79
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.720
size and other information on the video itself and there are places where you can make changes to it

80
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.410
if you want to.

81
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.780
For example if you explore some of the items and the effects control window one of those attributes

82
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.810
in there is called Rotation rotation obviously refers to the video itself and it's whether it's rotated

83
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.730
in degrees you change the rotation it's a 90 degrees.

84
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.780
Well look at our image you'll see a change in the screen on the right.

85
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.180
So now the video is rotated and if you shuttle back and forth of the play head you'll see that the entire

86
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.410
clip is now rotated.

87
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.180
So that's how you make.

88
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.520
But if you wanted to reset that then just go over to where the rotation is and click on a circular arrow

89
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.800
on the right and that will usually reset it to the original value.

90
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.160
OK.

91
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.630
There you go.

92
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.480
Now we're back to non-crazy land.

93
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.800
Now there are plenty of effects that Premier has and if you go up to the top along this horizontal navigation

94
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.170
bar you'll see effects as one of those buttons you click it a new window will appear on the right.

95
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.010
Now one of the folders there is a video effects and inside there you've got things like color correction

96
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.550
and items inside that like brightness and contrast.

97
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:36.030
Now if you've ever edited a photo Instagram or pretty much any other app a lot of these will look familiar

98
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.580
to you.

99
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:43.200
So you can just grab one of these effects and drag it over onto the clip on the timeline to apply the

100
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.750
clip and then you have to change the attributes however you want.

101
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.210
Now keep that in mind that's kind of tricky but when you want in fact you grab it and you throw it on

102
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.950
the clip that you want the effect to be applied to.

103
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.600
So it's click and drag brightness and contrast and put it right here on the video clip and there you

104
00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.870
go.

105
00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:58.870
Now it's applied.

106
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.330
If you go over to the effects one know we can now start making changes.

107
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.580
Change the brightness change the contrast do whatever we want grab the play head and shuttle back and

108
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.380
forth to see what it looks like.

109
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.300
We decided we don't like what we've done.

110
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.250
Well we can hit that reset button again or we can disable the effect by clicking the X button on the

111
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.860
left now eFax stands for special effects.

112
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.300
I don't actually know the F stands for but it is basically what it means like special effects.

113
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.110
I don't know where to apply or faxes to do them using what are called keyframes.

114
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.210
Now keyframes are specific points that you can set within a video clip to tell what the tell the editing

115
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.280
program when to start and stop applying certain effects.

116
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.070
For example let's say we want to start a video clip by having an all blurry and then a few seconds later

117
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.710
into the clip it clears up.

118
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.080
It's actually a pretty common way to start videos you see it on YouTube of what tax Boire that unblurred.

119
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.740
So it's sort of like this dreaming weird kind of effect that we're creating recreating the video to

120
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.010
come into focus.

121
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.110
So it really affects older and over the blur folder there is an effect called directional blur.

122
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.000
OK let's click and drag that onto the clip on the timeline.

123
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.980
Then over the properties windows or a fax windows we can see that it's in there.

124
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:10.020
Let's try the play head back to the beginning of the clip on the timeline then we'll go over to the

125
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.440
effects one now and next to the blur length part of the effect.

126
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.120
There's a little stopwatch icon.

127
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.090
Now if we click on that you'll see it turns blue.

128
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:23.190
Now what that means is we just created a keyframe or a specific point in the video where you want the

129
00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.110
effect to again.

130
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.850
Now the result is called a key frame.

131
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:31.200
Is that your timeline is split up into frames every second depending on how actually how you recorded

132
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.590
it.

133
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.610
And depending on the settings you set up your pet project.

134
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.140
And usually it's 24 frames per second.

135
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:44.310
So if you make a frame a key frame that just basically means that the program now knows that in this

136
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:50.810
frame and the 23rd seconds or whatever something happens right and then you let the computer know that.

137
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:56.520
Well this keyframe is associated with a blur or something like that so knows the start the blur at this

138
00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:56.950
point.

139
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.580
If you're having trouble keyframes guys don't worry.

140
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.200
I mean honestly these are ones the ones that you're going to struggle with until you eventually clicks

141
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.350
and it works but unfortunately like all the software as you use these.

142
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.350
So let's click on that number next to the blue linked and let's make it like 20.

143
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.710
That's like super blurry.

144
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.890
So now let's drag the play hit five or six seconds into the video.

145
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:20.180
Go back to the special effects one now and now hit the reset button on the blurry length.

146
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.540
You'll see that the blur length is now set to zero.

147
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.850
Now drag that play head back and forth along the timeline and you'll see the effect in action going

148
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.210
from very blurry at the beginning to completely clear where we set that second keyframe.

149
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.580
Now the way that that worked was right we we said at the very beginning.

150
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:38.820
OK we want it to be blurry so he said a keyframe occurred and the keyframe told him that hey in this

151
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:43.820
frame make it all blurry and then we went to the end where we wanted to end it and then we hit reset

152
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:49.110
which basically sets a second keyframe but it's easy for us because we start and then just stop it.

153
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.790
So then the computer goes OK.

154
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.890
The effect has to last over this length.

155
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.550
All right so let me show you another feature that is what editing is all about.

156
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:01.190
And that's how to make cuts and edits is incredibly important to the right of the media.

157
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:02.010
Then on the bottom.

158
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.640
You'll see a vertical roll icons and right next to it.

159
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:10.290
The arrow is the one that's selected but you'll also see that there is a razor blade icon.

160
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.950
Can you guess what the razor blade does.

161
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.770
Well that's the razor tool which is what you're going to use to make slices or cuts within the video

162
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:17.840
and audio tracks.

163
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.870
I know they're just called slices in cuts or whatever.

164
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:25.170
But really just means that you're going to split these videos in half or just I don't know so let's

165
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.590
say five seconds and you want to change the video and play something else.

166
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.760
Well you have to cut it in five seconds and move the second portion of a clip somewhere else then take

167
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.050
the clip you want it and throw it in.

168
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.610
So it's Drog a couple of other video clips onto the timeline here.

169
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.140
Here's one OK.

170
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.320
Put another one on as well.

171
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.130
Now let's switch to the razor tool and start making some cuts.

172
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.160
Let's go.

173
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.600
Most of the way into the first clip and right about I don't know here we'll make a cut.

174
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:53.520
OK when we clicked there you'll see that the video audio clip after the cut has been highlighted.

175
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:59.560
If we switch to the pointer tool or the selection tool over here Bakra we had the razor icon and we

176
00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:04.380
click on that part of the clip Well then there's a whole bunch of options.

177
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.850
But one of them is going to be called ripple delete.

178
00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:10.750
Now if you want to just delete a clip what do you do you click it and you hit delete.

179
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:16.810
Now ripple delete is just a little bit different and it is a very common kind of tool that the editors

180
00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:17.510
use.

181
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:22.090
But using a ripple delete it's going to delete the clip that's highlighted and then move everything

182
00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:26.420
else after it back so that there's no gap in the timeline.

183
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.740
This is a great feature when you're trying to make edits quickly.

184
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.010
So if we hit Ripl delete here as opposed just regular Dooly.

185
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:36.060
Well the clip goes away and then the rest of the clip Smersh back against the first one.

186
00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:39.850
Otherwise we just delete or just leave a big blank space and we have to grab all the other ones and

187
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.530
slide them over back into place.

188
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.550
Now right now obviously it doesn't look like a big problem but when you have lots of things on your

189
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:50.170
timeline it can be a painting because what ends up happening is they'll you'll leave a big gap and then

190
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:56.860
you try to scoot them but then winds up happening is you accidentally move them out of sequence or you

191
00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.540
move them out of sync which you which you had established before the eclipse.

192
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.820
The next thing I want to show you here is how to apply a transition.

193
00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:10.180
Now transition could be like a crossfade or a dissolve or a slide in slide out or some kind of way to

194
00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.790
get from one shot to the next without just having it be simple.

195
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.030
It's now seen one updown seen too.

196
00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:20.860
One way to apply a transition is right click on the timeline with what has been made or in between two

197
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.180
clips and a transition.

198
00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.130
Now keep this in mind.

199
00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.910
You have to have two clips of a transition if you want to transition inside of one clip all you have

200
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:32.080
to cut it and then apply the transition right at where the two blocks meet.

201
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.380
Otherwise the computer doesn't know what to transition from and then to.

202
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:37.570
So it really won't make sense.

203
00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.500
So for première will probably use the cross as all.

204
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.140
And you'll see what this basically looks like crosses all of this means it takes one image and slowly

205
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.530
dissolves and as it dissolves in the second image starts bubbling up.

206
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:52.150
Now you can change any of the attributes on this like how long the transition lasts or when it begins

207
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.660
and ends.

208
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.590
If you want to change the transition that's there.

209
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:59.230
Well you can go over to video transitions in the folder on the right grab one that you like and drag

210
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.120
it over on top of the timeline.

211
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.750
For example what's grandis center split effect from a slide folder.

212
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:10.450
If we drive that over and then shuttle back and forth with the play head we'll see what the effect actually

213
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.510
looks like when you apply it to the clubs and the timeline.

214
00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.770
OK pretty cool.

215
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.760
Now you can spend 20 minutes just playing with all the transitions they have to pick which ones you

216
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.090
like.

217
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.910
Personally I like to use subtle transitions.

218
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:26.470
There's a lot of ones on it that have a lot of motion like things that crash in and you know I don't

219
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.850
know what ends up happening is that just too cheesy.

220
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:35.620
And oftentimes if you use to make motions specific transitions then people can actually kind of get

221
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:36.360
seasick.

222
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.860
I don't know if you've seen videos of too many transitions.

223
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.300
Actually can kind of give you a headache.

224
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:45.220
So personally I like to stick to simple stuff unless for some reason having a more animated version

225
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.520
adds some value.

226
00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.850
Anyway yeah I mean just keep it simple unless for some reason you think you know or the fancy one and

227
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.830
you write one more basic thing you should know about.

228
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:57.600
This is how to zoom in and out of your project and specifically on the timeline.

229
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.050
So there is a horizontal bar with a couple of circles along the bottom here.

230
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.260
You click and drag on the right one you'll see the magnification of the project increase and decrease

231
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:10.000
if you're into keyboard shortcuts you can also hit the plus and minus buttons on the upper right hand

232
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.060
corner of your keyboard to do the exact same thing.

233
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:16.300
OK once you've got your video edited and ready to go you want to export the video file.

234
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:20.120
So go up to the file menu and export and then select your media.

235
00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:25.010
Now when you want to actually make a video you have to export it because right now it's in a goofy format

236
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.600
and there's no video player that can play it.

237
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:31.540
If you just go to save what that does it saves your project right and so premiere can open the project

238
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.730
and you go right back to editing like you would.

239
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:38.500
But if you export it takes all of your clips all of your layers and smoosh them together into one video

240
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:38.830
file.

241
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:42.460
That's generally what you use when you're going to upload this to YouTube or wherever you're sending

242
00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.220
your media anyway is to go back to that.

243
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.870
And then the export and you select your media.

244
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:51.550
So it's going to bring up a window that shows you what the video will look like once it has been rendered

245
00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:56.110
or basically what rendered means all the effects have been generated by the program.

246
00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:01.620
The program is displaying clips but it's also creating its own effects and graphics and whatever.

247
00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.870
And it takes time for it to actually go through and make all those graphics.

248
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:08.950
No I think it's helpful to double check and if necessary change the name of the file and the destination

249
00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:10.700
where the file will be saved.

250
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:15.520
You can do this over on the right just by clicking the file name and sending the information about the

251
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.620
right directory in the right filename.

252
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:22.120
The other thing that might come in handy is if you're going to be publishing straight to a social media

253
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:27.160
platform of some kind like YouTube Facebook you can actually just go down to a published tab here and

254
00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.060
log into your platform of choice and then enter any specific settings for this video.

255
00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.260
So in that case when you export the video it'll just go directly to Facebook and post or directly to

256
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.130
Twitter and post it saves you time.

257
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.540
But I don't understand why people use this feature.

258
00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:45.490
To be honest because I personally just export it and then check that everything came out right.

259
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.640
If you sent it directly to Facebook then you could have render air.

260
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:53.620
You could totally have forgotten to remove something at the end of your clip or something like that.

261
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:54.700
No turning back.

262
00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.600
But if you really must save time you're constantly publishing really short stuff.

263
00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:03.970
Do social media well then go for it anyway when you're ready hit export and the program will begin to

264
00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:04.720
render the video.

265
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:09.250
Export it now can depending on your computer and the hardware specifications you have this could take

266
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.440
a really short time or a really long time.

267
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.890
The longer your video is the more effective you have in it all the longer it's just going to take to

268
00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:15.460
render.

269
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.950
But once it's done Walla There you go you're good to go.

270
00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:18.370
All right guys.

271
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.270
That's it for now.

272
00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:22.600
Most of the editing programs out there are a lot like this.

273
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.900
Things might be found in different places but generally experience will be the same.

274
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.080
I encourage you to download a demo premier.

275
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:31.000
Any other editing program to give it a try for yourself.

276
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.170
They all have timelines.

277
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.570
They all have a fax.

278
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:39.090
You pretty much all put the effects on the timelines the same way you cut your clips on the timeline.

279
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:44.710
Pretty much the same way you stack your clips on top of each other in the same way you export and you

280
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.290
save and all that stuff pretty much the same way.

281
00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:52.350
Keyframes work the same way as well but the buttons will be you know somewhere else and you guys.

282
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:52.660
All right.

283
00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.460
Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video.
