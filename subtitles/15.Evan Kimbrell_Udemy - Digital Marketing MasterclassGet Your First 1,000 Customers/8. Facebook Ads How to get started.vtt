00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.830
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.230
So in the last group of lectures we went over the process for setting up and running ads and adverts

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.120
with all the paid options you could consider and words could be a natural fit to go along with your

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.680
Organic SEO efforts.

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.260
But in your case you might opt for a different approach and go with paid ads that reach people not when

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.570
they're searching but when they're doing something else like using Facebook.

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.360
Now most of the social platforms out there Facebook is by far the biggest and it's become a really successful

8
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.350
channel for certain marketers.

9
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.980
Now here is why this book has a ton of data on its users.

10
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.620
Well what kind of data you ask.

11
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.600
Well they track what you post.

12
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.590
They track what you like they track what you subscribe to and of course they track things like your

13
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.640
relationship status location job info family info all that stuff people happily enter into their profile.

14
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:56.890
Really this is what drives life in college and if you allow it or haven't figured out how to disable

15
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.850
it yet Facebook can also access your browser history so they know what you've recently looked at outside

16
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.510
of Facebook.

17
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.910
True story Facebook can look at all the sites that you've been to and then take all these other factors

18
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.710
combined and then they can predict behavior.

19
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.280
So for instance they can look for people who just lost their job because you'll be looking for.

20
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.670
You could be going on linked and looking for job ads or working on your resume.

21
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.670
They can also tell if you're if you're going to move soon.

22
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:26.190
Right.

23
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.230
It's kind of creepy.

24
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.090
But they can do this somewhat well.

25
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.300
So Facebook uses all this info to serve up ads that are as relevant as you can probably get.

26
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.590
Now if you ever wondered why you started seeing ads for let's say one productivity app after you checked

27
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.940
out the Web site for another one.

28
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.810
Well there you go.

29
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.060
Facebook ads come in many different flavors as well.

30
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.210
They can be taxed with one image text with multiple images or even a video.

31
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.850
And the ads all come with clear calls to action on them that you can define.

32
00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.630
So customers will know when they can sign up or buy or visit now or whatever it says Facebook ads appear

33
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.470
right in the customer's regular news feed.

34
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.040
Yes.

35
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.620
They can appear in other spots as well.

36
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.900
Even on Instagram is another benefit of advertising with Facebook by the way.

37
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.480
But plenty of ads show up in between your cousin's post about his love of buffalo wings.

38
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.110
And an update from your favorite band saying they broke up again.

39
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.340
So as far as visibility goes Facebook ads are very visible.

40
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.310
So how can you jump in with ads of your own.

41
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.860
Well there's a few things that you generally going to need first.

42
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.020
First thing you have to do is you have a Facebook business account to manage ads and set up billing

43
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.490
info.

44
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.160
That one's really easy to set up.

45
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.100
Number two a Facebook page for your business.

46
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.300
Again pretty easy.

47
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.240
Number three a Facebook account.

48
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.610
Thankfully none of these things are really tough at all to get started.

49
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.390
Now let's start by just simply setting up a Facebook business manager account.

50
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.500
Now this is just an account where you can manage ads and share responsibility and access with other

51
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.880
people if necessary.

52
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.340
So just go to business dot Facebook dot com then click add business type in your business name and then

53
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.190
your name and the business email address you want to use.

54
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.110
After that you'll want to either create your first page or claim a page you've been using to promote

55
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.620
your stuff.

56
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.070
Either way here's what you need to do.

57
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.890
Cook the business settings button in the upper right on the next page you should see people on assets

58
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.020
in bold on the left and under that an icon menu roll over the second icon.

59
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.540
That's pages and then click that it should say you have no pages yet no problem.

60
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.970
Well click.

61
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.470
Just add new pages.

62
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.360
And if your page already exists somewhere then you can click claim a page now type it in and it should

63
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.770
appear and then hit the claim button if that's the case.

64
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.320
But if you don't have a page at most you guys probably don't.

65
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.140
Then click on Add new pages then create a new page that will take you through the process of setting

66
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.860
up a page.

67
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.960
Since we're at this point talking about SDM and advertising in general social ads I'm going to assume

68
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.940
you've already created a page for your business or product.

69
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.690
If you haven't well pause here and just read it now you'll honestly need a page going forward.

70
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.490
We kind of set this up earlier in the course but it's relatively easy to use.

71
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.570
I use Kanva.

72
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.810
It's a free design app that helps you make Facebook cover posts helps you set up your profile image

73
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.910
helps you do a lot.

74
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.340
It really shouldn't take a lot of time to get something up decently looking that you can use going forward.

75
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.150
Also keep in mind your ads don't necessarily link to this page.

76
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.030
They just want to associate this activity with a page so it doesn't actually even need to look that

77
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.510
great.

78
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.960
OK so you've claimed a page or created a page.

79
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.940
The third thing you need to set up now is a Facebook account.

80
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.610
Well you'll need an an account to pay for your advertising so let's do that one real quick.

81
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.120
It's another very easy process.

82
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.910
Number one under people and assets roll over of the third icon down that's at accounts.

83
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.600
Click that then it should say you have no account obviously no problem.

84
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.500
Click Add new an account and then create new an account.

85
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.180
Then in the next grade you'll need a name for your account.

86
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.250
You could put your business name or your name or whatever it doesn't matter is not public on behalf

87
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.450
of means which page you're doing the ad work for.

88
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.390
Choose the one you just claimed are at it then choose your time zone and your currency.

89
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.780
If you have no payment option yet that's actually fine you can add that later.

90
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.850
Submit that form and it will create your account.

91
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.320
Now if you thought you were totally done there's two more quick things the Facebook system will ask

92
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.950
you to do.

93
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.150
I don't want to know if you want to use the new account you just created for testing purposes when you

94
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.040
create any new ad campaigns.

95
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.110
You can follow the prompts to say yes if you want to you probably a good idea.

96
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.760
Then it will ask if you want to set up payment methods so you can actually run a campaign when you set

97
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.410
it up.

98
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.510
If you can set this up now it's going to save you a lot of time later.

99
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.330
Just follow link and the steps they give you and you can just add your credit card and that's pretty

100
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.470
much how they're going to charge you.

101
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.460
I think they might even take paypal Once you have the payment method set up well and you can also set

102
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.020
a spending limit which is another good idea to make sure that you don't max out whatever credit card

103
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.630
you just added.

104
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.480
So there you go.

105
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.880
You have everything set up for your Facebook ad campaigns and honestly that's probably the most complex

106
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.150
part of this whole thing.

107
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.220
You are actually in the next few lectures setting up the ads themselves are a lot more fun than AdWords

108
00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.920
and I think they're a lot easier.

109
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.290
Anyway we'll dive into that next lecture.

110
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.890
You'll see that.
