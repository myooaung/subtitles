00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.670
Hey guys, welcome back to the course. So, this lecture,
what we're going to do is take the three principles
1

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.000
that we covered previous lecture for our optimization
audit, and then I'm going to show you a real live example.
2

3
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.030
that we covered previous lecture for our optimization
audit, and then I'm going to show you a real live example.
3

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:20.070
So we're going to demo this on a page that I made actually
for my MVP course, if you guys are following along with that.
4

5
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.520
So we're going to demo this on a page that I made actually
for my MVP course, if you guys are following along with that.
5

6
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.490
I'm going to show you a bad version and then we're going
to talk through how we can convert it into a good version
6

7
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.630
following those three criteria.
7

8
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.100
Remember? One, can they understand what it is? Two,
8

9
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.090
can they figure out why they
should buy it or be interested in it?
9

10
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.440
And three, can they pay you?
10

11
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.420
OK, let's go.
11

12
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.710
All right.
12

13
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.610
So this is the page right here.
13

14
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.630
Now, everybody out there, let's look at the page
and actually just read it. Read it to yourself,
14

15
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.430
and can you figure out what this is?
15

16
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.410
Give yourself four or five seconds.
16

17
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.120
I'll wait.
17

18
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.610
OK.
18

19
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.030
We're back.
19

20
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.690
Can anyone figure out what this is?
20

21
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.690
Well, I'll tell you what it is.
21

22
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:06.270
So this was actually in the MVP course. What it was was
a service where we could give gift baskets to Airbnb hosts.
22

23
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.980
So this was actually in the MVP course. What it was was
a service where we could give gift baskets to Airbnb hosts.
23

24
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.710
They could customize whatever they wanted and
subscribe, so that they got the same baskets over and
24

25
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.840
over and over again, based on how many guests
they had and what the guest preferences were.
25

26
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.520
The idea was that, you know, you host, and you
take 5 to 10 people in your home at a time,
26

27
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.040
so why not have an application where you create
the gifts that you give to your guests, and then, you
27

28
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.830
know, in advance pick what you wanted to go in them.
28

29
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.410
Children getting toys, and old couples getting wine.
29

30
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.300
So this is a good example and a very plausible example
of a site that to me could have made sense,
30

31
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.500
because I know what it does,
31

32
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.640
and so I might think that this is all they need to know.
32

33
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.680
Here's a picture,
33

34
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.420
here's a headline, and here is a testimonial
34

35
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.680
down at the bottom, but in reality, if I didn't know
what it was, I would probably be clueless.
35

36
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.460
Let's start at the top.
36

37
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.820
This is the headline.
37

38
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.600
And in this course, guys, we're going to cover in-depth
making landing pages, how you can get good at making them,
38

39
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.770
And in this course, guys, we're going to cover in-depth
making landing pages, how you can get good at making them,
39

40
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.140
but at this point in the course,
you don't need to be an expert.
40

41
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.400
but at this point in the course,
you don't need to be an expert.
41

42
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.960
We just need to follow those three criteria.
42

43
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.980
So "The cheapest thank you you can give."
43

44
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.000
First of all, grammatically, that's a little bit weird "you you."
44

45
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.980
It also sounds kind of funny, because think about it,
45

46
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.600
"The cheapest thank you you can give." Doesn't it
make it just sound like you're a cheap person?
46

47
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.430
A thank you is supposed to be heartfelt and actually
put effort into it, whatever, that's totally aside,
47

48
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.810
but what does that mean?
48

49
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.820
Like, I can understand, I can connect the two.
49

50
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.440
It's a gift of some sort.
50

51
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.830
It's a gift of some sort.
51

52
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.960
Giving a gift, cheapest thank you.
52

53
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.380
Am I buying that?
53

54
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.160
That is the question I might ask, because this image
is kind of irrelevant. And then it says "Give the
54

55
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.940
gift of Airbasket to your Airbnb guests.
They will thank you later."
55

56
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.340
gift of Airbasket to your Airbnb guests.
They will thank you later."
56

57
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.940
All right, great.
57

58
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.080
So I figured out for Airbnb, yes,
58

59
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.180
the Airbasket goes to them, but I don't know what
the Airbasket necessarily is, I hope it's not that.
59

60
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.470
the Airbasket goes to them, but I don't know what
the Airbasket necessarily is, I hope it's not that.
60

61
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.680
And then let's see if maybe we can find another clue.
61

62
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.210
We have a testimonial. "Airbasket
has saved me in so many situations with
62

63
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.690
my guests. They absolutely love
receiving them and always thank me later."
63

64
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.520
So what you can tell is they're buying something.
64

65
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.020
Not sure why we would buy, and I don't know what it is.
65

66
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.000
So this is a great example.
66

67
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.080
I mean, you'd have to be Sherlock Holmes to be able to
put together the pieces to figure out what exactly this is.
67

68
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.950
I mean, you'd have to be Sherlock Holmes to be able to
put together the pieces to figure out what exactly this is.
68

69
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.200
Even if I was interested, I'd probably leave, because I don't
know what this is, and I don't want to waste my time
69

70
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.020
trying to figure it out.
70

71
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.210
Second, do we have any reason why we should buy it?
71

72
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:34.650
I mean, it says cheap, and says they will thank you, and this
person said it was nice, but those aren't really reasons.
72

73
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.250
I mean, it says cheap, and says they will thank you, and this
person said it was nice, but those aren't really reasons.
73

74
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.880
How does this benefit me?
Cheap is just not a benefit to me.
74

75
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.060
How does this benefit me?
Cheap is just not a benefit to me.
75

76
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.160
I guess, "saved me in situations,"
I don't know what the situations are.
76

77
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.440
This is very hard to kind of connect the two.
77

78
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.020
And then, if I want to buy it, I hit "Create a basket" and it appears
that it's just, let's see, a form, and it just says "Thank you!"
78

79
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.790
And then, if I want to buy it, I hit "Create a basket" and it appears
that it's just, let's see, a form, and it just says "Thank you!"
79

80
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.320
OK.
80

81
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.450
How did I, how was I supposed to buy that?
81

82
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.770
That fails on all three counts.
82

83
00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:59.060
OK.
83

84
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.710
So what we need to do is change this.
84

85
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.280
We need to convert it into a way
that it's actually easy to understand.
85

86
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.410
So at home, actually think about this to yourself. How
would you improve this, given what you know it does?
86

87
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.810
Well, the first thing I'm going to suggest is that since you see
the headline first, you should probably tackle that one first.
87

88
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.600
Well, the first thing I'm going to suggest is that since you see
the headline first, you should probably tackle that one first.
88

89
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.890
Everyone reads the headline first.
89

90
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.410
I mean, that's just a fact of home pages,
landing pages, and marketing in general.
90

91
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.970
So "The cheapest thank you you can give,"
91

92
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.570
I would change that to something a little bit more specific.
92

93
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.150
It's OK if it's vague
93

94
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.350
if you then explain right here what it is.
94

95
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.490
Because the second thing people read is going to be this.
So I can use something that piques their interest or
95

96
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.380
I can explain it or give a little bit more of a clue,
96

97
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.560
but then I have to explain it. This is the area where
I explain dead simple what it is, and then I just
97

98
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.750
simply would not use a testimonial, and if I used a
testimonial, it would have to be something that is
98

99
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:58.020
more specific, it would have to say something like,
you know, "Airbasket is a gift that my guests love.
99

100
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.330
I love the fact that I can customize it and have it come
at convenient times, you know, and that my guests
100

101
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.590
can say it's personalized," or something like that. It
needs to have some of those features or benefits
101

102
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.230
in it to make sense and to be
somewhat convincing. And then,
102

103
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.810
yeah, obviously the second thing is, because
there's no benefits or clear benefits,
103

104
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:24.940
I would straight up just change this and add a section
that says "How it works" or "Why you should do it."
104

105
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.260
OK.
105

106
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.520
So let's look at an actual version that after
I've done that, I'm going to focus on benefits,
106

107
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.130
focus on clarity, and I'm going to
make sure that you can pay for it.
107

108
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.230
So here you go.
108

109
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.010
Now, if you actually go to Airbasket.co,
you will see this version.
109

110
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.440
So it says "Your guests will love you." Again, vague,
doesn't necessarily say what it is, but the next sentence
110

111
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.560
does. "Give each of your guests a personalized welcome
basket. Get baskets delivered on time for each guest
111

112
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.180
for as little as $7/basket." And then this image is much
more specific, much more relevant. In 1-2 seconds,
112

113
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.930
for as little as $7/basket." And then this image is much
more specific, much more relevant. In 1-2 seconds,
113

114
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.430
if you were to look at this and you didn't know what
it does, you could figure this one out. And then
114

115
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.080
benefits, right here.
115

116
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.740
"Why use Airbasket: save time and effort,
116

117
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.980
200 items to choose from,
117

118
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.020
enjoy bulk prices."
118

119
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.440
There you go.
119

120
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.450
And then I even went down farther and said how it
works and, you know, other things, why you should
120

121
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.740
buy, we cover a lot of this
121

122
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.880
later, again, when we talk about landing pages and Instapage,
that's what we use. You guys can look forward to that later.
122

123
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.600
later, again, when we talk about landing pages and Instapage,
that's what we use. You guys can look forward to that later.
123

124
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.110
OK, so you guys can see the difference.
124

125
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.360
Image is more relevant.
125

126
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.610
There is a text that literally describes what it is.
126

127
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.340
And then we literally describe
why you should pay me money.
127

128
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.030
OK.
128

129
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.330
Now, the only thing that's left in
our third or three piece audit is paying.
129

130
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.730
OK.
130

131
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:46.520
Now, let me show you how easy it is to add payment.
I can't cover every single base, guys, because if you're using
131

132
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.540
Shopify, it's a different way, if you're using WordPress,
it's a different way, if you're using a SquareSpace,
132

133
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.750
it's all basically different, but I'm going to show you
133

134
00:06:53.760 --> 00:07:00.590
the simplest way to do it, and this way covers
most bases. Just go to Stripe.com. What
134

135
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:07.700
they are, they allow you to take credit cards online,
they're a competitor to PayPal, they are well-known.
135

136
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.070
Why? Because they're extremely easy to use.
136

137
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.300
Why? Because they're extremely easy to use.
137

138
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.710
Just create an account and you will be
up and running in like two hours.
138

139
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:21.370
I say two hours because you do have to have your
account approved before you can take credit cards, but
139

140
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.830
you can get it set up in the first five minutes,
so set up an account and I'll see you inside.
140

141
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.130
All right.
141

142
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.780
And this is what the panel looks like.
142

143
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.960
You know, it's going to track all of your credit card
transactions, you can add all sorts of cool stuff
143

144
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:37.930
like subscriptions, coupons, plans, different products,
you can make it like events, you can make it do all
144

145
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.100
sorts of really cool stuff.
145

146
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:39.880
Big fan of Stripe.
146

147
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.120
Always check it out.
147

148
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:46.960
But now, how do we integrate this? Go to
documentation and right here, checkout.
148

149
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.140
Just go to checkout.
149

150
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.590
That is the button that you want.
150

151
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.060
So if you're doing PayPal, it's the same thing.
151

152
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.310
I mean, they just give you a PayPal button, you just say
you want to take payments and they'll take you to a page.
152

153
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:57.820
I mean, they just give you a PayPal button, you just say
you want to take payments and they'll take you to a page.
153

154
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.310
It just takes a lot longer with PayPal.
154

155
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:05.500
So right here it shows you how to integrate it. It's actually really,
really simple, and they're very nice. Because I'm logged in,
155

156
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.490
So right here it shows you how to integrate it. It's actually really,
really simple, and they're very nice. Because I'm logged in,
156

157
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:10.030
they've already input the code that I need for this to work.
157

158
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:17.050
They put in my data key, and my data image, and all that
stuff, so I don't have to deal with that, don't have to
158

159
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.280
be technical in the slightest.
159

160
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.040
All I need to know is I have to copy this and go
to whatever you're using for your website.
160

161
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:24.730
It's custom, no problem.
161

162
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:29.120
If you're using a platform, look
for the custom HTML editor.
162

163
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.070
So the way that you would do this
in Instapage is you just go up to New,
163

164
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:39.170
it's right there at HTML, and you can add custom HTML. Wix does this, Weebly does this, WordPress does this, Shopify does this.
164

165
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.160
it's right there at HTML, and you can add custom HTML. Wix does this, Weebly does this, WordPress does this, Shopify does this.
165

166
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.060
Everyone who has a platform will
allow you to insert custom HTML.
166

167
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.150
And, you know, if you're doing a custom website,
you work with a developer, just ask them to add it in. 
167

168
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.320
And, you know, if you're doing a custom website,
you work with a developer, just ask them to add it in. 
168

169
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.170
It's like putting in your Google AdWords,
your Google Analytics little snippet.
169

170
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.270
It takes three seconds.
170

171
00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.580
So you just double click
171

172
00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:03.440
in this case, and I just copy right there, say done,
it can't show me it yet, because it has to be live,
172

173
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.930
but you'll see in a second.
173

174
00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:05.930
Now I have a button.
174

175
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.080
So now I can just say Preview.
175

176
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.240
And there you go.
176

177
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:14.120
Look, I have a button right there that says "Pay
with Card," I can click it and I can pay you money.
177

178
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.550
You see how long that took me?
178

179
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.060
Look, you can pay me.
179

180
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.760
That's actually the technical name of Sprintkick. I put in 
180

181
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.250
my e-mail, I put in my credit card, pay
20 dollars or whatever you set it up to be.
181

182
00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.810
No excuses, guys.
182

183
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:31.390
That's how you can, in roughly five minutes, get a
payment button in to pass your one, two, three audit.
183

184
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:31.660
OK.
184

185
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:40.780
So we took an ugly, unfunctional page like this, and
we made it so that it actually makes sense, like this,
185

186
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.840
and then we added a payment button so we can pay.
186

187
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.430
There you go.
187

188
00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.430
We're done with the audit.
188

189
00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.710
Moving on, and hopefully you guys do the same.
189

190
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:48.520
All right, see you in the next lecture.
