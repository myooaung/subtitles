00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,650
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:07,560
So we started the section with a couple lectures about SVM what it is specifically why it's important

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,930
and a whole lot of detail about you know the terms that are involved with it.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:17,290
PPC C-p MCP a is that we have quality score.

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,590
We have ADD rank you can reward that the previous lecture if you guys don't feel like you understood

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,010
the concepts thoroughly.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,320
Now with all this info being thrown at you you might still be wondering is s.a.m right for me.

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,040
I get my toe into the paid search pool and try it out.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,690
Is this something I should stay out of or should I jump right in with both feet cannonball style and

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,790
just like any other channel or tactic paid isn't the right move for everyone.

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,700
And it's certainly not a requirement.

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,990
Many web sites and business owners out there ignore it completely and just focus on Organic SEO efforts

13
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,440
to build traffic and their audience and some of them are doing great.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,280
Just creating blog posts and articles sending out emails to people engaging on social networks etc..

15
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,010
Now there are a lot of channels you can use to grow your audience without the need for paid tools like

16
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,480
the ones we're going to discuss here.

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,240
However it's something that it's probably worth trying out just to see if it works for you should probably

18
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,450
try to explore the many avenues as you can.

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,580
As many traction channels as you can but just keeping in mind in general if you're not selling something

20
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,560
well then it can be hard to justify paid search.

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,080
Like if I'm selling something at $100 Well then it's pretty easy to say well I got to optimize this

22
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:32,420
ad and this landing page to get enough people to convert before I spend $100.

23
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,880
But if you're doing something else or you're selling to me it's five bucks you're selling something

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,920
that's just download like a freemium that it might be a little bit harder to justify.

25
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,110
And there are certain disadvantages that come with going the paid advertising route.

26
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:49,660
For one thing click through rates on search ads or just really low again or averaging around 2 percent.

27
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,330
Now for display ads it's actually even lower like less than a half of a percent.

28
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,880
I think it's like point three five of a percent.

29
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,430
Now the reason why display ads just don't know when clicks on them it just has to do with what we call

30
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:09,310
banter blindness and that's a concept that I think we covered in one of the earlier lectures of the

31
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,360
really long course some Never forget where we actually cover it.

32
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,350
But basically what happens is people get used to ads and especially getting used to ad formats and over

33
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,660
time as more and more people get used to it.

34
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,920
Your brain starts to just filter it out naturally.

35
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:21,860
So I don't know.

36
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,290
I can't even think the last time I saw a display ad but if I went through and looked at the last and

37
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,930
web sites I was at I guarantee there are some display ads I just don't notice them anymore.

38
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,230
It's also something referred to as the law of should he click through.

39
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,430
We won't get into it right now.

40
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,840
Also worth pointing out there's a general distrust amongst a big piece of the population out there when

41
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,590
it comes to any sort of paid advertising online study done a few years ago showed that between 40 and

42
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,050
50 percent of people trusted search ads social ads mobile ads and display ads 40 to 50 percent.

43
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:52,770
That's it.

44
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,140
The other half is really skeptical.

45
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,020
Now Trust has improved which is good.

46
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:03,130
But advertising still isn't as trustworthy as things like say advice for people you know or online reviews.

47
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:09,930
But at the same time there are some companies that not only use SVM they rely entirely on it.

48
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:16,610
Some good examples are e-commerce shops e-commerce shops oftentimes just really really heavily rely

49
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,210
on ads.

50
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,110
This is excellent and you see more and more now and it still blows my mind.

51
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,540
But a lot of kick starters are using search engine ads knowing that to back something at $400 or $300.

52
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:34,650
They can justify using search tools and especially if they're just using search ads for people searching

53
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,850
for really specific things or even just searching the name of the project they heard of.

54
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,400
Now are you still undecided about using SDM.

55
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,550
You probably are that's perfectly fine.

56
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,300
Let me offer some good reasons to use SVM.

57
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:52,350
Now some of these just might apply to your specific situation so you might want to use SVM to give something

58
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,840
new or timely a boost when you launch a new product page or web site.

59
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:03,680
You certainly want people to notice it but new content doesn't have any organic value by itself.

60
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,040
So you can use paid search to immediately get your ads in front of people who might be interested in

61
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,530
what you've got when they search for relevant terms.

62
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:18,210
For example right after the Pittsburgh Penguins won the Stanley Cup in hockey search ads pretty much

63
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:24,660
began immediately showing up on search results for Pittsburgh Penguins champion shirts and they were

64
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:31,140
from apparel companies selling championship shirts so that's a great example of you need to be shown

65
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,400
in front of people immediately.

66
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,070
So it obviously makes sense to strike the iron while it's hot and sell shirts to all the penguins and

67
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,030
other flightless birds living in Pittsburgh.

68
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,310
I don't remember if that new product happens to be an app you can specifically create an app ad which

69
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,710
will appear on phones and tablets and drive people directly to the mobile app store specifically for

70
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,610
that device.

71
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,180
That saves some steps if you're trying to get app downloads and new users from your paid efforts.

72
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,060
In general the fewer steps it takes for a customer to convert the more like they will convert say that

73
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,080
a thousand times.

74
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,740
They might also consider paid search to help you break through the competition.

75
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,690
If the search terms you want to rank for are dominated by competitors or your industry is just really

76
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:17,750
competitive in general using the paid search option might get you listed above others on the piece.

77
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:23,020
Some industries especially like service industries have dozens of companies that all offer very similar

78
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,580
things.

79
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:29,280
Think of tech right with like say web design agencies or even marketing agencies.

80
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:35,320
They're actually even pay per click agencies so that level of density actually makes it such the case

81
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,630
that you might be able to pull off running an ACM marketing campaign to seek out a little bit.

82
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,000
Finance is another industry that's pretty much the same way.

83
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,980
There's a lot of competition for services that are all very similar.

84
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:52,390
In fact tech finance and Consumer Services have historically had clicked through rates that are higher

85
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:57,670
than average probably because people are usually looking for help with building a web site or saving

86
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:01,290
money for retirement or whatever it is when they click the ad.

87
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,070
So if you offer a service and compete with a bunch of other places paid search might be an option for

88
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,460
you.

89
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,550
Other companies use paid search for some more specific reasons.

90
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:15,130
Now you might use SVM to keep traffic consistent like you trying to make your efforts work but maybe

91
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,340
not getting enough traffic or traffic is very inconsistent.

92
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,260
Paid ads might be a way to pick up some of the slack when you need to focus on specific conversions

93
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,780
paid search can also help.

94
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:30,490
Organic links might take visitors to your home page or some other page but you can set up your ads to

95
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:36,030
drive users to landing pages designed to drive users to take an action like buying something.

96
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,000
These ads could be based on mobile behavior as well.

97
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:44,620
Like if someone installed your app a while ago you can show them an ad inviting them to come back or

98
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,270
highlighting a new feature in the app.

99
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,510
They're not using it at times.

100
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,320
There's a specific kind of performance metric you're hoping to impact with advertising.

101
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,580
You usually wouldn't start running and paying for an ad just to see what happens.

102
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:03,280
You want to get more sales more users more awareness amongst your competitors or more use of your app

103
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,610
something that justifies spending the money to make that actually happen.

104
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,870
So if you find yourself in this position wanting to improve some part of your website or app performance

105
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,410
page search and other SVM options might be something you should try out.

106
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:18,520
And if you want to learn more about setting up ads and giving it a shot just keep watching because the

107
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,930
lectures to come will help you out.

108
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,330
All right guys I'll see you then.
