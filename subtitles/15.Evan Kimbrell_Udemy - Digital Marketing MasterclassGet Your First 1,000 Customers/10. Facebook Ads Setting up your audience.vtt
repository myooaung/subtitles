00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.040
Our guys welcome back to the course in our last lecture we started setting up the Facebook ad campaign

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.200
and we chose our objectives.

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.490
Now let's continue now with the outset.

4
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.260
And depending on the objective you'll see a different group of things to set up each time.

5
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.460
But in general it's about setting up who you want to actually see and what you want people to do and

6
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.130
how much you want to spend in total in the process.

7
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.040
I'm going to walk you through our example here where we set driving traffic as their objective.

8
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.120
But I'll mention a few other options along the way.

9
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.670
So since you chose to drive traffic the first setting we see is the on the outside is going to be guess

10
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.410
about traffic.

11
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.080
This is where you tell Facebook if you want to drive traffic to your website or to your app.

12
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.820
Now in our case well it's going to be a web site so we'll keep the setting as is and will enter the

13
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.850
URL later on in our setup.

14
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.810
They will bring it to our attention.

15
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.950
The next thing is offer and at this point I don't want to do anything with this.

16
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.440
I just want to create an ADD but no coupons or discount codes right this second.

17
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.680
Let's form the basics first and then later on you guys can get into more advanced stuff.

18
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.930
We can skip this and I'm just going to leave it off.

19
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.630
Now if you chose something else you'd probably see a different setting to begin with.

20
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.430
Like if you chose conversions as your objective a conversion setting will show up where you tell Facebook

21
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.510
what Pathi you want customers to take or if you choose they like product catalog sales is the objective

22
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.500
products will show up and that's a whole other thing where you're sort of set up product listings on

23
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.870
your Facebook page like is that the settings will vary and apply to the objective you chose.

24
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.230
So follow along with what Facebook shows you it's pretty straightforward.

25
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.600
Since we're doing a split test we're going to see the variable section with a split test.

26
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.740
You can run multiple ads and see what forms best but to be honest the simpler the better here if you're

27
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.530
starting out I suggest you do a simple A-B test two versions but change only one thing about them.

28
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.180
Now I know this is a little bit different than what I'm saying with Google Adwords But this is because

29
00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.350
with Facebook you can change your audience and such a greater degree that at first I think it's worth

30
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.410
tailoring the audience and then figuring out the ad.

31
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.520
So in this case I'm going to test my audience to see if one group would perform better than another.

32
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.800
That's usually a bigger variation.

33
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.390
Maybe Generation X fans would like the service more than Millennials.

34
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.680
I don't know let's test that and let's just see.

35
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.090
Now first we need to define our audience.

36
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.510
Audience settings are generally include the following location which could be people living in the location

37
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.830
visiting there even or were recently there.

38
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.190
I know age range and gender have their language so then detailed targeting lets you filter your audience.

39
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.910
You can either include specific people or exclude them based on really detailed attributes.

40
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.790
For example if you wanted to target millennials you could click in the include field to use demographics

41
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.520
than generation then guess what.

42
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.770
Millennials Yes actually have written out for you.

43
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.230
You'll see that immediately ads over a million people to your potential audience.

44
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.000
And as you pick different attributes the audience size and numbers over on the right will change.

45
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.430
Now in most cases you're hoping to define an audience right kind of in the middle of that green range

46
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.690
of the audience size meter.

47
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.330
If it's too broad then you're not going to be effective with your ad placements.

48
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.790
In fact Facebook's only really get to know where to put them and you could end up getting charged a

49
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.970
lot more than you should.

50
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.750
But on the flip side if you go too specific then you're just not going to get enough volume.

51
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.500
So you're just not gonna have enough people looking at it.

52
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.500
So it's just not really going to move the needle in terms of your ad campaign.

53
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.230
You don't need a thousand customers.

54
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:37.810
You can't do that with a really really narrow ad campaign unless you know you're fine running it for

55
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.560
six months.

56
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.110
Let's do a little bit more here.

57
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.150
Now I'm gonna change my location from the U.S. to San Francisco.

58
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.970
So I'll click in the location field start typing San Francisco and it'll show me that as a as a choice

59
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.810
when I pick it well the audience has updates you can see that on the side.

60
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.610
Now it's kind of somewhere in the middle.

61
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.580
Great spot to be.

62
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.920
But my work is not done.

63
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.710
If I decide to include any other attributes or the audience size probably should increase.

64
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.150
For example let's say I sell products that support the local football team like the 49ers.

65
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.380
And I want to drive traffic to the site with my AD.

66
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.930
So another way to define my audience is to include people who are fans of the team so I can actually

67
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.040
type in Forty-Niners and then I can pick the team from the list that shows up.

68
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.580
San Francisco 49ers and we see the audience in the upper right has increased just a little bit more.

69
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.630
So go ahead and choose whatever attributes you want to finalize in your audience just to shoot for an

70
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.390
audience size somewhere in the middle.

71
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.550
And if the arrows pointing straight up in the green that's great not too narrow not too broad.

72
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.360
It's kind of the Goldilocks when you're good.

73
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.550
Just quick save this audience and then give it a name that'll help you recognize it later.

74
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.730
I personally like to name them like my first version second version third version or I'd say like Forty-Niners

75
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.730
fans plus something or Forty-Niners fans minus something and as I start figuring out more and more tailoring

76
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:55.000
it.

77
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.980
But I like to save the audiences because sometimes I want to go back and retrace my steps.

78
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.040
Somebody call this one San Francisco 49ers millennial fans and it's safe.

79
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.780
So now your audience settings you'll see that audience appears with at a glance.

80
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.880
Details about them.

81
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.350
Since we're doing a split test we need to choose a second audience.

82
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.280
So here in the variable settings you can see my millennials audience is one brought in some or two we

83
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.810
can edit the one we just created and then tweak it to create the new audience we want.

84
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:23.700
Easy enough.

85
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.530
I'll just choose that millennial audience again.

86
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.230
But then I'm going to click the button below and then I'll go in here.

87
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.230
I want to find where it says Generation click that.

88
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.420
And then again in effect generation X this time and I'm sending a de-select millennials.

89
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:43.540
Now we say this as a new audience using the button at the bottom and we'll call this the San Francisco

90
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.110
49ers.

91
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.770
Gen X fans perfect.

92
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.350
All set the variable.

93
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.550
And the audience information moving on now the next setting is placement and I suggest you leave it

94
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.650
as is with the recommended automatic placement placement settings include the device type people are

95
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.650
using and the network will see the ad on including Facebook Instagram Facebook.

96
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.450
Audience Network which actually can include a lot of other web sites.

97
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:09.070
At first I like to use all of them and then look at the stats and then figure out which ones are working

98
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.470
in general placements on the side of Facebook.

99
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:17.920
I talked about this before are terrible in the right column and in general mobile ads are just harder

100
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.700
when you're asking for more from people on the landing page so keep that in mind.

101
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:27.970
But up until this point unless you have a specific reason to show ads only on mobile media thing is

102
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.560
literally mobile only or only on facebook you think doesn't work for mobile or something like that.

103
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.610
Then I personally just leave it as it is right now.

104
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.900
Now the last setting worth looking at here is the budget and schedule or if you're doing a split test

105
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:46.690
the split test budget and schedule is way to go about this is to decide how much money you want to spend

106
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.910
in total and how many days you want to run it for if you did 10 days with a limit of like $10 a day

107
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.000
while you spend no more than $100 even under the split test.

108
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.250
You will be running two or more ads at the same time so you'll be dividing your money amongst the ads.

109
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:05.160
The good news is split test is that your ads will still be seen but you'll be hoping for a good performance

110
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.600
and for a way to essentially define the winner.

111
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.360
Keep in mind with split test you want to obviously get to a certain amount of volume to say that one's

112
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.880
a winner.

113
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.020
He spent ten bucks and said oh this one's doing better.

114
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.370
It's not enough information you know to be statistically relevant.

115
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.230
You need to get to a certain point.

116
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:29.940
I usually try to over 100 clicks and that's when I start feeling a little more comfortable about it.

117
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:35.110
That's at that point when you move like a 100 to 200 then I start really saying like OK this one clearly

118
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.620
winning.

119
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.190
And there's also one other variable that you can set here.

120
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.760
Facebook can actually determine a winner based on performance and that saves you actually kind of a

121
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.760
lot of time.

122
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.950
Now under the schedule you can check off in the test as soon as the winning asset can be determined.

123
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.480
You know one out performs better.

124
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.390
You don't want to run the worst ad anymore.

125
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.180
Right.

126
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.880
I'll just tell you when one is clearly better and then you can start a new campaign with the winner

127
00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.410
or split another one.

128
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.010
And I think I'll run this for 10 days of the total budget.

129
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.210
I don't know a hundred dollars with an even split.

130
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.020
The ads will be run through the time each to determine the winner.

131
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.560
This is always just an example.

132
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:13.210
I generally suggest spending a little bit more unless you are just working with really really really

133
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:18.850
cheap ads and if you're OK with bidding really low just never having your stuff displayed.

134
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.290
Now once I hit continue we finally move onto the ad creation page.

135
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.600
Let's break here and we'll tackle that actually in the next lecture.

136
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:25.980
All right guys.

137
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:26.440
See the.
