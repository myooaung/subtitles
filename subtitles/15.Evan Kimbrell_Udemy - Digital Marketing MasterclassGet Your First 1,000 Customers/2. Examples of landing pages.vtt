00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.150
Hey guys welcome back to the Corps.

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.500
So we established what langauges are and our last lecture those pages you could be offering up with

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.360
say an insightful e-book that could make a social media managers job easier.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.120
Or an email course to provide regular tips to writers looking to improve their skills.

5
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.370
What are some examples.

6
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.220
One interesting lead magnets are used to attract visitors.

7
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.200
The combination of that promise value within nicely designed compelling page can result in a lot of

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.390
people showing interest.

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.750
They also do a better job than usual sales pages because usually usually you're asking for a lower bar

10
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.750
of entry usually just asking for their name and email maybe their phone number.

11
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.500
It's a lot easier than asking for their credit card.

12
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.210
So what do successful landing pages do.

13
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.900
Well they clearly state the value of the lead magnet and they do that pretty explicitly.

14
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.780
They make the value relevant to the visitor.

15
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.560
Here is why this awesome thing should matter to you.

16
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.950
They establish trust by providing an easy mechanism for getting that value.

17
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.250
Here's how you can get that awesome thing.

18
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.270
They do all of this and a distraction free environment.

19
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.800
They might say something like I'm not trying to sell you any other awesome things just this awesome

20
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.160
thing.

21
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.380
Click here to get that awesome thing.

22
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.330
Now it's not always easy to plan design and execute a great landing page but there are some excellent

23
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.800
ones out there we can look at for inspiration.

24
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.860
So let's look at these ideas in action.

25
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.720
First up check out this landing page from Kiss metrics this landing page is for a free web in our on

26
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.440
how to do Facebook advertising.

27
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.800
There's no waste information here at all.

28
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.080
A quick scan of the page tells you everything you really need to know from Kismat Tri-X.

29
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.320
It's FREE.

30
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.270
There is the title right here.

31
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.980
There's the date.

32
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.480
There's even a time zone converter if I'm really lazy and can't do the math.

33
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.270
Here's a nice three column set up with a short form on the left or description in the middle and the

34
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.900
faces and names of the people involved on the right.

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.910
The description here is focused on the top bullet points below give me some decently helpful detail.

36
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.080
Now the form is pretty simple.

37
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.620
Just name email country and would I like a demo.

38
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.230
So really nothing too intrusive here at all.

39
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.300
Now here's a great touch below the form even if you can't make it sign up anyway.

40
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.890
Now this will send you a recording and that is a really nice touch and I would imagine it helps them

41
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.950
with sign ups.

42
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.440
You think about it even if you have a mild interest in us webinars but you're not so interested you

43
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.920
going to wake up early instead of your computer for an hour and a half.

44
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.210
Well you could say maybe I'll just check this out later when they e-mail me the recording.

45
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.140
That way they'll just get a lot more people who sign up.

46
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.290
Now overall I love how clean this landing page is.

47
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.610
There's nothing else really distracting you from that than our information.

48
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.850
The best lesson to learn here is this.

49
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.490
Everywhere you look you see something to help you understand what's being offered.

50
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.650
If your landing page can do that well it'll be successful.

51
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.510
All right let's check out another example.

52
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.660
HubSpot created an e-book called How to write the perfect e-mail.

53
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.750
It's available for free on this landing page which is another nice example of a clean design rich with

54
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.380
detail.

55
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.220
Now scroll down from the top.

56
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.370
Do you guys remember how to spot.

57
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.500
They make marketing software and they do a lot of different things.

58
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.500
So we know right here this is from Hub's Vought.

59
00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.810
Now it's pretty obvious.

60
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.480
But you know putting your logo up there establishes you know who's offering this.

61
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.040
Don't obviously overlook that.

62
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.050
Well here's an ebook cover title on a subtitle looks pretty good.

63
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.370
Here's our first call to action.

64
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.220
Download Now for people who already know they want it.

65
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.690
Well they'll jump on this button.

66
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.390
But for people who need to learn more well they can easily just keep scrolling because there's more

67
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.140
info.

68
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.110
Next we see a description and checkmarks noting that there's six specific items that you'll learn from

69
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.900
this guide.

70
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.140
Now here's a nice touch especially for an e-book landing page which is a little tired sometimes.

71
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.520
Take a peek inside the guide.

72
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.880
Well then you can leaf through this ebook and see what it looks like.

73
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.180
Now there's not a lot of pages shown here but you get a feel for the design and what to expect.

74
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.260
And then last we have a short a q completely about the form you're about to fill out.

75
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.070
Do I have to.

76
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.740
And is this really free.

77
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.190
I like the idea of validating their need for your personal info here as well and reassuring you that

78
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.900
yes the book is free when I can charge you later for it probably wasn't in doubt because these are common

79
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.850
enough now but it's a good reminder.

80
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.950
Since you're about to share them some information.

81
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.210
Anyways when we go a download button here at the bottom we're brought to a simple form page with email

82
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.100
company name you URL and it's that's it.

83
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.910
Short and sweet.

84
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.440
And by filling this out we're creating an account so we can get instant access to other e-books and

85
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.890
free tools supposedly.

86
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.270
Overall I like the landing page experience here.

87
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.110
The first page is pretty nicely detailed and clean and the sign up form offers the promise of more value

88
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.520
on top of the ebook.

89
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.860
Now Scott can offer that because well they've got a lot of resources but for small businesses as long

90
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.510
as you establish the value of your ebook or whatever it is that you're offering filling out the form

91
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.410
should still be a no brainer.

92
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.830
Again you make a good enough case for it.

93
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.900
Now let's take a look at an e-mail course landing page because our familiar e-mail courses are basically

94
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.550
free.

95
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.390
Courses that are through e-mail you can guess that you sign up and then they send you one lesson at

96
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.170
a time.

97
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.050
It's also called like a drip campaign.

98
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.180
But in this case the idea is every single day is only a small amount of content.

99
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.130
And the reason why they do this is just because everyday they can send out an email.

100
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.320
And the people who are more and more interested will stay till the very end and then you can see and

101
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.240
like MailChimp or whatever analytics are conceived this person is really interested and then you can

102
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.220
send them targeted messages.

103
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.620
Now if you send them one really long piece you wouldn't know who finished it who didn't.

104
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.910
But then also just fewer people will consume it because it's easier to give someone five one hour courses

105
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.320
than one five hour course.

106
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.130
Now this example is much different than the usual one but it's still a good one.

107
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.070
So what does it say boost your hair moisture.

108
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.890
Now as a white guy I'm immediately out of my element.

109
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.970
But for women of color who've got curly hair Well there's obviously value here.

110
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.550
The huge background image tells you who the people at curly hair lounge dot com are targeting with this

111
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.470
email course.

112
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.740
But I don't have to be the audience to clearly understand what they're offering here.

113
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.050
Learn how to take better care of your curly hair.

114
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.460
OK.

115
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.270
Scroll down and you can see Monica is teaching this and you can read about her experience gool.

116
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.790
But before you start.

117
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.570
Well that gives us statements about what's included in this eight day course and below that we have

118
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.400
a group of testimonials women who have found success through this course and well that's a great touch.

119
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.310
Sometimes people ask me there people who believe testimonials.

120
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.290
And the answer is yes people generally do.

121
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.220
I mean you could just make up testimonials but for whatever reason people do trust them.

122
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.400
It's not as if they're getting a testimonial from the best friend.

123
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.710
But it's still better than nothing.

124
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.300
And then finally we have another call to action which is Hellyeah plus a quick reminder of what you're

125
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.930
signing up for a nice little touch of personality in there.

126
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.580
Now the tone of the copy is strong but inspiring.

127
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.830
So if you're a black girl who wants to embrace her curly hair well this landing page targets you very

128
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.180
well.

129
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.260
OK let's wrap up with one more example.

130
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:45.290
This next landing page offers a lot of information but for what there white paper is promising registering

131
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.470
for the Web site could be worth it depending if you're the right audience.

132
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:55.100
So track Tica is a research and consulting firm that put out a white paper on enterprise wearable technology.

133
00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.260
Case studies it's a mouthful but there's a pretty good cottage industry of people out there that make

134
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.690
case studies for enterprise companies.

135
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.310
A lot of times are case studies kind of explaining these broader consumer trends.

136
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.470
To someone who's in a business and then the idea is it might help you be able to adapt it for your business.

137
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.790
Those two things I want to point out here with the landing page itself and what they require to download

138
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:17.250
it first.

139
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.120
There's a lot of info about the white paper on this page.

140
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.610
Essentially this is a research paper 33 pages in link providing 40 different case study examples about

141
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:26.540
wearable tech.

142
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.210
They scroll down the landing page you'll see what the White Paper is all about.

143
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.350
The key questions that addresses who should read it and a complete table of contents.

144
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.860
It's a pretty big landing page for a pretty meaty piece of research so make sense to see how much information

145
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.480
they ask for to download it.

146
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.430
This is also a very common tactic in B to B if you're selling to businesses within a contract value

147
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.530
of one person could be really high.

148
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:53.900
And so you put a lot of effort in these pages just knowing that maybe you'll get 100 really qualified

149
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.370
leads.

150
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.860
Now the White Paper here is free if you register for the Web site.

151
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.620
That process involves sharing a lot more than just your email address.

152
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:04.640
They want info about yourself where you work your title and areas of interest.

153
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.540
It's a pretty good way of pre-qualifying whether or not you're someone that really is interested in

154
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.980
it and whether they should contact you.

155
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:14.210
I don't think the amount of info they're asking for is necessarily too much because well they're mostly

156
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.680
hoping future clients are going to register so they want to know if any of the leads they get will fit

157
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.120
into the specific research areas in their business so they can easily connect the dots.

158
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.010
Ultimately this example should show you that not all landing pages fit into a neat little template your

159
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:33.560
business might require something bigger or richer in detail would you ask for as much info as Practica

160
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:33.900
did.

161
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.720
Well most businesses wouldn't really need to but this is something you'll have to consider when you

162
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.580
serve up a lead magnet of your own to build your B2B you'll want to ask more because it's going to be
