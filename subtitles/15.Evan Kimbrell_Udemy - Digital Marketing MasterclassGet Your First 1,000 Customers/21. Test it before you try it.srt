00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,380
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,140
So we're wrapping up our group of lectures on how to figure out what to write as part of our content

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,340
strategy series.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,230
We just talked about how to organize ideas different places to find ideas of how to rank those ideas

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,300
and ranking ideas is important because well we'll know which ideas to start on.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,000
Well there's another way to identify the better ideas that you've got.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,220
And that's to test them and before you actually try them.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,630
Now what exactly are we talking about.

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:33,120
Basically instead of spending a lot of time creating say 20 pieces of content based on 20 ideas you

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,720
have.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,780
What do you get instead just validate those ideas upfront Yeah there's no Idea validator app out there.

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,500
No one's created that yet but there are real people out there that you know and you can actually use

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,590
to get some feedback.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,370
At least I assume you know some real people right.

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,460
I hope I'm not the only person you know because I've got bad news for you.

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,680
I'm actually just character on a TV show and I'm not real.

17
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:57,460
I mean it's

18
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,260
not anything anyway.

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,100
What if you could run your ideas by people who might be interested in them and then you could find out

20
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,080
that out of those 20 ideas maybe only 10 of them are in real demand.

21
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,120
And the other men not so much.

22
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,390
That means you could save half of your time and produce a bunch of blog posts and other materials that

23
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,890
are more likely to succeed.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,700
Great.

25
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,620
Now I'm all about saving time and succeeding when I make stuff and I hope you are too.

26
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,310
Because in this lecture I'm going to go over some of the ways to test your ideas so whatever you produce

27
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,650
has a better chance of succeeding.

28
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:36,020
Now the first way to test your ideas is to email people you know and just simply ask for their opinion.

29
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,810
So this is where those real people I mentioned before come in handy.

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,460
First you're going to need some people who have similar interest as your audience.

31
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,430
That way they can truly represent a sample of who you're trying to reach.

32
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,780
Otherwise if the e-mail your roommate for instance which is weird because he's right there in the same

33
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,210
room with you or your mom or a friend and if they don't really have the same interests as your audience

34
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,080
this test really isn't going to work and it's actually going to give you a lot of false signals as an

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,090
example if you're a Web consultant for small business owners then you might need some small business

36
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,190
owners to e-mail.

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,690
So who is your audience.

38
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,960
You know maybe 10 people who have similar interests as your audience is a great place to start but you

39
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,270
don't want to just copy and paste your entire list and drop it in email and say What do you like about

40
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,060
it.

41
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,750
I actually put some thought into this.

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,450
Maybe you choose the 10 ideas you personally like best and then ask each person of these 10 ideas please

43
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:33,870
choose that three you'd want to read the most or maybe the top five or you could ask choose any of the

44
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,570
ones you'd like to read about.

45
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,350
I don't know.

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,730
It's your choice what you're hoping to get back from this is some kind of consensus or trend like maybe

47
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,760
two or three of these ideas are most popular.

48
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,800
Then you've got some obvious winners.

49
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,380
But if interest seems pretty evenly spaced across the 10 all then maybe they'll get a bunch of votes

50
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,820
and that's the case then maybe all 10 of your ideas are decent.

51
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,050
If you want to take this e-mail testing tactic a step further you can email those trusted people with

52
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,810
a link to a survey instead that has the ideas in it.

53
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:09,060
For example you can go to Google form Google or Tom slash forms of Google Docs and list out your 10

54
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,570
ideas.

55
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,700
Ask them to check off what they liked the most.

56
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,440
And then you don't have to actually collect any of the votes.

57
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,350
The survey form does all that for you.

58
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,210
It's a lot actually easier and it's quite a bit cleaner either right.

59
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:22,500
When the surveys done you've got new ideas that have been vetted by real people.

60
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,850
You can have more confidence in the idea that scored well and you can expect more interest in them when

61
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,110
you publish them for real.

62
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,420
Now another way to test your content ideas for you make them is by sharing them on things like Twitter

63
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,140
and Facebook.

64
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,520
Now I saw this pretty simple experiment where a blogger was trying to figure out which topics his blog's

65
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,770
audience wanted to read about.

66
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,460
But instead of e-mailing blog posts ideas like we just covered he found blog posts that were similar

67
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,490
to his ideas from other sites.

68
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,710
Following suit.

69
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:53,020
One of these ideas was let's say to write about all the free alternatives of Photoshop.

70
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,890
He would go out and find a blog post someone else wrote about a very similar topic.

71
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,370
Got it.

72
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,850
Then what he would do is he shared a link to that blog post on his Twitter.

73
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,420
The reason he shared someone else's post instead of burning his own was just to see if the share Got

74
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,470
any engagement.

75
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,200
People liked it or shared it or reply to it.

76
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,900
That meant that there was an audience for that type of content.

77
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:18,030
It means that blog post idea is actually a good one but have nobody reacted or engaged with the share

78
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,270
that the audience probably isn't interested.

79
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,630
And now you can probably cross that idea off your list.

80
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,940
It saves you the trouble of writing it and now you can concentrate on the ideas that have a better chance

81
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,660
of succeeding.

82
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,140
All right so try sharing links to content related to your ideas.

83
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,710
Try doing it on Facebook and Twitter it's great because you don't have to write anything just borrow

84
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,820
someone else's content.

85
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,700
You never really know what your audience will react to.

86
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,800
So it's worth a shot.

87
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,260
Now there's one more experiment I want to tell you about that you can use to test your ideas and that

88
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,240
is a little more elaborate but it's Facebook ads.

89
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,460
You can specifically use Facebook ads for AB testing.

90
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,370
Now Will email and Twitter can be decent testing grounds testing on Facebook and be really valuable

91
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:01,140
because something like 70 percent of shares in General happen on Facebook.

92
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:06,600
What I mean is when someone writes a blog and they have a thousand shares generally speaking 700 of

93
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,760
those were on Facebook.

94
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,080
So that's where most of this stuff happens.

95
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,790
That makes Facebook a great place to figure out which ideas work since it's going to end up on Facebook

96
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,270
anyway.

97
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,410
So how do we.

98
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,380
AB tests or ideas on Facebook.

99
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:24,870
Well one thing what you can do is you can run Facebook ads on your headlines before you actually write

100
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,160
them.

101
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,950
OK so the process generally goes like this.

102
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,070
It does kick some a little bit of a Claytons of Facebook ads but you can learn it in ten minutes or

103
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:38,790
you can skip ahead to the next section or we go over the M and social ads and check it out there.

104
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,280
The process generally goes like this.

105
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:40,790
OK.

106
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,230
First look at your list of ideas and create a headline for let's say three or four of your favorite

107
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,110
ones next.

108
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,880
Start up a Facebook add test based on a previously established target market.

109
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:58,620
Basically just just try to target the best demographics Geographic and socio graphics of your identified

110
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:04,700
audio as you can then what you do is you run the ad and put the headline as the title of the ad and

111
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,510
pick a generic image that fits all of them.

112
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,770
OK.

113
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:15,110
So it's one ad that has four or five or three or four whatever you selected alternate headlines all

114
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,390
using the same generic image.

115
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:23,180
It's not five separate ads it's just one and with multiple copy and in face looks very easy to just

116
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,100
set different and copy.

117
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,920
Then the last thing you do is have the added lead back to either landing page or your blog home page.

118
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,950
That part's not actually really that important.

119
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,180
Now the point is here.

120
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:40,850
When you run these ads you're not actually looking to see necessarily how much it cost to get your clicks

121
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,560
or how much visibility you get.

122
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:48,950
We are actually trying to see is the click through rate based on the headline once you run it you can

123
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:55,460
very easily with a $10 you can show it to four or five hundred people four or five hundred CPM.

124
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:01,640
And then you can see which one has the highest percentage of people looking at it and clicking it.

125
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,410
Now I generally suggest you only do three or four headlines at a time and you do this otherwise you

126
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,820
have to spend more money.

127
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,120
Right.

128
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:15,110
Because 400 views spread over 10 headlines is probably not enough to be statistically significant whereas

129
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,870
three or four it actually is.

130
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:22,040
Once you have a clear winner out of that group with three or four or four or five then you now have

131
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,320
an idea that's probably worth running about or at least putting your efforts towards first.

132
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:31,070
And now in fact if you like that Facebook Abts idea you can actually take it a couple steps further

133
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:38,480
and then use the same testing's system to come up with the best headline for an idea or even the best

134
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,440
angle or the best image.

135
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,020
Really all you can do is once you find out that say number.

136
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,630
Idea number two is your winner.

137
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,160
You could rerun that test but now instead of three different headlines for three different articles

138
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,810
you do three different headlines for the same idea just sit down and try to think of three different

139
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:59,150
headlines you could think figure out which headline attracts the most clicks and then do the same thing

140
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,230
with images.

141
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,900
Then when you do the image you only change the image and you keep the same headline.

142
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,870
Again each Facebook test costs money but depending on your budget and the size of your business and

143
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,860
your audience it could really be an option worth considering and you don't have to spend that much just

144
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,620
to get people to look at it because you're not paying for clicks necessarily.

145
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,460
So there you go.

146
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,790
You can e-mail people you know you can share similar content on Facebook on Twitter and see how people

147
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:28,010
react or you can use a more elaborate Facebook AB testing system and then you know use three different

148
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,290
testing options to see which one is the champion.

149
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,070
And you whittle it down to figure out what's the best headline What's the best image.
