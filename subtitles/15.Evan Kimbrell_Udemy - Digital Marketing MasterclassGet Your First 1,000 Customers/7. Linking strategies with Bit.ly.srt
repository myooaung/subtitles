1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,530
They all know you all.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,520
Welcome back to our little miniature break full of data living and this lecture.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,590
We're going to cover linking strategies and how they can give you an additional layer of tracking that

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,480
you just can't get with basic analytics systems that we covered before.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,610
OK so with each of those analytic systems we have to install them on our page.

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,310
That means if a person comes to the page we can then track whatever they do when they're there.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,880
But how exactly do we know where they came from.

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:35,730
If you missed previously all of these systems try and try their best track or the referrer of the traffic

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:42,540
is and if you're using Google Analytics you probably noticed you have 10 links from Facebook Tony from

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,650
Twitter and 400 from this mysterious person called direct direct.

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,230
Unfortunately could be anywhere.

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,690
Technically it means they type the name of your website or your app store into the browser bar.

13
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,800
But I honestly call B.S. on that.

14
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:04,500
Some of them do that but it's really never the case that 90 percent of your visitors memorize the name

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,000
and then typed it in their browser.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,920
What we can do to get a better grip over what's happening when we're posting and promoting our link

17
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,700
is that we can use a number of linking strategies.

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,380
So the way that this works is we can do specific things to each link.

19
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,450
We can modify them we can tinker with them and we can make it so that each link is unique.

20
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:31,440
The benefits of doing this is well let's say we posted a bunch all over read it and if you're following

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,970
along with the course you probably did that.

22
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:40,230
How do we know which post is getting attention and which ones are being pretty much ignored.

23
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:45,990
Google Analytics would just say the traffic came from Reddit but how do we know if they click the link

24
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,010
say in the body of our message or in the footer.

25
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:55,050
These are really interesting things that are worth knowing which tweet for instance got more clicks

26
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:01,050
which called action gets more clicks in general these are things we need to learn and refine such that

27
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,970
we can increase the efficiency with which we can acquire customers or users.

28
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,390
And that is incredibly important going forward in the course.

29
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,830
So let's cover three or four I can't remember different ways you can do this.

30
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,810
Keeping in mind that really all we're going to do is modify the links themselves.

31
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,270
There's no crazy software.

32
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,640
The first act is by using what's called a web wrapper.

33
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,880
No not a YouTube video of someone rapping.

34
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,790
If you've actually followed along and tried using Twitter and you included a link and then tweeted it

35
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,200
out.

36
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,480
Well what happened.

37
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,160
OK.

38
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:43,620
You're beautiful puppies and porcupine playhouses info got replaced with a weird looking t dot SEO slash

39
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,720
a whole bunch of other gobbledygook.

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,720
That right there is called a web wrapper and Twitter for some reason doesn't always apply it to your

41
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,380
tweets.

42
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,600
But most of the time they do.

43
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:01,070
I honestly think they use like a pinball machine for determining who gets the web wrapper and who doesn't.

44
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,820
That's a wrapper and Twitter isn't the only one out there that can do this.

45
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,160
Google has its own system.

46
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:12,510
You can use to change your links to something that looks like Goo dot G.L. hourly is a wrapper that

47
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:19,200
changes it to Ousley and PITI is the one we're going to talk about how to change all of your links to

48
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,160
something that looks like Billy B.

49
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,620
T L Y.

50
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,620
And bitterly was its name so Billy represented by their mascot a pufferfish because Titli rhymes with

51
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:35,160
pufferfish is the most well-known system out there and almost everyone online will recognize it the

52
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,980
way you use it is pretty simple and you can create an account at bitterly for free and then paste your

53
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,410
u r l into the box that says create custom link up at the top right.

54
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:52,080
It will then spit out a bit like Slash jibberish link and there you go.

55
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,760
You believed your link if you were then to go out and use that.

56
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:01,740
Then whenever someone clicked that link you could see when it happened where it happened and you know

57
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,590
where the location of the person who clicked it is.

58
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,900
You can also see things like general trend lines of how well it's getting clicked.

59
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,450
It's data overload but it could be useful.

60
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,050
You can also label and organize your links for quick viewing.

61
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:21,270
I personally suggest that you make little folders and or little groups for each site that you're going

62
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:26,890
to target and then make sure that use a custom link for each post you do or each attempt you make.

63
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,240
OK.

64
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:33,000
Yea we can go a little bit farther down the rabbit hole and learn how we can customize each link.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,830
Beyond that flash jibberish they give us all you do is click the link and you'll see in the slide out

66
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,690
tray you can change it to really whatever you want.

67
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,040
So bitterly slash the name of your product would probably work decently well.

68
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,090
Now why do we customize these links.

69
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:54,300
You might ask well because the sad fact of linked short owners are Web wrappers nowadays is that when

70
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,790
you use them people often think you're trying to track them which you know is true.

71
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:06,670
Or they think you're hiding a link within them trying to track them is OK but it has a tendency to feel

72
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:12,100
like it's a little in genuine It's kind of like hey I want honest feedback and I'm personally tracking

73
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,510
whether or not you click this link.

74
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:19,900
And because the Internet is a giant mosh pit of human vice it's often the case in unregulated forums

75
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:25,820
that people linked to bad things and then hide it with a link or so people accidentally click it.

76
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,560
If you customize the link then it looks a little more legit.

77
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,580
And the more unscrupulous ones out there just won't even notice.

78
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:40,300
Now the issue with these links looking weird is legitimate and it might affect you depending on what

79
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,700
you're using it for.

80
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,800
If you want to spend the time and effort we can actually go a step farther and use what's called a custom

81
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,960
branded link shorter if you're not interested in this please God just skip this lecture.

82
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,260
This is totally extra credit.

83
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,620
Have you ever seen any of my tweets.

84
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,860
Course you haven't because you don't care about me.

85
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:07,580
Well when I share links they come through as Evan K. dot and slash some jibberish.

86
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,740
My web site is my name dot com.

87
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,680
And then Kimbrell dot com.

88
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:17,380
Now when you look at my custom link there's a better chance you might actually confuse it with my real

89
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,220
domain which is good and that's all we want.

90
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:27,520
Realistically I use my short term places where it's perfectly fine to use a shorter I do in emails surveys

91
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,310
and places like tweets.

92
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:35,590
But if I was going out in the wild trying to do this personally like in forums I would probably instead

93
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:40,180
want to get as close to as possible my real domain.

94
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:45,090
So when they click through there's not this huge gap between what they clicked and what they saw.

95
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,370
So ideally if I had something like Evan Kimbrell But the domain extension was Dotti L-L or something

96
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,460
like that like that would be nice.

97
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,970
Even something like every red dot net would be fine because then they get there and dot com.

98
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:04,230
Now if you want to go this route I've included a link to an extensive guide of how to do this with Billy.

99
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:10,600
It's going to cost you anywhere from $7 to 30 depending on which domain you end up buying and from where.

100
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,850
And it's also probably going to take like an hour or an hour and a half to do it.

101
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,190
It took me about an hour.

102
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,500
It really just takes too long to explain in detail so follow that guide.

103
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,940
But here is the gist.

104
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:27,160
Every country on Earth plus some other territories have a unique domain extension.

105
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,950
The reason we use dot com is just because it was the original and has the most people on it.

106
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,600
Eventually as the Internet expanded.

107
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,280
Other countries wanted to differentiate their links by making it obvious which country it was coming

108
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:48,010
from either by changing the extension itself like Dot am for our media or G-B for Great Britain or by

109
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,460
just appending it to the dot coms like the United Kingdom is.

110
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,990
So oftentimes dot com dot uk.

111
00:07:53,990 --> 00:08:00,530
Now the first example is what we call a country level domain not country style like the buffet or country

112
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:06,320
strong like Chevvy but country level country level like Dot A.F. for Africa.

113
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,020
Yes.

114
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,710
They don't match exactly.

115
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,550
Great Britain isn't a country I know of Africa.

116
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,930
I can't really remember.

117
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,320
But next time you see someone with say a dot I O extension ask them what it's like to live in the Indian

118
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,700
Ocean because that's what that stands for.

119
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:29,230
Also I know Africa is not a country trying to take a two to three letter combination and see if there

120
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,920
is a corresponding match.

121
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:37,180
Just google whatever the letters you want are if you're creative you can probably find one that works

122
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,820
or just end up creating a domain that is similar enough using one of the available extensions.

123
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,800
Once you find one you just need to buy it through whatever vendor you can find that's selling them and

124
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,840
it's always someone different.

125
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:55,510
This might take 30 minutes or so to figure out who actually has it but after some googling and some

126
00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:00,280
clicking through and people passing you to other pages you'll finally figured out that it's really just

127
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,610
a matter of changing the settings and setting it up in your bitty account.

128
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,420
Once it's set up all you have to do is change the settings.

129
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,780
Every time you copy a link you get a link instead with your custom extension.

130
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:16,030
With that you can make your links look even more incognito and reap the benefits of link tracking and

131
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,230
link analytics.

132
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,990
All right we've talked to way too much about Billy next lecture.

133
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,450
We're going to go over two more manual techniques.

134
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,160
You can also use to add link level tracking.

135
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:25,670
See the.
