00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.950
You about landing pages doing a wide variety of examples good and bad and then learning about some do's

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.190
and don'ts along the way.

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.410
So let's jump in and think about how we can actually create one of our own.

4
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.770
Now before you actually create a landing page I'm going to state the obvious that you need to have created

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.600
the piece you're offering.

6
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.040
This especially goes for an e-book white paper or an email course.

7
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.000
All the pieces of these things need to be available and you just start giving out when people complete

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.310
the landing page form.

9
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.370
If you're offering a web are probably have all your plans in place date and time the topic where it

10
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.760
will take place online like which platform you'll use the web.

11
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.340
Do the web and so on and the resources is somewhere around here we've attached some tools that you can

12
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.260
use for all of these kind of jumpstart the process but for the most part we're just focusing on the

13
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.840
mechanism that traps them.

14
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.080
And then you get their information.

15
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.910
Now assuming you have all that taken care of you can prepare many of the elements for your landing page

16
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.140
that we've discussed and analyzed already.

17
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.090
Write up a great headline to get people's attention create a description for your offering like what

18
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.340
your ebook is about.

19
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.070
It's written for and why you should download it and go into more detail and well.

20
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.920
So we kind of depends on the lead magnet.

21
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.270
Now e-books and white papers usually have a table of contents or a section that you can list out what's

22
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.870
in it.

23
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.600
Webinars usually have an agenda or some main topics or plan on covering usually like the juicy details

24
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.970
or the secrets and an email courses generally have a list of the topics or sections that help people

25
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.550
understand what will be covered and usually in what order they're usually like day one day to this day

26
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.360
three this.

27
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.380
So let's start here.

28
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.630
The staffs we can accomplish with really any writing platform write up a Word doc a Google doc or any

29
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.520
place where you can easily copy text and then paste it into our landing page later.

30
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.600
So let's say I've written an ebook on how to design I don't know a great logo.

31
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.220
I'm a freelance designer I'm not but let's pretend it and I blog about design topics including branding

32
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.940
tools techniques and timesavers.

33
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.010
I want to use this ebook to build up my email list so I can promote more of my professional services.

34
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.450
So my ebook should already have a lot of the elements I'll need for my landing page.

35
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.790
So the title I pick how to design a great logo description.

36
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.710
We want to be detail remember this 36 page book will guide designers to the best practices and important

37
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.860
steps of creating a logo for a business or product.

38
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.440
Let's get some more detail in this e-book.

39
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.300
You'll learn why Logos are so important to the success of a business school.

40
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.140
OK that teaches them some type of an outcome or some insight that they are missing out.

41
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.590
How to brainstorm ideas.

42
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.770
Eliminate bad ones and choose the best ones.

43
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:26.550
Easy to follow.

44
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.540
Techniques used by designers to create powerful logos how to select the right colors antipiracy patah.

45
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.860
Let's say create multiple Logo versions for alternative formats like print and video.

46
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.600
These are all things that might be important.

47
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.160
Now I've probably already written a lot of this detail as part of my book.

48
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.700
Maybe each section begins with a blurb that I can pull details from whatever I've gone I can assemble

49
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.320
it in my google doc for example and then just begin to assemble a rough layout of a landing page later.

50
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.830
Now you can see I've added all the stuff that I just mentioned the title the short description on a

51
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.630
bullet list of sections of the ebook but at the top I'd put in some placeholders a spot for my logo

52
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.740
for my design business the cover of my ebook which I can put in where the generic book thing is.

53
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.130
I have even made a little form at the bottom where people can enter their name and email with a bright

54
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.850
button.

55
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.030
I even added a note below it.

56
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.730
I've seen similar ones to it around where I basically say I'll probably email you but your personal

57
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.830
data is safe.

58
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.570
Definitely don't sell people's data.

59
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.380
That sucks.

60
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.980
Moving on.

61
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.240
So what you see in this Google doc is really just a bare bones example.

62
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.340
Nothing really special but it's got a classic landing page structure all the elements I want are there.

63
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.360
But you know based on some of the examples we've seen in our past lectures you could flesh out the page

64
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.920
even more with more compelling information.

65
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.080
You could even test it out.

66
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.140
Right you could swap out piece of information and do run basic AB tests.

67
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.960
Screen shots are peaks inside my book could also be a good feature to include.

68
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.930
You don't want to give away anything too good without getting their email address but images from the

69
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.410
book and say like give an idea of what the style is like.

70
00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.120
That's perfectly fine listing the people involved with your offering makes sense if you're hoping their

71
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.910
expertise helps sell it as well.

72
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.140
Our speakers make perfect sense to feature since they're part of the draw but if you co-wrote your e-book

73
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.010
with an expert well you could list details about them as well.

74
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.850
Nothing you could add testimonials and testimonials from people who have used what you have to offer

75
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.460
and found success are awesome.

76
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.670
Direct quotes with their name and location or company make your offerings seem pretty legitimate.

77
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.380
Maybe Jim from Tacoma Washington emailed me after Delo the ebook and said hey just want to let you know

78
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.400
I use the lessons you book and sold the business logo to a new client.

79
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.060
Thanks so much.

80
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.260
So what I would do is obviously reply to Jim congratulate and then ask him for permission to use that

81
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.790
quote.

82
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.400
Now we haven't launched this thing yet and you wanted to do quotes or testimonials.

83
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.440
You couldn't oftentimes that people vouch for you specifically.

84
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.350
So if I wrote an e-book and no one's ever read it I could get people I know who know I'm an expert in

85
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.320
the topic to read a quote saying Evans a great expert.

86
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.980
I go to him whenever I need advice.

87
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.440
Remember it's not always just the book you're selling it could be you.

88
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.090
So now let's update the google doc with a few more ideas.

89
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.990
I'm going to add some it down below we have got a new table to hold my testimonial quote I shorten the

90
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.350
quote so it's focused now.

91
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.180
I took out the hey I just wanted you to know obviously the intro part of it just kept the rest.

92
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.230
Just make sure if you do any editing of quotes from people that you don't see change the meaning and

93
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.980
don't be too liberal with the dot dot dot because if you do that too much then it actually looks like

94
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.520
you're kind of cheating and the person didn't say it.

95
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.780
Kind of like when movies put quotes in you'll be like I love dot dot dot the movie you know like what

96
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.490
did they say in the middle anyway next to the quote I'll put a picture from my ebook that I think will

97
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.450
look nice.

98
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.750
Now let's assume this picture is part of a technique I explain in the ebook.

99
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.000
So now what about my form.

100
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.480
Well I got pushed to the bottom but I'm going to borrow a technique I've seen in a few landing pages

101
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.170
and a duplicate my called Action up higher on the page.

102
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.770
Now the form will stay on the bottom of the page but where it was before I'm going to put a button that

103
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.340
when the visitor clicks it just sends them to the bottom of the page is actually relatively easy to

104
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.760
do.

105
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.830
So now I've got to call actions with Boesch essentially do the same thing.

106
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.520
Now I know I said don't do multiple call actions.

107
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.600
What I meant is multiple call to action to do different things.

108
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.620
It's OK to have the same one because it's still the same call to action.

109
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.170
Now it's just that there's one for people who already know what they want that's to the top and the

110
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:18.710
ones need to be more convinced while it's at the bottom you want the user to do a little work as possible.

111
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.940
OK so this is a good start.

112
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.790
Let's pause right here because if you've got your own planning page idea well you could rough it out

113
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.360
as well.

114
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.370
Again there's a way I do it at least to do a Google doc or Evernote doc and assemble all the important

115
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.030
stuff you need.

116
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.940
First words image is valuable information.

117
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.410
People need testimonials.

118
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.560
Any of those kind of plug and play sections you see pretty much everywhere else.

119
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.300
Now don't worry too much about the layout as you'll probably find some templates moving forward that

120
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.680
look even better and that's really just going to depend on the tool you'll use which will cover that

121
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.740
in the next lecture.

122
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.690
So I'll see them.
