1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:06,270
Is welcome back to the course too we've started talking about the three elements of production lighting

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,610
audio and video.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,120
Started off with lighting because I think it's the most important although it's kind of odd that we

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,130
start with lighting.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,870
Don't worry about it from lighting audio then we'll end up with the mainstay.

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,830
The thing that most people think is the only thing that happens in video marketing video is that our

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,590
last video did lighting talked about lighting equipment lighting setups lighting types and in some of

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,390
the basic concepts behind it.

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,330
So in this lecture will cover that second one which is audio.

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,170
What kind of cover the same topics.

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,570
Member what I said like 3 seconds ago that lightning is the most important element of production.

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:46,050
Well you could easily make the same argument for certain types of production where you could say Audio

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,080
is the most important.

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,020
If for instance you have a video where someone is explaining how to do something offering advice or

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,840
simply walking you through the process well being able to hear them is going to be a necessity.

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,090
What happens if you can't understand them like you know if the audio drops out for a second or if they

17
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,090
mumble or if the audio just flat out isn't clear

18
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:17,250
then you might rewind it or skip it back 10 seconds or so maybe you wait and see if it all makes sense

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,390
after you hear some more.

20
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,200
Or maybe you go find a different video that looks and sounds better.

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,990
Realistically it's probably going that last option only the most dedicated people will actually sit

22
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,060
through bad audio better or you can really just take you out of the experience.

23
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:38,030
And this is why along with video and light and good audio is an essential part of your marketing videos.

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:45,330
It's an essential requirement now lighting I think can take you in a bigger range from really low quality

25
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,830
unbearable to world class production.

26
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:56,220
So much of that rests on the lighting whereas audio you kind of just hit a point where it sounds great

27
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,710
and then very few people besides audio files or people that work in video production are really going

28
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,630
to notice anything past that point.

29
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:11,130
However if you're lightings awful Yeah it'll look pretty bad but it's not necessarily a game ender or

30
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:18,920
as if audio's bad Ah but manage it especially with walkthrough and tutorials and things like that.

31
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,520
You might as well just give up.

32
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,750
Stop now in movies and on TV you can create moods with a mix of dialogue music sound effects and other

33
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,960
like instrumentals.

34
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,600
But for the most part in marketing videos getting good audio means we're really going to focus on two

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,550
things.

36
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:40,470
One we want to make sure that we're clearly capturing what people say and making sure we don't hear

37
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,300
anything else that's in the background.

38
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,910
Other considerations like adding music or sound effects are entirely secondary and you can really figure

39
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,580
them out once you get to the post-production and the editing process.

40
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,030
For now we're really just going to focus on the capturing and recording of audio since we're in the

41
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,160
production section and how we can get the best quality audio we can up front.

42
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,710
So most of your concern when you think about capturing audio is going to be what microphones will you

43
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,630
need and how we will record that audio.

44
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,980
So we're talking about two different things microphones and audio recording devices microphones pick

45
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,190
up the sound and recording devices.

46
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,440
Record it when you're done with a shoot.

47
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,490
You can take the audio files from your recording device and then sync them up with your video before

48
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,480
you start editing.

49
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,540
Now 90 percent of productions.

50
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,600
This is the way it's done.

51
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:38,520
You have an external recorder and then you have a microphone right now that's actually how I'm doing

52
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,720
it.

53
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:47,850
As Parnell's zoom micro it's a recorder and then it's attached to what's called an SLR attachment to

54
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,210
this right here if you see it.

55
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
That's the boom mike.

56
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,740
However it is actually possible skip the recorder part.

57
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:04,980
You can in some situations run a microphone directly to your camera and that's great because it'll actually

58
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,270
sync up the audio with the video automatically.

59
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:15,390
When I first started filming ice film that way I had a recorder that would go directly into the camera

60
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,800
and I didn't have to deal with it.

61
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:24,540
Now there's two downsides obviously doing that one is a little bit of a hassle when say you're far away

62
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,400
from the camera.

63
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,680
Right.

64
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,550
So if I have an audio Mike say it's close to me and the camera's far away when in a cord that goes all

65
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,200
the way to the camera or off to spend a lot of money on a wireless one.

66
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:42,120
The other thing is that if it goes directly into the camera because those recording devices have to

67
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:49,260
use external batteries they create these low frequencies that can actually create kind of a Halma or

68
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,930
a buzz in the actual set.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,190
It's not a problem with that one of my courses where I had an adapter that took a mike to my camera.

70
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,810
Something is wrong with the read it and realize afterwards but there is this low level hum through all

71
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,140
the videos it was awful.

72
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:11,930
So let's talk about microphones and that's really where the only variation is specifically we're talking

73
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,690
about what do you need for a marketing video.

74
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,010
Now quick dip the mike on the camera or.

75
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,640
It's called It's also known as the onboard microphone.

76
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,700
You might be tempted to use it on your camera.

77
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,270
You might say well my camera takes audio when I notice that.

78
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,850
Oh my God.

79
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,960
Don't use it.

80
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,910
It's absolutely awful.

81
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,150
I don't know if we can switch the onboard audio right now.

82
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,480
Maybe you can hear me but oh my god.

83
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,080
It's just really low quality it's really flat.

84
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,270
It's got a lot of noise in it.

85
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,590
It sounds like it kind of coming from a distant location.

86
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:46,300
Now the first part of my going to talk about is called the shotgun mike.

87
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,640
I referred to it as a boom mike but you know explain that in a second.

88
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:56,660
The shotgun is a long thin Mike and it's good for capturing the sound in a specific direction and then

89
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,390
not picking up sound in other directions.

90
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,530
Usually you attach a shotgun mike to a stand and you point it at someone speaking.

91
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:09,200
Now I have it pointing directly at me right now and it's on a boom stand so often times you'll just

92
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,630
refer to it as the boom mike because it's on the boom.

93
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:15,560
General idea what does that you want to set them as close as possible to the person so it's not visible

94
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,560
on screen.

95
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:23,750
Closer it is the more of that person's voice it will get and it will get a lot less from elsewhere.

96
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,870
Now if I had this it was farther away while it would have to travel farther it's spread out and be less

97
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,610
concentrated.

98
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,880
But it also could pick up other noises that are kind of happening around.

99
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:39,470
Now if there's two people close together while you can point the shotgun in between them just make sure

100
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,700
both people speak towards the mike and not away from it.

101
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,700
Otherwise Lord help you.

102
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,480
Now shotguns are probably the most commonly used microphone and it can be a little expensive but they

103
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,550
do capture nice directional sound as long as the person speaking doesn't move around too much.

104
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,880
So all you really have to do is positioning the mike in front of your speaker and then point the end

105
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,340
of the mike towards their mouth.

106
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,670
Personally a shotgun mike is the only ones you know right now.

107
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,910
They're my favorite.

108
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,270
Why.

109
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,810
Because I think the audio quality is the best.

110
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:14,750
The reason why I think the audio quality is best is because it captures in one direction but it also

111
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:21,140
grabs a little bit of the sound around and that gives it kind of more of a natural full feelings and

112
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,310
you hear them it's almost more similar to what you'd actually hear if you're in the room with them.

113
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,660
Now I already mentioned booms and shotguns often come hand-in-hand with booms.

114
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:39,920
Booms are basically poles that are elevated up above someone and they dangle the shotgun at the end

115
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,160
of it.

116
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,970
Now it can either be on a stand like I use or big productions.

117
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:49,130
Unfortunately there are some poor bastard usually in turn that has to carry it and literally physically

118
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,430
like hold their hands over the scene and pointed at someone.

119
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,850
Now the pros of having a single person operated boom is that.

120
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:02,500
Well you get the boom closer to people more often especially if you're walking they can move with it.

121
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,260
You can't do that with a stationary boom.

122
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,930
The other thing is if you have two people talking.

123
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,730
Well they can take turns pointing at it.

124
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:12,620
Who's talking so that the people who are talking don't have to conflict point and try to find the shotgun

125
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,700
to make it sound right.

126
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,830
You could also always have two microphones.

127
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:21,480
But again if you have someone holding it or just operating a standard one that saves you from having

128
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:27,080
use to so shotgun mikes are probably the most common I'd say you see there's probably 60 percent of

129
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,800
the time the other 40 percent are what we call Lavell Lear.

130
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:37,070
Mike's also what cruel people in the know call lavs voyeurism and call it a laugh Mike to slap them

131
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,210
because that's not right.

132
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:43,490
Because you wouldn't say lavalier the law will here therefore law here is a small microphone that you

133
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:49,640
can clip onto a shirt or a jacket usually below the person's chin sometimes it's directly out of the

134
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,950
shot and sometimes it's actually in the shot and you see it.

135
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:52,370
No it's.

136
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,250
Mike for law is usually going to be attached to a small battery pack to put in a pocket or they attach

137
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:58,770
their belt.

138
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:06,530
Then the audio can go wirelessly to the camera or in some cases it's a wired version where you actually

139
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:10,070
have a line running directly to the audio capture device.

140
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,250
Now what are lawful is use for that.

141
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,000
You know shotguns can't be used for.

142
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:19,910
Well shotguns are best for set scenes where you know exactly where they're going to be talking and you

143
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,470
have the time to set up a boom pole.

144
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:29,450
Whereas a lot of this year is going to be better for if you're out in the field walking around and you

145
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:34,490
need the audio to travel with someone or if you're just in a situation where it's unrealistic that you

146
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,870
could get a boom pole all the way into their face a lot of times you'll shoot something and it's too

147
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,340
wide.

148
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:46,240
You can see too much therefore would be too ugly to constantly have a boom pulsing over someone's head.

149
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,520
Now you know to look for it next time you're watching anything like a TV show.

150
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,860
And I was just watching Seth Meyers is the late night TV show.

151
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:59,570
And you can see right in the middle of the shirt clips a leer right there.

152
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,980
Why.

153
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,340
Because they often zoom out or change angles.

154
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:08,620
And I think probably because it's too easy to catch a shotgun which did just look bad.

155
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,670
If you're trying to zoom out and just see the stick can hanging over someone.

156
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,600
Now one of the good things about all the love of yours is that they can capture good sound and they

157
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:23,230
can be relatively expensive really really cheap shot gun problems in a minimum like $100 or is a really

158
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:28,080
cheap lavalier $20 $30 and get you almost a similar sound.

159
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,160
The other person obviously is really portable.

160
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,640
Once you get someone set up a lot of Llyr they can move around.

161
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,600
They're pretty much miked up as long as they're on the scene.

162
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:41,290
You can even carry it with you to the next scene if you're using a wireless one at least and then you

163
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,940
don't have to get set up again.

164
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,900
Now what kinds of law tears are in my opinion.

165
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:53,560
The upper range for the sound you can get from a law is just not going to be as good as a shotgun.

166
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,020
If you have the opportunity to make the best audio you can or you have an ideal setup you're going to

167
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,610
want to go with a shotgun though I think it just drives me nuts about law Lears is that you can see

168
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,110
them on the screen.

169
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,510
A lot of times it's just impossible to hide them.

170
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:13,210
I mean the idea is that it needs to be close to the person's mouth talking and aides generally point

171
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,070
towards them.

172
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,800
OK.

173
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,810
Most people if you don't get the best audio you have to put it here which means you can see it.

174
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,900
Some people really get really tricky and put it like in your caller pointing towards you or in your

175
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,780
shirt like you're putting up.

176
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,110
But then when you move certain directions then you can see it.

177
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,460
I personally find it distracting.

178
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:35,920
There's a really funny video where they make the entire videos that to how much they hate lavalier microphones

179
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:41,070
because it just kind of takes people out of the video makes you look at it and go oh right this is a

180
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,030
video production.

181
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,170
Now some of you might think well that's obvious anyway.

182
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:49,030
But I mean if you're trying to really go for an immersive experience or really training gauge them in

183
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:53,240
your script or your content it's one more thing that just kind of sticks out.

184
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,220
Now here's a protip.

185
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:59,760
And this is something I'm relatively proud of that I figured out how I managed to do it because it what

186
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:06,910
I become a marketer series of Justin Maiers the way that we used Lovelle liras and every single scenes

187
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:12,940
that we could cause scenes really quickly and it was really easy to do wasn't We both wore button ups

188
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,340
but we chose button ups so we didn't really like as much because what you could do was you could go

189
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,960
in the back of your shirt.

190
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,420
I don't have a pocket on this one but usually are pockets right.

191
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,380
And so you can do is cut a tiny little hole in your shirt in between the outside of the pocket and your

192
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:37,480
actual sure you can run the law clear through your shirt and then through it and then tape it with Velcro

193
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,820
tape into your pocket.

194
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,120
Right.

195
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,610
So it have a clear line of shot at your mouth.

196
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:48,170
So it's the perfect ideal position and the velcro tape would stop it from moving around too much.

197
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,790
Anyway I was quite proud of that but it also does remind me of one of the other cons with the lavalier

198
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,300
is that motion.

199
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,750
If you don't set it up correctly it will create a like a rumbling noise and a lot of times it's really

200
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,310
hard to know when that happened.

201
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:06,670
So if I have it right here and I brush it remove my shirt it'll pick that up because it's so close to

202
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,770
that motion not I might not be a big deal to some people but if you're filming by yourself or just two

203
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,720
people or what are three people you don't have someone monitoring your audio constantly.

204
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:20,980
You could end up with an interview that's constantly full of noises.

205
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,610
All right so those are the two main ones you're going to see Chuck.

206
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:31,150
They're usually stationary or are held out by some poor bastard and they create the best audio.

207
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:37,380
However they do have a tendency to pick up some sound and anything towards them they'll pick up.

208
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,300
So you want to get them as close to your mouth as possible.

209
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,920
They're harder to move around so you have to set them up and they're bigger and they're easier to see

210
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,990
which sometimes precludes using them when you're doing filming where you're moving around a lot.

211
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:55,030
Like for instance what's called run and gun where you just walk around filming or in productions where

212
00:13:55,030 --> 00:14:00,490
you want to use multiple camera angles and you might see it and one of the angles lavalier is they'll

213
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,070
give you more portability.

214
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:09,850
They're easy to hook up to someone and they're more versatile so you can change scenes if you zoom out

215
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,200
if not really an issue.

216
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:17,860
However the problem is you have rubbing noises is harder to get as good audio as a shot gun and you're

217
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,360
still going to get way better with a shot gun at the end of the day.

218
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,520
And they're they're kind of distracting.

219
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,110
I find that hard to actually hide.

220
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:31,510
Now another type of Mike that's worth mentioning are called us be microphone's.

221
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:36,370
Now normally I wouldn't mention USP monks but if you're going to be recording things on your laptop

222
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:42,900
like a quick video or a walkthrough then you're probably going to actually invest in an external microphone

223
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:48,640
you know what to record just in your built in mike on your computer because again like the built in

224
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,000
mike on your camera it sounds like crap.

225
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:54,940
Now US and the mikes are the cheapest by far of all of them.

226
00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:01,360
And you can get external mikes for dollars that are decent $50 that are good and hundred dollars that

227
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,220
are fantastic and you probably tell right from the name that they just plug right into your USP and

228
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,270
then you can record directly to your computer.

229
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,400
Now the artist benefit of doing this as if you're recording a screencast.

230
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,660
Well the best place to put a mike probably on your computer where you're talking into looking at the

231
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:23,950
camera you can obviously do a screen cast and then film in a different direction like film in front

232
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,720
of you while you record on the computer.

233
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,160
In that case what you do is you just use the same thing you can use a lava leer or a shotgun.

234
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,260
However if you're doing more of a simple screencast will than usually the best way is just do the audio

235
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,680
directly in your computer using the USP microphone.
