All right, and we are back. Last lecture, we got real
acquainted with this lovely graph that growth marketers
1

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,480
dream about at night, and I've heard
stitch into their bed pillows.
2

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,820
It's just a rumor, and like most rumors, it's 100% true.
3

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,730
OK, so we get it.
4

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,870
New businesses need short term manual strategies
to start feeding the gears of feedback that will allow
5

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,550
you to progressively expand your
growth efforts with more confidence.
6

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,840
But there's one more thing we need to talk about,
lest you've finished the rest of the course with exploded
7

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,180
brain syndrome. In all growth strategies,
8

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,600
there are two components that make it work.
9

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:38,880
Number one component, you have something that attracts
attention, and number two component, you have something
10

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,890
that converts that attention into sales or conversions.
11

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,520
You have the honey that attracts the bees or the 
milkshakes that bring the boys to the yard, and then
12

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,870
you have whatever the bees drown in, because from
how I understand it, that's how beekeeping works,
13

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,800
you have whatever the bees drown in, because from
how I understand it, that's how beekeeping works,
14

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,590
and then you have whatever convinces the boys to drink
the milkshake - which is a metaphor we are no longer
15

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,580
going to explore.
16

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,790
Basically, it is the world's simplest jigsaw puzzle.
17

18
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,650
Everything we cover in this course and everything you
do in an attempt to buy some customers will need
18

19
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,080
both components to work effectively.
19

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,850
Presumably, you sell something on your website or
through some web property you control, or even through
20

21
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,180
a platform where you host your
business. If you want to sell something,
21

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,940
first we need to get people to our page, and then we
need to make our page in a way that actually then
22

23
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,280
gives them what they want.
23

24
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,980
If we say we're pursuing a content strategy, we would
need to make something and then promote it.
24

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:37,140
The promotion could be community posting, it could be
borrowing traffic from platforms, buying ads, targeting blogs,
25

26
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:37,950
The promotion could be community posting, it could be
borrowing traffic from platforms, buying ads, targeting blogs,
26

27
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,220
there's a million other ways you can get eyeballs on it.
27

28
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:46,230
Once the user sees the post, and it's the post's job
as the second part of this formula to convince the
28

29
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:51,450
user to either buy something you're selling, do
something, like give you their email address, or follow
29

30
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,950
your brand in the future.
30

31
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,030
Oftentimes, this piece is the end point
and it tries to convert the user.
31

32
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,340
Sometimes it's just a link in the chain and it's
used in tandem with, say, email marketing.
32

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,790
So get used to thinking about growth strategies
33

34
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,860
as always two distinct actions. Throughout the course,
34

35
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:13,440
this is also how we're going to be explaining these.
In the next couple of lectures, we'll go over how to
35

36
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,810
check that your site is ready for sales,
36

37
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,310
and if it is, then that dramatically simplifies
that second process. I will see you later.
