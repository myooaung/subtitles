Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,670
So we've covered a lot of different ways to generate ideas and build content for your audience.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,240
And our focus has been to put it all on your website or your blog.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,570
It makes sense because your site is where conversions happen sales sign ups client inquiries all that

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,460
good stuff putting great content in your site means people will come there from searches social shares

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,010
and email.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,140
Well there's another way to get people to come visit your site and that's through what we call guest

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,910
posting.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,420
If you don't know a guest posting is.

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,000
Let me introduce you to it.

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,560
So guess posting just means that you write a post for someone else's blog or someone else's web site.

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,570
You're a guest and you contribute with a post.

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,220
So this sounds a little backwards to you.

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,950
I get it but actually think about it.

15
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,280
Do you have a blog.

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,510
You probably have a certain amount of writing you need to get done each week that can take a lot of

17
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,130
time and effort so why not get someone else to write something you approve it and then you post on your

18
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:55,500
site as an extra or an exotic way to fill in the gaps between your post and the perspective of the writer

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,700
it works because you get exposure on someone else's web site and can drive traffic from their site back

20
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,650
to yours.

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,490
Kind of like co-mingling your audience's guess posting also known as guest blogging.

22
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:10,320
Sometimes works because it can help you build an audience beyond where you've already posted.

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,540
Now remember we're still trying to build up our first 500 customers here and if you want to reach more

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:22,050
people at some point you have to go outside your usual web sites and social platforms like Mad Max venturing

25
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,780
into the desert in search of water.

26
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,630
Sometimes you just gotta hit the road and find some peeps to help you with your mission.

27
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,940
Now the exposure factor is not the only reason.

28
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,450
Guest blogging is considered a great traction channel.

29
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,570
I'd say there are probably three big reasons.

30
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,500
Number one like I said before it gets seen by someone else's audience and gets some new exposure to

31
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,220
that new audience can directly lead to more traffic for your web site.

32
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,550
And number three if you get close enough you could be seen as an authority or an expert.

33
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,770
People Google your name they're going to see you on a lot of different Web sites generally a good thing

34
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,340
that then can snowball into more exposure building activities like getting interviewed or speaking at

35
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:57,920
events.

36
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,360
So this sounds like the kind of adventure you want to sign up for.

37
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,810
Great because I'm a whole bunch of letters coming up telling you how to do it.

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,110
First you'll need to figure out where you can post.

39
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,230
That involves some research but it ties into a bunch of activities you're probably already doing like

40
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,120
following blogs you like and being aware of what's going on in your industry.

41
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,900
After you find some sites or blogs where you might be able to guess post you to approach them pitch

42
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,460
them your idea and then if they accept to write something that fits their style or format if you pay

43
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,090
attention you'll find that the next handful lectures are pure pure gold if I may say so myself.

44
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,530
Absolutely perfect.

45
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,330
Alid didn't.

46
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,500
Content.

47
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,560
So if you're interested in this guest posting thing keep watching.

48
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,400
Otherwise see in the next lecture.
