00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.400
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.500
So in the last set of lectures we spent a lot of time talking about content strategy basics and now

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.910
we're finally going to start coming up with ideas about what to write.

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.110
This idea generating process is going to involve us going out to a couple of different platforms and

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.450
Web sites and basically trying a bunch of experiments to see what ideas work and don't work and then

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.290
recording our good ideas somewhere so we can turn them into content later.

7
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.660
Well before we start digging for ideas I want to make sure you've got a system in place for recording

8
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.170
your ideas or have at least thought about a system.

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.380
You guys don't want to make a system you can skip this lecture or otherwise hear it in detail.

10
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.920
One of the ways that you can put this down into an easy to use system.

11
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.400
So in this lecture I want to take you through the process of setting up a place to store your content

12
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.060
ideas.

13
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.790
This is something you can start with and will probably evolve over time but the idea is to have some

14
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.510
place where you can go as you do your research when you're looking for ideas and as you're planning

15
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.830
out your content strategy for the long term.

16
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.310
So what kind of place do we need for recording our ideas.

17
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.070
We need something easily accessible something we like and something we probably use before and that's

18
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.860
something that's pretty easy to use.

19
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.700
So by now you probably tried out a few different apps and platforms you could probably start with a

20
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.540
Google Doc and I personally recommend something that has spreadsheets because there's only a bunch of

21
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.220
fields of information worth storing and then you can sort them more easily it's not just a block of

22
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.940
text.

23
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.210
Personally I use a tool called Air table.

24
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.470
It's basically like Excel on crack.

25
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.190
More specifically it reminds me of google sheets but it has all this extra functionality and it just

26
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.070
does a whole lot more.

27
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.140
You can customize a lot more.

28
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.410
You can make it function like web forums or web pages or you can just do a ton with it.

29
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.600
Whatever you decide to use you'll need to do some initial setup to make sure you're getting the details

30
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.870
that you need later.

31
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.910
And that's what we're gonna go over now so that you know six months from now you're not looking at your

32
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.360
content list going.

33
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.170
What was Evan talking about.

34
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.690
Let's say you're a graphic designer.

35
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.760
You're trying to get more clients and you've decided to start a blog because while you're smart and

36
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.890
you're plenty of ideas you can share about graphic design logo design Photoshop and you know all that

37
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.480
stuff.

38
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.860
Well you could use google sheets to create a spreadsheet to keep track of your ideas and that's kind

39
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.500
of the path that we're going to pursue.

40
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.090
So let's do that OK.

41
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.360
Let's go into Google Docs.

42
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.980
Let's create a new sheet.

43
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.280
And here we go.

44
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.730
For those of you government use Google Docs Google Docs is free.

45
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.330
It's basically just like the Microsoft Suite platform.

46
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.030
But online and it's Google.

47
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.310
And it's in your browsers.

48
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.420
You can access it anywhere.

49
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.660
OK.

50
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.680
I'm going to call my sheet content ideas spreadsheet because you know that's what it is and I'm super

51
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.150
original.

52
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.210
You call it whatever you want.

53
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.760
Now for each idea we come up with.

54
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.500
We need to record information about it.

55
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.460
And the more ideas we have the more important it will be to have all the info about each one to help

56
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.340
us organize and sort it all out.

57
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.140
So let's add some fields at the top so we can make sense of all the ideas we come up with later.

58
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.840
Let's start with the title now.

59
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.270
Isn't it a little bit early you might ask to be coming up with the title names or content.

60
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.300
We were really just thinking about and in some cases I actually know sometimes you might come up with

61
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.260
the exact title you want and that's a good thing.

62
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.260
Oftentimes you'll come up with content you want to write but you can't really think of a sexy title

63
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.490
or any title that would be remotely interesting or on brand.

64
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.290
And that's generally something you want to nip in the bud it's usually not a good content idea.

65
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.510
OK.

66
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.310
Let's just fill out some theoretical ideas let's say how to deal with annoying clients had some pop

67
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.700
to it.

68
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.950
Let's put that in there.

69
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.740
And yes it can change but for now let's just use what we've got.

70
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.390
And yes absolutely.

71
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.270
Other times you have a general idea like the top X number of projects where photoshop is easier than

72
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.170
illustrator.

73
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.270
And by the time you finish writing that that X will turn into the actual number.

74
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.470
So you don't necessarily have to be 100 percent precise in your title but you should try at least you

75
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.590
get the format done.

76
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.650
Let's say I want to write something like My logo design process like something along how I do it when

77
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.040
my workflow is well I don't have a snappy title yet but you'll know what it's basically about.

78
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.740
And then later on you can try to come up with something a little more pizzazz or whatever you know.

79
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.680
Put that in there.

80
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.900
Don't judge yourself too much.

81
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.180
Just throw it in because later on we can sort through it.

82
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.750
Now the titles.

83
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.400
Help us start thinking about our ideas.

84
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.260
But sometimes we need more info or we forget what we were thinking about exactly.

85
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.210
So a second field or description or summary.

86
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.870
Keep it short but maybe list out the main point of the three key ideas or what you hope to accomplish

87
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.780
with the post.

88
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.590
Sometimes that I do is I list out the three most compelling points I'd make in it things that I think

89
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:44.460
are more scrappy or uncommon or whatever the secret sources in some cases your idea maybe like a response

90
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.760
to something you saw online or inspired by another post.

91
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.070
So in that case let's add a You are Alan there in case you need a reminder of what you wanted to write

92
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.060
about.

93
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.290
If you're not writing in response to something you can use this one as a reference to something you

94
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.960
saw for inspiration or some you want to look at later as you're collecting these ideas you can begin

95
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.930
to add some organization and include a category any post about Photoshop for example might fall under

96
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.120
the photoshop category or maybe I'd call it like tools.

97
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.250
I don't really know you could play with it make it whatever you want see how things start to shape up

98
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.890
if you're not sure you can always go out to someone else's blog and see how they do it lines and colors.

99
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.810
For example as a block for digital artist and a less post about Photoshop under the category called

100
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.420
tools and techniques.

101
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:34.220
So yeah I might consider calling it that now categories are nice because as you add a new idea you can

102
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.330
immediately slot it into that group.

103
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.000
Eventually you might see a group of ideas that could be turned into a series but you know let's not

104
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.680
get ahead of ourselves yet if we know what kind of content this is going to be we could put in a another

105
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:52.490
column for format we could put blog post video mini site or something else.

106
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.170
This is another way to help you find ideas but also to help you figure out what you'll need to make

107
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:02.900
them an idea for a video going to require a script for example which is different from a blog post.

108
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.730
Now the first couple of ideas I have on my list are generally going to be blog post but the one about

109
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.470
my logo design process for example could work well with the video instead.

110
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.360
Now we could just put blogs slash video in there as a thought meeting or kind of open it to it being

111
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.860
a video maybe just depending on how much time we have it could just be a blog.

112
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.170
OK.

113
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.420
Now what else can we add in here.

114
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.520
How about a goal in the beginning you might not be sure exactly what your goal is or the specific piece

115
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.560
but you will want to define 1 by the time you publish it.

116
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.470
So if you're blogging about tips to create a logo and illustrator for example you could use it as an

117
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.690
opportunity to ask people Do you want a logo done for your company.

118
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:46.100
Contact us for a free quote or let's view logos from our satisfied customers.

119
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.110
Perhaps you want to generate leads get people to buy something or compel them to sign up for your email

120
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.850
newsletter.

121
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.750
Keep a goal in mind and each piece you create will help you achieve it.

122
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.300
So there you go.

123
00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:01.580
That's a spreadsheet approach to recording your ideas and this is a pretty good starter package for

124
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.750
putting down what we need.

125
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.570
This is simple enough.

126
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.950
You can play around with the format.

127
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.630
You can move the fields around if you want or add some others if you think it's necessary.

128
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.330
You might decide you want to add the platform will be posted for instance.

129
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.380
Like is it gonna go on your blog as new on LinkedIn medium or somewhere else.

130
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.670
You might also put things like date to make sure some of these get done by a certain point.

131
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:26.300
You know like that post about Black Friday November Are you one that's a riff on like Valentine's Day.

132
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.170
Those are time sensitive so maybe you want to make sure that you get these done sooner.

133
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.920
So the question then is What are you going to put into this list.

134
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.640
Well in the next lecture we'll talk about a bunch of places you can go to find inspiration.

135
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.320
All right I'll see you then.
