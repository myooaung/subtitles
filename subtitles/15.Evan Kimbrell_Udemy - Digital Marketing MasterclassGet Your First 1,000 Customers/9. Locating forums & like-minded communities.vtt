Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.700
All right, so we ramped up our manual methods of
Twitter spamming and we're on to a much classier form
2

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.290
of spamming - forums.
3

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.590
I say spamming although I'm really joking, because
this is how virtually all businesses start out, through
4

5
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.910
some form of scrappy manual effort promotion,
and that's the way the Lord wanted it.
5

6
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.220
And the one we're going to cover in this lecture
and the next couple lectures is very, very scrappy - 
6

7
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.390
scraptastic, some might say.
7

8
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.500
What's a forum? You might ask.
8

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.850
Well, it's any site online where people
gather to talk about some specific interest.
9

10
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.440
It's from the ancient Greek "for," meaning "to gather,"
and "um" being the Greek word for Starcraft.
10

11
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.720
Once you have access to these forums, you can then
spread your gospel in the most efficient way you want.
11

12
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.050
Best part about this strategy,
12

13
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.630
it really only takes maybe 30 minutes to an hour,
and in 90% of the cases, it's completely free.
13

14
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.420
it really only takes maybe 30 minutes to an hour,
and in 90% of the cases, it's completely free.
14

15
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.540
That's of course if you don't count your time and, well, no one
is too busy to troll through some special interest forums.
15

16
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.730
That's of course if you don't count your time and, well, no one
is too busy to troll through some special interest forums.
16

17
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.520
Get over yourself.
17

18
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.020
Alright, so if we wanted to start taking advantage of
these gatherings to get some eyeballs on our page,
18

19
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.070
what's the best way to go about doing that?
19

20
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.760
Well, first off, I want you to know that we're going to
cover three different types of online communities.
20

21
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.770
They're all a little bit different and the strategy
for each is therefore going to be different.
21

22
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.980
Now, the first one is a traditional forum that is nameless
and hosted at the actual domain of that interest website.
22

23
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.940
Now, the first one is a traditional forum that is nameless
and hosted at the actual domain of that interest website.
23

24
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.290
Second, we'll cover Slack groups and Slack communities.
Don't know what that is? Don't worry, we'll get to it.
24

25
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.920
Second, we'll cover Slack groups and Slack communities.
Don't know what that is? Don't worry, we'll get to it.
25

26
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.210
Third, we'll go back to Reddit.com to get even more
acquainted with that treasure of the internet.
26

27
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.880
To tackle the first group,
27

28
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.970
traditional forums, it's actually relatively easy, and unfortunately
it may or may not work for you if your industry
28

29
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.900
is really obscure, but you really would be surprised
as there are literally hundreds of thousands of
29

30
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:05.880
forums on the internet, ranging from interior decoration
to people who think they are elves, to people
30

31
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.260
who like to collect antique phones - variety.
31

32
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.940
There are two different ways really to find a forum.
32

33
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.430
Number one is the direct route, by just going to Google
and typing in the broader category of your industry
33

34
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:25.560
plus the word "forum," "community," or even adding in
some of the names of the most common forum softwares,
34

35
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.600
such as "phpbb," "vBulletin," and "Simple Machines."
Believe it or not, between those three
35

36
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.140
such as "phpbb," "vBulletin," and "Simple Machines."
Believe it or not, between those three
36

37
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:42.330
I just mentioned, vBulletin, phpbb, and Simple Machines,
that actually is 93% of all of the online forums.
37

38
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.950
I just mentioned, vBulletin, phpbb, and Simple Machines,
that actually is 93% of all of the online forums.
38

39
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.320
If you have a forum, there's a 93% chance you use
one of those, so if you search for that specifically,
39

40
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.480
it's going to look just for forums. So try to think
of a topic that would attract people you want to
40

41
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.050
talk to and get to look at your product.
41

42
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:03.750
If you're creating, say, a hardware IT product, you
can either look for general technology enthusiast
42

43
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.590
groups, or you can go back to when we wrote down who
we think our target users are and then try to deduce
43

44
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.320
maybe what their job is. Instead of generic technology,
44

45
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.430
you could instead look for forums that say, I don't
know, for systems admins. Let's say we're selling a
45

46
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.450
new dog collar.
46

47
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.990
Well, you could go specific and search for dog forums
by saying something like "dog owner" or "dog lover"
47

48
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.740
plus any of those suffixes that we covered, or you
could go by profession, maybe type in something like
48

49
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.950
"animal foster forum" or "veterinarian forum."
49

50
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.730
Some of these you might honestly strike out
with, but in most cases, you'll find something.
50

51
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.490
Take a glance through a couple of the search results
and write down the URLs of the places you think
51

52
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:53.670
one, have a sizeable enough audience, and two, are on
similar topics to what you're working on, and three,
52

53
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.670
are something you could easily join, as in you don't
actually have to pay to join it or it isn't something
53

54
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.610
like Product Hunt, where you have to
be invited to join the community.
54

55
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.360
Yes, if it gives you a flashback to having to find a table
to sit at during high school lunch, and that terrifies you,
55

56
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.780
Yes, if it gives you a flashback to having to find a table
to sit at during high school lunch, and that terrifies you,
56

57
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.330
well then, you're looking at the wrong forum.
57

58
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.360
Let's go ahead and use an example
so it's easier to kind of understand.
58

59
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.560
Let's say I was making a product for, say, we'll go
back to the thing we used before, productivity.
59

60
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.700
Maybe, let's say it's a SAAS tool that helps you
get through your tasks faster throughout the day.
60

61
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.340
I might have one or two angles with this.
61

62
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:36.000
I could google "productivity + forum" or I could go
with something like "project manager forum," since
62

63
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.150
project managers are really all about efficiency.
63

64
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.350
It's kind of what their job is.
64

65
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:48.840
I can even go with something like "get shit done forum"
or "inbox zero forum" or any other buzzword you
65

66
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.740
can really think of.
66

67
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.950
All right.
67

68
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.490
So let's try one of those out.
68

69
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.990
All right, so the first one is, well,
69

70
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.800
not what we're looking for, that is a conference.
70

71
00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:02.550
Great place to do this in real life, but personally, we
instead want to hide behind our computers and never
71

72
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.360
see someone's face. The next one in the list is from
Stack Exchange, and after taking a peek at it, we
72

73
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.530
can actually tell that yes, this will work. Just as a
side note, you'll often notice your topic is actually
73

74
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.010
a subtopic of a bigger forum.
74

75
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.340
That's perfectly fine.
75

76
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.530
Just make sure that the subtopic group itself isn't dead.
76

77
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.450
Make sure to check the date of the last post.
77

78
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.420
Okay, so I would mark this one,
Stack Exchange, as a winner.
78

79
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.100
Now, scanning through the others in my list, I can
see that there is a Life Hacker article that links to
79

80
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.350
a productivity forum, and if we were going
to try that, well, I'll save you some time.
80

81
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.140
It actually takes you to a 404 page.
81

82
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:45.000
Great. But on the next line, we have Rise Forums, which
sounds like a god awful internet marketer forum, and
82

83
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.880
I think it is, but it does actually have a separate
section on productivity, so that actually looks pretty
83

84
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.590
promising for what we're trying to do. Both Stack Exchange
and Rise Forum are legitimate options for this technique.
84

85
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.670
promising for what we're trying to do. Both Stack Exchange
and Rise Forum are legitimate options for this technique.
85

86
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.500
OK, so do that for yourself,
86

87
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.030
and if you have trouble, obviously
just go and post in the Slack group.
87

88
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.460
You should come away with at least
a handful of forums to check out.
88

89
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.250
Generally speaking, when you search and then you click
through, you're going to run into three different types
89

90
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:17.340
of forums. One, you'll find what's called an open thread
forum, two, you'll find close thread forums, and
90

91
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:24.180
three, you'll find Q&A format forums. In open thread
forums, you'll find the most traditional form of forum,
91

92
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:30.590
and generally what you get if you use any of those softwares that we previously covered like phpbb.
92

93
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.080
In this scenario, anyone can create
an account, anyone can post,
93

94
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.190
In this scenario, anyone can create
an account, anyone can post,
94

95
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:39.180
you can see a list of topics and then a list of maybe
subtopics, then a list of threads with the subject
95

96
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.830
of each thread displayed.
96

97
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.050
The original thread creator posts something, it could
be something they did or, let's say, a question they
97

98
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.730
have, and then people respond
both to the original poster,
98

99
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.590
often abbreviated as OP, and to each other.
99

100
00:06:53.610 --> 00:07:00.270
Now, a closed forum, on the other hand, is exactly the
same, except the registration to the forum is closed.
100

101
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.260
Now, a closed forum, on the other hand, is exactly the
same, except the registration to the forum is closed.
101

102
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:06.030
It could be closed in that you need an invite to join
or closed in that you need to pay money to join.
102

103
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.350
If it costs money,
103

104
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.140
it's really just going to be up to you
whether or not you want to join.
104

105
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.360
Unless it's some exorbitant amount of money,
105

106
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.310
I generally say go for it,
106

107
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.030
because if the group is relevant, you're going
to want to be lurking in there anyway.
107

108
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.340
The last type, like we previously saw, is a Q&A forum.
108

109
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.110
The difference here is that the topic of each thread
is a question and the posts after that are going
109

110
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.530
to be directed at that question and
not what other people said.
110

111
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.160
The game is a little bit different here,
so just keep that in mind.
111

112
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.190
All right, so we know how to find forums and we know,
generally speaking, what types we're going to have
112

113
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.960
to handle. In the next lecture,
113

114
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.130
let's talk about getting into them
and actually making some noises.
114

115
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.430
Get as excited as you possibly can. See you then.
