00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.490
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.830
Now we discovered ways to define our audience and part of that is understanding what their interests

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.840
are and especially what their pain points are what everyday problems do our users face or what occasional

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.430
problem comes up that needs to be solved.

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.150
You need to understand that content marketing is just like any other type of marketing you're just trying

6
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.420
to alleviate the pain your customers have an understanding that can really help you wrap your head around

7
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.240
what we're doing in this section.

8
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.800
OK so you know the group of people that you want to connect with and now you've got to figure out what

9
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.630
you're going to make what content are you going to weaponize and getting them to love you.

10
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.980
Well I've found that the easiest way to go forward because I myself am not really that creative is the

11
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.800
first look at what types of content are already out there and survey what's currently working.

12
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.920
If I can't think of what the first step of creating something is as part of my content strategy while

13
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.790
it might just be due to the fact that I have no idea what the possibilities are kind of hard to order

14
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.900
off a menu if you don't know what's on the menu.

15
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.140
So with that being said in this group of lectures we're going to talk about the lay of the land and

16
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.340
assess the 10 types of content that consistently pleases audience and can effectively act as a template

17
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.870
to save you time.

18
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.410
You guys can read the title of the lecture to see which one we're going to cover.

19
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.910
We're going to cover what it is and then get into a little bit more of detail of what makes it work

20
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.460
and what it's good for.

21
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.190
And if you don't care about each individual one just make sure to skip to the next lecture.

22
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.560
All right so it's there are the types of continent usually begin with and focus on answering questions.

23
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.350
These are tutorials interviews and roundups.

24
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.220
So let's start with tutorials.

25
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.960
So first off what what do I mean when I say tutorial given you're watching instructional video right

26
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.560
now you probably know the tutorial is.

27
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.550
But in the world of content marketing we're talking about things that could be like how to repair your

28
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.510
genes and they blow out how to fill out doors how to organize your project files even things like how

29
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.770
to come to terms with the death of a family member to things that are less morbid.

30
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.900
But just as important as how to get the most food in your POTY Brito as you can.

31
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.120
Generally the idea here is to make something that details out how to do something that your customers

32
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.730
might at some time want to do pay attention to this type guys because as a business you're trying to

33
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.580
be helpful.

34
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.990
And this is one of the easiest forms of content to integrate into a broader content strategy.

35
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.280
It's pretty obvious how it helps and how you go about doing it.

36
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.920
Now your first instinct when faced with creating a tutorial might be to think internally that is what

37
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.460
stuff do you make or do or offer that you can create tutorial content about how you might create things

38
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.380
like how to install our app or how to set up WordPress in five minutes.

39
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.290
This is a lot like knowledge base type content but remember everything gets indexed online and if someone

40
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.650
is thinking of trying your product or service being able to see easy to follow content on how to master

41
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.650
it could potentially improve their conversion rate.

42
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.690
So that's one way of going about it.

43
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.850
The other point here though is that if you're too are about your products and your stuff you're not

44
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.540
really considering what's going on outside of your business.

45
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.960
It might work and in a lot of cases it does help when you put it in conjunction with your product pages

46
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.370
but you're really not using this style in this format to its fullest potential.

47
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.250
So another way of thinking about your Tal's is to think instead of internally think externally or more

48
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.150
specifically from the customer's point of view focus less on you and more on them.

49
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.660
You can create tutorials about things that support your industry or directly support your customers

50
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.630
ability to succeed.

51
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.040
If you make marketing automation tools you might create tutorials walking them through how to write

52
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.040
a great welcome email or how to lower their overhead on a Facebook marketing campaign.

53
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.650
The idea here is that you want your customer assistance to succeed as marketers because if they succeed

54
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.660
well then they'll continue to use your product.

55
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.620
The great example of this is a company called Twista.

56
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.960
Now they make a video player that you can embed in your web site and then they host your videos on their

57
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.770
blog.

58
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:30.060
So they primarily focus on making your company better at making videos because if you're better at making

59
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.410
videos then you'll probably continue using video and thus their service.

60
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.910
You can even go so far as to create tutorials that are unrelated to what you sell but your customers

61
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.080
might find interesting.

62
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.770
Let's say you sell camera lenses online while making a guide on how to hire a freelance videographer

63
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:54.330
is not highlighting something you're selling but if your customers buy lenses Well they might also want

64
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.190
to know how to hire a videographer.

65
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.280
So just to recap you create tutorials about your products and services but also about the needs of your

66
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.080
customers perhaps involving ways to use your product or use your service.

67
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:14.200
So how can you come up with ideas for tutorial content Well you can sort it broadly and consider the

68
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.930
basic things they might need help with how to get started how to create your first project how to edit

69
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.690
or change or fix your projects and so on.

70
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:30.070
You can also consider all the how do I blank questions you might get from a customer of yours and figure

71
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.230
out how you can answer all of them.

72
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.240
You can include screen shots.

73
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.890
Step by step instructions you can just make a big walkthrough video.

74
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.880
There's a lot of different ways to do it.

75
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.480
The point is you can just identify questions that you get frequently need a way to organize your thoughts

76
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.500
well start at the beginning of a customer relationship.

77
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:54.790
When people don't know you but they do know they need a product like yours what questions would they

78
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:55.420
ask.

79
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.860
Things like how much will it cost.

80
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.100
How does it work.

81
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.010
How does it compare to these other competitors.

82
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.790
I'm looking at when they start getting more interested more instructional type questions will arise.

83
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.780
So things like how do I install this.

84
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.500
How do I use the different features what happens if it breaks or I need to return it.

85
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.420
How can I integrate this product with other products.

86
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:26.770
I use the level of detail increases for people who are closer to buying your product or have been using

87
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:27.130
it.

88
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.040
These different kinds of people have different needs.

89
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:35.500
So think about the questions they'll ask each step of the way and then make sure that your content strategy

90
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.840
incorporates either both or focuses exclusively on one segment.

91
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:47.530
Generally best practices dictate that you try to have content for each part of the process first becoming

92
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:53.320
aware of your product and then getting more familiar with it and just learning how to be good at using

93
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.680
it.

94
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.840
OK so those are tutorials and like I mentioned they focus on answering those key questions or customers

95
00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.580
might have.

96
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.870
Now another type of content that at the end of they just answer these questions is called The Interview.

97
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.760
Now we've all seen interviews right.

98
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.190
Hey Erin how's it going.

99
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:09.990
Good.

100
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.600
I've been staring at the camera lens for about three hours now.

101
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.660
The goal of an interview is to ask someone who actually knows something some questions looking for valuable

102
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.250
information and their answers interviews are great because you don't have to do all the mental heavy

103
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:29.200
lifting someone else provides the great stuff for you using to think of the questions.

104
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.850
Interviews are definitely worth considering because let's face it as smart as you might be it's not

105
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:40.270
easy to come up with amazing insights or especially to share experiences that you haven't had yet.

106
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:45.340
Experts in the industry know lots of stuff they've worked on a lot of projects and many of them love

107
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:50.430
to share this knowledge with others especially when you approach them and call them an expert.

108
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.870
That's really a great thing for their ego.

109
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:58.330
It's an easy way to get them to respond to your email when you ask them to be someone that you can interview.

110
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:03.650
So are you identifying quote unquote experts or good people to interview.

111
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.140
Well here are some ways that you can find them in whatever your industry is.

112
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:14.050
First off look at events if your industry has big events every so often look for topics that are relevant

113
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:19.720
to yourself and check out the speaker list you might see common names pop up a lot.

114
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.340
If these experts speak at events they're usually willing to speak in interviews as well probably in

115
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.230
the hopes of raising their profile.

116
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:32.410
Usually it is the case that you see the same people in the same interview circuit or in the same speaking

117
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:33.490
circuit.

118
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.800
And if they do one they're very likely to do another or another 20.

119
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:43.000
The next thing I suggest is check out popular industry blogs or web sites places that always post latest

120
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.990
news latest tips things like that.

121
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.960
The people who own and operate these blogs could be the kinds of experts you're looking for.

122
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:55.300
Sometimes they interview experts and then well in that case you can see which ones you might also want

123
00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:00.370
to approach the previous logic still applies if they've been interviewed once then they'll probably

124
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.350
be interested in doing it again.

125
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:08.050
Third thing you can do is look for some books authors love any chance to promote themselves and their

126
00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:13.870
book to speak about the contents of their book so just go to amazon search the books section on your

127
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:14.910
relevant topic.

128
00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:20.650
Try to get as specific as you can and see who has written topics about it lately you might have to dig

129
00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.590
in order to find contact information.

130
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.590
But it could lead to a very interesting interview for your audience.

131
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:31.180
People who are open to being interviewed generally make themselves easy to contact.

132
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.160
Once you agree to do an interview with someone.

133
00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.570
Preparation is key.

134
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.650
You want to tell you that.

135
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:40.150
Learn about who they are what their expertise is and start preparing your questions the best way to

136
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:44.530
get the most relevant information from people is the prompt them with good questions that start digging

137
00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.240
at the content you want them to share.

138
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:51.190
Now if you're interviewing someone for the first time you should probably establish their credentials

139
00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.610
as an expert for your audience.

140
00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.520
Not only does this help the people watching it or reading the transcript.

141
00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.730
Understand the value of refinishing it.

142
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:06.890
But it also helps with people finding your article because it gets next you might begin by asking Who

143
00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:11.270
are you and what do you do or what does your company do that you want to highlight.

144
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:16.710
What led you to this industry this company this problem they're trying to solve.

145
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.800
How did you get started with questions like those you'll begin to get information about their experience

146
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.350
and interest and learn about where they came from.

147
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:31.360
Then if you want to insight on specific topic ask them about it but put it into context for your audience.

148
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.990
For all the marketers reading tell me what's your favorite SEO hack.

149
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:43.110
There are a lot of digital auditors wondering is it worth was it worth it to upgrade to photoshop s.c

150
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:47.000
creative suite from C-s 6 What's your take on it.

151
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:50.360
Their work or project experience can be valuable as well.

152
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:55.190
Ask questions like you've mentioned you've worked with a lot of Fortune 500 companies.

153
00:10:55.190 --> 00:11:00.300
How does their process for creating content differ from small businesses.

154
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.990
Another one you just got back from South by Southwest.

155
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:07.010
Tell me about some of the new products you saw that artists should be looking for.

156
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.660
People really value hearing experts tell them what they should be interested in.

157
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:16.390
I always wrap up with something like How can people learn more about you or connect with you.

158
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.470
It's kind of a way for your interview subject to get something out of the interview as well.

159
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:25.610
Besides just their name plugged in somewhere and especially if your audience wants to connect with them

160
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.450
in some other way it's generally just a common courtesy.

161
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.910
Now keep in mind these interviews can take multiple forms.

162
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:36.740
You can do a video chat Skype call and you just do it through email if you want to be aware that some

163
00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:41.780
of the experts you interview have limited time maybe you can only get 20 minutes of their time and which

164
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.520
is enough for four or five questions.

165
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.780
Dedicate that time to asking your best questions to try and get the best content.

166
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:54.390
If you do interview them online make sure you record it obviously using a tool like maybe try campaign

167
00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:54.830
to.

168
00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:58.390
Don't try to scribble notes when you should be listening to what they say.

169
00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.540
That's a rookie mistake.

170
00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:00.230
Record it.

171
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.840
Watch it or listen to it later and then get what you need out of it.

172
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:08.480
However you conduct your interview just make sure the process is easy for them and they will cooperate

173
00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.940
with you to make sure you get what you need.

174
00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.810
Everyone appreciates a process that runs smoothly.

175
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.200
So with interviews you devote your time to one expert and ask them a bunch of questions.

176
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:24.740
While there is another content type called a round up which basically reverses what we just described

177
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:32.510
you ask only one question but instead of one interviewee you ask a bunch of interviewees or a bunch

178
00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:38.750
of experts now with a round up the third type of content we're going to ask us in this lecture you conceivably

179
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:45.770
end up with a range of answers that can show many ways to do one thing or interpret one piece of data

180
00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.940
or information for example.

181
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.310
Just take a smart blogger dot com.

182
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:55.730
OK well there's the one they asked 25 writers What was your greatest writing or creative challenge and

183
00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.370
how did you overcome it.

184
00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.760
In the end they had 25 different responses that helped readers see that even successful writers face

185
00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.540
challenges.

186
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.830
But there are ways to get past them.

187
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:12.050
It provided helpful advice and strategy and everybody likes seeing a wide range of a buffet style of

188
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:12.820
advice.

189
00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.680
People are generally of the mindset that more is better.

190
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.570
Now there are a couple great things about round ups.

191
00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:22.880
Number one since you're usually asking experts or influencers for their opinion by displaying them on

192
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:29.010
your blog you benefit from their association and often they help you promote the piece for you right.

193
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:33.410
Because they want to show that they were interviewed showing that they were a thought leader.

194
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:38.750
The their bonus I see is it's the only type where you really don't have to do any writing content creation

195
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:42.430
yourself you're just compiling answers and writing an intro.

196
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.720
Maybe if you want to put together a round up post.

197
00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:50.180
One easy way to gather your responses is just to use something like a Google form or a type form.

198
00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.440
You don't need anything complicated all just ask your question.

199
00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.480
Then get their name title and company maybe even their Twitter profile or web site.

200
00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.810
You are all so that you can link to them.

201
00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:05.000
This is something by the way that you could very easily outsource ones your form is set up share the

202
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.580
link over email with your experts but give them a deadline.

203
00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.300
Tell them you need responses by a specific date.

204
00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:16.130
This can help get your answers more quickly but it also makes it such that they're probably not going

205
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.180
to forget about it.

206
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:22.310
All right so if you've got questions you think your audience wants answered these three content types

207
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.660
can be a great way to do it.

208
00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:30.080
Tutorials interviews and roundups and tutorials you tell your audience how to do something you do it

209
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:36.170
through a video or a long guide or whatever whatever you think is the most enriching way of doing it.

210
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:40.850
Interview you just find someone who knows a lot about the problem that your customers are trying to

211
00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:41.420
solve.

212
00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:46.010
You ask them questions and they generate the content for you and the last ones probably the laziest

213
00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:47.040
one the round up.

214
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:53.720
You ask one question to a lot of experts and just use that as like a big Here's 25 ways to do something

215
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:54.720
for your audience.

216
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.360
Give her a few more content types in the next lecture.

217
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.430
So I'll see that.
