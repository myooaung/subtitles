1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,390
All right guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,510
So the last couple of lectures we've been looking at editing programs like premier that you could use

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,750
to create your marketing videos.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,400
Now you can see they're pretty powerful pieces of software.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,950
But the sad news in all of this is that you still have to do most of the work yourself.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,580
There's really no feature yet where you can say OK here is all my footage and please cut it together

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,020
for me.

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:26,070
Now if you for some reason don't want to do that basic level of work well then you've got to hire people

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,270
to do it for you.

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,290
And actually we're going to talk about outsourcing in a later lecture.

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,070
But let's assume that for now you do actually have to do that basic level of editing yourself.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,250
Well first of all let me tell you it's really not that bad.

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,340
Put on a good podcast and kind of just space out as you do it.

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,240
The good news is that you can make a ton of progress with editing by creating a thing called a rough

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,840
cut or rough cut is a quick and dirty edited version of your video.

16
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,180
Not dirty as an adult dirty but dirty as in it won't be perfect and that is perfectly fine.

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,350
What a rough cut basically is is when you take all your footage you stick it together.

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,810
You get rid of all the bad takes all the retakes and then you sync the audio together and then you know

19
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,410
you pick which camera you want to use if you're doing multi-cam and you might think that I described

20
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,660
everything you do in editing but no not really after that fact and you have to do actual adding notes

21
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,250
and you put on your B-roll that's what you put in your time lapses as you put in your text titles of

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,370
facts transitions all that stuff.

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,900
A rough cut is basically just the bare basics.

24
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,320
Now you don't have to move anything on the timeline significantly.

25
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,210
And it should be ready for you to just kind of throw things on top and rough cuts usually also do some

26
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,200
corrections where like maybe the microphone accidentally came into the frame.

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,120
You might well crop it then or maybe one of the lights went out.

28
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,920
So he took out that section or maybe the colors are off.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,750
So you did a little adjusting to the brightness.

30
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,280
The idea is this by creating a rough cut you can get to see an approximation of what your finished video

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,470
will look like you're good to see a rough idea of what it sounds like how long it is with the pacing

32
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,210
or rhythm of the whole video is like Rough Cuts are a great first step in the post-production process

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,930
because it can also let you know if you need to go back and reshoot anything.

34
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,340
Generally speaking the editing process will go filming right.

35
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:14,280
Then you have all the raw data you might do some processing to the videos if you want to like downsampling

36
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,110
talked about before on the camera and lecture and then you do the rough cut and the rough cut is the

37
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:26,040
quickest you stitch together gives you the best kind of overall look at your piece and then you go into

38
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,800
multiple rounds of editing or just one round.

39
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,070
So you go from rough cut to final cut.

40
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:39,740
In our case or videos we film it then we downsampled a video then rough cut goes to text and title cut

41
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:45,120
which is kind of like an intermediate cut where we add in text and titles and then it goes to people

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,630
who add graphics illustrations animations and all the other random stuff you've seen in here.

43
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,150
Now it's really going to be up to you what happens after the rough cut that's going to come down in

44
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,990
your process and what are you figure out works for you and also does depend on how many people you're

45
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,280
working with and if you're doing all of the process and also how many videos you're making.

46
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,580
So anyway how do we make a rough cut.

47
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:11,460
Well in general look for the best take in your video and then cut out the others.

48
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,610
Really the easiest way of doing that is to use what I call the scrubber but it's also called the play

49
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:21,110
head and you just scan through your video looking for each individual cut.

50
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,170
What it comes with the visual look for Takes where people look their best and aren't making weird faces

51
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:30,420
or movements when it comes to sound well listen for the best read of a line which time actually sounds

52
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,270
the best or most like the mood you're trying to create.

53
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:39,430
Also you notice any weird stuff like hums bumps cars people screaming outside in the window.

54
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,350
Don't use those takes if possible.

55
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,800
Really it's that simple.

56
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,930
You take all your videos you throw it in a timeline you sync up the audio and then you cut out the bad

57
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,720
takes.

58
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,320
Then you might do some light rearranging or picking which camera to use when you're done with that you're

59
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,180
done with the rough cut that is literally it but past that there are some ways that you can speed up

60
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,130
this process or at least do it more efficiently.

61
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,530
It's not going to go over six different steps that you can use to make this process work a little better.

62
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,880
So number one is always have your script or storyboard with you while you at it.

63
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,420
Really don't try to edit from memory.

64
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,800
Use your script or a shortlist as a reminder.

65
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,090
You'll stay on track knowing exactly what comes next.

66
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,060
Sometimes it's really hard to tell inside the editing what's going on.

67
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,890
Also with having the script you can see where people deviate from it so a lot of times you might have

68
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,690
four different takes one of them sounds the best but then you look at it and doesn't actually match

69
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,140
the script perfectly.

70
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,500
So you might end up choosing another one.

71
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,620
The second thing is it really helps to edit in a sequential order.

72
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,060
Start at the beginning of your script or storyboard and then edit there first then going straight through

73
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,170
to the end.

74
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,790
Editing an order can help you from being getting confused about what shots or pieces go where.

75
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,150
Don't try to jump back and forth because a lot of times ends up happening in the second half then you

76
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,130
do the first half and you'll just miss a chunk and then when you make your rough cut Oops there's a

77
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,780
whole bunch of stuff that wasn't supposed to be in there.

78
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:03,620
Number three is while you're editing use the audio wave form as a guide you can see in the actual timeline

79
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,570
when you have the audio it has a wave form where it goes up when people are speaking and it's loud and

80
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,920
goes down when it's quiet.

81
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,220
Then you can see exactly where people start and stop talking where they take long pauses smack their

82
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,910
lips cough whatever these noises make very distinctive shapes inside the wave form.

83
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,000
So if you see them you'll know oh they're about to mess up.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,770
This is honestly one of the easiest ways of going through a rough cut is just when you first look at

85
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,210
it go and cut out sections where no one's talking.

86
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,650
That's an easy way to tell.

87
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,630
But you just look at the way form no one's talking.

88
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,590
Other thing you can do a lot of times is you'll notice filler words or things you're not supposed to

89
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:45,440
be saying like write well or um typically if you've done this enough and that happens with me I can

90
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:52,980
look at the waveform and actually spot those words because they make a very unique waveform repeatedly.

91
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,880
I don't even have to listen to the tape to figure it out.

92
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,080
Number four is when making your cuts make sure to leave actress face before and after each takes you

93
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,020
can shift things around if necessary.

94
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,490
Maybe it's an extra second or so whatever it's fine.

95
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,630
Remember you don't need to be precise in this cut yet.

96
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,720
Number five is don't add any transitions just do them later if you add them now.

97
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:16,880
Kind of going to get stuck in the order that you put the clips and set with the camera angles you might

98
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,870
want.

99
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,190
I generally with a rough cut you want to be able to easily move them around.

100
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,810
The reason this is add temporary titles.

101
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,860
If there are spots where they ought to go.

102
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,830
Don't worry about creating any nicely designed or animated titles.

103
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,490
Just create quick placeholders and then replace it later with the real thing.

104
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,870
Repeat this process until you're done and then when you're back when you are actually done give the

105
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,010
whole thing a watch.

106
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,850
GIGOT a nice sense of accomplishment from watching it all the way through and you should because you're

107
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,660
much closer to getting the whole thing done at the same time it might feel like you're watching a low

108
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,460
budget movie.

109
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,550
Well the edits are probably a little bit off the pacing to and that's perfectly fine.

110
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,170
A rough cut gives you a starting point where you can focus on fixing some of the finer issues.

111
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:58,580
Like I know is each cut sinked up with the audio.

112
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,390
Are all the effects in there correctly.

113
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,540
And obviously incorporating all of the titles you might want to do it don't take too much time with

114
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,450
your offcut again.

115
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,610
Do a quick and dirty run through your footage a simile or video and make your plans from there.

116
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,110
It's a big item to cross off your post-production checklist for sure.

117
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:18,380
Also we're talking about is that because the process is so simple and so repeatable.

118
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,110
This is often one of the things that people will outsource.

119
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,400
Can noise gets some of the cheapest people to do it because anybody with half a brain can do this.

120
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,860
They can just look through and go out.

121
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,570
Don't talk there don't talk there.

122
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,960
Occasionally you might some issues where they don't know which take to take what it take to choose but

123
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,400
what you can do is you can just watch the whole thing and put little markers for them so they know this

124
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,070
is the good one.

125
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:38,620
Sound good.

126
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,050
OK.

127
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:39,820
See the next lecture.
