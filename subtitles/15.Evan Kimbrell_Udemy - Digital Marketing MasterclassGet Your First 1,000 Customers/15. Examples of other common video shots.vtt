00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.840
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.910
OK last few lectures I've been explaining how to use different set ups to get the type of marketing

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.460
video you want covered the fundamentals of lighting audio and video.

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.650
And then if you understand the basics of each Well you should be able to put together pretty nice and

5
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.570
effective sets for yourself to shoot it.

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.570
Now the main concern when you shoot is always going to be getting great footage of your primary subject.

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.220
Maybe it's your expert doing explainer video about how mobile apps are developed.

8
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.850
Or you might be interviewing some clients for a testimonial video about the success they had with your

9
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.660
product.

10
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.010
Those people are the main subjects of your video and the footage you get of them is what people in the

11
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.850
film and video biz call a role.

12
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.410
Now this is the most important footage of the video and it probably makes up the majority of what gets

13
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.070
seen.

14
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.870
April is the footage that is kind of like the baseline footage.

15
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.250
It carries the narrative forward.

16
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.800
It's the original speaker it's the main subject it's usually what you start and what you end with.

17
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.680
But it wouldn't obviously make up the entire video right like we wouldn't have a wisteria shot of me

18
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.610
just talking for ever without anything coming up on screen or anything else happening because while

19
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.140
staring at the same person for three or four minutes straight in a marketing video situation would get

20
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.650
boring.

21
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.000
How an online course.

22
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.530
I'm sure you're not bored at all.

23
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.360
Now you obviously have to mix it up and people need breaks to keep their attention span that's really

24
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.370
important especially if you're doing things like ads or any type of video that can help you with conversion

25
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.950
or sales.

26
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.890
So this lecture right here is going to be about how you can use additional kinds of shots of video elements

27
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.230
to make your video even better.

28
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.760
We're to cover some of the common shots you might see.

29
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.400
And also common concepts that are important to know but couldn't really get their own lecture.

30
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.310
So the first kind of video that I want to mention is what's called B roll and it's arguably the most

31
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.390
common type of video that marketing videos have in them.

32
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.670
Now let's obviously aside from the payroll if the role is the main person talking the subject is being

33
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.840
lit focused on and they're the one carrying the narrative.

34
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.300
Can you guess what the bee role is.

35
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.200
Well B-roll shots are videos of related people places and things that complement the main part of the

36
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.680
video.

37
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.850
It helps reinforce what people are talking about.

38
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.410
So for example you might make a video talking about the wonderful health boost you can get from running

39
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.920
a bike.

40
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.520
Cool.

41
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.660
It gets the heart pumping you get fresh air and it's a wonderful thing etc. etc..

42
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.490
Well as interesting as the topic is and as good looking as the speaker you might be showing that same

43
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.420
shot of someone talking and talking for a long period of time really not that exciting.

44
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.520
So what we do is we use B-roll to jazz up the video insert shots of related things.

45
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.720
Now in this case it could be a shot of the product itself nicely lit and showed from different angles

46
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.780
or it might be the person who's talking but instead them using the product demonstrating how it works.

47
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.450
Talking to people laughing or anything if I'm telling a story about how I visited a company well it's

48
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.190
probably important that the B-roll shows me visiting that company if I'm doing a video about the culture

49
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.550
of my business and my co-founders of all of them videos of us talking and laughing and eating and drinking

50
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.760
our coffee and etc. etc. it would be great B-roll to kind of fill in this visual for the person watching

51
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.880
now bureaux might be used to show where a product could be used.

52
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.690
Maybe there's a specific place or maybe it's everywhere or you could show where people can buy your

53
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.120
product like in a store or on a Web site.

54
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.710
Now this whole time all the B-roll has been rolling on the screen the speaker from your roles is still

55
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.380
going to be talking it's not like they just stopped randomly and then cut to a video.

56
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.260
Unless of course you guys have seen some of my videos where I do that for dramatic effect but it's more

57
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.590
to be funny than actually like professional anyways or Usually you have a role still talking still delivering

58
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.350
that information that you want to get across.

59
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.280
So not including the b roll you just made the video a lot more interesting and compelling and it's generally

60
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.500
pretty easy stuff to collect.

61
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.400
The best way to incorporate B rolls Dyster to plan for it in your script.

62
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.820
For example if you're talking about your product performing some action and will then write in your

63
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.580
script.

64
00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.140
We need to get a shot of someone using the product doing something similar to what I'm saying in the

65
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.180
actual script or of your speakers just going to be talking for a long period of time and you don't have

66
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.040
anything for someone to look at or anything happening while you can make marks of it in your script

67
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.310
to say we need something here to break it up.

68
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.790
Just make sure to know all of the B-roll shots you need because you'll need to either shoot it yourself

69
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.720
or you can buy stock video footage.

70
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:27.690
Now I don't generally suggest buying stock footage unless you are really strapped for stuff like you

71
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.710
really need something or there's some B-roll that you want that's really difficult.

72
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.260
So there's a company called Video blocks.

73
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.030
They're probably the best place I know of to get cheap stock footage a lot of stock footage is incredibly

74
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.880
expensive but you can get all sorts of things from you know really really handsome people in suits and

75
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.360
laughing about something to a drone flying over San Francisco two kids playing soccer or whatever it

76
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.220
is you need.

77
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.100
But generally you can tell that it's it's like a stock photo.

78
00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.840
But you know the video version of it now B-roll has become so common that videographers out there shoot

79
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.850
all kinds of B-roll and then they just sell it on web sites.

80
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.850
Another one you might say or like I stock photo will they also video.

81
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.800
So if you really want to up your production now you make your video look quite a bit better and more

82
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.790
engaging.

83
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.640
Absolutely include B-roll.

84
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.440
It's one of the easiest things to do and it really really improves the quality of the video.

85
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.600
It's awfully hard to do if you're doing a lot of videos like for instance if I'm recording this for

86
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.740
10 hours I can't make 10 hours of B-roll.

87
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.730
I mean any noted show after a certain point but if you're doing like a promo video a lot of promo video

88
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.750
is like 90 seconds to two minutes long the other filled with B-roll.

89
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.940
Now if you have something like a program or an app that you want to demonstrate or walk through in your

90
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.730
video Well then a screen cast is going to be another great solution you can use.

91
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.540
Now screencast if you never heard this term before most you guys probably have to re record the screen

92
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.790
to demonstrate how something on the computer works to show the action someone's taking in an app or

93
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.390
both.

94
00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.080
But you don't put the camera in front of the screen and then hit record.

95
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.030
That generally doesn't look very good.

96
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.780
However if you guys want to do that and it's something I have done occasionally and promo videos he

97
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.760
has put in the resources a link to a video where they actually talked about how you can do it correctly.

98
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.290
It's quite it's quite difficult but when most people do is they'll use a screen recorder program to

99
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.270
record what's happening on the screen not just you know playing directly out and step on the screen

100
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.860
as you can show the entire screen but also zoom in on specific areas to emphasize something or you can

101
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.940
highlight an area or darken area or blur out something I'm not supposed to see.

102
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.280
Whatever this is can really help the viewer follow along with any instructions you might be going through.

103
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.400
Now another option with your screen cast is record it yourself at the same time while you record the

104
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.810
screen.

105
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:48.410
You can also record yourself using your built in webcam or your USP camera connected to your computer.

106
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.610
This way the viewer can see you speaking and also see what you're doing on the computer.

107
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.180
It's a nice thing to include sometimes because you can see the person's reactions to things.

108
00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.510
For some videos like longer screencast walk.

109
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:05.260
There's that web cam shot of the speaker or standard Capshaw is a nice way to keep viewers interested

110
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.530
because they see a real person being there with them.

111
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.340
The guys have taken become a growth marketer.

112
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.320
We have a lot of that.

113
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.220
You'll see that a lot where we'll be on a screen cast with the laptop slightly out of view of the camera

114
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.440
just like this.

115
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.820
And then we'll be navigating a site.

116
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.240
We're also doing this course although the technique is a little bit different.

117
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.130
The guys you probably notice now if you're looking for screencast recording software I kind of mentioned

118
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.160
this a little bit before.

119
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.680
But there's really two great options and I'm sure there's other ones.

120
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.530
But personally these probably have all you need.

121
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.050
One is Camp Tasia and the other is screen flow.

122
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:43.050
Now screen PLO's Mac only and it's kind of its focus is being on it's being simple.

123
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.630
It's really simple to use.

124
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:50.350
It doesn't it's not terribly feature rich but if you don't need to bog yourself down a hundred and one

125
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.700
features and this is the way to go there are a PC that I generally suggest eating camp Tasia which is

126
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:55.810
pretty powerful.

127
00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:01.330
It has a lot of stuff in it and if you really want to work with your screen casts Well you know there's

128
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.280
a lot you can do if you don't want to pay for anything.

129
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.410
There's one called screencast matic.

130
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.090
You know it's decent.

131
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.160
It gets the job done.

132
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:15.550
But the point is that you can record up to 15 minutes of video with it for free.

133
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.180
So if you're only making 50 minute videos then well you can go pretty far with that.

134
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.480
Now sometimes you want to show a long process but you don't need to explain every single little bit

135
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:23.130
of it.

136
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:29.320
Here's where you can use a timelapse shot now time what shots or sped up videos that show the passage

137
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.860
of time or progress on a screen very quickly.

138
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.400
For example you could shoot somewhat illustrating a portrait that takes 15 to 20 minutes in real life

139
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:40.890
and it's been sped up to three and a half minute video or whatever time I was there.

140
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:46.200
Nice because you can explain something once and if it's a step that has to be repeated over and over

141
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.860
well you quickly show the rest of it using that lapse without boring the viewer.

142
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:55.420
Now it's also great when you're explaining a process that it takes way longer to do the process than

143
00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:56.710
it takes to explain it.

144
00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:02.280
Protip on this one if you want to shoot a timelapse use the settings on your camera.

145
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:06.530
OK like your iPhone will have time lapse setting on it.

146
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.380
Your cameral have a timelapse sitting on it and most potent point and shoot will do it as well.

147
00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:16.500
Now why use your camera as opposed to just later on just speeding up the video editing.

148
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:23.290
Well actually time lapses are just tons and tons of photos just stitched together over a long period

149
00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:27.710
of time and it takes an enormous amount of footage and storage.

150
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:32.810
If you're going to do it with a regular recording that you speed up also the quality is just a bit lower.

151
00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:38.070
You'd have to actually just go and google this and you can see on YouTube comparisons between the two.

152
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.510
Generally speaking just try to use the inbuilt camera function to do this and create a time lapse video

153
00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:48.190
of your own well you just need to place it somewhere for an extended period of time and put it on the

154
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:49.660
timelapse setting.

155
00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.280
You don't want to move it or even touch it because that will really screw it up time as it only work

156
00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.140
when you're not moving.

157
00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.520
This is random and anecdotal but guess what.

158
00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.100
A timelapse is called when you're moving that's called a hyper lapse.

159
00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.160
I don't know why you need to know that but now you do.

160
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.950
By the way time lapses really do make for great B-roll if you need to show the passage of time a cool

161
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.670
skyline shot of a city over ours.

162
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.200
Well you can speed that stuff up to 10 15 seconds whatever you need.

163
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:23.600
And in fact a good stock photo and all those other stock video places a lot of them have like city skyline

164
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:30.050
and that's generally kind of the only time I'd say use stock footage because you're not going to go

165
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:33.890
run a drone and make that so they have a really really good versions of it.

166
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:37.120
So we've talked about ways to complement your video different kinds of footage.

167
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:41.750
But if you have a lot of things you want to include like lots of shots of people using your product

168
00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:46.220
will it be nice to show different people using an app or using it in a lot of different places right.

169
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:51.320
Well if you have lots of shots you want to group together you can create It's called a montage now montages

170
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:56.450
when you group related shots together to demonstrate the passage of time like showing progress or a

171
00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:01.570
variety of related things like my example with lots of different people using the same app.

172
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.610
Now you can show these shots in order if you wanted to show the actual progress.

173
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:09.560
For example if you wanted to show how easy it was to build a garden in your backyard maybe your hardware

174
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.910
store that sells all the supplies Well you could quickly show a series of shots.

175
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:17.870
No more than a few seconds each where you show the progress of a garden being built while the speaker

176
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.390
talks you through the steps.

177
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:24.800
You know first be clear the area then we dig holes and after we do all that raking stuff I don't actually

178
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.060
know how to build a garden but that's in my head how it works.

179
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:32.060
But if you have the steps and you to share them with somebody well you can list them and then just show

180
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:37.220
them no other kind of montages it's just so a variety of people or things in no particular order.

181
00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:43.700
Now here's a video from an on Audi car dealership in Seattle and they use a montage of B-roll shots

182
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.510
showing people the grand opening of the dealership to kind of set the scene.

183
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.870
You see shots of all of the different stuff.

184
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:54.700
And then they cut to an interview shot as the April with a mix of different kinds of shots video has

185
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.470
some energy to it making it easy to watch and not too boring.

186
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:57.720
OK.

187
00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:03.230
There's one more type of shot I wanted to mention and it's actually a type of camera angle you've probably

188
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.380
seen before.

189
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:11.540
Now what this is is called a V point of view shot out of these shots are shots of the camera axes the

190
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.060
person's eyes showing you exactly what they might see.

191
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:19.280
Appeal of the shot might be useful if you want the viewer to feel like they are experiencing something

192
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:25.400
like touring a location or riding in a vehicle or in the case of this GoPro video both.

193
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:26.300
So that makes sense.

194
00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:31.790
Take your camera and hold it or you know attach it yourself and walk around look at things and pretend

195
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.560
to be a person instead of just a camera.

196
00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.300
Sure he's a go pro to capture all this footage.

197
00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:39.260
Just make sure it makes sense in the context of your video and make sure that the settings are the same

198
00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:43.230
Go Pro settings are often quite a bit lower quality than your main camera.

199
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.240
And when you stitch those back and sometimes they can create a nasty transition each time you use a

200
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.930
different kind of video type whether it's a montage of V or stock footage is B-roll.

201
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.890
Well it needs to make sense and obviously complement the main part of your video.

202
00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:58.500
The worst thing you could do is make something that's not related enough to what you're saying.

203
00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.370
So it ends up being distracting.

204
00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:04.000
So obviously make good choices and your video should work out pretty well.

205
00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:04.520
All right guys.

206
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:09.220
That's a grand summary of what are other types of shots that people use all the time.

207
00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.050
If you use these you can make amazing videos.

208
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:18.350
Time lapses are awesome montages are awesome and B-roll really is the key to making a well-polished

209
00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:18.790
video.

210
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:24.260
There's no video out there that while I mean no professional corporate video out there that doesn't

211
00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.840
have B-roll and then it would be considered very good.

212
00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:27.950
Anyway guys that's it.

213
00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.080
That's what I think I will see you guys in the next lecture.
