1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,680
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,690
So in the last lecture I gave a rundown of one kind of editing style we looked into a bunch of techniques

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,220
from a man named Casey Neistat and we looked at how he uses and puts together his videos.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,650
Now in this round I want to give you more ideas for how to edit your videos by looking at techniques

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,890
used by the team over a YouTube channel called Crash Course.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,380
Now a crash course produces a series of educational videos on all kinds of topics Gooding science history

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,060
economics and more.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,330
And you can imagine if you're in the business of creating videos for educational purposes like what

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,490
school kids or college students or whoever might watch.

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,820
You really need to create stuff that's not only accurate and communicates all the facts people need

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,100
but they also have to be interesting educational videos in general need to capture attention and keep

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,870
it so if you're running down lots of facts well you might consider doing what Crash Course does and

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,250
using a couple of their editing techniques to make your visuals more interesting and well fun to watch

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,220
crash course by the way came from a YouTube channel called The Villon brothers where two brothers would

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,050
ask them each other questions one would ask question on video and then the other one would respond.

16
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,280
And it got really popular.

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,690
Millions and millions of followers.

18
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,740
Largely because of the styles they used in it.

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,100
They use a lot of jump cuts.

20
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,570
They created a lot of techniques that you see all across YouTube now.

21
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,570
Crash course of their hand is like their first attempt at being more straight faced more educational

22
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,190
less just goofy.

23
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,260
Q and A and casual.

24
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,970
All right first of all it's just if you have the time go and just watch a quick launch go to YouTube

25
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,780
and type in Crash Course if you go and look at them and watch one of their videos.

26
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,940
This will help you understand this quite a bit but generally it's just it's John Green who is also a

27
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:45,360
famous author now sitting at a desk with a bunch of goofy things around him and constantly cutting to

28
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:52,680
images or animation and then they have a couple kind of narrative mechanisms that they use over and

29
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:58,590
over that are either funny or goofy or gives them an opportunity to have some back and forth.

30
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,510
So let's actually get down to their editing style.

31
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,450
First off they do this thing that well I'm going to call the three for one at it.

32
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,920
They shoot their lecturer in a medium wide shot.

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,460
Basically it's like a waist up shot from them in the center of the frame.

34
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,830
Now this is a nice shot and it's kind of similar to what I'm doing now.

35
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,440
Little bit of this is a little more narrow than that and it's totally fine to use this throughout the

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,300
entire video however you run the risk of being a little stale.

37
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,770
Now what I mean is that no matter how interesting the stuff was that the speaker was saying if we sat

38
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,880
on the same shot here for 10 seconds 20 seconds and 30 seconds.

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,620
Well it would become tiring.

40
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,700
Yes we're learning.

41
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,840
But us human beings need to be stimulated at the same time.

42
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:44,980
So crash editors take that medium shot and then they crop that frame just a little bit like this.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,830
And you know I'm looking at it feels like we're just slightly zoomed in.

44
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,640
And now the speaker is on the right side of the frame.

45
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,070
It also looks like a different shot with a different camera.

46
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,610
But no it's just the same footage cropped a little closer using editing software or in Premiere.

47
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,740
They probably selected the shot and increased the scale after you by making the image bigger.

48
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:10,650
It seems like we're about zoomed in either way it's a pretty basic technique and with HD quality especially

49
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,050
with four k this very slight crop wouldn't actually degrade the quality of the video really that much

50
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,240
still looks great.

51
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,710
And if you can crop the image in this direction well we can crop towards the other side too.

52
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,000
So 10 seconds later in this video the next line the speaker delivers has him now on the left side of

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,710
the screen all the Crash Course editors did was shift that crop from one side to the other.

54
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,440
Now I see what I mean.

55
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,640
Three for one you have the normal shot but then within that shot they just zoom in on either side.

56
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,540
And now they have three shots out of one.

57
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,070
The way you do this in your actual editing software.

58
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,240
Pretty simple.

59
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,810
You just take your time line image.

60
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:52,960
Then you look at the little preview window and you're caught at the point where you'd want to zoom in.

61
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:58,150
So you cut your clip in half then you take that section where you want to be zoomed and go to the preview

62
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:58,650
window.

63
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,600
And there should be control.

64
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,420
Will do this but there should be a button that allows you to drag a corner of the image.

65
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,730
So then all you do is grab the corner pull it so it zooms in but only on that second part of the clip.

66
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,120
Now why would you do this Croppy kind of editing.

67
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,310
Well there's probably another take in there somewhere on the speaker recorded this.

68
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,900
Maybe he messed up a word or maybe he just wanted to say things a different way.

69
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,040
But either way they wanted to make an edit it without leaving a jump cut.

70
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,190
There's an edit where there's a gap of some time between two identical shots.

71
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,960
The fact that some footage is missing is notable but by cropping the original image in a different direction

72
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,070
you can make the edit without creating the jump could affect and make it look like you actually shot

73
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,750
with multiple cameras whereas in this case they actually use one camera.

74
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,570
So there you go three different shots created from one a three for one special.

75
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,280
Now you can certainly crop and zoom a shot in other ways too but Crash Course uses this technique a

76
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,000
lot to keep the video looking energetic and clean.

77
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,960
It's a pretty economical way to use one camera angle.

78
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,060
The next technique we're going to look at that crash course he uses is an editing incorporating animation

79
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,950
now animation can take a few different forms but for marketing purposes I'm not really talking about

80
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,740
the Disney Pixar type stuff.

81
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:13,510
Animation can be used to make tiles move and pop like a lot of those ads you see where as you're saying

82
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:18,330
the words they show up on screen they rotate and they shift the globe and they slide around etc..

83
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,040
Crash course these is an animated tidal effect that's even more subtle than that.

84
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,280
In this video the use of animation emphasized the word for word sections the speaker says it all verbatim

85
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,770
but on certain words or phrases they animate the word and an emphasis just a little touch like they

86
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,930
can help the viewer stay more connected with what's being said.

87
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,670
Now Crash Course also uses animation by creating characters that appear and then move around on the

88
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,230
screen all the speakers talking.

89
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,090
Check this part out.

90
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,830
It's not even necessary that the character be there.

91
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,870
But again it's a little touch that adds some visual appeal and keeps you interested for longer sequences

92
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,140
like when they need to provide long examples or in this case tell a story.

93
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:58,270
Crash Course uses a full screen animated sequence to explain everything when they need the viewer to

94
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,610
take in a bunch of details or steps full screen visual can really capture their attention.

95
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,300
Now the way that they do their animation is actually partnered with a Taiwanese firm to make these and

96
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,200
you know they have a lot of audience so I think the Taiwanese firm gives them a pretty good deal on

97
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,580
making these for each one.

98
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,450
However you know you're only making a couple of videos it's actually pretty easy to go on fire and say

99
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,980
hey I want to make a video that looks an animation that looks like this.

100
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,760
There's a bunch of people sitting around a table and in one of them laughs and the other one slaps someone.

101
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,710
It's not super expensive.

102
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,340
However if you get to make hundreds of videos then well and yeah that might get pretty price.

103
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,940
So it all sounds great you might say but I'm just getting started with the editing.

104
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,040
I don't know how animation even works yet.

105
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,200
How can I get animated titles and characters added to my videos.

106
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,350
Well I can give you a couple of oftens that you can use on your own to create some animated sequences.

107
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:49,220
Number one is check out power tuner and a moto if you get a power tune for example.

108
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,330
They've got templates and ideas you can use to start creating animated sequences of your own.

109
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:58,150
It's really just like a software where they set it up to make it brainless and non-technical or you

110
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:03,820
just grab animations or images and illustration and throw it on canvas and then you just set it up to

111
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,050
make them move in a certain way probably can learn how to use it in a couple of hours just like Crash

112
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,980
Course you might be thinking about emphasizing points and specific part of your script or maybe you

113
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,900
want to create an animated sequence to act out a story like you're telling.

114
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:21,520
So try two or and a moto there just softwares that allow you to imitate and quickly make a lot of these

115
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,270
animations.

116
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,300
And also if you don't want to do these you actually pay someone else to use in a moto.

117
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,020
And if you do that well that's really cheap.

118
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:32,770
Maybe if you already know you want animated titles and sequences as part of your video you have written

119
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,090
it into your script already by knowing what you need.

120
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,880
Earlier on in the process you'll know what skills you need to hire for when you look for a video editor

121
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,670
or some other freelancer.

122
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,320
If they can do all the things you need then you only need to hire one person instead of many.

123
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,520
So that's what I wanted to cover about Crash Course and their editing style.

124
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,610
They've got a pretty slick way of turning one camera shot into mini.

125
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,780
By using a crop or scale effect really quite easy to do.

126
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:59,660
It's a great option for editing when you don't have alternate angles or multiple cameras.

127
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,240
Are Of course these animations to inject some more visual flair are all the titles little characters

128
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,550
and full screen sequences.

129
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,550
Look for parts of your script that you want to emphasize what you really need the attention of your

130
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:09,920
viewer.

131
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,910
Or maybe you're hitting on a pretty well-known quote.

132
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,180
Those parts could be good candidates for these types of editing techniques.

133
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,180
So take a second watch on their videos if you want or 10.

134
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,690
Sometimes I go down the rabbit hole because they're pretty good and see if there's anything else you

135
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,410
can pick up on.

136
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:30,190
They have a lot of goofy high jinks of repeatable gags and inside jokes that are actually pretty good.

137
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:30,610
All right guys.

138
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,350
Anyway I'll see you in the next video.
