1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,730
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,980
So we come to the point where we're finally going to write our pitch e-mail.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,210
Up until that point we've talked in our lectures about many different ways to get to know these contacts

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,260
to read their work to understand their interest and to get their attention at different points in time.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,980
All of those things help making this task the pitch much much easier.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,940
And the first thing I remember about your pitch is that you've got limited time to make an impression.

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,310
Remember reporters are lazy but also busy.

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,240
They have no time to read through hundreds of words.

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,990
Discover your wonderful idea.

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,470
You need to grab their attention immediately and really really choose your words.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,950
Sachs now that I have your attention now that needs to happen with a strong subject line here's a few

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,930
things you can do to improve your subject line for a pitch e-mail.

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,930
First up personalize it.

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,770
Remember all that work you did to get to know the writer Well it's time to use that knowledge.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,120
Now you simply put their name in it.

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,440
Hey Steve Great post or call out some work.

17
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,970
They did that you'll eventually comment on in your e-mail.

18
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,930
Nice post on productivity apps.

19
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,660
Either strategy can get their attention and it doesn't immediately sound like you're about to pitch

20
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,350
them something.

21
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,180
The sad fact is that people like to hear about themselves and that is kind of the golden rule of cold

22
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,660
emailing you send an email.

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,680
You need to talk about them them them not you you.

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,060
If you want to take it a step further create some curiosity but don't make it a complete mystery.

25
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:18,950
Here's what I mean.

26
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,600
Let's say Johnny the reporter wrote a blog post about an app to find parking spaces in your city.

27
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,040
Now what you can do is reference that post of a subject like parking app question or parking app Post.

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,740
Thanks Johnny if I'm Johnny the reporter I know what the parking app reference is but yeah I might be

29
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,690
curious why exactly there's a question or why are you thinking about me specifically.

30
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,600
Now this curiosity could lead them to opening the e-mail.

31
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,760
Now here's another idea.

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,300
We know reporters want to be one of the first if not the first to report on something so getting a jump

33
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,550
on the competition can help.

34
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,650
If your subject line you create some type of a limited time offer type of fact that could be something

35
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,280
that's useful.

36
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,370
Now this one's a little bit debatable.

37
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,340
So one of the situations where if you ask reporters if using this tactic is a good idea they'll say

38
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,260
no it's super annoying and then you'll say well did you open the e-mail and they're like yes every time.

39
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,570
So it's kind of up to you.

40
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:14,820
But anyway if you add the word exclusive in the subject line a reporter might just give it a look because

41
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,330
they're just trained to be like oh sweet scoup it's exclusive.

42
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,310
I'd better check this out because I miss something.

43
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,060
Now the same thing does not go for using the word embargo.

44
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,560
That's one way to guarantee they won't open it usually with embargoes.

45
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,850
You want to say this later on in the sentence.

46
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,370
And don't imply that they have to follow it.

47
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,590
You basically just mention that this is this is how we're doing it anyway these are Grae's to grab their

48
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,690
attention or the promise of interesting information.

49
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:42,480
And if these contacts already have at least some baseline familiarity with you then these tactics shouldn't

50
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,390
actually seem desperate and annoying.

51
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,290
In fact they might seem like you're doing them a big favor by sending it their way.

52
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,260
There's a big difference between someone saying something and you don't know them and someone saying

53
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,120
the exact same thing and you actually know them.

54
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,730
OK so there are some tips on your subject line just personalize it create some curiosity and if none

55
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:06,750
of that works and try to use some limited time type exclusive something that kind of piques their curiosity

56
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,120
in that way type language.

57
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,430
But ultimately if all you can come up with is the simplest shortest way of getting your pitch across.

58
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,180
Honestly sometimes that's another way to do it.

59
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,310
New dog walking app now available for Bay Area residents.

60
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,850
You know if that's something that's interesting and that person covers the Bay Area or covers dogs in

61
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,200
the Bay Area well really hard to ignore.

62
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,330
Be on the subject line.

63
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,960
Consider those first two sentences in the body of your email very very carefully.

64
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,550
This is where you make a make or break your pitch.

65
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,660
You need to keep the attention of the reporter.

66
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,550
So follow through on the subject line immediately greet the reporter like you would anyone else.

67
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,700
Hi Steve.

68
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,080
And then quickly make a relevant statement though I completely understand that ties into whatever you

69
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,570
referenced in the subject line for example through an e-mail subject line it said no lightsaber article.

70
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,290
Thank you.

71
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,500
Maybe your e-mail will start off like this.

72
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,680
And forgive me for the Star Wars references.

73
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,290
Hey Luke.

74
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:03,890
Love the post you wrote on light savers dot com yesterday about fighting stances for using the force

75
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,560
out I'm just making it up or to use some of the tips in my training this morning.

76
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,170
The first part of this email now works on making a connection and establishing a relationship.

77
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,140
You show that you actually read their stuff that you appreciate what they do and you're not just someone

78
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,560
who's randomly master blasting out thousands of pitches at once.

79
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,290
Then after that you go on your pitch.

80
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,730
So basically become something like Thanks for this.

81
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,410
And now there's this other thing you might like.

82
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,720
As for the pitch itself clearly state the value for them and their readers.

83
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,980
If you've done your research you should know if this subject will be of interest to them or not.

84
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:40,920
But reporters always have to consider their audience too so they need to know why they should care about

85
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,460
this pitch.

86
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,660
Or of yours and try your best to make it crystal clear.

87
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:49,680
Remember that 99 pitches sitting on their inbox next to yours so if you don't make your point clear

88
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,310
and you don't make your point clear quickly Well it's going to go into the trash.

89
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,130
Now let's continue that last email.

90
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,490
Now I can say I just wanted to pass along some news that you might be interested.

91
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:05,260
And again you can be my startup makes custom lightsaber handles out of 100 percent Willkie hair or whatever.

92
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,330
In a recent survey of my customers 80 percent of them say they're willing to spend more to buy products

93
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,210
with authentic materials instead of the imitation materials made by the Empire.

94
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,800
If you're interested in the data I'd be happy to share it.

95
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,970
Let me know and best wishes Obi-Wan Kenobi.

96
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,250
OK so you've got some data to share about your customers in the industry and you want to know if this

97
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,720
reporter is interested in it.

98
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,390
You're not being overly dramatic like oh you'll never guess what my customers think of imitation lightsaber

99
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,880
handles.

100
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,490
Want to know.

101
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,320
E-mail me now.

102
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,580
The email example we've come up with here is a better cell.

103
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,580
This kind of information will be valuable to other companies out there and it's real data instead of

104
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,480
opinion.

105
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:46,030
You also established that you read their article you added some personalization into it and then you

106
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,320
connected that.

107
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,580
This is something you do.

108
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,350
It's important.

109
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,640
It's valuable and it's relevant to something that they've already written about or have had an opinion

110
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:54,930
about.

111
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,530
Now it will take some time to kind of perfect your pitch voice and style but in general be polite and

112
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,160
friendly but don't act like you're the best friend they've ever had.

113
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,990
Unless you are best friends of course them do that and be confident in your pitch but not obviously

114
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,880
arrogant you know believe in what you've got.

115
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,230
Don't sell it like it's the greatest thing in the world.

116
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,180
Be excited about it.

117
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,140
Whatever it is.

118
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,770
But sell it with the reporter and their audience in mind makes sense.

119
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,470
OK well we're going to practice a little bit more in our next lecture.

120
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,350
Just to be sure.

121
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,960
See you then.
