00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.860
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.600
So far we've talked about the basics of video marketing running through common video types and thinking

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.240
about ideas you could use to create your own in the pre-production phase you finalize your idea write

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.840
your script and prepare to actually make this video.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.380
And that leads us to the second phase of video production also known as production.

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.260
This is the part where we actually set up locations shoot our video.

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.920
We say things in front of the camera and we make sure we get all the pieces we need for the third and

8
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.130
final phase the post-production.

9
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.970
So pre-production is all about preparation.

10
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.730
If you can do a great job preparing your script your notes and in the ideas you have your production

11
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.040
phase should go smoothly.

12
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.940
Pre-production is also where you figure out what content youre going to make.

13
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.010
Match it up to your audience and also make sure that there is some type of opportunity in the market

14
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.210
for what you're about to make.

15
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.310
Now I'm talking about your production going smoothly.

16
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.260
I mean while it probably won't but you and you might get lucky.

17
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.650
Look I want to give you any false hope here especially if you haven't produced a video before and I

18
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.960
don't mean you know selfie videos on your phone.

19
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.930
I mean real produced video content for the purposes of making some money or some real business purpose

20
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.800
producing videos can be a huge pain.

21
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.130
I mean think of it this way you could conceivably write a blog post during a rainy lightning storm with

22
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.890
your wife I knocked out using only your phone and a mobile app or a pencil and pen and you'd be sitting

23
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.140
in your car doing it on an airplane.

24
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.590
Right.

25
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.770
I mean that also sounds scary but it is possible written content is far easier to produce than video

26
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.370
content.

27
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.240
In that regard.

28
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.120
Now the video everything has to be prepped in advance in perfect detail if you're shooting in a conference

29
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.100
room in your office.

30
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.700
Well everybody else in the office needs to be quiet or otherwise you're going to hear them.

31
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.410
People have to stay out of the room or the audience will see them if you're on camera.

32
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.710
You need to look good.

33
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.440
You could write blog post in your underwear all day but videos require you to actually look presentable.

34
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.190
That requires everybody to show up at the same place during a set amount of time and or as you might

35
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.670
be renting space which means that you're on the clock and don't you get me started about shooting outside.

36
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.020
Well I guess I can talk about it if you're outside.

37
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.480
You have to pray that the weather is good enough.

38
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.210
It it's too dark outside too windy too rainy too noisy then you might not be able to create what you

39
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.680
want.

40
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.790
And all those girls are selling umbrellas or some kind of waterproof device and you need to stand in

41
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.100
the rain to show how it works.

42
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.260
In which case check me God.

43
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.640
So there's a lot of moving parts in a video production.

44
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.530
And there's a lot of things that can go wrong many many times have I filmed an entire day of work to

45
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.040
only find out the very end of the day that if we lost all the video.

46
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.260
Now the equivalent with a blog post be writing a really long blog post and then breaking your computer

47
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.580
and losing it.

48
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.030
But your chance of being able to recover that is a lot better than say having me last week.

49
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:58.510
Cat Ran and hit my hard drive off of a desk spinning disk hard drive disk no work no more lost almost

50
00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.700
a terabyte of video.

51
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.450
Basically what I'm trying to say here is that there are core requirements for video production to be

52
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.190
successful.

53
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.380
These requirements are related to video audio lighting and seen go in each one of these in more detail

54
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.490
and the lectures coming up.

55
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.890
But essentially And here's the gist of it.

56
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.640
The requirements for your video refer to the type of camera you use the settings of that camera and

57
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.420
the equipment you use with your camera like specific lenses and the way you use the camera to record

58
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.180
your video.

59
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.600
The requirements for your audio refer to how to capture the sound you want to eliminate the sound you

60
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.200
don't want.

61
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.870
The requirements for your lighting which is arguably the most important part and to newbies that might

62
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.450
be surprising that refers to how you will light the subjects in your video making them look good which

63
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.850
could be done with natural light artificial light or any number of lighting combinations.

64
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.100
The requirements for your scene are related to what your location or set needs to look like giving your

65
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.140
eye enough stimuli but not enough to being distracting or matching the mood of what are video you're

66
00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.030
trying to create.

67
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.920
My background right here is probably pushing it in terms of Toogood's to look at.

68
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.430
But when you're making long form educational content you're staring at my face for nine hours.

69
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.870
It helps have a couple of things to distract you occasionally in the lectures.

70
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.400
Coming up I'll go over plenty of detail for each aspect of video production.

71
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.540
So stay tuned and I'll see you in the next lecture.
