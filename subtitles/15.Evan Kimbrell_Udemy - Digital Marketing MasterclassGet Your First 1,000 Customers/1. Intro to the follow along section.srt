00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:07,980
Hey guys welcome back to the course and welcome to the introduction to the follow along section so I

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,970
don't know if you guys have taken any of my other courses other courses I'd generally like to do it

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,580
this way I show you a technique and then I follow along and do it for real business.

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,330
So in this course we're going to do that as well.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:27,930
We're going to try as much as possible to emulate or least like imitate every technique we do or at

6
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,410
least almost every single one because not every single technique works for every single business.

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,110
So part of the process in this course is we're going to go through all of these techniques going to

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,970
start off with manual effort stuff and then get towards the long term bigger picture stuff later on.

9
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:50,400
And you kind of have to make a decision Should I try this for my business based on watching me do it.

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,180
See if it's relevant see if it fits your strengths and then make a decision.

11
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,460
And so I'm going to do the same thing as well but I try to simulate as much as I can as possible.

12
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:04,380
Now I'm going to alternate most likely between different things.

13
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:13,250
So I have 15 courses on udemy which will allow me to do a lot of these techniques because there are

14
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,770
a lot of different topics to them.

15
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,000
However there's obviously certain disadvantages to online courses they're hard to sell.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,440
They're hard to run ads to.

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,090
They're hard to do certain techniques too.

18
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,160
So I'll have other things I'll have as backups.

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,730
But if you guys seem out of courses I 15 so I have pretty much all the way from like people want to

20
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,480
learn marketing.

21
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,200
People want to learn product management.

22
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,060
People want to learn programming MVP ideas.

23
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:46,200
I should be able to use any one of these courses to simulate what we're doing here.

24
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,390
Yeah.

25
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:54,600
So like I was saying we'll use these pages as pretend like businesses don't like pretend but we'll act

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,560
like this is a product.

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,900
So if I wanted to do my pre programming course then we'll follow along and I'll go on Twitter and I'll

28
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,880
look for certain people that have the pain points that might mean they're interested in this and what

29
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,410
we'll do to track to see if I'm actually making sales with the techniques and he might not all of them

30
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,890
are going to work is going to create a coupon.

31
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,340
And then what we'll do is we'll periodically check in after each time we try something and see who's

32
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,670
actually cashing in that specific coupon.

33
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,630
And that's the way that we'll be able to tell this is actually response of this technique.

34
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,950
It's not sort of my courses.

35
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,940
There's some other things we might try.

36
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:34,490
I have a blog which we'll use when we get to the content marketing section.

37
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,970
I have a couple of micro sites that we might use.

38
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,900
I have one that's like a video series that's like Christmas themed.

39
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,300
We'll talk about that later.

40
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:52,090
I also have a site where it's like a collaborative space for sharing business ideas.

41
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,640
So we might use that one.

42
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,900
It just depends on what the technique is and what makes the most sense for what we're trying.

43
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:04,920
Later on the course will actually switch to a different landing pages just because I have my own landing

44
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,110
pages for my courses on my site.

45
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,680
They're not 100 percent done right this second but these will give us more control and more insight

46
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,950
over the analytics like who sees it and who buys it.

47
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,600
Unfortunately Udemy we can drive traffic to it but I won't know necessarily what the conversion rate

48
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,490
is or how long they're on the page or if they went from one course to another and then came back.

49
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,640
I don't have that granularity of information.

50
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,890
So we're going to try to do this later on the course and we get some more advance stuff.

51
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,720
Okay guys I'll be excited these sections are kind of off the cuff little bit unscripted.

52
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,830
We'll just see how they go.

53
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,760
Otherwise guys I'll see you in the next lecture.
