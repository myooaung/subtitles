00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.130
OK we are back and we're talking about how to write SU friendly stuff.

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.980
We've mentioned how important quality content is along with your audience and the structure of your

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:08.850
post.

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.820
Now let's talk about where key words fit into this whole bigger picture.

5
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.120
Thanks to your keyword research you should have a five to 10 key word phrases that you really think

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.790
are good opportunities and you want to try and rank for them.

7
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.350
Now each time you write something.

8
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.800
Try to find a spot to use one or two of those key word phrases.

9
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.610
Don't try to stuff all ten in each post.

10
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.540
Stay focused and write with a purpose but keep these keywords in the back of your mind.

11
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.590
Now the result is that they should appear.

12
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.850
Naturally if you're writing in a natural conversational way you keep looking for excuses to object.

13
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.090
Another key word.

14
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.790
Well it'll sound unnatural and people won't like it as much with keywords in mind.

15
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.930
Here's a few specific things you should try to do every time.

16
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.890
The first one is if you can fit one of your keywords in your title that is ideal.

17
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.740
Now that means the keyword should appear in each one as well as your title and hopefully as well as

18
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.580
your you are l.

19
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.020
Now if you do there it will give your page a decent SBO boost especially if you're specifically going

20
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.890
for that keyword.

21
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.010
There are two of your key words appear naturally in the body of your post.

22
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.130
That's also good as well but don't force it.

23
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.620
Google generally knows what a relevant keyword density is supposed to look like so keyword density.

24
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.330
You know if your search term is bake pie it'll look at how many times has a big pie in the article and

25
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.930
no actually no.

26
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.390
Well a good article should only say at about 3 percent of the time or 4 percent of the time.

27
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.770
If you're running you're saying bake pie.

28
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.910
25 percent of the time then clearly you're written by bought and you get penalized.

29
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.090
Remember that Google is just getting smarter and smarter all the time.

30
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.890
Soon it will be Skynet.

31
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.650
But for now just assume it's smarter than you.

32
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.330
Number three is Google also understands more and more synonyms in like terms for keywords.

33
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.220
They after all have billions of search data so they can tell what people consider are related to one

34
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.740
another.

35
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.340
Google knows that BBQ for example is the same as barbecue's spelled out where the Christmas lights are

36
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.440
also known as string lights.

37
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.960
It's easier to repeat a term sometimes used synonyms in alternative terms or for them instead.

38
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.740
Throughout your post and now I mentioned before a little bit of a keyword density with Takada a little

39
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.240
bit more keyword density is the percentage that tells you how many words in your post are devoted to

40
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.440
a specific keyword.

41
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.360
Now years ago the ideal percentage of a keyword density was really hotly debated.

42
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.310
But these days the experts actually openly wonder if the number has Rizzi any relevance at all.

43
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.290
I mentioned Google is much smarter and can index a page.

44
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.480
Look at the tax code and basically understand what a page is all about.

45
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.430
Now a lot of rescue experts believe the number of times you use a keyword depost shouldn't be defined

46
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.640
by a percentage but rather by how important it is to what you're writing.

47
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.040
So if you write in a natural conversational tone key word will keep popping up like every few words

48
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.250
that Viagra would get Viagra.

49
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.960
Pretty annoying Viagra really fast Viagra $10 pills.

50
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:56.900
You must agree.

51
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.920
So with many topics in Osseo it's all kind of debatable right.

52
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.420
So it used to be a case that everybody would just make sure they get a certain percentage of the keyword

53
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.490
in your post.

54
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.090
Now some people don't use percentages anymore but google for the most part knows what the percentage

55
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.340
should be.

56
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.590
I still use it because it keeps track of my forcing it or not because sometimes that percentage will

57
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.740
actually tell me before I actually notice it in my writing.

58
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.210
Anyway back to your post.

59
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.050
Let's not forget about that title.

60
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.170
Now the title of your post is that major ranking factor and we mentioned in the previous lecture.

61
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.320
Well here's a quick reminder of some of the tips we mentioned before make the title clear and to make

62
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.170
it accurate you've got to make it unique as well as try to keep it under 60 to 65 characters but don't

63
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.070
feel like you have to make your title generic or too simple.

64
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.370
In fact a creative title can be a huge attraction for people when they're considering which link to

65
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.050
click or article to read.

66
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.140
Use your title to spur some interest in what your post is all about.

67
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.850
What say you have a post about your opinion of the best ways to manage a project with virtual coworkers.

68
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.470
Maybe your first title idea is how to manage a project with virtual coworkers.

69
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.140
Nothing wrong with that of course but to make your title more interesting you could try one of these

70
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.740
ideas.

71
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.360
You could try promising results how to manage virtual projects and get awesome results.

72
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.790
You could create a little bit of drama.

73
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:14.210
Why.

74
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:20.880
I completely changed the way I manage virtual projects or maybe emphasize a key detail got virtual coworkers

75
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.190
managing projects just got easier.

76
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.150
Now these are all variations of the same idea but depending on what you're trying to make people think

77
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.670
a different kind of title can make a different impression.

78
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.880
All right.

79
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.370
Now here's a few more thoughts on writing and generating SBO value.

80
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.100
Write and publish articles and posts consistently.

81
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.710
If possible try to make a schedule and stick to it.

82
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.270
We talked about this back in content marketing we talked about the content calendar and your publishing

83
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.500
cadence each time you write try to create something that's original.

84
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.800
Now it's nearly impossible to create something totally new these days.

85
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.380
I know but on your site for your readers each time you post you at least be giving them something new

86
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.140
to consume and to act on.

87
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.460
And if it's the same thing give it a new angle or for a new type of person.

88
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.420
Now don't copy other people's stuff but also don't cannibalize your own content have too much overlap

89
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:12.150
between your post and your post in advance to make sure you're not taking away from a past post or something

90
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.140
already be written.

91
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.480
Try to fan yourself out a little bit and I don't mean running about anything that comes to mind but

92
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.040
just make sure that you know if you're running a productivity you don't just write a bunch of generic

93
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.600
ones on how to increase productivity six ways to improve productivity 10 ways to improve productivity

94
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.450
improvement productivity actually get into the details and by choosing specific ways of doing it titling

95
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.450
it that way.

96
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.340
Well then you can actually stop yourself from cannibalizing.

97
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.570
Thing is to make it easy to share your content.

98
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.200
Now whether you add share buttons or explicitly write something at the end of your post like please

99
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.570
share me encourage readers to share your stuff.

100
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.970
More shares actually can lead to more links and traffic which improves your Cascio value is actually

101
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.350
twofold fold right so people can click it and share it.

102
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.050
Which means more free traffic Google will notice that and be like hey this is more popular must be better

103
00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.910
in general now.

104
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:05.520
Google looks for pages that are more socially plugged and they look for pages that get shares and promote

105
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.950
sharing on their page.

106
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.650
It's just one of the things they look for and the more modern algorithm updates.

107
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.520
All right so in this lecture we mentioned a lot of different ways to write SEO friendly content.

108
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.080
You have to consider the overall structure of your piece and how each piece is presented and organized.

109
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.890
To think of your audience and what they want and expect as well as your own identity and personality.

110
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.640
There are fine details to consider as well.

111
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.650
The title the code and the keywords but in the end you really just want to create something substantial

112
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.650
that only helps your reader but demands to be shared.

113
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.700
Set your goals high each time you write you want to get ranked for keywords and provide something with

114
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.260
significant SU value.

115
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.920
Well you write pieces that appeal to an audience and impresses them make sense.

116
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.500
Probably not.

117
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.840
Yes.

118
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:45.350
I don't know.

119
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.400
OK well we're going to put this to the test in our next lecture when we try some of these best practices

120
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.690
for writing content.

121
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:52.530
All right I'll see you then.
