1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,970
Now in order to get the most out of your mykes and capture the best audio you can remember the second

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,980
point I mentioned at the beginning of this lecture.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,540
Great audio making means making sure we don't hear anything else but the subjects on screen.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,380
Now what do I mean.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,190
Well let's do a cooking experiment.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,710
Wherever you are I want you to actually stop.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,500
Don't make any noise.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,010
Pause the video and listen.

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,730
Now you might be in a living room office or bedroom.

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,700
Take a listen and make a note of what you hear besides me obviously.

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,730
Maybe there's the slightest hum of an air conditioner.

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,410
Perhaps you're in the kitchen and you can hear your refrigerator buzzing away.

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,860
Maybe someone's outside right now mowing the lawn.

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,780
Some kids are probably skateboarding on your sidewalk god dammit.

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:57,270
Maybe a large truck rambling body there might be birds if they have opposable thumbs they might be tweeting

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,610
right now.

17
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,660
Coral is full of sounds.

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,980
No matter where you are we get used to it so you don't really notice it.

19
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,360
But as soon as you set up for a shoot you might all of a sudden notice hey I let my neighbors are actually

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,110
quite loud.

21
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,190
So part of the challenge of capturing great audio for your marketing video is going to be eliminating

22
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,460
as many of those worldly sounds as possible.

23
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,540
Now that really just comes down to choosing a location.

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,040
Well try to choose a location that says isolators possible US few extra people machines and noises as

25
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,700
possible.

26
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,660
Then when you're in your chosen location you want to do something that's what I consider more important

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,630
which is called an acoustic treatment.

28
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:40,070
Now this means optimizing your room to deaden any noises in it and reduce any echo you might get.

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,300
In case you're in a room that's empty or the room might just be big or it might be big and empty.

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,950
Now you might ask What do you mean by Echo.

31
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,020
What do you like filling in a cathedral so every time you make a noise I can hear.

32
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,370
After three seconds your voice comes back like a boomerang.

33
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:00,950
No what I'm talking about and I was as I say Echo because Echo is what you might recognize it as.

34
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,360
But technically it's called reverb.

35
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,140
Now what reverb is is when I talk and the camera picks it up it's also going to pick up the sound waves

36
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,430
from my voice that hit the wall and then bounce back to it.

37
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:21,020
Now comes the absolute millisecond after it captures the original sound.

38
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,520
The time between it coming back distorts the sound but also the refraction off of something will change

39
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,170
the sound.

40
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,780
So in dead rooms what that basically means is when I talk.

41
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,680
That's all you hear.

42
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:39,210
You don't hear any secondary voice bouncing back with like a tinny or a hollow sound to us if you're

43
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:52,630
really bored actually just turn off all the sound right now in your room and clap.

44
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,820
And when you clap just listen to it does it just go.

45
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,750
Or do you actually hear it reverberate on the walls.

46
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,950
That's a really good way of testing a room to see if it's worthy of shooting.

47
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,730
If you clap and you go Oh wow yeah I can hear the ceilings of the walls.

48
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,080
Well yeah then it's probably a bad place.

49
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,820
Usually a dead room when you clap.

50
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,800
It's barely sounds like anything they might say well what's it matter if there's a little bit of reverb.

51
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,750
What really matters if you have bad reverb it's really really hard to understand you and you add in

52
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,580
music.

53
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,980
Oh man it just becomes a muddled mess.

54
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,070
It's actually one of my promo videos I had to redo entirely.

55
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,920
I can probably link it in the non-technical person's guide to building products and apps.

56
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,610
The Echo was so bad it's it's really hard to tell what I'm saying and unfortunately is because I was

57
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:47,540
in a room had too much empty space and the walls were metal sorry the walls were like cement whatever.

58
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,230
It's a really bad material for sound bouncing off of it.

59
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,640
All right so really there's three steps in general for doing what we call an acoustic treatment to make

60
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,640
the room not sound terrible.

61
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,970
Now the first thing obviously is like I said before get as quiet as you can clap your hands see how

62
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:02,510
it sounds.

63
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,970
Then also just listen for hommes buzzes other noises from machines and any other sources use your microphone

64
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,850
and headphones and just tell everybody to shut up for a second.

65
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:15,650
So usually if you want to be polite you kind of stay quiet on the set you know probably not on a set

66
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,150
right now but people think you're cool for saying it did you will have things like refrigerators conditioners

67
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:25,160
microwaves and fans and things like that and you're going to have to turn those off a lot of times you

68
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,270
have a window open you're going to have to close it.

69
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,910
Unfortunately the temperature in the room is probably going to be the least of your concerns.

70
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,900
Do your best to turn off what you can and eliminate all the outside sources.

71
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:41,120
Next step would be to focus on reducing the reverb that we talked about before.

72
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,510
Now have you done the klap test.

73
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,560
And you said wow I can hear the walls or if you couldn't tell what you can do is just record Samaniego

74
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,320
just saying talk talk talk or writing off a fake sentence or whatever and then put it into a computer

75
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,550
listen on your headphones.

76
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,800
That's the best way to tell because that's what people are going to hear at the end of the day.

77
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,630
So a lot of times you listen to it oh go oh wow that's really what this room sounds like in this case.

78
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:09,350
The best tip I can give you is use blankets if you've ever moved from one apartment or house to another

79
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,330
you probably seeing these heavy quilted blankets they use and they wrap and cover your furniture and

80
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,920
they're thick because you know if you bump into something that ought to damage whatever they're carrying

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,180
you know if you buy them without moving and they're really cheap you get each one for like two bucks

82
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,890
or something.

83
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:29,720
Well you can do with those is a lot of things you can use some clamps and you can hang them on if you

84
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,570
use a couple light stands.

85
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:37,520
Sometimes the molding in the room you are in you can use hooks in and hang them up like that.

86
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,970
Worst case scenario I've done this before you leave a big exposed wall that's really hard metallic material

87
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,660
like a cement or something.

88
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,550
What you can do is duct tape it.

89
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,140
I've duct tape these to the wall and it works pretty well.

90
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:57,800
Do your best to cover as many expose large spaces that could be reverberating sound and then keep testing

91
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,740
it as you go.

92
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:06,260
There are things you can do if there's options available to you it's just fill the room with more stuff.

93
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,590
If you're in a living room that's empty and you might have emptied it because you think oh that's better

94
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,400
for filming.

95
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:16,680
Well that actually might have worse reverb than if you put the couches and the tables and the stuff

96
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,480
back in larger rooms means that the sound has to travel farther before it comes back.

97
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,020
And so that actually can create a lot of problems.

98
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:29,700
So what you can do if you're limited on supplies is you can take one of those blankets I was talking

99
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:35,250
about and try to hang it up kind of like you'd hang up clothing after the wash and turn up if you're

100
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:35,970
in a large room.

101
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,890
Try to put in the middle of the room and what that does it essentially cuts the room in half so that

102
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:46,290
the sound doesn't go all the way to the end and then back it only goes halfway back and then actually

103
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,580
that can actually help quite a bit.

104
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,240
But as you do about reverb and this just really comes down to choosing a location is.

105
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,600
I know hardwood floors look great but carpeted is just going to be so much better.

106
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,160
You can only cover so much the floor with blankets.

107
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:08,570
Just pick some place that has carpet or throw down a rug that will make an enormous difference.

108
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:14,420
The third thing you can do and this is kind of optional it's kind of out of the way but you can invest

109
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,620
in if you're using the same location.

110
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:24,110
Often you can invest in foam pads and there's a lot of them out there and they're not really cheap.

111
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:29,530
You can get these half inch foam pads they could look like egg shell basically or a lot of times they're

112
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:36,210
like these triangles spikes and they usually come in like one and a half foot by one and a half foot

113
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,590
squares.

114
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:44,250
You can buy things like 10 of them for $30 or something like that checked on Amazon but you can cover

115
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,270
all your walls with that and that will deaden up the noise quite a bit.

116
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:53,670
The only problem with that is like if you're using a space like a rental space or are you going somewhere

117
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,530
you shoot out all the time.

118
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,270
Well you have to put those foam pads up and you know if you're renting your apartment even when you're

119
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,290
shooting your apartment you know that's always something you have to take in consideration make sure

120
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:08,550
that when you put them up you use a light adhesive because otherwise you take them off they'll rip the

121
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,020
paint off and other other foam options you can use.

122
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:18,540
They all get way more expensive from there you can do what are called acoustic panels which are kind

123
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,310
of two foot by four foot panels and you hang up against your wall.

124
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,210
You can see them in some of my courses I use to put them on the doors but they look kind of like something

125
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,560
you'd see in someone's home.

126
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,410
That's the best part about them is that they look normal.

127
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,950
However they do cover a big section of a wall and they're pretty good at absorbing sound.

128
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:42,890
You also invest in things like bass traps which are foam pads that go up on your ceiling in the corners.

129
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,610
Right now you might think that will cover the whole walls of foam when Also I need all foam actually

130
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,280
only will stop certain frequencies of sound.

131
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,430
You actually need these things called bass traps to help with the lower frequencies of sound so that

132
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,340
your voice sounds low or unmanly or whatever.

133
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,800
If you're really an audio file or if you really have a space you are doing a lot of recording in that

134
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,090
symphony something to look into.

135
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,480
The last thing we need to talk about really quickly are audio recorders.

136
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,090
Now those are those things that you use kind of in the field that record the sound of the microphone

137
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:15,800
to the recorder.

138
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:21,390
They're better than going right into your camera because they don't have as much static noise incorporated

139
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,170
with them.

140
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,070
They're also pretty portable which means that you can have more flexibility of what you're shooting

141
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,470
where you're walking to.

142
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,010
Really they're all just kind of small boxes I just showed you mine before they record.

143
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,120
They have a lot different settings you can use them for a lot of them actually can record on themselves

144
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,020
alone without using an external microphone which is pretty cool.

145
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,940
At least good when your mikes break and you're in a Penge.

146
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:49,980
So the most common brands you'll see are like Tass cam or zoom and they both make really popular recorders

147
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,290
that are usually around like $200.

148
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,760
Now the only consideration pass that I would say with these recorders is if you start getting really

149
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,860
fancy really they're getting professional audio and you might start getting something that's way more

150
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:08,880
fancy you start mixing audio professional audio people though record one thing for each person on the

151
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,570
set and will even have recorders around the room just to pick up and be noise and they can feed that

152
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,940
in later into the video.

153
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,160
Yeah.

154
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,480
You don't need to go that far by it.

155
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,380
You do need to consider how many Mikes you need.

156
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,090
Ninety nine percent of the time you'll be fine with any zoom more tabs cam recorder because they allow

157
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,300
you to put in at least two microphones.

158
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:34,680
The last thing I'll say about audio is that unlike lighting you don't just set it up and then you're

159
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,180
done with it till the end of the shoot.

160
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:41,450
With audio you do have to do what we were mentioned before called Audio monitoring which means that

161
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:46,070
occasionally you have to check to make sure that it is working as it should.

162
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,850
This is especially the case with lava liers but occasionally you run into situations where a car drives

163
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:57,120
by and wrecks the sound or just something happens and if you're not paying attention to the audio you

164
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,140
might miss it.

165
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:03,140
Now the best thing you can do is if you're working with someone have them monitor it as they monitor

166
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,420
the camera on the lights and other things.

167
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:10,730
But if just you well this thing to do is just occasionally take breaks and then listen to the audio

168
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,100
to make sure nothing went wrong.

169
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:12,410
OK.

170
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,580
Later on in the lectures of this section we're going to talk about different production setups and we'll

171
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:24,110
again discuss audio but we'll discuss it in more detail about where to position them what types.

172
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,740
I prefer to buy or what's best for your budget.

173
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,630
Until then I'll see you in the next election.

174
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,100
We talk about video.
