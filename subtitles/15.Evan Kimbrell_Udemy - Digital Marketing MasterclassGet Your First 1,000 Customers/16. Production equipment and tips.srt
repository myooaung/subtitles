1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,400
Hey guys we are X and the last several years we've gone over a whole lot of information about video

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,830
production not just the fundamentals but also diving into some commonly used in popular production setups.

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,990
I want to wrap this section up on video production with a few extra tips that I have to recommend because

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,210
some of these are essential depending on the types of videos you want to create.

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,270
Now to talk about four different things from talking about teleprompters professional voice over artist

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,820
Dali's and slider's.

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,780
All right let's get in this.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,010
If you anticipate recording a lot of scripted video especially longer videos Well you might consider

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,130
investing in a teleprompter.

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,760
Teleprompters allow you to read the words from your script off the screen while you record.

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,460
The big advantage here is that you don't have to memorize your script which is great if you have long

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,420
scripts or lots of them to record.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,650
So potentially it could save you lots of time.

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,910
Now here is how it works.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,350
Well the prompter uses a special see through screen that sits in front of the camera lens.

16
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,830
The camera won't see it but when you look at it you'll see the words from your script reflected on it.

17
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:00,960
Now in some cases you're just using reflective glass and then if you use an iPhone or iPad it just reflects

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,620
on the glass and you see that.

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,960
Or fancy ones will have a screen that's powered by a program that feeds the letters into it.

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,220
Those are very expensive and then generally in these more expensive setups as you say your words someone

21
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,700
probably controls it or scrolls the text down.

22
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,860
And the other cheaper versions you can either time it where it just goes at a certain pace.

23
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,070
There's some ones where they'll look for what you're saying and I'll match them up to the words and

24
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,840
then move along accordingly.

25
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,970
Or you can just use the remote in general.

26
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,680
Teleprompters are a great way to add polish to your videos if you're a professional and you care about

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,590
your brand well.

28
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,390
Then using a prompter is going to make you sound like you know what you're saying and you're more prepared

29
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,130
to deal with this a little bit in another video.

30
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,240
But the cheapest option you can do is what's called the parrot teleprompter and it just goes right on

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,300
the front of the Lindzi or camera they use like an iPhone to read the information onto it and you use

32
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,570
iPhone programs that can act like teleprompters.

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,980
It's really pretty simple.

34
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,920
I mean it doesn't work fantastically but it's only 50 bucks.

35
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,190
The alternative other fancy teleprompter programs which are God.

36
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,190
I mean they've I've never seen them lower than a thousand dollars.

37
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,190
Now one thing to keep in mind with teleprompters is that you will have to practice with them.

38
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,450
It's not as easy as it sounds like you're basically reading on camera.

39
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,980
But the hope is that you don't look or sound like you're reading.

40
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:28,460
You need to practice you come off as natural you're spouting off all this prepared material that's going

41
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,580
to do it for all of us here.

42
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,630
Channel 4 News.

43
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,960
You stay classy San Diego.

44
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:40,080
I'm Ron Burgundy not have you noticed this but newscasters they use teleprompters.

45
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,610
They're just really really good at it.

46
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,460
You might not notice that they're just literally reading something off with their eyes.

47
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,260
They just don't know.

48
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,030
I mean they've just gotten to a point where they can ad lib they can never really run into problems

49
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,080
they do it all live.

50
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,050
It's actually pretty impressive.

51
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,550
Here's the prompter one way you can tell if someone's using a teleprompter and this is one of those

52
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,010
things once you hear it you can never hear it.

53
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,170
Well there's two things.

54
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,300
One is what I call I lock.

55
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,790
So if someone's talking to a camera and they're just staring at the camera like this and they never

56
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,630
do long blinks and never look away like this.

57
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,770
That's a good sign that there is the teleprompter and the other thing is if you look at their pupils

58
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,620
generally speaking you can see them going like this because they're reading that teleprompters will

59
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,120
be too large based on the distance in the camera.

60
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,690
So a lot of times you'll be like this and that just looks really bizarre.

61
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,150
This is how people use help from the wrong where they put them on top of the camera below.

62
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:42,240
And that's oh I have to really hate that because imagine if I was talking to you like this like Does

63
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,210
this seem natural at all I'm just reading off a teleprompter.

64
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,600
I personally hate that stuff.

65
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:55,290
So weigh the pros and cons here and consider Will the extra expense hardware and practice and kind of

66
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,120
the high jinks you have to get through.

67
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:03,480
Is it going to be worth it to complete your recordings and get through them faster with more polished

68
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,590
and sounding more prepared.

69
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,400
Do I need to record long stretches of dialogue in front of a camera.

70
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,780
That would necessitate a prompter.

71
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,860
Is there a different way of recording these long scripts.

72
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,210
OK.

73
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,760
Well that's really enough about teleprompters because you might be thinking about this to yourself.

74
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,270
Yeah.

75
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,500
You know what I don't actually want to be in the video.

76
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,620
I don't want to talk in it.

77
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,790
I want someone else to do it.

78
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,080
And plenty of people will agree with you.

79
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,720
It's nothing about your voice but about their own.

80
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,240
A lot of video makers actually outsource the actual speaking being done in their videos and they get

81
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,050
professional voice over artist to do the work for them.

82
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,200
What I want from you is your full.

83
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:47,440
As it turns out not everyone has the most beautiful easy to understand and crisp accent.

84
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,350
People generally want to hear certain types of voices like for instance men for some reason think that

85
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:56,290
women's voices are more pleasing and more relaxing.

86
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,450
And I probably I don't know what women think about men's voices but in general if you're trying to get

87
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:06,990
across a feeling or some convey some emotion that you can't produce in your own voice while using a

88
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,810
voice artist is a pretty good option.

89
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,470
Now one popular voice you can check out if you really want to get into this and you have a little bit

90
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,730
of budget for it check out voices dot com.

91
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,400
They have thousands of people on there who freelance and do professional voice work.

92
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,530
And with all those people you have an immense amount of choices to choose from and say that five times

93
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,720
fast choices choices choices for choices anyway.

94
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,940
You've got men and women high voices deep voices people who sound professional people who sound young

95
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,860
and trendy people who can enunciate lots of detailed terms and then people who can do that cool in a

96
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,980
world like movie type trailer voice.

97
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,490
Now that's great if you have a very specific idea in mind of what you want but generally they're going

98
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,790
to charge you per word or per second.

99
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,860
And it can get kind of expensive depending on what you're using them for.

100
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,490
My preferred option is actually just go to five or dot.com five or it's five or with two Rs.

101
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,380
There's a lot of voice artists on there just type voice over voice artist and you'll just see an enormous

102
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,300
amount of them that's what I always use and I never really spend more than $20.

103
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,020
I mean you have people who are really good really in demand they have voices that sound like they're

104
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,040
from commercials.

105
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:17,130
Then you have people who are newer to it have perfectly fine voices just haven't built up a large portfolio

106
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:22,010
and therefore can be really cheap you go cheap is like a dollar a minute voiceovers.

107
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:30,240
Also keep in mind are great but only when you have to call this omnipotent narrator where you're narrating

108
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:36,540
a promo or an ad or whatever it is and there's a voice and that the viewer knows they're never going

109
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,080
to see the person who's talking this way called the OmniPod and it's like it's talking in the back of

110
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,970
your head that's perfectly fine.

111
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:46,140
But if you want to show the person talking well then you have to get a real person.

112
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,530
So anyway we talked about some ways to improve your delivery on camera and how to add a professional

113
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,010
voice to the mix if you don't want to do it yourself.

114
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,670
Now it's I got some equipment you can use to improve your camera work and make your videos look even

115
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,280
nicer.

116
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:02,940
Once you go down the camera equip it rabbit hole you may never emerge because there are so many kinds

117
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,910
of things you can buy to capture really nice footage.

118
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,180
There's lots of things to hold your cameras movie cameras when your cameras fly your cameras.

119
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,460
Drones are very popular right now because their costs have finally come down.

120
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:18,150
And if you need aerial footage or something like that for your marketing maybe it's a golf course or

121
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:23,160
a manufacturing plant or you want a sweet group shot of all your employees well a drone can be pretty

122
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,540
good.

123
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:29,370
In most cases you don't really need a drone but if you're doing it outdoors the stuff that I think it

124
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,630
might be worth buying otherwise just rent a drone for when you need it.

125
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,790
You've thrown a beach party and you know aerial shot will do that.

126
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,100
Great place find people or drone or owner operators.

127
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,210
You can Google it.

128
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,120
Also on Craigslist people posts on Craigslist all the time it's just some guy with a drone he's pretty

129
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,290
good at flying it.

130
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:52,590
They're usually pretty cheap it's not super cheap but they're decent but before you go buying a drone

131
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,820
fleet equipped with go pros and laser beams or However these things fly I want to take you back to a

132
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,630
couple of well-tested pieces of equipment the crews love.

133
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,820
Now Dali's and slider's Now Dolly is your very best friend.

134
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,240
Squishy be f.f you can dress and blow.

135
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,760
Now this auction I'm talking about a dolly is basically a train track that you build for your camera.

136
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,270
It's allow I call it a slider because I'm a simpleton.

137
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,420
But and it just makes it slide.

138
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,070
This is what we do in America we just call things exactly what they are.

139
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:24,660
It's not a roundabout there's a circle and you attach your camera to it and slide that bad boy forward

140
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,370
and backward or side to side to capture some really nice and smooth footage.

141
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,060
The idea with using a dolly is to create a factory make a scene more intimate bringing the viewer closer

142
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,620
to something or someone or farther away as you zoom out.

143
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:43,680
Now could be people product a place but being in as it's called focuses the attention on what's in view.

144
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:49,080
The flip side now if you Dalty out to expand the view that shows people a wider view or scope of the

145
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,390
location and situation.

146
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,820
In fact you could also Dehli sideways to follow someone as they walk from one side to another.

147
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:59,970
We actually call that one a tracking shot and you could even build a circular track around something

148
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:05,380
and then Dalty around it creating a cool mini kind of effect whatever direction you go.

149
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,000
These are great because they provide smooth video footage instead of doing the same thing while holding

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,410
the camera in both your hands.

151
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,520
Do not underestimate how much of a nice polished effect a dolly can.

152
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:20,430
And if you use a dolly correctly people won't even notice but they'll just know that this is way nicer

153
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,540
if you look at something like promo videos we almost always use Dali's and it's almost always on the

154
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,530
alternate camera.

155
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:31,320
So the first one static the never changes and Exide camera will always have a slight motion to it and

156
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,620
it really does help with this kind of feeling of a high production do not by any means try to do this

157
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,030
manually with your hands.

158
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,360
That's just just never works out.

159
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:47,850
The fact of Dolly the reason why it looks good is because it stays on a perfect track and it's perfectly

160
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,260
smooth when it's jerky or it goes up and down it kind of kills it for you.

161
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,120
Now of course there's other ways of doing this.

162
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,430
You can do it with some handheld cameras that are auto stabilizers like on a gimbal that's what they're

163
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,140
called but that requires an entirely new piece of equipment.

164
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,920
It's probably not worth doing.

165
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,820
There's also one thing that even goes one step further which is pretty ridiculous and if you look at

166
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,910
the become a product manager video we did we actually tried to use this.

167
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:18,930
It's called a parallax Dolley and what parallax is is it's a fact when you have something in the foreground

168
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,360
and then have something in the background.

169
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,510
And it's when the background is moving but the foreground is not.

170
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,130
Now that's a parallax effect.

171
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:30,270
It's pretty frickin sweet but it's kind of overkill for a lot of the stuff you do.

172
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:36,330
And there's specific dollies that you can use that allow you to do it and basically what it does is.

173
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,290
So is the camera moving like this never changing its lens.

174
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,800
It starts like this.

175
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,910
And then as it goes along it tilts the camera.

176
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,210
Right.

177
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,900
So whatever it's focused on doesn't move but the background does it.

178
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:52,180
I personally it's one of these things that when I see the footage I just kind of drool.

179
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,070
Anyway if you decide to go the dolly route it's going to cost you some money because you need to buy

180
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,110
a bunch of equipment to make it all work.

181
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,880
My general advice if you want to use a full blown Dolly is rent it because they're good or do you get

182
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,410
a good one they're really really expensive.

183
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:09,390
So I mean how often you use it like how annoying would it be if we are watching this for 10 hours and

184
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,620
you just have the camera keep sliding back and forth.

185
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,930
I say just rent it.

186
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,190
Now if you're really insistent on owning one well there's a much smaller and more affordable version

187
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,930
of Dolly that a lot of marketing video crews will use.

188
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:25,040
I actually called a slider and it's what I incorrectly mix up.

189
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,380
Now a slider is not a tiny hamburger.

190
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:32,490
Well it is but you know what I mean it's basically a miniature version of a doll that slides back and

191
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,500
forth along a super smooth track.

192
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,800
They can place it on a table or even mounted on a tripod.

193
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,900
They do is to create the same smooth motion we've been talking now with Dali's.

194
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,520
But in this case you don't need as much motion.

195
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,370
Typically a doll is going to be like Yeah if you're moving and you want it to track someone if they

196
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:54,450
walk or as a is just just get that nice little short motion at it even a little bit of motion in a video

197
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,180
shot really can look good.

198
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,300
Now you might be tempted to say well doesn't my camera zoom in and out.

199
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:05,700
Why can't I just dial in and out by zooming in and zooming out and just slap yourself because that's

200
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,320
just not the same if you actually look at the comparison of the two.

201
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:14,010
It's not actually the same thing zooming in and out kind of feels like you're pulling them towards the

202
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,140
image and then pushing them back outwards.

203
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,470
Dolly feels like they're just slowly moving towards it.

204
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,170
It's really just not the same effect if you did it with zooming and actually be pretty annoying.

205
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,280
It kind of has this binocular like a fact like you're looking into something really quickly and it's

206
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,310
really hard to get done well.

207
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,980
So like I said earlier you could go even further into camera equipment land and look things that will

208
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,410
help you get more advanced more elaborate kinds of shots you have a need.

209
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:43,220
Well there's pretty much always a piece of equipment that you can satisfy with.

210
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,230
For example there's a thing called gybe.

211
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:50,800
This is what it is is a long arm you attach to a camera so that you can capture a rising or falling

212
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,710
or even like a swooping kind of camera movement.

213
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:59,170
So for that reason they're also sometimes called Crain's because they look like Crain's gybes are pretty

214
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,730
nice and if you see footage from it they're pretty impressive.

215
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,680
But again a lot of work just to get a couple seconds of a swooping motion.

216
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,180
Now there's also things like shoulder mounts and you can use these with cameras of all sizes to help

217
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:15,040
the characters and hold the camera more easily providing a little more stability for your handheld camera

218
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,820
shots.

219
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,780
Steady cam mounts are another thing that you can mount on the camera so you can try and get smoother

220
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,340
footage when you know you're going be walking or even running while holding the camera.

221
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,570
You might also call this like a camera stabilizer.

222
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,230
And I've also mentioned go pros and drones at different points so really there's a whole bunch of ways

223
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,190
to get different and interesting video shots if you need them.

224
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,970
All these extra types of equipment can cost money especially those more elaborate setup so be sure you

225
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,170
really absolutely need them.

226
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,870
Honestly if you're just starting out personally I mean I'd grab a slider for yourself maybe and try

227
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,220
it out but again like I said rinde when you need it anyway.

228
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,210
So there you go.

229
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,630
We talked about teleprompters.

230
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,450
You know if those are voice over artist and additional equipment like Dali's slider's drones and a couple

231
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,630
of other things any one of these things can really add a nice professional touch to your marketing video

232
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,140
because after all anything it makes the video look better makes you look better.

233
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,980
Keep that in mind.

234
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,210
All right guys I'll see in the next lecture.
