00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.910
Hunger is welcome back.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.270
All right.

3
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.040
So we're in the homestretch here with content type templates that you can use to kind of jumpstart your

4
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.150
process.

5
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.380
So far we've discussed content types that help us answer questions present lists full of information

6
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.490
and then finally last lecture we covered Content-Type to help us tell stories about ourselves and about

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.820
our customers.

8
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.300
Now we're going to wrap up with content types that go all in on one specific topic.

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.400
We're going to talk about number one many sites.

10
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.400
Number two ultimate guides while the other content types offer specific focus on a need a story or a

11
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.440
scenario.

12
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.240
These content types provide everything supposedly you need to know about one specific issue or topic.

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.520
It's more than just a 10 ways to create a what ever post or a case study about a client who found success

14
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.490
one time.

15
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.360
Those content types have their place but sometimes the reader needs the whole picture top to bottom.

16
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.060
They want something more comprehensive.

17
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.630
So let's start off here talking about many sites.

18
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.300
Now many sites are a little hard to pin down because they can be a lot of different things.

19
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.370
But I'll try my best to explain this.

20
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.640
Usually when we think of content we think of things you create on your site or on a community site that

21
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.020
gets people to go to your page and or like your brand with many sites.

22
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.750
The goal is still the same but we don't create content on our site.

23
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.590
Instead we conjure up an idea for an entirely separate web site with its own functions and potentially

24
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.850
its own branding.

25
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.190
The idea here is that you can create a small tool with its own site or a quick site that capitalizes

26
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.810
on something topical.

27
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.770
Then you promote that site itself and it's all tied together into your larger site.

28
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.170
I know maybe that doesn't necessarily make sense but let's go over some examples.

29
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.490
For example in December I launched a site called the 25 days of ideas.

30
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.350
You can look at it WW day.

31
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.660
Twenty five days of ideas dot com.

32
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:05.310
Now this is not part of my broader Evan Kimbrell dot com site and in fact you wouldn't immediately know

33
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.550
that they were related in that site that I made I made a Christmas themed once a day advent calendar

34
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.430
of videos that explain how to come up with business ideas as you do.

35
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.680
I gave it away for free and as a result I got exposure to something like that was like 40000 new users

36
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.950
and then many of those people then bounced around the pages and even commercial dotcom and then bought

37
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.560
of course I know this because I set up campaigns specifically tracking this.

38
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.860
So that's the idea.

39
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.680
Make a tool or a gag or just something really useful and launch it like it were a completely separate

40
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.270
thing.

41
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.930
Now a classic example of a mini site that just did insanely well was done by a company called HubSpot.

42
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.930
Now HubSpot created the Hubspot marketing grader.

43
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.090
If you went there you wouldn't necessarily know that it's part of HubSpot.

44
00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.230
It looks like its own Web site but it was brilliantly simple HubSpot sells software that helps you automate

45
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.270
and manage your website marketing and sales Buika.

46
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.770
They created a tool where you could put in your website and that tool or web site would automatically

47
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:17.940
graded on how well your site would perform on a number of different things like no load time user conversion

48
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.530
things that marketers care about.

49
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.090
Now that's a really helpful tool.

50
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.990
Digne have you basically free advice that you might pay a consultant to do.

51
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.570
And guess what if you use it then HubSpot gets your email and throughout out the tool you get subtle

52
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.460
prompts to use their service because it's basically the antidote to the problems they just highlighted.

53
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.060
Web site greater believe it or not and this is on the downlow is one of HubSpot largest sources of leads

54
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.240
for their software.

55
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.200
It's actually a really big deal for the there wasn't just some one off thing.

56
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.690
It's a good like 40 50 percent of their leads if you want to catch many sites in the wild.

57
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.180
Check out product on almost every day we see a site created that's very basic but is designed to get

58
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.200
shared in adjacent promote the company that then created it.

59
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.870
Many sites obviously take more time and require more fluency with putting together web sites but you'll

60
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.660
find that they're much easier to promote and can be a great way to highlight your brand in general.

61
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.000
It's a lot easier to say look at this web site I just discovered that does this crazy thing or gives

62
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.340
you this great information versus this blog post that a company that's clearly trying to sell me something.

63
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.740
It's a lot easier to share and talk about and have more buzz about the first one.

64
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.200
So the mini site is its own thing it's a tool or a site that stands on its own but still supports your

65
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.090
business or brand in a way.

66
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.520
Well the other type of content that we're going to talk about here is the ultimate guide and it's a

67
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.990
little bit of a departure from this.

68
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.680
Dare I say we're saving the best for last.

69
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.360
Why is this one the best.

70
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.490
Because it's so it's the ultimate guide.

71
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.440
There's nothing better than that right.

72
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.740
Well do a search on Google if you want to just just use the phrase ultimate guide and you'll surprisingly

73
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:05.100
find it a lot of goaltimate guides out there now is there something more ultimate than an ultimate guide.

74
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.530
Maybe the immortal guide or the Super-Duper guide should we look for the ultimate guide to ultimate

75
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.130
guides.

76
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.910
Oh wow.

77
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.400
Ultimate Guide inception.

78
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.170
Anyway I got off on a tangent there.

79
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.130
Sometimes our audience needs more information than a listicle can provide.

80
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.390
Sometimes they're not in search of something specific.

81
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.670
They need everything.

82
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.660
They don't know anything about a topic and they want the full rundown everything to do with web design

83
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.880
from choosing new web host to maintaining it over time or everything to do with cutting up Thanksgiving

84
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.610
dinner from choosing your turkey to enjoying those scrumptious leftovers and some of the weirder things

85
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.180
people eat.

86
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:45.090
We're talking about topics and concepts of multiple levels many pieces to them and we need a content

87
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.060
type that can bring it all together.

88
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.140
That's the ultimate guide and an Ultimate Guide is a promise more than anything it's a promise that

89
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.220
you will deliver everything the reader needs to understand a topic.

90
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.870
If you're running the ultimate guide to Instagram you'd better cover basic features.

91
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.810
How to use them secret tips shortcuts expert advice all the information one would need to understand

92
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.110
and use it really well.

93
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:14.370
You could write an ultimate guide to your own product that be easy enough and perhaps it would be a

94
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.090
good start depending on how popular product is and how much depth there is to it.

95
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.890
But like we've said a few times before in the series Don't forget that you can actually think externally

96
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.380
and you think externally.

97
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.320
That's when you bridge the gap between your interests and your cost.

98
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.430
The customers who don't know use interests.

99
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.710
Could you create an Ultimate Guide for people who work in your industry.

100
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.990
Your ultimate guide to being a bartender your customers are a marketer an app developer a puppet tear

101
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.830
a product manager or whatever.

102
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.220
Imagine if you gave your customers an ultimate guide on how to do their job.

103
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.710
That would be pretty ultimate.

104
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.100
Maybe you want to create something more focused on an action.

105
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.710
So what verb works for your audience.

106
00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:57.720
Do they create.

107
00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.500
Do they build.

108
00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.310
Do they write.

109
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.670
Do they support then.

110
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:07.740
How about an ultimate guide to creating or building or writing or supporting you fill in the blank.

111
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.210
Consider your audience and figure out what Ultimate Guide makes the most sense for them.

112
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.590
Here's an example that could help Zappia as a company that's all about productivity.

113
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:21.720
I don't know why it's not pronounced Zep's here because they make things called zaps therefore it Zappia.

114
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.840
Don't ask me questions.

115
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.350
They make a tool allowing you to automate things across multiple tools.

116
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:33.570
I know the brain Mussar basically think of them as like the app that allows you to transfer information

117
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:39.900
between two other apps or to take one thing from an app and then send a signal to another one.

118
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.730
I want to save something and every now and then I want that to print out on my printer without me having

119
00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.580
to do it.

120
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.040
You can create a zap to do that now and their content marketing strategy.

121
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:55.950
They created a bunch of ultimate guides including the ultimate guide to remote work CRM software email

122
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.420
marketing customer support and a whole bunch of other ones.

123
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.760
There is a lot of info on each one as there should be.

124
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.130
They are ultimate guides right after all.

125
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.200
But why exactly would zap you do that.

126
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:14.190
While many of their customers have not just an interest but a need for automation in their lives automation

127
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.590
tools like Zappia make their jobs easier.

128
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.500
So in Zappia creates an ultimate guide with them in mind.

129
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.940
It provides even more ways they can use their tools and increase productivity.

130
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.870
It's like training and coaching content combined with secret tips and hacks.

131
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:33.780
In the end if you're say a support person and you read this guide you should come away with two things.

132
00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:40.200
A better understanding of how to do your job and to trust in the people who put the guide together.

133
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:45.490
That trust then can lead to longer relationships that have more to do with purchases and money.

134
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.260
And that is another reason why ultimate guides can be so powerful.

135
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.180
All right so there you go.

136
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.300
In total in these videos you were 10 Content-Type.

137
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.030
You can use for different purposes.

138
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.340
You could actually call it an ultimate guide to content types.

139
00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:59.100
I don't mind.

140
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.170
Go ahead call it.

141
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.070
But here's another twist you can think about.

142
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:08.340
You could take one or more of these and make them but you might even get bigger results if you combine

143
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:08.820
them.

144
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:09.650
Yes.

145
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:16.290
And for graphic that was actually a listicle or company stories from Wisdom's that were actually more

146
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.220
like company stories mixed with many case studies.

147
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.910
Don't be afraid to color outside the lines here.

148
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:27.480
Perhaps your round up interview idea turns into a listicle or the makings of an ultimate guide.

149
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.680
Seek out existing examples of these types and you will find some inspiration.

150
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.560
It's not hard to do.

151
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.430
Now did we forget some contests in our round up of contents.

152
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:44.070
Yes of course we did but these ones are common and popular and they're easy to replicate.

153
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.640
There's other ones out there.

154
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.330
If we had a 50 hour long course I should on and along with course will be.

155
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:55.800
Maybe we'd cover them but these are the ones I've identified that work well consistently and are easy

156
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.400
to do.

157
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.170
And while you don't like it then make your own list.

158
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.330
Just leave me alone.
