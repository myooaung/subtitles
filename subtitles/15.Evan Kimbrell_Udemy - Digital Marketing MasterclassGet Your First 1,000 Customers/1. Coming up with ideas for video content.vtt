00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.620
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.490
All right so we're talking about video marketing and so far in this section we basically explained what

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.130
Video Marketing is why you'd want to make a video and then we talked about the many common types of

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.510
videos out there.

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.990
We also touched upon the three different phases of video production.

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.970
We have preproduction production and postproduction all video projects are going to have something in

7
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.650
each of these categories.

8
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.700
So this is where you need to plan well in pre-production that's the time that comes before you shoot

9
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.960
any part of your video.

10
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.060
And the reason why pre-production is really kept separate from production is because of how vital pre-production

11
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.800
is to the success of a video.

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.210
Now that preparation is important for running a blog post or baking a cake.

13
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.950
So

14
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.830
I ever know now it is absolutely necessary for the success of a video and I don't care if you're talking

15
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.190
about the latest 300 million dollar Marvel Comics movie or firing up your iPhone and just live streaming

16
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.660
something.

17
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.380
If you don't prepare you're going to do and say and where you're going to do it.

18
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.160
Well the process of making a video will get exponentially more difficult and the end product will be

19
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.790
worse.

20
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.640
So as part of your preparation for creating videos you need to come up with some solid ideas for content

21
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.800
back in our content strategy section we spent a good deal of time talking about content types you know

22
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.380
common formats people use to write post and then we also talked about common topics people would write

23
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.000
about.

24
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.950
Video content is a lot like written content and that there are some common types and topics worth considering.

25
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.790
So in this lecture I want to talk about those common types and topics you can use for video and how

26
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.530
to come up with some ideas of your own.

27
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.760
Now if you're at the point where you're ready to jump in and create videos I'm going to make assumptions

28
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.680
about you and your process so far.

29
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.520
First of all I have to assume you've already taken the necessary step of defining who your audience

30
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.850
is.

31
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.500
That's the part where you do some research.

32
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.510
Look at any existing data or information you have and create a picture for yourself of who your ideal

33
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.390
audience would be.

34
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.210
So it also be the part where you confirm that your audience is interested in video content to begin

35
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.740
with because you know if you're about to listen to me tell you about how to create a whole bunch of

36
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.130
videos in your audience rather read that content or just not interested in it all.

37
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.850
Well you might be wasting your time.

38
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.630
So make sure you know your audience and that they're open to videos and if you haven't done this research

39
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.200
please go back to the content strategy section and check out the lectures.

40
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.350
I think it's called like defining your audience.

41
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.390
The process is kind of the same as content marketing.

42
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.810
But you know you still need to know who you're going be talking to.

43
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.020
If you're already all done that or you just don't really care.

44
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.920
Well then I think we're good to go it's go on back in the content strategy section.

45
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.900
We did a group of lectures about common content types.

46
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.940
I think there are 10 in total and it included things like ultimate guides and roundups and you know

47
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.750
other ones.

48
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.730
Well since we're talking video here now I want to focus in on five of those content types you could

49
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.980
apply to video and I'm going to ignore the others because some of those written formats just don't translate

50
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.740
well to video format.

51
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.160
So the first one is tutorials.

52
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.150
You might remember that from the content marketing section of all those content types this is one that's

53
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.060
probably easiest to do as a video whether the shooter feels totally planned out and recorded or if it's

54
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.850
live and interactive as part of a stream tutorials make for great video content because people can see

55
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.250
what you're doing instead of just reading about it.

56
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.390
Number two interviews now interviews are another natural fit for video.

57
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.700
If you can get in the same room or do a video chat with an expert while you can record and produce an

58
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.770
interview video content type that allows you to lean on the other person to come up with the actual

59
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.750
information as long as you ask decent questions of course.

60
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.410
The number three have company stories now producing videos that tell companies stories obviously make

61
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.460
a lot of sense.

62
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.450
You can make it about the origin of your business.

63
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.330
People who do all the work while there's always the slack off the location where you work and the charities

64
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.090
you support etc..

65
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.520
Anything that helps reveal that human side about your business is a nice thing.

66
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.700
Sharing his stories through video can make it easier to relate to as well.

67
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.990
Number four is case studies and in a case a you're going to outline how and why a customer chose your

68
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.900
product or service and how it impacted their business.

69
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.810
Usually I think it's easier to consume all of this information if it's in a written format but a video

70
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.930
could be a more entertaining way to get the same point across.

71
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.020
It could also be a little bit more convincing than a fifth one are talking about the listicle so it

72
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.930
might be a stretch.

73
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.660
But yeah you could actually create listicle videos and let all the companies out there that do.

74
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.760
Buzzfeed obviously does make listicle videos as does like college humor and Valks and all those guys.

75
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.070
If you're showing a list of video elements like clips from a movie or video games or apps Well the net

76
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.070
could actually work.

77
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.830
It could be a little more engaging.

78
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.610
However with written listicle you might be able to create list into like the triple digits.

79
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.030
Like I don't know the hundred web sites you can download e-books but with the video you're probably

80
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.880
going to need to stick to something shorter.

81
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.860
Otherwise the insanely long video a top ten list is probably something that's closer to what you want

82
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.980
to make with a video.

83
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.070
So those are five content types that could be done in video tutorials interviews and Company stories

84
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.310
are generally get to be your best bet.

85
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.400
So if you wanted to take those ideas a step further and start thinking of content ideas for your own

86
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.860
videos.

87
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.440
Well then let's think about this.

88
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.980
Let's start with tutorials.

89
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.890
Now what kind of video tutorials would you produce.

90
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.930
Well what products do you have.

91
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.990
What features do those products have.

92
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.190
What basic functions should people understand about your products.

93
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.350
What concepts do people need to understand before they can really use your product.

94
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.060
What I'm asking basically is this what knowledge could help people get started and what advanced functions

95
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.390
could help more experienced customers get even more out of your product.

96
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.650
Also keep in mind with tutorial videos you don't have to just make it about you you you you you you

97
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:42.670
can make a tutorial but how to use something that's related to you via software that had something to

98
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:43.860
do with graphic design.

99
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:51.220
I could make a series on how to use Adobe Illustrator or how to use or how to find a good free stock

100
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.640
photos.

101
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.670
And that's something that people who might actually be interested in would find are plenty of questions

102
00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.670
you need to ask if you're going to go the route of making tutorial videos.

103
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.770
And when I say that I don't mean it in a general sort of like psychological asked these questions to

104
00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:06.400
yourself.

105
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.260
I mean literally answer these questions go through every one of them type them in a document somewhere

106
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.790
and come up with the answers your audience would want if they were researching you considering you and

107
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.260
maybe deciding to buy your stuff.

108
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.700
So let's say for example year that company Squarespace Squarespace is a company that provides services

109
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.650
to people who want to create nice looking professional web sites and it's really like an entire online

110
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.470
presence in a box.

111
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.490
If you've ever listened to a podcast you've heard an advertisement from them like an advertisement everything

112
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.810
and the Web sites Amaker are really nice looking.

113
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.820
If you guys from NBP course are going to use this but they're hard to customize.

114
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.220
Now they also offer services for marketing as well as e-commerce.

115
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:51.390
So you'd come to Squarespace if you needed a Web site and really wanted to establish yourself online.

116
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.230
Well with all of those services they offer Squarespace could easily produce a whole series of tutorial

117
00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.880
videos and they actually have done it to help people understand how to get started how to create an

118
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.980
account and navigate all of those pesky billing questions how to manage your domain names with their

119
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.450
system how to add images to add pages blah blah blah blah blah.

120
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.410
As you can see there's a series of videos for each of these subjects so there's a lot of valuable information

121
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:20.050
here especially excellent about Squarespace is approach those that they know video isn't the solution

122
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.880
for everyone.

123
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.870
Their videos are professionally produced.

124
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:23.880
They look and sound great.

125
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:29.320
And if you watch them you get the answers you want but they also provide all of that same value in written

126
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.630
form on the same page as each video with links and screenshots to drive home each point.

127
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.910
And this is kind of an important lesson I want you to realize.

128
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:42.790
Video Marketing or video content whatever you want to call it isn't like a separate tactic you can use

129
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.850
exclusively on some platforms.

130
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.610
Video should be a part of your overall content strategy and you should use video to do things that text

131
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.800
and other formats can't do.

132
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.730
When Squarespace produces these great tutorials they complement them with certain information and sure

133
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.140
everybody out there looking for this value actually gets it.

134
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:05.220
Now if you decided you wanted to interview experts in your field and then produce nice videos with them

135
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.270
will make a lot of sense to offer a written transcript of the interview with the video.

136
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.630
That way people will want to watch the video can watch video and that people want to read they can read.

137
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.770
That is something that's worth keeping in mind with video.

138
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:22.040
If you don't add close captions then there's nothing for Google to index.

139
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.690
Therefore it's generally a very good idea to have a written version as well.

140
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.490
If you do add transcripts that's great.

141
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.030
That's fewer words.

142
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.320
So Google is not going to parse as much as a written version.

143
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.450
Point is if you're doing this for SEO then make sure that you have a written version and transcripts

144
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.740
and close captions if you can.

145
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:44.530
Protip being obviously that YouTube auto generates or captions for you if you want to.

146
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:44.810
Oh yeah.

147
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:48.880
That was uploaded to YouTube though put in the transcriptions that you can download it back now.

148
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.390
Company stories are another Content-Type where video could be valuable.

149
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:57.520
Think about how you could mix and match formats here a page with lots of written text with images videos

150
00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.560
and maybe even info graphics showing corporate timelines.

151
00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.720
This mix of content can make the entire experience more interesting.

152
00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:09.010
So perhaps if you can interview your CEO or founder ask him why they started the company.

153
00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:14.470
Combine that with pictures of your first office space and a written account of your first days or weeks

154
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:18.250
of business and you've got an interesting origin story to share.

155
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:19.390
Let's take an example.

156
00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.620
A company called Eastman.

157
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:25.210
They're a global chemical company with tens of thousands of employees with products and partnerships

158
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.750
that range probably across every industry.

159
00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.350
They make toys they make clothing in the autumn.

160
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.830
They work with automotive and medicine plastics are pretty much everywhere.

161
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:40.030
Well in about two and a half minutes Eastman pretty much boils down their story into a video that gives

162
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.390
you an idea as to what they're all about.

163
00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.480
If they can do that and they're just all they do is make plastics.

164
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.750
Well you can do that as well or you can use video to highlight your customers instead and produce case

165
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:54.520
studies conducting interviews would again be great use of the video format since you can see and hear

166
00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.350
clients tell their stories instead of reading a quote.

167
00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:58.970
It makes for a more personal experience.

168
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.570
That some people trust more.

169
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:06.300
For example go to a meeting produced a pretty cool case study video about Investor's Business Daily

170
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.320
and how they use go to meeting in their business.

171
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:13.500
The videos are just about two minutes long and it makes the case for why other similar businesses should

172
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.550
be using their product.

173
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:19.230
And then if you wanted to create a video listicle the format is becoming even more commonplace.

174
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:24.660
For example Forbes created this video here about the top 10 jobs in the U.S. for 2017.

175
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.830
And if you're concerned about how to make a video listicle Here's a tip if you watch the Forbes video

176
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.790
you'll see it's made entirely up of stock photos and other still images.

177
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:37.890
All they did was each image was added a little bit of movement overlay some tax that tells the story

178
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.140
and then add some music to the background.

179
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.470
Not too complex at all.

180
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:46.050
But again combine this video with a text version of the information to get the most out of it.

181
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.040
If you come up with enough ideas for each type of video perhaps you could even plan and create a video

182
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:56.010
series of your own like a monthly interview series with web design experts or a weekly tutorial on a

183
00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:01.410
different feature that your mobile app has video series are nice because it saves you from coming up

184
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.510
with all the creative ideas for a video.

185
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:08.730
Every time you make one you have a series you'll be able to come up with a structure like how it begins

186
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:14.280
and ends what you do in the video each time you'll have an established link like if you want each one

187
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:19.530
to be say two minutes long each time or ten minutes or whatever and you'll have some reusable pieces

188
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.460
you can use for each episode like intros and outros.

189
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:27.720
Even the graphics and music are pretty or usable with a video series you can deliver a consistent experience

190
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.390
each time meaning your audience will come to expect your videos and anticipate them before they arrive.

191
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.050
So consider how you can use these content types to your advantage.

192
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.940
Tutorials interviews companies stories case studies and listicle.

193
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.520
All right guys I'll see you in the next lecture.
