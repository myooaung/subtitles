00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.950
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:07.140
Now we spent the last few lectures of this SCA section of the course discussing the on page factors

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.310
such as pieces of code you can use to make your page rank higher for the terms you're using.

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:17.880
Specifically we mentioned title tags headers and an other formatting code you can use like bullets lists

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.920
and unordered lists.

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.430
Well nothing is more on page than the text on the page.

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.800
While there are a lot of ranking factors you could consider the quality of your content you're providing

8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.000
is really to be the most important factor.

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.240
You think about it all these other things like filling in HMO tags and using headers to structure content.

10
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.130
It's really all irrelevant when it comes to how good the actual content is.

11
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.680
Right.

12
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.500
Well we use this code to help pages look better and to help search engines better understand the content

13
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.530
but the better your stuff is well the easier it will be for humans and search engines to consume it.

14
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.440
Use it and therefore you know the Google God will figure that out and move it up.

15
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.230
So in other words running SE or friendly content really just means writing user friendly content.

16
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.240
So this lecture going go through some of the best practices you can use to make your writing as user

17
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.370
friendly as friendly as possible.

18
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.110
First off I want to talk about word count and we didn't mention is a little bit back in Content Marketing

19
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.940
now there been studies done that show that longer posts have a better chance at ranking higher on the

20
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.770
R.P. than shorter content.

21
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.560
A group called the R.P. IQ did an analysis in the top 10 ranking results on Google for various terms

22
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.330
and found that the top 6 results all averaged more than twenty three hundred words.

23
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.630
All ten averaged well over like 2000.

24
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.440
So generally experts must agree right that using 2000 words in a post is ideal and maybe it's even better

25
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.480
if it's longer right.

26
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.400
Well no there's actually no agreement on this.

27
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.730
There are plenty of posts that are 600 words long for example that rank really well for certain terms.

28
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.470
Well some companies on the other hand are going but by writing the pieces that are 5000 words or longer

29
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.120
and those are also performing well.

30
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.510
So the question is who in this situation is right.

31
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.190
Well probably both really all comes down to what you're writing about and who your audience is.

32
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.630
If your audience is a well-educated bunch of engineers you need lots of detail maybe 5000 words in a

33
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.220
post is best for them but for business marketers for example looking for tips on a speed up and on you

34
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.920
know an automated process and three easy steps.

35
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.280
We don't have all the time in the world to read thousands of words.

36
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.160
They need something quick and clear and accurate.

37
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.970
So we're accounts are actually going to vary based on what you're looking for.

38
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.870
Generally speaking when you look at search results you'll find that longer ones are up front.

39
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.510
However depending on what you're searching for the range could be wildly different.

40
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.340
We could be talking a difference of 200 words and all the posts or 500 words to 700.

41
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.590
Or are you talking about the differences.

42
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.930
You know 5000 to 6000.

43
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.550
Just consider what information people might be looking for what they might need and what would be most

44
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.050
helpful.

45
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.800
Now regardless of how long your post might be or who it's meant for each time you write you should always

46
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.370
think about the structure of your piece before you write it and it doesn't how long it might be.

47
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.370
How will the information be organized.

48
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.290
What kind of sections will it include or process.

49
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.110
Will it explain the writing a post for a cake recipe Let's say you want to give a short intro list the

50
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.570
ingredients then provide the steps in order so that the reader can follow along.

51
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.150
If you're running an opinion piece he might introduce the issue provide your take on it and then include

52
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.530
arguments to prove your point by figuring out how your piece will be structured.

53
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.360
You can also take advantage of those Hetter and list tax was discussed in the previous lecture figuring

54
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.100
out your sections and subsections makes it a whole lot easier decide where to put your tags to organize

55
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.120
sections and content.

56
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.860
Now how's this all sound so far.

57
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.120
Quality content counts most workouts going to vary.

58
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.440
Consider your audience and the structure of your piece.

59
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.890
In general longer pieces do better but that's within a range determined by what you're searching for

60
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.000
and who's looking for it.

61
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.770
The end of the day it all comes down to whether or not people are happy with what you write.

62
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.480
Anyway let's take a break here and cover some more tips in the next lecture.
