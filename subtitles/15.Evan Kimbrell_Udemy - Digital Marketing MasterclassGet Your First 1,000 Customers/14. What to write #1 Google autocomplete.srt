00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,190
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,720
OK so you know how important is to come up with great ideas for your content strategy.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,410
Yes.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,450
If you make stuff that just isn't anything special Well then this whole content thing might not really

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,200
work out for you probably should focus on one of the other growth channels.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,230
There's a common rebuttal I hear when I tell people hey just make something new and it's usually well

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,260
I'm not that creative so I can't come up with something new.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,460
And that statement I'm not creative therefore I can't.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,390
Let me just clear the air here once and for all is completely ridiculous.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,410
There's really no magic sauce to this.

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,050
If you're looking for some quick and dirty ways the generic content ideas look no further than Google

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,040
autocomplete.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,690
What's that you ask.

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,760
It's a secret section inside Google Analytics.

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,080
No I'm actually kidding.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,180
Is that thing where when you start typing in your search term and Google tries to autocomplete And guess

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,750
what you're trying to say try and give you suggestions.

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,330
That's it.

19
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,610
That's literally all it is.

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,560
And it's a fantastic way to come up with content ideas.

21
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,820
Here's how you do it.

22
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,820
Your customer will type a search into Google at some point and in the hopes of finding a company or

23
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,490
product like yours presumably remember people who aren't your customers you probably won't know your

24
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,430
name so they'll search using the most logical terms they can think of.

25
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,460
And this is where you can basically take advantage of it by creating content that corresponds to the

26
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,530
searches that they do.

27
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,530
Now first consider this question What do you make or do boil it down to a search term.

28
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,650
Don't dogs use your product name focus on a straightforward term without any branding on it you make

29
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,450
or provide a blank.

30
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,430
OK maybe it's photo editing apps means video production services maybe you give massage therapy whatever.

31
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,970
Just type it in as you do you'll start to see that auto completes forms this magic list before your

32
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,390
eyes.

33
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,460
But yes come on I know I know you've seen this a million times.

34
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,370
Now where exactly is the magic here.

35
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,590
Well Magic is a bit of a high bar to jump over but it will say goes after your term.

36
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:04,530
The word for F O R by doing this in Google Google thinks you're searching for that term for someone

37
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,690
or something.

38
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:11,610
The search will become a little more specific now and it can show you autocomplete for a specific audience

39
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,790
or problem.

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,660
Don't think about it.

41
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,920
You don't provide your product or service for everyone or every situation and if you do you probably

42
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,990
need to specialize.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,210
You probably focus on a certain audience or a certain purpose.

44
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,210
The former shows us what needs or audiences are most popular on Google you'll see autocomplete like

45
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:36,870
this photo editing app for musicians video production services for sports teams massage therapy for

46
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,660
neck pain.

47
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,160
Try a bunch of these and see what auto completes appear that are relevant to your business.

48
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,730
Now write them down somewhere and then let's move on because four is just one way to actually refine

49
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,550
your search and use autocomplete to help you.

50
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,260
All right so let's say you have an agency and you build apps himself and the clients just a service

51
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:55,780
business.

52
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,800
Well here's some Googles you could might actually want to try.

53
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,380
Let's try apps built with and then let's see what autocomplete gives us.

54
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,340
It'll probably tell us that people are looking for specific languages or frameworks you might see something

55
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,570
like apps built with Ruby who is Ruby if you don't know who Ruby is.

56
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,590
Don't worry it doesn't matter.

57
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,160
But that difference of adding the 4 is actually pretty important.

58
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:23,130
You can try photo apps that th 80 messaging apps that audio apps that whatever kind of app you make.

59
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:28,420
Add that at the end to see what type of specific need the users are looking for.

60
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,170
These are going to refer to features or requirements Taipan that don't and you'll see common problems

61
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,540
or issues that customers want to avoid or fix their apps.

62
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,290
And if you're getting a little stuck try this Protip.

63
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,790
If you put your cursor and type an extra space in the middle of a term Google will try to actually auto

64
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,400
complete the search right there in the middle of the sentence and not at the end.

65
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,400
It's pure magic.

66
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,560
So let's say you find a bunch of interesting relevant autocomplete.

67
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,460
How can you use them to actually write content.

68
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,630
Customer search for things for specific reasons.

69
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,000
Take massage therapy for neck pain.

70
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,110
Well it means people are looking for a solution either in the form of a service you offer advice you

71
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,390
give or techniques they can do themselves to reduce pain.

72
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:16,500
You could promote your therapy practice with ads sure but content with value makes a much stronger connection

73
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:22,270
blog post with steps to take or video showing techniques would make a lot more sense here.

74
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,410
They can show your expertise and maybe get them in the door potentially photo apps that are music apps

75
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,040
that don't tell you what customers want in an app or what to avoid.

76
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:39,320
Your app can help create a comparison table or a side by side image that proves you have what the competitors

77
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,890
don't call out the solutions and blog titles or social posts to get their attention.

78
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:50,430
Something like use X Y Z app to listen to music without Wi-Fi or without it crashing and that might

79
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,570
show your value.

80
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,910
One last thing I want to mention here Google autocomplete can give you a bunch of ideas worth keeping

81
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:57,440
for later.

82
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:03,010
But don't miss the opportunity actually check out the results of these terms now the top blog post in

83
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,250
articles should not be ignored.

84
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,440
So take a look at them and get more ideas from those top result.

85
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,240
You can also see if there's already 10 blogs on this topic that are done really well in which case maybe

86
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,770
that's not something you want to compete with.

87
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,060
All right.

88
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,150
Do you have the idea.

89
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:21,730
Google really has so much information it's kind of scary especially about what people are looking for.

90
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,110
The auto complete feature is like one of those best friends where the two of you can finish each other

91
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,820
sentences but who also helps you come up with content ideas.

92
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:36,460
So give the auto complete a shot you might look like an idiot just typing in random botched sentences

93
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,760
in Google but who's looking over your shoulder.

94
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,980
All right guys I'll see in the next lecture.
