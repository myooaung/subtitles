Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.000
All right, so let's take a quick set to work on finding
a list of communities that are going to be our
2

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.720
targets going forward. This is step two of our five
step process to rock solid abs. For a lot of you, this
3

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.970
is going to be obvious,
4

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.880
and for a lot of you, this will take
some thinking to get right.
5

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.240
Luckily, like I've said before, if it
exists, there is a subreddit for it.
6

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.020
So you shouldn't have too terrible of a time finding
your community. Once you find a bunch of subs, that's
7

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.230
when we'll start assessing whether
or not they're worth it, because
8

9
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.930
later in this section we're going to cover how
to slowly introduce yourself to the community.
9

10
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.420
If the sub isn't worth it, then it's not
worth the time to even get to that point.
10

11
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.320
OK, so you know what your business
does and what your product or service is.
11

12
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.810
Now, we need to define areas that are going to match this.
12

13
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.530
First off, try to think of some keywords that you're going to
use that you think will lead you to where you want to be.
13

14
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.990
First off, try to think of some keywords that you're going to
use that you think will lead you to where you want to be.
14

15
00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.290
I suggest being both literal and bigger picture. If you're
selling a procrastination mobile app, for instance,
15

16
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.530
you can go literal and say "procrastination" or you
can step back a little and go a little broader with
16

17
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.430
something like productivity, motivation, discipline,
self improvement, or even mobile apps.
17

18
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.570
The thing to keep in mind here - don't fret if you can't
think of a lot of descriptors that match your business.
18

19
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.410
The thing to keep in mind here - don't fret if you can't
think of a lot of descriptors that match your business.
19

20
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.400
We only need to find one and
then actually the rest is easy.
20

21
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.150
I will explain how this works in a second.
21

22
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.570
OK, so once you've taken all eight seconds to think
through your keywords, go to www.reddit.com/
22

23
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.210
/subreddits and search for some of these
where it says "Ready for something new?"
23

24
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.930
What this will do is suggest subreddits for you.
24

25
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.000
If I type in "procrastination," for instance, we get
a whole lot of things that I didn't even think about
25

26
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.330
that are definitely related. We see ADHD, sure.
26

27
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.900
that are definitely related. We see ADHD, sure.
27

28
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.640
Get studying, sure.
28

29
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:57.240
Deciding to be better, okay. Sounds like these people
might have procrastination issues. Some of them are
29

30
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.190
obviously junk, like subreddit "ffffuuuu"
which is a sound of frustration,
30

31
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.560
writing is also a bit too off,
31

32
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.540
AdviceAnimals really makes no sense,
32

33
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.720
I don't even want to get into what NoFap means.
33

34
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:09.950
I don't even want to get into what NoFap means.
34

35
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.850
OK, so open up a tab of one of the ones you pick and
copy the URL down somewhere so you can keep track.
35

36
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.910
OK, so open up a tab of one of the ones you pick and
copy the URL down somewhere so you can keep track.
36

37
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.180
If you think it might be worth it, just throw it in.
37

38
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.410
Copy the link address so you can
easily access them from your list.
38

39
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.390
After you've compiled the suggestions that makes sense,
39

40
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.160
try another one of your keywords, and keep doing that
until you've exhausted the suggestions and start
40

41
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.900
seeing repeats. After that,
41

42
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.910
I like to then take the same keywords
and input them into the search bar
42

43
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.510
that's right below it that says
"Search subreddits by name."
43

44
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.580
This way, we can catch any literal matches we missed
with the vague suggestion search, which is really kind
44

45
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.110
of hit or miss. When we do this one,
45

46
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.730
we can see all the sort of things
that we actually originally missed.
46

47
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.580
For instance, no procrastination, procrastination time,
47

48
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.590
non-zero day, which if you actually read the
description about it, it's about procrastination.
48

49
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.260
non-zero day, which if you actually read the
description about it, it's about procrastination.
49

50
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.270
Now, if you guys are still struggling to find subreddits,
50

51
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.770
try out these other two options.
51

52
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.580
One is to go to reddit.com/search.
52

53
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.370
Yeah, I know, curveball, but specifically, this searches
content, not the group title names. That actually
53

54
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.170
might get you in the right direction.
54

55
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.600
Also, pro tip, if you go to one of the subs you find,
most times on the right hand side you'll actually see a
55

56
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.800
Also, pro tip, if you go to one of the subs you find,
most times on the right hand side you'll actually see a
56

57
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.340
"other related subreddit suggestion" list and then
you're pretty much done. After that, if you still can't
57

58
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.110
find anything, try a site called Metareddit.com,
which does just a little bit better job of searching
58

59
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.650
and displaying subreddits.
59

60
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.390
OK, once you have your list, what I want you to do is
go and take a look at each of the subreddits you have.
60

61
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.600
Open them up in a separate tab if you absolutely have to.
61

62
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.660
What I want you to do right off the bat is to look at
the sidebar on the right, where it says the name
62

63
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.440
of the sub after the /r/.
63

64
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.930
Right below you'll see two different numbers.
64

65
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.890
The first is the number of people subscribed to the group and the
second is how many people in the group are currently active
65

66
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.630
The first is the number of people subscribed to the group and the
second is how many people in the group are currently active
66

67
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.630
at this very moment. This is the first thing we
need to gauge for where to apply our time.
67

68
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.240
Anything over 10,000 people I consider good.
68

69
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.000
Anything below 1,000
69

70
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.000
I usually throw away. Anything in the middle is
really just going to depend on your discretion.
70

71
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.770
Even if you have the most accurate sub in the world,
71

72
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.590
if it's only 200 subscribers, it's just
not going to be worth your time.
72

73
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.420
Secondly, look at how many people are active versus
the subscriber list, and that might help you make
73

74
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.880
the judgment call. If it's, say, 4,000, but 250 are active,
74

75
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.540
that means it's a very active thread.
75

76
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.850
If it's 12, on the other hand, out
of 4,000, it's not a very active thread
76

77
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.460
and you can use that as a tipping point.
77

78
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.870
There's no real rule for this.
78

79
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.350
Just get rid of the ones that have abnormally low ratios.
79

80
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.830
OK, so we'll take a second and clear
out our list on procrastination.
80

81
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.290
We can get rid of "no procrastination," because wow,
14 users, and only 2 are awake. "Self-improvement"
81

82
00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.480
is a winner, although it's got a low engagement ratio.
"Procrastination train" is obviously a no-go, too small. "Deciding
82

83
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.070
to be better" will do,
83

84
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:12.080
although, again, low ratio, and it looks like the others,
"ADHD," the discipline one, and studying, yeah, they
84

85
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.780
all look like healthy subs.
85

86
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:14.030
OK.
86

87
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.970
Now, after you've ruled out the ones
that are just too small or too unengaged,
87

88
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:25.030
we need to take some time to look to see if what people 
are talking about is, one, related to what we're doing,
88

89
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.320
sometimes you just misread the title or the community uses
the group in a different way than you actually expected,
89

90
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.100
sometimes you just misread the title or the community uses
the group in a different way than you actually expected,
90

91
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.330
or two, what types of posts are being posted there.
91

92
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.030
Is there a lot of discussion and people asking questions
or is it just a space for posting funny pictures,
92

93
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.930
like birds with arms? And then, of course, three, are the
topics being discussed something you know anything
93

94
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.060
about and could feel confident contributing to a discussion
about? Take some time to go through your list.
94

95
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.420
about and could feel confident contributing to a discussion
about? Take some time to go through your list.
95

96
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.670
The idea here is that we want to get the list down to, say,
three or four subs that are the right size and the right topic.
96

97
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.000
The idea here is that we want to get the list down to, say,
three or four subs that are the right size and the right topic.
97

98
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.910
More than that, and it's going to take too much
time and you might lose focus. After you look
98

99
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.250
at the sub for 5-10 minutes and scroll through the posts,
99

100
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.640
how do you feel?
100

101
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.960
Are they the same group of people you're trying to sell to?
101

102
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.110
Do you feel like you could comfortably contribute?
102

103
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.630
If it's yes and yes, then keep it on the list,
and let's move on to step number three.
