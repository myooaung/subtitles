Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,570
So what do I mean when I say raising your Reddit IQ?
2

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:13,010
I mean to say that if I just let all of you go and try
your best at making Reddit work for your business,
3

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,920
almost all of you would fail ingloriously.
4

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,150
Why?
5

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,400
Because if you haven't actually spent a lot of your
life living and breathing and scrolling through
6

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,400
online forums, you might not really fit in, so to speak.
7

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,330
Yes, it's true that Reddit's community
spans all types of people.
8

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,250
53% are male, the average age range is like 18 to 40,
9

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,770
53% are male, the average age range is like 18 to 40,
10

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:43,650
there are 80-year-olds and quadriplegics and celebrities,
obviously separate people, not all in the same
11

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,160
person, but they're all on there.
12

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,070
But Reddit as a whole has their own way
of operating and their own way of speaking.
13

14
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:57,420
Sometimes if you just learn these rules of conduct and the
vernacular they use, it's actually enough for you to blend in.
14

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,620
Sometimes if you just learn these rules of conduct and the
vernacular they use, it's actually enough for you to blend in.
15

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,280
So, generally, the first thing I suggest you do is go
to the first link in the resources called Reddiquette.
16

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,790
If you're one of those people that can't find the resources
section and are at risk of drowning in a bathtub,
17

18
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,550
then just google Reddit Reddiquette
or go to Reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette.
18

19
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,060
Now, here is where they lay out the
general global rules for the community.
19

20
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,420
Not every single one is set in stone, but checking your
behavior against this before you post can dramatically
20

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,670
increase your chance of success.
21

22
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,680
Now, the first thing you might notice scrolling
through that list is that most Redditors don't actually
22

23
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,850
follow all of these rules, especially in the category
of "don't accuse someone without proof" or "don't
23

24
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,580
downvote something just because you don't like it."
24

25
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,640
But c'est la vie, what can you do?
25

26
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,160
Just do your best to follow the rules the best you can.
26

27
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,540
Now, the main ones out of this list
27

28
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,580
I think that are worth pointing out,
28

29
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,890
there is a focus on being human.
29

30
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:02,220
Yes, I know, that sounds weird, as if you're like a robot
that's being asked to comprehend love, but what
30

31
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,510
they really mean is be conversational.
31

32
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:11,490
If you are talking to someone, how would you sound
versus if you were writing them an email or writing
32

33
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,340
an advertisement targeting them?
33

34
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:21,300
No, you would not say "There were a plethora of choices across
a myriad of options." Did I pronounce that right? I don't know.
34

35
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,230
No, you would not say "There were a plethora of choices across
a myriad of options." Did I pronounce that right? I don't know.
35

36
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,360
Unless, of course, you are just irredeemably pretentious.
36

37
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,760
So just because you're behind a keyboard
doesn't mean you're any less of a human.
37

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,100
Other key takeaways,
38

39
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,270
stay away from words associated
with clickbait, like "breaking."
39

40
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,130
Make sure you announce every time you edit something,
40

41
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,740
don't pick fights.
41

42
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,310
There are almost like a hundred things on that list, so
42

43
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,720
just scan through them.
43

44
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,510
OK, now let's talk a little bit about
how people speak on Reddit.
44

45
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,740
Every country has its own dialect,
45

46
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,520
every neighborhood has its own slang,
and Reddit is really no different.
46

47
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:53,760
All right.
47

48
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,840
So here is the 80:20 of Reddit slang so you don't
accidentally just screw it up the first time you try.
48

49
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,780
OP, which you might have heard me
actually say before, means original poster.
49

50
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,670
OP, which you might have heard me
actually say before, means original poster.
50

51
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,390
OP, which you might have heard me
actually say before, means original poster.
51

52
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:10,290
So when you're commenting in threads, it can get really
confusing as to who is referring to who. The person
52

53
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,170
who posted the thread, made the original post,
53

54
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,990
will forever be the OP.
Subs, you know what those are.
54

55
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,180
will forever be the OP.
Subs, you know what those are.
55

56
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:23,370
Not submarines, not metro stations, or that
sandwich chain that Jared betrayed our trust with.
56

57
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,340
It means subreddits, subcommunities,
always displayed as /r/ and
57

58
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,770
then the actual name. What are upvotes and downvotes?
Well, in Reddit, if someone likes your post, they
58

59
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,270
will upvote it, if they don't, they will downvote it.
59

60
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,980
Upvotes will move your post and your comment to
the top of the list. When you post or are looking at a
60

61
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,600
post, you can see on the side the
ratio of upvotes to downvotes.
61

62
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,290
post, you can see on the side the
ratio of upvotes to downvotes.
62

63
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,790
That's actually a fantastic gauge of whether or
not the community likes what's being posted.
63

64
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,020
Be aware, every single post will have downvotes.
64

65
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,940
It is just the way of Reddit.
65

66
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:05,920
Like the YouTube video of a paralyzed man learning
to walk again onto the beach into the sunset.
66

67
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:12,270
Yes, there are actually people who would downvote that
video. Karma is a fake currency that's used on Reddit
67

68
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,200
to show who posts and contributes
the best content and comments.
68

69
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,430
When you get upvoted you get one karma.
69

70
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,930
Your karma is then divided between your
post karma and your comment karma.
70

71
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,430
So keep this in mind.
71

72
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:30,810
Everyone can see your karma in both categories and
in which subs you received the karma in. Virtually
72

73
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,790
all users will use this as a barometer of how
seriously to take you when you post. More
73

74
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:42,550
karma means they're less likely to respond angrily or
negatively or call you out for something. Throwaway,
74

75
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,140
karma means they're less likely to respond angrily or
negatively or call you out for something. Throwaway,
75

76
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,490
this means an account used for the sake of being
anonymous and it's something that we will definitely
76

77
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,220
use, and people for the most part are OK with.
77

78
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:56,270
Next up, Xpost. An Xpost, this is a posting
that has appeared in multiple subs.
78

79
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:02,800
Sometimes this is fine and sometimes it's not, we'll
actually talk about it later. Linkjacking, this refers to when
79

80
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,260
you share a blog that merely covers a news story.
It's a bad tactic and they consider it kind of like
80

81
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,810
a cheap shot way of getting people to
your blog as opposed to the news story.
81

82
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,230
Don't do it, it's not a good idea.
82

83
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:19,960
Other terms very specific to Reddit, AMA, an AMA is a
thread where someone offers to answer any questions,
83

84
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,740
Other terms very specific to Reddit, AMA, an AMA is a
thread where someone offers to answer any questions,
84

85
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,600
it means "ask me anything."
85

86
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,130
Eli5 means a thread where someone asked a question
and wants you to explain it to them like they're
86

87
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:32,120
five years old, and not in the "you'll understand
when you're older" (you won't) way,
87

88
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,760
but in the "please make string
theory really simple for me" way.
88

89
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,160
but in the "please make string
theory really simple for me" way.
89

90
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,190
OK, that's a good starter kit of vocabulary for you to use.
90

91
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,540
Keep in mind, generic internet lingo, like IMO,
91

92
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,450
IRL, AFK, are all used, so brush up on that if you're rusty.
92

93
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:54,280
If you want to, and I suggest you do, because it's honestly
interesting, go to the other link in the resources
93

94
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,100
that has an exhaustive list of Reddit terms.
94

95
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:02,450
There are a lot in there that we didn't cover,
but God, there's no way to cover all of those.
95

96
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,230
OK, next lecture, onto the step two, where
we start looking for our communities.
96

97
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,810
See you then.
