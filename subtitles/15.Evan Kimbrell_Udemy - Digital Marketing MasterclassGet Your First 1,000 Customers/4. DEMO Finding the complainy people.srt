00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,920
Hey guys, welcome back to the course,
so in this lecture we're going to demo it.
1

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,770
Last lecture, we talked about finding
potential complaint customers.
2

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,570
So for those of you out there that are still a little
confused how this would look or how you would
3

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,700
do it, let's just do it with an example idea.
4

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,370
do it, let's just do it with an example idea.
5

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,150
OK.
6

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,020
So I'm going to make something up,
this was part of a startup competition
7

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,400
I was just in yesterday, I was a judge for it. Someone
pitched an idea for something, I'm going to say exactly
8

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,460
what it was, but it helped people transfer money to India.
9

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,040
OK.
10

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,080
So let's pretend that was our service.
11

12
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,470
That's not exactly what they're doing.
12

13
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,990
We have some servers that transfers money to India.
13

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,070
So typically that's going to solve the
problem that people can't transfer it,
14

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:50,400
probably, they're probably having trouble finding a way
to transfer it, or they just can't find a way to send back
15

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,220
wages or pay people in India.
16

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:53,920
I'm not sure.
17

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:01,410
So probably what I would do is focus on someone
complaining about transferring to India or "can't send
18

19
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,940
money to India" and I'll probably
see where that takes me. Okay.
19

20
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,460
So the first thing, remember, we just go to Twitter,
and right here in the bar we're just going to try a couple
20

21
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,540
of things. So I'm going to say "transfer to India."
21

22
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:15,950
of things. So I'm going to say "transfer to India."
22

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,460
I could say "can't transfer to India," let's see
what it says. Can't transfer to India.
23

24
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,580
But the reason why I might shy away from these is
because on Twitter you can only put 180 characters, so
24

25
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:32,530
long sentences like that might actually be broken
up because people have to save time, so
25

26
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,760
they might not say "two," they might
26

27
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,120
put the number, they might abbreviate
"can't" to CNT or something like that.
27

28
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,190
So we'll see.
28

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:47,740
OK, so off of that, we can scan through these,
and I can see two people right off the bat.
29

30
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,120
So one person is saying, "Can someone
volunteer to spare something something
30

31
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,400
transfer to India? Need to order something and I can't
make a payment from PK," I'm guessing it's Pakistan.
31

32
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,230
Whatever.
32

33
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:03,570
OK, so that was one, we would mark that one
down and we could reach out to that person.
33

34
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,590
It looks like we have another one. "Trying to
transfer money to India for urgent need.
34

35
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,480
What the, you know, you guys can't fix your
[...] online services for more than 48 hours."
35

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,660
Ah, that guy is complaining about another service.
36

37
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,390
Maybe you could swoop them up, talk to that person.
37

38
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,250
This guy's complaining again, "Both MG and PP
can transfer to India online, but WU can't?"
38

39
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,260
Western Union can't transfer to India.
39

40
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,520
I didn't know that actually.
40

41
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,520
So that's another person we could actually talk to.
41

42
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,620
Great. OK, three people right there
42

43
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,210
we could reach out to, those are some great leads.
43

44
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,750
Let's go back to the search bar.
44

45
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,110
Let's just try more broadly.
45

46
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,470
"Transfer to India."
46

47
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,990
See what that gives us.
47

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,850
OK, so let's see. We have one person advertising
a service that does that. Looks like a lot of people
48

49
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,620
are complaining about something
topical, something in the news.
49

50
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:01,650
So let's try something a little more broad. We'll just
try "transfer money to India" instead of "can't
50

51
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,160
transfer money," see what we get.
51

52
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:04,840
OK.
52

53
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,700
If one person looks like they're pitching their service,
we don't really want to go to those people.
53

54
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:16,320
Another person pitching. Here's one person
that is happy about their rate.
54

55
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,510
And you could potentially reach out
to the person, not necessarily a complaint.
55

56
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,050
And here we go, here's a complaint.
56

57
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,770
"Hello, @TransFastWorld,
57

58
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,680
how long do you take to transfer
money to India from Canada?
58

59
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,350
It's already 50 hours. Kindly respond." That person
is having trouble transferring money to India.
59

60
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:32,830
There you go.
60

61
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,240
There's another one. And it looks like another person
is roughly complaining, he's saying he could transfer
61

62
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,990
money between bank accounts in US
and India, but not true for all accounts.
62

63
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:46,070
You could maybe reach out to the person whether
or not they have an issue with one specific account.
63

64
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,120
OK, we can try again, and we can try something, now we have
64

65
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:56,290
I think five people. We could say "can't send," we'll just
say "send money to India" and see if that's broad enough.
65

66
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:56,830
I think five people. We could say "can't send," we'll just
say "send money to India" and see if that's broad enough.
66

67
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,330
OK, and this one is broad, but we can still pick out
some people. Looks like people are complaining about
67

68
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,830
Pakistan, can't ever search for India
without complaints about Pakistan.
68

69
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:15,270
This person says "We are facing a lot of trouble
sending money through the Maldives to India."
69

70
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,550
Still counts with sending money to India, that person
is complaining that he has a problem with it.
70

71
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,050
Here is another one.
71

72
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,730
"30 minutes on the phone to send money to India and
72

73
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,710
now I have to go into a branch to sign papers.
73

74
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:31,910
This process is broken." Very dramatic, but that guy
is a very good potential customer for our service.
74

75
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,690
We just grab 7 right there, and
I don't know how long that took me.
75

76
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,370
They only took me about five minutes
to do and we got seven people.
76

77
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:39,880
Great.
77

78
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,060
All right.
78

79
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,890
Now let's try the Reddit technique.
79

80
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,410
So remember it's site:reddit.com,
80

81
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,570
So remember it's site:reddit.com,
81

82
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:52,370
and then we'll use the same search
terms, "can't transfer money to India."
82

83
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:52,940
All right.
83

84
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:59,660
And looks like right off the bat someone started
a discussion about how they can send money.
84

85
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,410
This person wants to know the best
option, easiest, cheapest, best ways.
85

86
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,240
I mean, anywhere in here you could pitch them.
86

87
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,600
I mean, they probably are having
trouble, that's why they're asking.
87

88
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,520
Looks like someone here is asking "Why did it take 100
days to transfer money to India versus other countries?"
88

89
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,040
That guy probably has a problem.
89

90
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:26,290
Here's a person complaining they have PayPal restrictions,
probably trying to send money through PayPal.
90

91
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:34,390
Here's another person complaining about transferring
funds without any fees back and through India.
91

92
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:34,870
Here's another person complaining about transferring
funds without any fees back and through India.
92

93
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,810
That's another person who probably has a problem with it.
93

94
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,970
What you would want to do is just hop in here and read them
and see whether or not they do exactly fit your problem.
94

95
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:43,900
What you would want to do is just hop in here and read them
and see whether or not they do exactly fit your problem.
95

96
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:48,850
OK, this person is trying to send
$50 every month to his grandparents.
96

97
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:54,560
He's trying to figure out the best way
to do it is, he's concerned about fees.
97

98
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,770
OK, so that's a legitimate one, what you
could actually then do is reach out to them.
98

99
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,220
We cover that in the next lecture,
99

100
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,420
so stay tuned for that.
100

101
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,730
OK, and then the last one was just Google.
101

102
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,470
You know, I can just go back to here
and just drop this, and just go through that.
102

103
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,830
OK, and then just see what happens.
103

104
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:14,790
OK.
104

105
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,400
Here we go.
105

106
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,740
I mean, looks like on digitalpoint.com, some random
forum, someone is straight up complaining about
106

107
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,300
how you can't transfer money.
107

108
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,740
It says "from" India, but you could
probably find someone who is "to."
108

109
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,370
We have some people asking it on Quora.
109

110
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:34,690
Remember, Quora was one of the ones we mentioned
that's usually pretty good for this technique. "I can't
110

111
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,160
transfer funds." Look at all these people.
111

112
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,320
Tons of people just complaining, complaining, complaining.
112

113
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,190
We have quite a lot to work with.
113

114
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,150
It's only been like 8 minutes, and
look at all the possible leads
114

115
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,370
I have found. You could do this all day long.
115

116
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,780
All right, guys. Hopefully that demo helps
you kind of wrap your head around it.
116

117
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,620
See you in the next lecture.
