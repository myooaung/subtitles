00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.210
Hagar's Welcome back to the course so we are going to do the follow along section for topicality on

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.020
Twitter.

3
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.850
You guys remember how this works.

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.220
It's pretty simple.

5
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:18.060
What you want to do is you want to look for articles or blogs that have been shared or posted recently

6
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.130
that relate to your topic.

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.530
And then what you wanted to do is find the links for those then use Twitter search just to find people

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.050
who share those.

9
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.120
Now what kind of a key differentiator here that makes this work is that if you find an article that

10
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.680
somehow relates to that person having a problem with it or interested in it.

11
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.360
So a lot of people to share anything.

12
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.670
There's a lot of people who just share ten times a day.

13
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.730
But if you find something where.

14
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.510
So say if I'm doing how to come up with business ideas and I want to find an article that works for

15
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.900
that one I'd probably look for something that has to do with it being difficult.

16
00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.300
Here's ways of getting out of this difficult situation so they might share that because they've experienced

17
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.820
it.

18
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.330
They're in that situation or they've passed it so they have some type of relationship to it.

19
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.360
Now that's what I might do.

20
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.910
The product manager course I have or I might do the how to come up with business ideas.

21
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.070
It just depends.

22
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.780
Business Ideas only problem is when you're looking for a blog.

23
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.680
You might run into things that are older or don't necessarily represent them having a problem with it

24
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.990
but with become a product manager I could definitely find people who are posting blog posts or news

25
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.730
articles that are specifically about getting the job.

26
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.390
So I feel like don't want to be a little more on point.

27
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.000
So what we can try.

28
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.490
We just dip our toes and see how it works for how to get business ideas and see how that goes.

29
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:49.380
So first thing you always do go to Google and then what we'll do is my guess is that there is something

30
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.890
out there that's like a 101 business ideas or something like that.

31
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.180
So this idea is OK so there's a lot of these.

32
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.430
So my guess is anybody sharing one of these is probably interested.

33
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.010
And I know my message to any of these people is going to be like oh I did some of these in my video

34
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.160
or my course so I could do it.

35
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.890
News.

36
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.640
OK so there's a couple here like this Mashable link is pretty good so probably want to copy these down

37
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.650
I guess that's not super useful we'll go back to all of these are going to be just gold.

38
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.290
And Ryan Robinson My neighbor he also is a pretty popular post on this.

39
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.860
So small biz that he is for beginners that's perfect for me.

40
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.320
So you know there's real maybe some cross-pollination here where people who are sharing this might just

41
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.390
have an account that sells something to people who are trying to start a business that that's possible

42
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.850
but it could also be people who are trying to start their own business.

43
00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.640
OK so these are all kind of an angle of why people were trying to save money which is going to play

44
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.840
to our advantage or not.

45
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.200
So anyway here's Nashville one on point for shares.

46
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.180
Woo.

47
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.000
What we'll do is we'll just go straight to Twitter.

48
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.420
I don't actually think that we need to use Basim for this.

49
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.960
If I was doing a comprehensive sweep then you are totally opposed to the amount.

50
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.150
Do all of that but just for the purposes of doing this we can.

51
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:32.720
So pretty sure that everything this link is necessary now maybe not.

52
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.540
We got so one of the problems is that Twitter is going to convert this.

53
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.680
So what I might have to do is to site

54
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.150
nothing interesting.

55
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.930
So maybe what I need to do is just isolate this business idea.

56
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.400
You can launch for cheap or free so others do this because if they're directly sharing it it should

57
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.160
have that title right there.

58
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.670
OK.

59
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.020
There you go.

60
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.880
So that's one of the problems that you type in the link.

61
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.880
What'll happen is it.

62
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.780
No one has that links show up because Twitter automatically changes it to something funky.

63
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.750
What you can do and this is a little bit of a hack is you can take this link right here and then put

64
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:28.940
it in your tweet like that and then it's kind of obnoxious but you tweeted out it'll show you what the

65
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.110
condensed version looks like and then you can copy that.

66
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.560
So anybody who uses the automatic Twitter link sharpener will show up on a search for that.

67
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.240
So if I say I tweeted this out let's say it is like Twitter code slash x y z are you on I get for that

68
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.680
and find all the people that shared that one.

69
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.110
So all that automatically did that that would work.

70
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.990
So it just didn't work for me because I have a custom link shortening.

71
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.740
So that wouldn't work but this is something you guys can do if you're stuck anyway.

72
00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.410
And how will share this.

73
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:10.920
OK so 14 hours is not really so I think what's going to happen here is that some of these posts are

74
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.370
a little bit old and I get a little bit old in terms of like Mashable which means oh my god it's 10

75
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.390
days old it's ancient like a dinosaur.

76
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.730
But like for instance this guy is pretty good six hours crazed.

77
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:34.870
OK so what I can do from this is now make a list of people and I will do such a thing.

78
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.940
So I did this before in Excel but I use Evernote just way too much way too.

79
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.510
It's way easier for me.

80
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.140
So take these statuses

81
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.590
and then it just becomes manual grimed.

82
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.570
Now this is getting a little bit old but because it was 10 days ago.

83
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.550
But again they messaged and each time you respond.

84
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.320
So any time they get on Twitter they will see that you sent this to them.

85
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.910
OK.

86
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.560
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to get like five of these I think

87
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:24.700
go from there being ever if I wanted to focus more bang for your buck I would probably focus on people

88
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.790
who have more retweet or more comments because then what happens if I comment on this.

89
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.360
All these people that liked the post will get a notification.

90
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.930
But you know it's not going to be a huge difference.

91
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:44.290
Again guys run in the manual section so if you think that this is there's a faster way of doing this

92
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.550
like here is really no point optimizing it right now.

93
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:54.200
Bobby Moore interesting So a lot of times it'll happen is like Bobby Umar post and then he has three

94
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.240
read tweets.

95
00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:02.740
And then what I can do is like see this person tweeting it.

96
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.360
The question is just whether I can find the post.

97
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.970
Susan 17:3

98
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.620
shop Bhave.

99
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:14.380
There we go.

100
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.490
All right now I can comment on her retweet.

101
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.230
I should be able to see this.

102
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.610
Yes it would be pointed to her.

103
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.300
So this would actually work.

104
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:35.100
So I think that's enough to just kind of show you an example of how this works.

105
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:41.530
All right so what would I say in a message see when these guys back up my face.

106
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:42.620
I am a side hustler.

107
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:49.630
Billy my online business my from my closet my wife or kids I sleep in or.

108
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:55.940
So what I might say something like Did you find this useful useful.

109
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.310
I tried covering

110
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:11.110
it here and I will link to course

111
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.360
and

112
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.270
say something like harder said than done.

113
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:34.900
All right find practicality doing it are all

114
00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.230
sufficient.

115
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:39.070
Whatever.

116
00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.730
So I'm willing to sacrifice people.

117
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:49.050
I might copy paste but don't do it more than like four or five times because then all they can do is

118
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.300
look at your timeline and see that you're sending copy and pasted messages.

119
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.620
So it just lowers your chances of them responding.

120
00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:05.240
So you at list can I get rid of them as we go in Spanish.

121
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.010
I don't know if this is really going to work.

122
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.540
But you know see that cost me like three seconds of my life.

123
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.980
So it's worth stopping and saying oh maybe they can't read this.

124
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:17.550
Maybe they can.

125
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.360
I don't know why I don't know.

126
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.660
They're sharing something it's in English.

127
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.430
If they aren't always bilingual.

128
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:28.570
So I think my angle here is just going to be the whole like I did the real tactics.

129
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.920
No it's not entirely super intuitive.

130
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.330
We'll see how it works.

131
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.380
OK so we're just going to move through the list.

132
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.800
Power through it and then call it a day for this on.

133
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:42.120
OK.

134
00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.220
It's beyond easy starting a business for almost nothing.

135
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.650
But what businesses are guaranteed to make it MAY to make big money capital.

136
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.300
So that's one of my customers.

137
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:59.080
I might say just depends on the size of the idea.

138
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:11.480
Mr. You can shoot for your column for this whatever.

139
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:16.950
And then don't need to go back and get my link again.

140
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.250
Does this make sense.

141
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.110
I don't know.

142
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:26.370
Quintessence I mean on even nice name.

143
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:32.070
He's a social opener influencer thought leader helping B2B clients with social media.

144
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:37.170
I don't know why people call themselves influencers or thought we are that kind of seems counterintuitive

145
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:44.890
but we see it as

146
00:10:50.490 --> 00:11:07.670
same old.

147
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:14.590
He's an entrepreneur connecter founder of do failures run for OK.

148
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:20.930
Typically when I do this technique I try to avoid these people the ones who are it just because well

149
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.180
you know it just depends on your product.

150
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.620
You're just less likely to hear a response from them.

151
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.080
You go after people who don't have a lot of followers then you're more likely to get someone who's here

152
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.460
to respond.

153
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:39.730
So what I might do instead is like go after some of these people who retweeted it which is areally easy

154
00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.190
I mean they don't make this hard at all.

155
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.480
OK.

156
00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:51.660
So this guy this guy has a lot of followers but you can see the fact that his ratio of following to

157
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.650
followers just means that he's probably just using a bot.

158
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.380
Yeah.

159
00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:00.760
He has absolutely no engagements are going ignore this guy equally.

160
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:08.210
So one thing you'll notice is I think that the tweets are listed by how many do they bring to my followers.

161
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.610
A hundred percent sure I can do anything if I can't do it.

162
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:13.550
I know how to get help.

163
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:17.330
Ben Carson is blogging about Ben Carson fascinating.

164
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:29.380
OK so this guy looks like he is a master share pretty of an artist but now did you find that post was

165
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.830
right on the 17th.

166
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:38.990
From his from John Rampton.

167
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:40.150
Barack Obama.

168
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.370
So if you go farther down this is what I generally do.

169
00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.430
I just scroll all the way down and I just search for it.

170
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.280
So John you know and there you go.

171
00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:49.050
OK.

172
00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:54.220
So I can comment here and thrice the same thing.

173
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.240
I wasn't very impressed.

174
00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.030
With the list

175
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:10.560
I did some techniques

176
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.990
text me cause

177
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.710
you're interested

178
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.780
whatever.

179
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:30.020
OK.

180
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.980
OK.

181
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:37.100
Fatima and message maybe a couple more of these people.

182
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:39.240
She has 140 followers.

183
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:40.630
70.

184
00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.840
I'm looking for people with low amounts followers because I'm more likely to respond.

185
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.230
But then also I'm just making sure that they're active enough

186
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:49.460
so

187
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:53.720
all this

188
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.690
scroll down.

189
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.130
Like I said we should be able to find it.

190
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:13.920
From on Twitter you'll be lying to me since you retweet it.

191
00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.370
Maybe she just liked it.

192
00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.950
Maybe the retweet last year a little more strategic about it.

193
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:27.460
Of teacher Mm.

194
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.860
Now this person different patina.

195
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.220
OK

196
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:39.740
this personal that we read it or respond.

197
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:46.950
But I think Twitter is full of shit for these people are deleting their tweets.

198
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:53.190
It claims that yeah they retweeted it but then they retweet is not on their list.

199
00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.170
There we go.

200
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:54.950
Cool.

201
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.400
OK so

202
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:06.300
John I don't want to jump Rampton So I just want respond to her.

203
00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:14.750
OK so I can say the same thing listed by

204
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:38.470
semi-relevant and I think that probably going to do it for this technique.

205
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:45.570
So I will keep watching the coupon code that I've been saying out get your 10 and see if anybody uses

206
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.320
it to come through.

207
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:53.490
I can also watch the links to see if people are clicking it doesn't necessarily give me all the information

208
00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:54.180
I need.

209
00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.900
Again guys it's a manual process right.

210
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.930
So I just spent 15 minutes doing this.

211
00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:04.380
You could do it and just spend 30 hours doing it and after three hours depending on what you're selling

212
00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.340
it can be very easily the case that you get 10 customers.

213
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:12.630
If I'm selling something with a coupon at $10 and it's a chorus it's fairly ubiquitous enough that people

214
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:16.000
know what it is and it has its own promo video.

215
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:16.710
I mean they like that.

216
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:24.120
So I wouldn't be surprised if I spent two hours doing this that I'd get 10 customers and a hundred bucks.

217
00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.830
I really don't think it be terribly hard.

218
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:30.270
But anyway so that was an example of doing topicality on Twitter.

219
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.640
All right guys see the next dr.
