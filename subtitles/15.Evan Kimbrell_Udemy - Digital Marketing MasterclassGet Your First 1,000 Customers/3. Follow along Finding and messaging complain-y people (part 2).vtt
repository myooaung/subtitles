1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.420
It anyway so now that's a sufficient list.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.520
I mean I can do this pretty much all day.

3
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.710
You really just fishing.

4
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.050
So at this point what I do is I would go back to my Twitter list and just start messaging people.

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.620
So we'd start at the bottom.

6
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.330
So they're saying so excited coming up with new business ideas.

7
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.400
Can't wait to show what I've been working on.

8
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.960
I know it feels a little random kind of jumping into someone's conversation.

9
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.110
But what could you say.

10
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.890
OK so that's what I could probably say.

11
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.620
That's awesome.

12
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.680
The idea is it will work out in community of people coming up the ideas if you're interested.

13
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.020
So I mean I'm responding to them.

14
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.980
I'm not just doing a good templated nonsense but it's a little bit of a redirection.

15
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.650
So the Course has a community of people when we do share ideas.

16
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.200
I was just thinking maybe sincerity had the idea that's more appealing.

17
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.740
So we'll try that one.

18
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.830
OK.

19
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.070
Moving on.

20
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.750
See next one.

21
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.700
One coming up ideas new business ventures.

22
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.300
I asked my mentor to sit down to discuss every move step.

23
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.540
Interesting.

24
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.870
Probably something along the lines of like that's cool maybe or something.

25
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.680
And the interesting thing is I could just do something like lay him like this.

26
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:25.970
We tried this for self-promotional but then I could make it a little more personal.

27
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.060
All right.

28
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.100
So we are steadily moving along here.

29
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.540
That's to

30
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.130
writes this guy is talking.

31
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.510
He's good at coming up with ideas.

32
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:51.610
Kind of the reverse author what to get

33
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.650
on the room.

34
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:12.090
I am trying to make fun of them being like I'd love to hear your advice.

35
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.450
My base.

36
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.530
All right.

37
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.020
Moving along.

38
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.810
Coming up some new ideas for my business.

39
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.760
They certainly hope the all of K-Y Jelly have that work.

40
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.890
It gets

41
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.070
really

42
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.580
OK.

43
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:58.680
Here's one that's a legit complainer saying that problems with this so I'm so I'm Kreator when it comes

44
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.620
to coming up with ideas using a business partner or something.

45
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.050
NCM is self brainstorming

46
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.490
other easy ways to do it.

47
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.290
It's more science in art or just Petrou.

48
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.840
Not our Erica moving along

49
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.470
so in this one maybe I'll take a different tack being like do you have any advice.

50
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:46.150
Do you have any idea what to do with this group.

51
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.750
That's all things norming

52
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.710
together.

53
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.940
OK this is too old.

54
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.490
I'm just going to skip it.

55
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.610
Are we now worth it.

56
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.290
Well that will notify the person so

57
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.460
there's another complaining person so it is pretty on point.

58
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:48.130
So I'm just really going to piggyback this one decently for him and to have about 25 different

59
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.850
people have to work really hard to come up with ideas for things to make money.

60
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.660
I always try and mind my business and make my friends happy.

61
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.600
I know I know they are stocking up but she's not very active.

62
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:22.790
He used her to focus.

63
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.630
Maybe this will help

64
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.950
teen savvy ways turn bad business ideas into good ideas.

65
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.510
I might skip this one.

66
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.170
It doesn't really count.

67
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.300
I think you get the point.

68
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:49.660
I'm going hop over to read it a message to this person and he said all of his old post Business.

69
00:05:49.800 --> 00:06:00.900
Hey I thought all your is talking about are you talking about how to come up with business.

70
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:11.220
These use your I think it's super hard.

71
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.510
Just

72
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.270
lose

73
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.200
interest.

74
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.460
There you go.

75
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:35.230
And then basically I just make sure that he knows it's not like a copy paste message I'll just say like

76
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.500
message ever.

77
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.890
OK.

78
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.410
Now on the show.

79
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.840
So I'll finish out this list and we will pay attention and see if any of this works we'll see if the

80
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.390
traffic comes through any of the clicks.

81
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:58.360
Realistically you know I mean how long does it take me like 20 minutes to do the message like eight

82
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.890
people something like that.

83
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.290
And those are all pretty relevant.

84
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.620
Right.

85
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.470
And I'm depending on what I'm selling and how appealing it is.

86
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.070
It could be easily the case that you get a couple of sales.

87
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.030
I don't really know if I spent two hours doing this.

88
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.940
I could easily message 40 people.

89
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:20.830
OK so I'm going it a certain point I might run out of good options and I started going to worse options

90
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:26.070
but I mean you can really troll for this forever and we didn't even get into the third technique which

91
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.810
is just google searching you google search will find tons and tons of forums and other sites and commenters

92
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.910
and just really anything.

93
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:38.890
And then we haven't even touched any other social network so there's a pretty good example all monitor

94
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:42.320
the traffic and we you guys will see you later if that works out.

95
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:42.830
All right guys.

96
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:43.280
See you later.
