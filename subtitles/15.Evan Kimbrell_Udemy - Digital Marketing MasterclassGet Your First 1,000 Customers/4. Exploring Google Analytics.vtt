00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.980
Hey guys, welcome back to the course. Now that 
we've got the Google Analytics tracking code installed
1

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.350
on our site, we should start seeing
some data rolling in eventually.
2

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.810
Since there is no Carl and sadly, there are no creampuffs,
3

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.010
I'll show you what Google Analytics
looks like with one of my projects.
4

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.820
I'll give you a basic overview of the different sections 
before we dig into the concepts of goal setting
5

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.850
and origin sorting in the next two lectures.
6

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.910
Now, for those of you who skipped the last video,
you may already be familiar with the layout of Google
7

8
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.250
Analytics and you're probably totally confused about 
who Carl is and why I'm talking about creampuffs.
8

9
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.190
Well, don't worry about the creampuffs 
and also feel free to skip this lecture.
9

10
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.840
Please do.
10

11
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.520
Now, if you've never seen Google Analytics and their 
user interface before, well, brace yourself, because
11

12
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.630
you're going to see a lot of stuff and
it might be hard to take it all in.
12

13
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.780
You might even want to rewatch this afterwards 
and make sure you've got the basics down.
13

14
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.810
Rest assured, though, we're going to go into a lot more 
detail with Google Analytics later on in this course
14

15
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.530
Rest assured, though, we're going to go into a lot more 
detail with Google Analytics later on in this course
15

16
00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.110
when you actually have some data about people 
coming in to your site. So let's see what it looks like.
16

17
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.630
OK.
17

18
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.930
So when we head over to analytics.google.com, again,
assuming we're logged in we have it set up, it will look like this.
18

19
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:06.970
So when we head over to analytics.google.com, again,
assuming we're logged in we have it set up, it will look like this.
19

20
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.680
Now, depending on when you guys are watching this,
20

21
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.520
this user interface could look different, because 
they change it all the time for no reason,
21

22
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.110
but in general it's the same thought process,
22

23
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.980
and if they move it from one tab to another,
it just takes an extra 5 seconds to find it.
23

24
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.190
You'll see a list of all the projects where you have the 
Google Analytics tracking code snippet installed.
24

25
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.910
If you're new to Google Analytics, you'll only see one 
project, like the one we did last lecture for Carl's creampuffs.
25

26
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:30.570
If you're new to Google Analytics, you'll only see one 
project, like the one we did last lecture for Carl's creampuffs.
26

27
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.970
We're going to check out the data for 
my most recent project, 25 days of ideas.
27

28
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.160
This was just a fun video project I made around 
Christmas and it was like an advent calendar counting
28

29
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.490
down to Christmas. For every single day
29

30
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.390
we had a video going over a way 
to come up with business ideas.
30

31
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.030
Now, you can see up here that the date range 
always is going to default to the past 30 days.
31

32
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.170
Then below you can see some high level data.
32

33
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.570
Yes, I am aware that I alternate between 
data and data, I don't know why I do that.
33

34
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.420
You'll see things like number of sessions, which is how 
many times the site loaded on someone's screen in
34

35
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.400
the past 30 days.
35

36
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.370
It counts it, if someone opens your site 
twice, then it's going to count twice.
36

37
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.990
It's not about uniques. It's also going to show you things 
like average session duration, which is how long people
37

38
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.990
stayed on the site during each session, bounce rate,
which is the percentage of people who loaded only one
38

39
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.370
page and then moved on to some 
other website or closed the page.
39

40
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.120
One thing I'll note about bounce rate is that different 
analytics tools will calculate this differently.
40

41
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.330
Google has a very specific way of doing it.
41

42
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.850
They generally look for people that only look at 
one page and leave within a certain period of time,
42

43
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.340
so if they go to your page and 
they're on there for 10 minutes,
43

44
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.310
but they didn't click through to anything 
else, then it's not considered a bounce.
44

45
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.820
Then finally we have goal conversion rate, which is obviously 
0%, because, well, I'm lazy and I never really set it up.
45

46
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.360
Then finally we have goal conversion rate, which is obviously 
0%, because, well, I'm lazy and I never really set it up.
46

47
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.400
Now, goals can be set up to track how many 
people, let's say, reach a certain page on your site.
47

48
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.490
They can be useful for tracking things like, I don't know,
how many sales you receive or how many people
48

49
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.550
sign up, and things like that.
49

50
00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.870
We're actually going to go over it in the next lecture, 
so it's actually really, really important, especially for
50

51
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.460
websites where you're selling something.
51

52
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.730
Now, we continue our tour and we click on "All website 
data" to get to the meat of Google Analytics - and
52

53
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.260
brace yourself, because it's a little overwhelming at first.
53

54
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.480
Well, here goes nothing.
54

55
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.490
OK, so Google Analytics always dumps you right into 
the Reporting tab into the Audience Overview section.
55

56
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.890
You can see Audience and then Overview in bold here.
The Audience section is where you go to learn more
56

57
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.570
about the people visiting your site.
57

58
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.030
Things like where they're located at, what languages 
they speak, what type of technology they
58

59
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.120
use, as well as things like how often they visit your site 
and what they do when they actually get there.
59

60
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.040
The first most obvious thing you'll see on the page
is this little squiggly graph. As you can see, it's
60

61
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.550
showing us the amount of sessions 
per day for the past 30 days.
61

62
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.920
You can hover over different days to see 
the number for that particular day.
62

63
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.150
You can see the same sessions number we saw in the
last screen. Then we can see Users, which is going
63

64
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.430
to be a lower number, because it's unique. That's because 
there are some users with multiple sessions, meaning
64

65
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.030
they came to the website more than once in the past month.
65

66
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.150
Especially with this website, that was kind of the point,
I wanted people to keep coming back to it. After that,
66

67
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.550
we see Page Views, which is different than Sessions.
67

68
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.230
This is why it's important to have that tracking code
in the header of each page, because then Google
68

69
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.510
Analytics will track how many pages everyone 
viewed across your entire website.
69

70
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.540
You notice this number is slightly higher than the 
sessions number, and that's because some people viewed
70

71
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.480
more than one page, assuming you have more than one page.
71

72
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.590
Now, this leads us right into the next number, which
is Pages Per Session, which is just the number of
72

73
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.750
page views divided by the number of sessions.
73

74
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.770
Pretty straightforward.
74

75
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.780
Next step, we're going to look at Average Session Duration 
and Bounce Rate, which are the same as the numbers we saw
75

76
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.190
on the opening screen.
76

77
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.330
Why are they listed twice? I don't know.
77

78
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.130
Why are they listed twice? I don't know.
78

79
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.330
Then there's Percentage of New Sessions, meaning 
of the people that came to your site within a given
79

80
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.710
period of time, how many of those people 
have never seen your site before?
80

81
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:55.050
Now, this is an estimate, because Google isn't 
perfectly able to track this, but in general it's decent.
81

82
00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.360
For example, you can visit a site, then clear your 
browsing history in cookies or switch browsers, then visit
82

83
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.170
the site again, and Google wouldn't know. One thing 
that's very specific to Google is that they track with
83

84
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.600
cookies, and cookies can be cleaned.
84

85
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.290
If you're ever curious what a 
number means in Google Analytics,
85

86
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.040
here's a quick pro tip.
86

87
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.110
Lots of times when you hover over things, Google will 
actually pop up with something to tell you more about it.
87

88
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.340
Lots of times when you hover over things, Google will 
actually pop up with something to tell you more about it.
88

89
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.930
Like, here we see it says Percentage of New Sessions 
means, and it pops up, "An estimate of the percentage
89

90
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:22.950
of first time visits."
90

91
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.780
Well, there you go.
91

92
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.980
So, when in doubt, hover.
92

93
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.700
Now, that same percentage of new sessions
data is displayed in the pie chart.
93

94
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.960
Mmm, pie. Now, the pie chart is just a way of visualizing 
the same information - depending on what you're trying
94

95
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.580
to figure out, different visualizations can help you 
get there. Down below that, we can slice and dice
95

96
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.750
the data in different ways.
96

97
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.180
Like, for instance, language. You can see most of my 
traffic comes from English speakers, which makes sense.
97

98
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.480
Next, we can check out country.
98

99
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.220
Not surprisingly, the U.S. is number one, because 
apparently we're great at being America.
99

100
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.370
Then we can look at browser, Chrome here,
100

101
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.910
you can tell it's obviously in the lead.
101

102
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.380
And thank God Internet Explorer
is dying a slow and painful death.
102

103
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.030
And then for mobile users we can see what kind of 
smartphone they're using, if they're using an iPhone
103

104
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.480
or an Android when they came 
and looked at it. Aaand, holy ***!
104

105
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.300
Someone actually looked at my site on a Blackberry.
Apparently my site went back in time to 2006.
105

106
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.950
Now, all that information will be useful for figuring out who's 
visiting your site and how best to serve them going forward.
106

107
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.190
Now, all that information will be useful for figuring out who's 
visiting your site and how best to serve them going forward.
107

108
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.680
If you have a ton of visitors who speak Spanish, well, 
maybe it's a good idea to give them an option to change
108

109
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.270
the language on your site.
109

110
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.730
If most of your mobile traffic is coming from people 
on Blackberries, then you should develop your site to
110

111
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.030
look good on the Blackberries.
111

112
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.720
And I would love to check out your time machine.
112

113
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:40.800
Okay, so I know that was a lot already, so I'm going 
to briefly go over this stuff here on the side and
113

114
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.350
then we'll go into more details 
in a couple of lectures from now.
114

115
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.470
So each one of these icons represents a different section.
115

116
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.680
You can click on them to expand and collapse them.
116

117
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.190
I'm going to do a quick rundown of each of them so you can 
at least have a general idea of where things are. At the top
117

118
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.270
I'm going to do a quick rundown of each of them so you can 
at least have a general idea of where things are. At the top
118

119
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:59.580
we have the dashboard. Now, this is where some people 
first go to check on things, because they can create
119

120
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:05.580
different reports and display a bunch of them all in one 
spot. By default, there are a bunch of pre-populated
120

121
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:11.000
charts and graphs, like New Users, Users, what 
country people are in, and all sorts of other stuff.
121

122
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.350
These are customizable however you want.
122

123
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.850
The idea is to give you a high level overview of things
so you can see them all at once with a quick glance.
123

124
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:18.450
The idea is to give you a high level overview of things
so you can see them all at once with a quick glance.
124

125
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.810
Next up, we have Shortcuts and Intelligence Events.
125

126
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:27.060
Now, I won't bother showing you these, because I 
don't have either one set up and it's a little hardcore
126

127
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.170
for what we're trying to do, but the gist here is that you 
can save any custom report you create as a shortcut
127

128
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:31.770
for what we're trying to do, but the gist here is that you 
can save any custom report you create as a shortcut
128

129
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.430
so you can easily find them again.
129

130
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.910
I'm not even sure what intelligence events are, but 
by no means is it a reflection of my intelligence.
130

131
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:43.260
Basically, both of these are more advanced 
features we don't need to get into right now.
131

132
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.400
Now, the next one down is Real Time. As its name implies,
132

133
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.220
this one shows what's going on in your website right now.
133

134
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:54.210
It can be fun to look at when you're getting decent
traffic, although not really sure how useful this
134

135
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.650
is at any given moment.
135

136
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.830
Google Analytics is most useful as a tool 
for figuring out what happened in the past.
136

137
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.390
So you can use that information to make your 
site and your marketing better in the future.
137

138
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.680
Google Analytics in general has a delay.
138

139
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.750
So a lot of times people will be on your site now,
139

140
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.390
they won't put that into your data
for at least 24 hours. Anyway,
140

141
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.270
let's go back to the audience overview, where we 
started to check out some of the other things in the
141

142
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.460
Audience section. Over here on the side,
142

143
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.770
there are tons of other things, some of 
which are more useful than others.
143

144
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:25.200
Many of them are just a deeper dive into the stuff 
on the Overview page, but there's some interesting
144

145
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.630
stuff in here that could be useful, like 
demographics, geography, behavior, etc.
145

146
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.710
Also, the Users Flow section is interesting.
146

147
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.210
It shows a visual of how different users 
navigated through your website.
147

148
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:41.250
Click that dropdown menu and you can pick just about 
whatever parameter you can imagine and it'll show them
148

149
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:47.760
as the first column and then show you where those 
users are going on your site and where they were when
149

150
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.870
they left your site.
150

151
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.650
Now, that can potentially show you weak parts of 
your site where people are routinely getting to and
151

152
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:56.850
then leaving. Maybe it's on the thank you page after 
they placed an order, which would be great.
152

153
00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:01.140
But maybe it's the checkout page, which could be an 
indicator that there's some room to improve that page.
153

154
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.040
But maybe it's the checkout page, which could be an 
indicator that there's some room to improve that page.
154

155
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.810
Next up is the Acquisition section, and this is where we'll see,
155

156
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.610
yep, you guessed it, where your traffic is coming from.
156

157
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.640
It'll show you how many people came through 
various channels, like direct, social, referral,
157

158
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.880
and organic search.
158

159
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.910
Now, this is what we're most interested
in during this section of the course.
159

160
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.540
We'll be digging deeper into this part in just a bit.
160

161
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:20.700
Just stay tuned.
161

162
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.440
This is also the section where you go to see what users 
you advertise to on Google AdWords are doing once
162

163
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.360
they land on your website, although I'm not doing that
at all for my website right this second. And there's
163

164
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.250
another section here for all the things social, 
like Bookface and the big blue bloated bird.
164

165
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.580
Anyway, moving on down a bit, we see 
on the side a section called Behavior.
165

166
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.460
Now, this is where you go to learn more about, not 
surprisingly, how people behave on your site. Want to
166

167
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.380
figure out what your most popular blog post is? Go here. 
Want to find the most popular search term people
167

168
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.720
typed into the search bar on your site?
168

169
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.790
Well, go here. Again,
169

170
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.830
here's another cool visualization 
section called Behavior Flow.
170

171
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.730
Now, this one changes up the information a bit from
the one we saw in the Audience section of Google
171

172
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.510
Analytics. Instead of starting with something like 
the country your users are in, this one starts with
172

173
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:09.880
things like what page people started on, which is more 
commonly called a landing page, and then shows
173

174
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:14.160
you how the users that started on those individual 
landing pages went through your site.
174

175
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:19.900
For example, here's where you would see some different 
blog posts people landed on directly because they
175

176
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.380
saw them on Twitter or Facebook or something like that.
176

177
00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.270
Well, what can people do on the blog post page?
177

178
00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.680
They can just close it, which is called a bounce, like 
we talked about earlier, or they could click over
178

179
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.860
to the home page to learn more about it,
179

180
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.020
what your site is all about,
180

181
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.630
or they could sign up for your e-mail list, or they 
could click on a link in the article that leads to
181

182
00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:42.820
another article, or any other number of things. This can help 
you figure out where people are going throughout your site.
182

183
00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.360
another article, or any other number of things. This can help 
you figure out where people are going throughout your site.
183

184
00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.010
Now, last but not least is the Conversion section, and this is 
where setting up goals for your site really comes into play.
184

185
00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.060
Now, last but not least is the Conversion section, and this is 
where setting up goals for your site really comes into play.
185

186
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:53.550
But, like I mentioned at the very beginning, I never 
set up goals for the 25 days of ideas, because I'm
186

187
00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.020
a lazy bastard and I wasn't sure 
what my goals would have been.
187

188
00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:00.970
But, as I said then, goals can be really important for 
figuring out what users are doing on your website
188

189
00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.520
and can even help you find areas 
where you can improve your site.
189

190
00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:10.390
The next lecture is all about goals, how to set them 
up, and what you can learn after they are set up.
190

191
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:14.710
Now, I know this lecture is a bit of a beast, especially if 
you're unfamiliar with Google Analytics beforehand.
191

192
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:19.900
And we went through it really fast, but trust me, it will 
all eventually make sense, especially with practice.
192

193
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:24.580
Google Analytics is definitely not meant to be pretty,
since Google is basically like your nerdy cousin
193

194
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:29.920
who still wears Velcro shoes as an adult, because they're, 
you know, so much more efficient. Just start poking
194

195
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.260
around once you see some data coming into your site,
195

196
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:37.300
hover over stuff, and try to translate Google's nerdy 
explanation for things or just, you know, post in
196

197
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.720
the Slack group, where the other resident 
nerds are, and we can try to help you out.
197

198
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:41.890
Anyway, guys, moving on.
198

199
00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:42.860
See you in the next lecture.
