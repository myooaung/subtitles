00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,910
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus and to the brand new section search engine marketing also known

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,170
as SVM.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,900
Now this point you should be familiar with SEO or search engine optimization and you already probably

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,960
know about many of the strategies involving keywords.

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,090
There's a lot of overlap.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,290
Etzion se.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,530
Now maybe you're writing articles and posts that focus on keyword phrases or specific questions.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,150
People might search for on Google if you're using keywords and optimizing your site and pages with code

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,250
and other attributes of covered then your efforts are probably off to a decent start.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,720
Here's the thing with SEO as SEO is a long term game and it's a long term game even to see the first

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:47,550
results getting your page ranked for a decent lead traffic keyword and getting it ranked they like number

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,110
one.

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,860
That usually takes months.

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,920
Unless your keyword is just insanely specific and the reason why not just take so long is because well

15
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,170
it's the organic way right you're not paying any money.

16
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,300
I mean sure you're paying money to maybe hire someone to write content for you or to do link building

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,420
for you but you're not paying Google anything.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:14,620
Now the alternative option is search engine marketing and it has benefits that are different than SCA.

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,280
No SC like you said it takes WAY long time to even show up.

20
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,950
But SDMI on the other hand you can actually just pay money and then show up at the top of a search result

21
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,180
paid search efforts help you skip the line and then go straight to the top of the search pages.

22
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,590
Well I'll see sometimes Now that's what SC him and the next section are all about.

23
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,050
Now to understand SCMP you need to understand how Google's paid search advertising platform works and

24
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,520
that is called add words.

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,230
Edwards allows you to place bids and then eventually pay to have your ads featured on specific search

26
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,290
result pages that match the keywords you're targeting.

27
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,670
Now your ads could be text based like the ones we see at the top of search result pages.

28
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:57,300
They can also appear as banners if you get a actual graphic done and you'll see those on web pages or

29
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,470
it could be some kind of hybrid where you might see it show up specifically on phones at a much smaller

30
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:04,980
format.

31
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:10,380
However just as Google tries to show the best and most relevant search results in its organic results

32
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,690
on its SEPs member search engine result pages.

33
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,230
Google also tries to match users with the best ads so no matter how much you might pay to advertise

34
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,340
you still need to understand the most effective ways to create your ads.

35
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,010
And that is something that we're going to cover in the section.

36
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,350
So in the end you can use what you've learned about Google Adwords and paid search and then apply many

37
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,610
of the same principles to things like social advertising as well.

38
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:41,490
Facebook ads in particular are pretty popular and for certain businesses and certain advertisements

39
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,810
can be pretty effective.

40
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,160
So by the end of the section you'll have a lot of ideas about how you can use paid efforts to quickly

41
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,030
reach the audience you need across multiple kinds of platforms and devices.

42
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:58,920
One thing worth pointing out is that ACM is in a sense like a CEO and that in order to master it it

43
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,070
takes a long time.

44
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,370
However you can start seeing results as soon as today.

45
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,880
Right so with CEO we have a long let's say six month plan and by the end of six months you could easily

46
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,920
be number one page rank with SVM you can show up tomorrow however its going to be pretty optimize and

47
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,510
over time you can have to go through a trial and error process to really get something that works.

48
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,740
Search Engine ads don't work for all businesses.

49
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,770
OK sometimes they are really expensive.

50
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:31,860
Sometimes your keywords are just way too saturated and too many other people are trying to advertise

51
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,400
for them.

52
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,580
So in a lot of cases its not going to seem feasible at first but again over time you may find that with

53
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,670
some optimization and some tweaking of your strategy you can actually find a niche that works for you.

54
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,990
The same thing goes for social ads and we're only going to focus on Facebook ads in this section but

55
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,670
it's kind of the same principles you can put something up tomorrow start getting traffic see how it

56
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,140
actually how the traffic responds and if they convert.

57
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:02,400
But then over time you get to slowly start iterating on it and eventually after a couple of months and

58
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,330
a couple rounds of iteration you'll probably have figured it out.

59
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,150
Anyway guys I hope you enjoy it and I'll see you in the next lecture.
