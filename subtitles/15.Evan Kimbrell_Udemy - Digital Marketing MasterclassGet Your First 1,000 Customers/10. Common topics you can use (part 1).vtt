00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.330
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.010
Now in the last lecture we talked about common content types.

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.850
Those are some of the popular formats like listicle interviews and ultimate guides and those are the

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.920
proven ways to present and structure the stuff you write.

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.110
But also a good Quickstart Guide to Getting something out there.

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.070
But now we need to talk about what you're going to write about and in order to be successful in that

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.950
there are two things that we need to take into consideration.

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.490
First thing is category and the second thing is scope.

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.310
Now your category is going to be the subject matter that's relevant to your audience.

10
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.330
This is what they want to hear about.

11
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.100
By this point you should have a pretty solid idea of what your category is.

12
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.610
Take the example of that hardware store Lowe's its home improvement store they sell building materials

13
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.650
kitchen appliances and all kinds of tools for the home.

14
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.120
They create content about Home Improvement and all that seems kind of obvious.

15
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.490
That's the point.

16
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.080
But what if your category isn't that obvious if you're an app that say finds the Close's yoga class.

17
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.280
What exactly is your category.

18
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.020
Well you could choose in this case yoga and talk about yoga things but you could also go a similar categories

19
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.120
just like healthy living or spirituality.

20
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.860
It's going to help you decide which category you're going to tackle and if you're going to mix and match.

21
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.900
Just make sure if you are indeed going to cover say spirituality that is in line with how you see your

22
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.820
business and it's in line with what your customers care about.

23
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:38.580
Maybe your type of yoga doesn't necessarily lend itself to the crowd that also needs spiritual advice.

24
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.150
So knowing your category is one part of figuring out your topics your scope on the other hand.

25
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.690
Yes I can say other hand refers to how much within a category you're going to cover.

26
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.720
You want to write about as many relevant topics as possible within your category.

27
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.950
That's what we call a broad approach to scope.

28
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.820
Sometimes you want a broad approach if you know that you have a wide range of customers coming from

29
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.590
many different industries.

30
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.020
Let's go back to that Lowe's dotcom example.

31
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.040
Their audience includes a range of people interested in home improvement topics but they could be home

32
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.110
owners needed to fix things or do it yourselfers working on a new project.

33
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.230
The Lowe's blog includes tons of tutorials with relevant topics things like electrical repair window

34
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.180
installation lawn care how to install shower tiles you name it.

35
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.120
Their scope is broad because their customers are a wide ranging group of people and the customer needs

36
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.170
to cover a wide range of information.

37
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.460
But if you're thinking yeah I don't want to write about a ton of different things or I don't have the

38
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.790
time nobody else is helping me write this stuff.

39
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.580
I need something more focused.

40
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.960
That's totally cool.

41
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.190
Stead of a broad approach you can go with a narrow approach.

42
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.070
All that means is that within your category you're going to focus on just a few specific items or concepts.

43
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.470
If a broad approach is like a food court at the airport with every possible type of food imaginable

44
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.090
the narrow approach just like the food truck on the street that only sells Korean BBQ.

45
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.490
That's their focus.

46
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.310
They're awesome at it.

47
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.180
And now I'm hungry.

48
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.920
Forget food for a second and let me show you an actual example of this.

49
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.430
There are company companies here well we're going to talk about them again.

50
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.280
They're a productivity tool that helps people connect popular softwares together so they can share data

51
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.100
and complete commands in unison or to put their apps in sequence whatever.

52
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.960
Here has a content strategy that is very focused.

53
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.170
If you go to Zafira dot com It's spelled like rapier but with a Z.

54
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.710
Yeah I know that didn't really help anything at all so just put it on the screen go to the blog section

55
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.540
and at the top of the blog page you'll see the following be the first to hear about the best apps in-depth

56
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.460
productivity gadgets and tips to grow your business while their customers might come from a wide range

57
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.240
of industries.

58
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.800
Appier is choosing to focus their content ever on a narrow range of topics.

59
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.790
So how exactly do you choose between a broad and a narrow scope.

60
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.890
You have to review your customer needs and consider how many of them you intend on supporting through

61
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:05.750
your content.

62
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.980
Member Lowe's home improvement if you forgot is impressive because like three minutes ago their customers

63
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.810
are coming to them in search of a broader range of products for their home with a broader range of needs.

64
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.960
So it makes sense that blows uses a broad content strategy to satisfy them.

65
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.830
The other hand Zopyrus focus is that there are a productivity app and therefore customers are coming

66
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.130
to them to help with productivity.

67
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.090
They might also have other needs outside of that like marketing or finance or shipping.

68
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.720
But these needs are largely irrelevant to Zappia because they're out of their scope.

69
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.430
Xavier wants to focus on productivity with their content and it's a narrow scope and well it works for

70
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.770
them.

71
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.200
OK so let's talk a little bit about your market and its saturation.

72
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.700
Now you might ask What if someone already covers my topic in depth and they have a lot of content already.

73
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.500
If there are popular blogs mini sites video series or even books about topics you want to cover.

74
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.220
That's actually a good thing and I know it's counterintuitive what that means is that there's already

75
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.020
an established audience out there consuming and actively looking for this information.

76
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.040
They really don't really worry as if absolutely nobody is covering the topics you want.

77
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.550
A lot of people worry about being unique and that's fine but be unique in the way you write about these

78
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.450
topics not by choosing a topic no one cares about and no one is searching for.

79
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.150
OK so we've got our category and we've got our scope in mind to move forward with this.

80
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.750
I think we should write these down because it's going to help us come up with topic ideas for our categories.

81
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.510
Go ahead write it down type it into Google Docs spreadsheet or whatever you chose put it down somewhere

82
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.250
so we can refer back to it as we move forward.

83
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.610
Once you've got your category written down somewhere you should go out and see what others in that category

84
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.790
are writing about you know get a sense of what people are talking about in your space right now if you

85
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.750
are close you go to Google and you search for home improvement blog if you're Zappia or you probably

86
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.310
go and search for productivity blog.

87
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.540
You can try other combinations too to look beyond blogs.

88
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:12.110
You can do basic things like Hoban movement tips or productivity checklists search or things that you

89
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.750
think your audience would actually be looking for.

90
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.670
So let me go to Google now and let's just do that let's just type in home improvement tips for writing

91
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.170
content for Loew's I'd search for this and see what other people are doing.

92
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.700
OK one of the top results is a post from lifehacker which I know from checking out their site before

93
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.320
that they have a very broad content strategy scope.

94
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.520
They write about home improvement but also things like Hak and your home with smart tools how to pay

95
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.280
bills that are really just all sorts of things that feel like shortcuts and feel like hacks.

96
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.350
Their scope is beyond where I want to go.

97
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:50.060
You might find good home improvement articles from them but I'm more interested in a site that has my

98
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.400
same focus.

99
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:57.170
There are a few spots down from them I can see home tips come home improvement ideas and answers you

100
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.880
can trust.

101
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.760
Well that sounds closer to what I would create if I were close.

102
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.330
Let's cook in here and let's see what's up.

103
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.540
All right.

104
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.690
So right at the top I can already see that this is promising.

105
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:12.860
Their menu list lots of the same category as at Lowe's sells appliances heating and cooling stuff plumbing

106
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:18.920
electrical equipment plus above that in the blue section they've got some content types buying guides

107
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.660
how things work how to articles.

108
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.770
So it's like a pretty good match of our clothes.

109
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.200
So I'm going to bookmark this site just come back to it later and I have some time to really dig in

110
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.270
the articles.

111
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.250
For now I'm just making a list of sites to get started.

112
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:37.690
Here's another tip I suggest it can be helpful to you if you subscribe to the emails from these Web

113
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:38.240
sites.

114
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:43.370
When you're busy and you don't have time to do the research they just email their stuff right to you.

115
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:49.040
Plus if they're a competitor it's a good idea to keep in mind what they're covering and see what they're

116
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.700
up to.

117
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.930
It won't take you very long after going through their stuff to get some inspiration for things you should

118
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:54.550
write about.

119
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.590
So that process we described right there.

120
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.460
You can use to find sites that match your content category and scope.

121
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.870
Go to Google search for your category look for good articles or sites visit them and just add them to

122
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.690
your list for digestion later.

123
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.430
OK so I want you to try this for yourself.

124
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.450
Coming up I want to dig into sites you found a look for topics you can use for your own site.

125
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:15.650
So go ahead.

126
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.890
Fire up Google and get googling and I'll see you in the next lecture.
