1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,650
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,830
So we finally reached the homestretch of this content of your journey.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:12,240
Yes I know see obscenely long on the one recording it but I figured content strategy is incredibly important

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:18,270
because while content strategy is easy for everyone to do and his fingers on a keyboard it's free and

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:24,920
if you put some actual effort into it it's one of the most promising channels I think to go from 100

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,130
customers to a thousand.

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,870
They aren't really buying ads and are only risking much and risking is your time and at this point your

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,970
time probably isn't super valuable in all of our previous lectures here.

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,560
We spent a lot of time talking about ways to identify your audience come up with the content ideas ways

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,410
to create the content and then most recently how to promote yourself and the content.

11
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,900
And then obviously I don't make a system for managing it all now with all this effort you put in.

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,800
At some point you'll want to know is this working or not.

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,270
Well in this lecture we're going to cover ways to figure out if your content strategy is working for

14
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,790
you.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,670
We'll talk about the metrics you can measure tools you can use and what to do next.

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,060
All right let's get started.

17
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,820
Now if all of our content strategy efforts paid off perfectly than everything we created would have

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,830
been seen by everybody in the world and we'd sell all the things to all the people now we'd be rolling

19
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,550
in cash.

20
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:21,680
Probably Scrooge McDuck ing into a giant pool of gold coins and probably all be floating on hoverboard

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,280
by now.

22
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,890
Unfortunately nobody no piece of content is ever perfect.

23
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,530
Everyone is still fighting and struggling to get their blog posts and videos seen in the hope it will

24
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,540
accomplish some goals like selling stuff or connecting with more people you know keeping your business

25
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,000
afloat.

26
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,520
Well I'm just going to say it now.

27
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,730
Measurement is the only way to know for sure if you're succeeding.

28
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,760
If you don't check to see if things are working you'll never know.

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,500
Did you get 10000 people to read your blog post.

30
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,220
I don't know if you're not measuring it.

31
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,200
Did you sell enough products this month to pay your rent.

32
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,490
Maybe I he's probably figure that out with all the work you put in.

33
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,080
Or will put in after you're done with the course.

34
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,600
You owe it to yourself to measure results and know for sure.

35
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,990
If you measure the results of your content and also if you figure out ways to improve your future stuff

36
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,130
specially if you can see what worked and what didn't.

37
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,450
So the two important questions we have to ask when it comes to figuring out whether or not we did this

38
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,940
correctly is one what should we measured honor to come to that conclusion and to how do we actually

39
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,080
do the measuring.

40
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,000
First let me address the how because there is a common to everybody and their mom uses to measure content.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,090
The pages and the websites and more.

42
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,740
And that's oh yeah that thing we set up and like Section 4 called Google Analytics.

43
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,740
Once you grow your business into the thousands of customers perhaps you can look into more advanced

44
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:41,010
tools like a mix panel or a Kismat tracks but for individuals and small businesses that are sub thousand

45
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,940
customers.

46
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,180
Nothing really beats Google Analytics.

47
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,390
It's free and it has pretty much everything you need.

48
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,740
So what should we measure about our content.

49
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,520
Well there are a lot of things Google Analytics and you know the other platforms can measure.

50
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,680
This is our focus and content marketing now is going to be three key metrics that we have to focus on.

51
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,210
So the first key metric has page views now page views are going to tell us how many times a piece of

52
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,760
content was viewed by someone that clicked on your link and viewed your content.

53
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,740
OK whatever.

54
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,340
It's a basic stat for sure but it can help you get an idea as to what people are looking at in general

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,220
which topics are being viewed more which formats of content are viewed more like for instance did you

56
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,200
write a listicle and suddenly get twice as many views.

57
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,920
Are there any exceptions worth noting like a post you publish on a holiday the got less views than normal

58
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,170
is used generally is going to inform the decisions you make going forward about which content to make

59
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:40,890
when to publish it and what promotional techniques you use that work versus others but also give me

60
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,920
some indication about your headlines more page use means more people clicked through.

61
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,860
Again it's a very basic start but it's one of the ones that gives you a baseline that you can work with

62
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,920
through essentially establish the top line.

63
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,820
OK now the next metric you need to make sure that you're paying attention to is average time on page.

64
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,290
Now this data tells you how long the average reader stayed on the page and it's measured in minutes

65
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,040
and seconds.

66
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,610
Now as you might imagine longer content usually has a longer time on page shorter content has less.

67
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,200
Either way though a higher average time on page is better for you more time on pages generally means

68
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,640
the reader hasn't left yet.

69
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,880
They're reading longer and we can assume that means your content is more valuable.

70
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,840
Or you know fallen asleep.

71
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,650
That really happens more time and is also good though because it means that there are more chances for

72
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,480
the reader to see other things on your page.

73
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,780
Like any offers or calls to actions or links to more pieces of content.

74
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,450
So unlike your in-laws the longer these people stay the better.

75
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,590
Now there's always a delicate balance you have to be aware of if you publish a lot of short form content.

76
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:45,600
You're probably going to see lower time on page and that makes sense right because even the most engaged

77
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,980
people are going to read it but it's going to be over pretty quickly.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,220
And then if you publish the guides while it's generally on average going to be longer where you want

79
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,820
to be aware of is the percentage of people that make it longer than say a minute.

80
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,640
How fast you can read but in a minute that means that they're sufficiently into it.

81
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,860
And if they go past that minute mark that generally means that they're satisfied with what they're reading

82
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,200
or at least interested enough to go farther.

83
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,830
It's kind of similar with video and video we know that there's a 90 second rule.

84
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,890
Usually people drop off around 90 seconds so they make it past 90 seconds.

85
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,400
That means well you hit a winner.

86
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,360
My general advice is to actually just time yourself.

87
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:29,250
Try pulling up your iPhone or whatever you use and using the timer app and trying to just read it you

88
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,710
know what to do that there's actually a website called word count and it's word count.

89
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:39,120
Now one of those plug the text into it and I'll tell you the average reading speed for just an average

90
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,590
person reading it.

91
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:46,740
Then just take that number compare it to what you see and that's a general idea of people finishing

92
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,700
it or not.

93
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:53,760
So if total page views tells you things like whether you're using the right promotional channel or people

94
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,770
find the topic interesting or the headlines are written well.

95
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,260
TIME On page then I tell you once they came to it.

96
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,250
Are there expectations being met.

97
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,760
Are you getting the right people and is what you're writing something that's worth someone's time.

98
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,860
Now besides those two there's one more stat that I think you should probably pay attention to and this

99
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,110
is the dreaded bounce rate the bounce rate was created by Sir Mix a Lot back in the 1990s during that

100
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,460
music video I think is called Baby Got Back.

101
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,170
My is kidding.

102
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:27,210
Burns right measures the percentage of readers who bounce from your site without visiting any other

103
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,830
pages on your site.

104
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,080
They read your content and immediately leave.

105
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,220
That's basically it.

106
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,260
Now there is seriously a debate out there as to what bounce rate necessarily means.

107
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:42,840
Google Analytics actually measures this slightly differently however the difference in definitions is

108
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,360
not large enough to really matter.

109
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,410
The point is if someone bounces.

110
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,470
That means they saw that they click through.

111
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:54,240
They saw what you had and decided that they were not interested or it didn't match what they thought

112
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,870
it was.

113
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,650
If you have an abnormally high bounce rate it could be a lot of different things.

114
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,310
It could be your site is just ugly.

115
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,800
Could be that you're advertising your stuff or promoting it incorrectly.

116
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,990
Or it could be that what you write is just low quality.

117
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,860
So with that being said what's a good bounce rate.

118
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:14,850
Well it's kind of hard to say and it's really it's really about interpretation.

119
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,540
Again a good bouncer it's going to depend on what you're writing and who you're going after if you're

120
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:24,600
writing long form content while you're naturally going to have a group of people that see how long it

121
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,390
is and just naturally leave.

122
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,770
However if it's really thoughtful long stuff that's supposed to be really about people then you probably

123
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:37,800
shouldn't see something that's too high or the hand you're running short form stuff you can generally

124
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,110
see Ballantrae be a little bit higher and still consider that healthy it's worth keeping in mind.

125
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:47,790
What were your goals with this post right so a lot of like news sites out there for instance only want

126
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,290
page views on their page.

127
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,970
So if they publish something got a lot of people to click through and 90 percent of the people bounced

128
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,380
it still doesn't matter right because they just want to people see the advertisements.

129
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,090
Now compare that kind of mentality to another kind of site lets say they like a retail website that

130
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,880
sells products 80 to 90 percent of the people arrive on your product page and left.

131
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,660
That's really bad.

132
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,880
That's ads very bad in fact and according to research most retail sites for instance should see a bounce

133
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,890
rate between 20 and 40 percent.

134
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,590
Meaning most visitors will at least look through a few pages before deciding that's not what they're

135
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,380
looking for.

136
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,450
Now there are two reasons why your bounce rate might vary and it's worth kind of keeping this in mind.

137
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:32,610
Number one it might be the case that there's just not enough for the person to consume me that you wrote

138
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,980
a one page piece.

139
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,930
They read it really quickly or scanned through it and that's it.

140
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:43,860
OK in that case oftentimes it's because you didn't give them enough internal links or links to other

141
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,680
things to read.

142
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,220
That's why it's important to always have suggested articles that pop up later for them to read more

143
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,620
or some way to push them towards a call to action.

144
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,850
Now another reason you might see a high bounce rate is that your content on the page doesn't match the

145
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,320
way that you're advertising it.

146
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,740
Remember we talked about how to write a good effective headline.

147
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:07,950
Well sometimes if you take that a little too seriously or too far you can end up running a title that

148
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:14,250
is just to click Batey or it's a mismatch between what you're actually trying to deliver sometimes the

149
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,740
right content and it's great and there's really you can't really think of a way to sex up the headlines

150
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,520
so you write something that's just inaccurate.

151
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,000
Remember titles create a first impression and users see them on search results or on social platforms.

152
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,350
Someone clicks through starts reading and sees the content and it doesn't really match the title as

153
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,740
they probably end up leaving that's totally natural.

154
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:36,780
So naturally if you for some reason thought your bounce rate was too high I'd recommend you try to add

155
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,820
more internal linking ways to keep them on your page or at least keep them in your site.

156
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,660
And the other thing is to make sure that your title matches the content of your post.

157
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,810
An easy way to tease that second one out is just to ask someone.

158
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,750
Show them the headline and ask them what they think it is.

159
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,090
Again you can use tools like five second post to do something like that.

160
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:00,350
You can run a basic survey on Facebook as the survey you Mechanical the survey whatever you can send

161
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,150
out an email.

162
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,930
The point is you just want to see people that say Oh I think this this article will tell me this.

163
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,350
Now I've mentioned page views we talked about time on Page and we talked about balance rate.

164
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,400
Those are the three metrics that are very common ones used by content marketers to measure the success

165
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,480
of posted pages.

166
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,270
But when you see all of these numbers you might still wonder.

167
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,670
I don't know if I'm doing OK.

168
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:24,320
I don't feel bad because again obviously these numbers are downright confusing and a lot of times it

169
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,290
feels like you're interpreting tea leaves.

170
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,380
Now there's a lot more metrics and Google Analytics as well.

171
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:35,480
You can get lost in there for Taizz But if you can focus on some key metrics say once a month you get

172
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,210
a much better handle on how to interpret what the numbers mean.

173
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,000
It's also important that you understand basic attribution.

174
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,460
So for instance if you have a page that sells something and a page as a blog you should be able to use

175
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,470
Google Analytics to tell how many people came to this page and then started buying.

176
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,010
That's generally pretty easy to do on Google Analytics just by sorting by origin.

177
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,170
That doesn't necessarily work for you.

178
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,140
There's some other things you can try that are more easy to tell.

179
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,960
For instance there is a site called Jayco or full story.

180
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,900
What it does is it literally records what users do on your Web site so you can watch the people that

181
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,670
come to your blog and watch them and see are they actually going from the page to where I want them

182
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,250
to go.

183
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:19,120
Anyway back to the point about comparison with content marketing the first time you post something I'm

184
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,120
going to be honest with you.

185
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,860
It's really hard to tell if it's actually working for you.

186
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,110
This is really kind of a long term thing.

187
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:32,690
So after a month then you might be able to look at it and say yes or no or two months but after one

188
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,080
post it's really hard to say.

189
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:40,550
Let's say like after four weeks or six weeks or whatever you have a really high time on page and a low

190
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,300
bounce rate.

191
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,910
OK.

192
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,780
This means that they're reading your content and looking around your site for more.

193
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,500
This is probably your best case scenario.

194
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,140
Now if you've a high time on page and a high bounce rate this could mean a lot of different things that

195
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:59,150
could mean that the people that come and stay really like your stuff and the people that don't kind

196
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,090
of leave.

197
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,600
I consider this kind of middle of the road.

198
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,790
It also kind of depends on how you define balance right.

199
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:10,130
Some people define bounce right as people who leave immediately and sometimes Google says that people

200
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:14,360
who bounce or someone who looks at one page only and then leaves.

201
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:20,150
If that's the case well then your browser doesn't mean anything it just means that they didn't necessarily

202
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,190
convert or go to other pages in your site.

203
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,870
So I consider it something that's kind of in the middle of the road.

204
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,430
You probably want to work on keeping them on the page or promoting in different areas.

205
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,400
Now conversely Let's say you had a low time on page and a low bounce rate.

206
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:40,160
While that means that people are probably finding what they need quickly and looking around your site

207
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,880
for more.

208
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,940
Again that's kind of middle of the road it kind of depends on what you're publishing.

209
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:49,610
But if you have a low time on page and a high bounce rate well then people aren't spending a lot of

210
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,280
time looking at your stuff and while they're leaving.

211
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,020
And that's most likely a signal that you didn't make some changes to your content.

212
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,900
But let's not devote all of our attention to Google Analytics because there are other places to look

213
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,820
for data to help us measure success.

214
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,620
Social media content will generate likes and engagement and shares and you can gather that data using

215
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,220
platforms like buffer hoot suite is another one.

216
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,210
And meet Edgar.

217
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:15,920
There's obviously a lot more each social platform has its own metrics even within that that they can

218
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,570
give you an idea as to what works.

219
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,530
Facebook pages for instance give you detailed stats but the total number of likes and followers you've

220
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:26,810
got as well as specific post views reach and engagement showing you which content work best.

221
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:32,230
These web pages also feature insights tab where you can dig into your audience and see demographic data.

222
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,950
Now Twitter on the other hand provides an analytics page you can see your top tweets as well as basic

223
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,210
metrics like followers shares and mentions how many people click through to your profile or click through

224
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,800
to your link when you post something.

225
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,060
Twitter also has a followers dashboard that lets you see information about your followers like demographics

226
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,880
lifestyle info consumer behavior.

227
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:49,700
Little creepy.

228
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,380
Now depending on how seriously you use these social platforms you have a chance to get more detailed

229
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:58,940
info on how your content promotional efforts are going with access to this data in different places

230
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,330
so the success of your content obviously is important.

231
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,810
And using these metrics and ways to interpret numbers will help you figure it out but ultimately your

232
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,620
success hinges on the original goals you've set for yourself.

233
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,870
Why are you creating content in the first place.

234
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,760
What did you hope people would do.

235
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,110
Do you want them to buy stuff.

236
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,420
Register for something or simply read it and then remember you.

237
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,520
Your success here will be measured by a number of conversions that you can generate.

238
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,940
Google Analytics does allow you to track conversions meaning it can record every time a Web site visitor

239
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,500
performs a specific action like making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter for example.

240
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,860
So setting up conversions that relate to your content strategy goals all of you understand if you're

241
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,790
achieving any measure of success you might see that some pieces of content lead to more conversions

242
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,030
while others don't.

243
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,850
Eventually you'll get to a point where you realize have a big overarching content strategy goal.

244
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:51,440
Things that benefit your business as a whole and you also have individual content goals like jittering

245
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,520
page views and longer time on page.

246
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:58,190
You'll see that the success of those smaller pieces then drive the success of the bigger goals.

247
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,710
So don't worry if it seems like things are taking way too long a time.

248
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,300
Now this is an ongoing strategy.

249
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,270
You need to keep feeding kind of like a fire or wild unicorn.

250
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,970
Don't feed it and it will die.

251
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,270
So once you've got your measurement platform like your Google Analytics and you know how to do the basic

252
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:18,190
tracking that we covered before and you've got the numbers look at then you might see some opportunities

253
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:18,960
for improvement.

254
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:23,080
In general there are some tips that can help you get better numbers regardless of the kind of industry

255
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,300
or business you're N..

256
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,430
Number one is try to focus on writing better content.

257
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,300
I know it sounds all simple but make better stuff.

258
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,360
It's really that simple.

259
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,840
Spend more time on it research it more polish it more get more outside information.

260
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,190
Think through it more.

261
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:44,020
Number two is maybe if you don't like your metrics instead of going back and editing what you have or

262
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,800
are trying to do more try to change your process.

263
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,930
You've got to just focus more on consistency.

264
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,670
Don't stop producing content.

265
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,280
Remember like a fire or a unicorn or a cat you don't feed it it will die.

266
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,400
So keep going.

267
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,510
Sometimes the problems will iron themselves out.

268
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:03,250
Number three is try your best to look for clear successes and then duplicate them.

269
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,900
A lot of times are published 10 things and one will do way better than the others.

270
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,150
It should be obvious when you look at the metrics in the metrics you might see that the blog post called

271
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:18,940
top 10 ways and app developers like getting a root canal is your best one and it's got a lot more attention

272
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,710
so maybe you make some more listicle.

273
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:26,020
Or you create more stuff with the funny titles or you focus more on trolling the dentistry profession.

274
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:30,460
But if something works try to exploit it in the end measurement will go a long way towards helping you

275
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,780
understand what's working and why.

276
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,790
But it's not everything.

277
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:38,980
Keep experimenting and figuring out new ways to create content and the results you want should come.

278
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,430
Keep in mind this is more of a long term strategy.

279
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,620
So at first you might not succeed.

280
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,850
That does not mean you won't succeed in the next round or the next round.

281
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,620
Over time you also get better at interpreting your metrics.

282
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:56,560
Right now I can't give you an absolute answer as to what your bounce rate should be but you can figure

283
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,750
it out over time.

284
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,330
If you notice that as you make subtle changes you get better at your process.

285
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:07,440
It goes down well then generally you know you're moving towards the promised land.

286
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,960
You could also just use common sense.

287
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,220
Are you getting more sales.

288
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,730
Are you getting more conversions.

289
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,240
And then look at how much time you spend on the content strategy yourself.

290
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,790
Is it worth it.

291
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,810
I think it's a fantastic way to get to your 500 customers.

292
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,380
I don't think it takes longer than a month to use it to get to that point.

293
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,390
