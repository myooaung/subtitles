00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.490
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:08.230
So we've talked about some goals for creating content improving branding and increasing engagement.

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.440
Now let's get to one of the goals.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.390
Many people obsess over.

5
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.880
That's conversions.

6
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.290
Conversion is when a reader or web site visit or takes a specific action kind of covered this before

7
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.880
those actions can be measured on dashboards or on platforms.

8
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.790
And to some people they indicate how successful you are at whatever you do it's a yardstick so to speak.

9
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:36.240
And it's called a conversion usually because you are converting a user from one kind of status to another

10
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.610
set of a prospect and our client set up a lead there now a paying customer.

11
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.010
So what are some examples of conversions.

12
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.690
Well number one when someone orders a product on your website that's a conversion or two when someone

13
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.200
signs up for your e-mail newsletter that's a conversion as well.

14
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.020
Number three conversions can also be inquiries through a contact form event registrations click through

15
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.490
on an e-mail or votes in a survey.

16
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.590
We usually just end up calling those leads.

17
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.170
Now each conversion is different but you can see how important they are especially because some of these

18
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.050
involve real money buying a product activating a membership renewing a service you've been collecting

19
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.930
donations.

20
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.310
These are all conversions that involve money changing hands.

21
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.790
Our goal here is to figure out how you can write content to make those conversions happen well before

22
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.150
you write anything you need to have your goals clearly in mind when you create your blog post or web

23
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.890
site pages as you create each piece of your content including the headlines the page copy especially

24
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.040
the calls to action.

25
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.880
You need to always work towards the goal you're trying to achieve.

26
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.600
Kind of goes without saying the reason you won't your goals clearly in mind is so you know if you're

27
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.820
succeeding or not.

28
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.080
Now a great way to evaluate this is by just doing basic AB testing.

29
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.790
Other people call it split testing but the idea is that you take two versions of the same page that

30
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.950
you've made make a tweak to the language or the call to action the color of the button or whatever and

31
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.600
see which one performs better.

32
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.460
Now there are a few tools you can use to do this but Google Analytics actually has a feature built and

33
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.540
called experiments that can help you do this for free.

34
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.950
So it is an important requirement for your content if you're trying to get them to convert.

35
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.450
Well you need to make people trust you if you don't trust the Web site you're on then you're never going

36
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.830
to click the buy now button or give them your personal data.

37
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.150
Not even to email you a newsletter.

38
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.420
Building trust requires that you have a Web site that doesn't look shady and works as expected.

39
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.140
That's a place where your designers and developers have to do their job.

40
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.790
But assuming you have a website that looks good and works well then the trust part is really up to you

41
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.440
as a writer of the blog posts and web pages.

42
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.260
You have to write content that can be trusted.

43
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.200
For example do you make any claims that you need to back them up.

44
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.840
You can cite data that supports your product like people have saved 50 percent on expenses when they

45
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.850
use our app.

46
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.170
Then if that's true you have to show a chart or at least some data or feature a quote from a client

47
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.020
saying that if you write about your dozens of satisfied clients then link to a page on your site that

48
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.330
maybe list them out or a page that includes some testimonials from them it's not enough to just say

49
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.660
it.

50
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.340
If you blog about how important a new feature of your product is don't just say it's important.

51
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.500
Show a video of a customer using it or linked to another blog post it breaks down how it works.

52
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.600
So when you have a conversion in mind like getting people to register for webinars for example you need

53
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.150
to make people believe through the content you create that it's not only valuable but trust worthy enough

54
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.390
for them to go through with that conversion.

55
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.790
No other way to get a conversion is to help the reader eliminate the competition from the picture.

56
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.820
When we're thinking about buying a product or downloading some kind of app we usually consider alternatives

57
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.450
to find the best one especially if we know we're going to have to spend money we don't want to have

58
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.990
to buy the wrong thing.

59
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.610
So in order to make the right decision we do research that might include looking for posts that help

60
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.910
us compare multiple products like five web hosts for your e-commerce Web site or the pros and cons of

61
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.190
cloud based file backup services.

62
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.350
Now you can wait for bloggers to cover you or the media to do your review.

63
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.200
But if you can write that post comparing yourself to the competition.

64
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.440
Well it does two things.

65
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.470
First it allows you to tell the story rather than someone else.

66
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.840
And sure it'll be biased because you wrote it but if you write trustworthy content like we talked about

67
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.250
earlier back up your claims probably believe it.

68
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.840
So include some proof of your claims and be transparent when necessary but put any negatives in context

69
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.170
like yes may only cost more than the competition but that's because their service is better.

70
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.380
And we have more features etc. etc..

71
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.600
And secondly if you write that story in posts on your site it means that they might not go to the competitors

72
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.320
site for similar information.

73
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.410
The reader is one step closer to buying as long as you can convince them that your stuff is indeed better

74
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.340
than someone else's.

75
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.200
Now here's an example.

76
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.180
Remember help scout.

77
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.600
Well housecarl knows that they have a few key competitors out there Zendesk is one of them.

78
00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.480
So help us out create a page on their site specifically to explain how they compare to the big bad desk

79
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.450
what are the goals of the page is to clearly convert Zendesk users to help scout users because it includes

80
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.250
price comparisons a way to import data from Zendesk to help scout.

81
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.370
That's dirty and explains a lot of its key features.

82
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.510
The best part of the page though is a video with the help scout client describing why they SWIP shrugs

83
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.670
and desk to help scout.

84
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.860
Those are some fighting words.

85
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.040
So basically helps got to saying here all these reasons why you should go with us but if you can't take

86
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.840
our word for it here's someone that actually switched and is very happy about it.

87
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.560
It's a great piece of content and you can bet they get convergence like sign ups or inquiries because

88
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.010
of it.

89
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.190
This might be a good spot to pause for a snack and consider your own conversions.

90
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.500
So if you have competitors trying to get the same people you are.

91
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.810
Think about one of your main competitors and it is ask yourself Could you write a post that's basically

92
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.010
like the top five reasons we're better than our competitor.

93
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.300
Do you know your competitor well enough to do that.

94
00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.230
Some differences like price or feature set could be obvious but there might be some other differences

95
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.940
you haven't thought of yet.

96
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.020
So take a patient help Scout's book and maybe ask some of your customers.

97
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.470
Have any of them used your competitors product or service before.

98
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.750
If so why did they switch.

99
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.430
This kind of detail can really make for great content to help eliminate the competition for other people's

100
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.160
minds.

101
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.700
OK.

102
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.880
Another strategy to help you get more conversions is to appeal to people's egos.

103
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.240
Yes their egos.

104
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.670
Lots of companies love to feature customer success stories on testimonials on their blogs.

105
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.380
For example there's a box of box it's kind of like Dropbox but they focus more on businesses.

106
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.890
No not that box box.

107
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.040
It's a huge digital content management platform.

108
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.980
It's an online workspace for collaboration file sharing and all sorts of other kind of stuff for enterprise

109
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:44.390
people.

110
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.140
So I've got a blog with a whole series of articles on customer stories writing about how companies have

111
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:54.600
integrated their systems with box or linked clients in the healthcare industry for example who use it

112
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.350
for specific health care purposes.

113
00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.120
Well naturally your company gets profiled one of these posts are going to share it with lots of people.

114
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.560
Ok but how do they help with conversions.

115
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.160
Wow.

116
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.540
And the company gets profiled then they share it then their followers will go check it out because of

117
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.730
course they trust the company that got profile.

118
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.110
So they check out the story read about the success and if there's a relevant conversion and they're

119
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.360
like want to see how it all works.

120
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.350
Check out our Web unarm register for this free trial.

121
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.810
The people checking it out are more likely to convert.

122
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.500
Now trust already exists between them and the company they follow.

123
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.730
So you're really just kind of piggybacking on that trust to get the conversion to happen.

124
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.690
And by the way lots of people love free exposure or a chance to interact directly with the company they

125
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.320
like.

126
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.110
So if you want more success story content just put out a call for at the end of each post.

127
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.980
Want to share your story fill out this form.

128
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:48.540
It's a content type that basically powers itself share one story.

129
00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.710
Ask for more.

130
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.600
All the while each post shows that your product works.

131
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.350
Hopefully enticing new people to try or buy it.

132
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.830
Aside from people's egos you can also appeal to their fear of missing out.

133
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.010
Hash tag fumo.

134
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.430
Fear is a legitimate way to make conversions happen.

135
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:08.820
Writing how awesome an event was with details about sessions and speakers and special guests and all

136
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:13.350
that is a natural need into a registration form for the next event.

137
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:18.390
In fact you can literally put phrases like Don't miss out or limited time offer.

138
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.760
It's a sales technique called scarcity where you try to get people interested by making them think that

139
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.680
something will be gone soon.

140
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.160
Whether it's true or not.

141
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.880
So how do you get people to act well.

142
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:34.500
Tell your readers to set up alerts in their email preferences so they don't miss any messages about

143
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.560
special deals or updates on their product or you can use a third party plug in like literally called

144
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:46.350
photo made by one of my instructors to create jealousy and compel them to buying all of your stuff.

145
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:52.410
OK one more way to create conversions and your content is to simply give something away for free.

146
00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:55.020
Kind of like how we talked before with engagement.

147
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:59.880
Now there are times in selling things and making money or nece are necessary goals but not all of the

148
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.480
time.

149
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.400
Sometimes you want to generate some leads you want more people to email things to or people you can

150
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.830
approach with deals later on to create that trust.

151
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:08.960
We're always talking about.

152
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:14.700
Sometimes you have to give them a taste of what you have to offer so maybe you're a web designer or

153
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:20.280
an agency and every time you work with a client you have a checklist of items or questions you ask them.

154
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.620
It helps you understand their needs and goals and prepares them to work with you.

155
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.980
You can write about this checklist in a blog post.

156
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:34.710
Turn the checklist into a PTF and put up a form asking people to enter their email if they want to download

157
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:34.890
it.

158
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.030
Could this content be worth money while.

159
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.050
Perhaps but sometimes giving away value for free can lead to more opportunities later.

160
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:48.150
People can read the PTF and think oh maybe I should work with them and redo our Web site or they really

161
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.870
know what they're talking about let share this link and recommend them to people we know.

162
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.850
I don't know if they say that but that's what they do.

163
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.360
So we covered a bunch of ways to write content in support of conversions.

164
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.840
Just remember that conversions don't happen you don't have a clear called action.

165
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.740
You need a button or some other mechanism to make it happen.

166
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.980
That's just science right there.

167
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.630
Whatever you write should lead to a form or an e-mail or a button that tries to get the reader to do

168
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.190
what you want them to do.

169
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.690
Is this a design concern.

170
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:16.260
Sure.

171
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.810
But as a content creator you need to know where that button is.

172
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:25.140
Sometimes you want to actually call it to the reader's attention like download our checklist at the

173
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.070
end of this post or something like that.

174
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:31.380
So I know this is all about content but here's a quick rundown of some of the tools you can use for

175
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.850
some current conversion forms you might need.

176
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:39.690
If you want to build an email subscriber list email platforms like MailChimp and a Weber have tools

177
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:44.850
and templates for setting up simple subscriber forms you want out of contact or inquiry form.

178
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.090
There's an app called SuBo not to be confused with apps sumo.

179
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.260
It is created by the same person.

180
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:56.100
Sewel has a bunch of free tools where you can customize a form and then place it anywhere you want on

181
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.740
your blog or site.

182
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:02.250
You could also add one of those like boxes that shows up and you scroll down the page a little bit and

183
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.890
it slides out very conveniently from the side.

184
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.150
Simo kind of makes a point that you can use this tool to politely ask people to complete the form and

185
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:15.200
so I can see that this is probably more effective than just having a form pop up out of nowhere.

186
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:20.580
They have no option to avoid and if you produce videos you can use a tool like Wispa to put lead forms

187
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:25.470
inside the videos themselves at different points like Enter your email to watch the rest of the video

188
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.530
which I personally hate.

189
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.720
What you can do or you can put it like at the end.

190
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.780
Now are a lot of options you can go there.

191
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.160
All right.

192
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.540
Last thing I swear.

193
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.010
A word of warning about writing for conversions.

194
00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.850
Don't get obsessed with them.

195
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:42.570
Understand that one piece of content will not always earn all the trust people need to convert a lot

196
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:46.920
of time it takes a bunch of content and visiting other sites and talking to other people so it will

197
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.470
take multiple pieces of content over time.

198
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:54.090
That being said don't be one of those Web sites where you obnoxiously attack the reader with popovers

199
00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.320
informs every step of the way.

200
00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:00.690
Using those techniques is different from actually writing and delivering content with value.

201
00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:01.770
Don't be a jerk.

202
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.840
Write Great stuff and just earn their trust.

203
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.070
All right guys heed my warning and I'll see you in the next lecture.
