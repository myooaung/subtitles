1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,560
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:08,840
So in the last lecture I showed you how to create canonical long form content really involved but for

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,210
what you actually provide it's generally worth the effort.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,220
You checked it out.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,830
Definitely do it in this lecture.

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,850
I've got another tactic you can use to create content.

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,840
Now these We're going to call controversial posts.

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:26,240
This is that thing or you pick a religion or a political figure of some kind and you just start laying

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,520
into them repeatedly personal attacks talking about their moms just horrible stuff.

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,380
Actually I'm kidding.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,460
And that's not what I mean by controversial post.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,360
You're not trying to anger someone in the world of content marketing you're always trying to be noticed.

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,910
Normally you let the value of your content do the talking for you but with a controversial post you're

14
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:57,690
just trying to spark a conversation or engagement with an aggressive title contrarian topic or both.

15
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,840
Now to be clear you don't really just want to jump into that religion or politics fool because you'll

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,390
drown honestly stay out of the deep end of things that are way too controversial and you can never win.

17
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,820
Avoid those at all costs.

18
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,790
It's just not worth it.

19
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,370
Now controversial posts are the ones where you're not going to bother being diplomatic.

20
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,640
We're polite and you're going to take a stand on something if you truly believe in something like Coke

21
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,780
is better than Pepsi.

22
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,640
Well then write a post and state that will you piss off Pepsi drinkers of the world.

23
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,840
Perhaps when they might comment on your post telling you that you're wrong or sharing it and telling

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
their followers how wrong you are.

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,470
Well that's actually kind of the point you want to generate reactions and sharing.

26
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,040
Other types of engagement.

27
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:48,630
Sometimes you need a strong piece of content like a controversial post to spur people to take action.

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,610
It's also worth noting that controversial pieces can show that you are not a sheep following the herd

29
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,400
but in fact you can think originally and you're not just arguing for the sake of it.

30
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,070
You might even be seen as a visionary or an influencer.

31
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,820
These benefits are nice but in the end you really want to generate those reactions we talked about.

32
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,520
So over avoiding religion politics the Nazis and black lives matter.

33
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,820
What topics should you talk about.

34
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,020
Well the answer is relatively easy.

35
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,700
Stick with the same topics you've been thinking about through all the lectures you've watched.

36
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,520
I'm talking about topics relevant to you and your audience.

37
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,040
There's no reason to change that now and go off running a post at the Syrian civil war and I can say

38
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,430
that's still a no go topic even though I have no idea when you're watching this video because well that

39
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,270
civil war has no end in sight.

40
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,580
Sad face emoji.

41
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,150
Instead with this tactic we're going to address the topics relevant to your specific needs and issues

42
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,300
related to that need.

43
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,420
And then we're going to give some people or brands or old fashioned ways of thinking and doing things

44
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,860
a good kick in the nuts.

45
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,780
I wish I had as many of them.

46
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,930
So there's three types of controversial posts I want to cover here.

47
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,320
Now the first type is the old right way vs. wrong way of doing things.

48
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,000
Post.

49
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,290
Maybe you've seen posts out there that list options for like web hosting or moving services or who knows

50
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,510
what but they write just to inform you and stopped short of actually choosing the best.

51
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,040
Well those are the distant Canadian cousin of the type we're currently talking about.

52
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,070
Why Canadian because they're ridiculous.

53
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,040
Polite.

54
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,460
In our case forget being diplomatic.

55
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:33,300
Call one out as the clear victor and then explain why say that strong man's moving service should be

56
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:33,950
called.

57
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,400
We'll see man moving service and another customer service is clearly inferior.

58
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,440
Another example if you know anything about project management for example you know that there are a

59
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,720
bunch of different approaches people use.

60
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,260
One of the older ways of managing projects with something called the waterfall approach.

61
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,670
But in recent years things like Agile frameworks and specifically things like the scrum framework have

62
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,490
become a lot more popular if you are for some reason fascinated by this stuff.

63
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,000
Waterfall is basically a let's do everything at once and figure out what we did wrong afterwards and

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,100
scram as a type of agile process.

65
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:14,370
That's basically more like let's just do a little bit here and then reconvene afterwards.

66
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,890
Anyway maybe you decide scrimmages better.

67
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,930
You highlight a bunch of reasons why and you title your post seven ways scrum is clearly better than

68
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,150
waterfall for project management.

69
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,420
You're not pulling any punches.

70
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,600
You have a clear vision angle and you're going all in on it.

71
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:35,110
People who agree with you will want to share it and people who don't will want to troll it

72
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,140
so that's one way to do it.

73
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:55,670
Now another type of controversial post would be to straight up declare that something is dead every

74
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:01,730
year or somewhere somebody in the entertainment media writes a post that says Saturday Night Live is

75
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:06,570
dead and in social media someone always writes Twitter is dead.

76
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:12,530
Ironically oftentimes on Twitter there's always someone who wants to drum up controversy in conversation

77
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,310
and that that's one way of actually doing it.

78
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,120
However repetitious that is.

79
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,840
For example remember how a bunch of designers some years ago adopted flat design.

80
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:27,260
You know that design that decided everything was too complex and advanced and then decided that icons

81
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,250
should now really look like basic doodles.

82
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:30,960
Yeah.

83
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,480
That one apple was using it.

84
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,310
So of course lots of people followed suit and of course just as flat design really reaches its peak.

85
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,880
People started anticipating its downfall.

86
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:46,940
If you Google that design is dead you'll see all kinds of posts from 2013 2014 and so on.

87
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,270
Now keep in mind these articles weren't all written just to be controversial.

88
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:56,480
2014 fast company wrote is flat design already passe.

89
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,290
Basically they truly wondered where the industry was going.

90
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,630
They could have gone with a safer more generic title like The future of flat design or even something

91
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,790
like evaluating the impact of flat design on mobile devices.

92
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:17,270
But these titles kind of read like academic reports asking if something is passe or declaring it dead

93
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,850
or useless or obsolete is really just another way to grab people's attention and make people notice.

94
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,800
People who agree will want something that reinforces their opinions of the read it.

95
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:32,030
People don't want their opinion challenged or that they just want to rage at the page.

96
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,920
That might be a really good time for you to get angry.

97
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,990
That's my secret.

98
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,620
I'm always

99
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:46,570
right.

100
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:52,030
Now the third type of controversial post worth covering is what I called the rebuttal when a blogger

101
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,670
media source or someone else declares something you respond with their own post and declare the opposite.

102
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,700
So when someone posts Twitter is dead you're right.

103
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:06,880
Twitter is not dead and here's ten reasons why it's basically that old playground argument of did not.

104
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,120
Did too but you know in content marketing form not only can you spur some responses with a strongly

105
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,220
worded post like this but you can also get the attention of the original poster and perhaps engage in

106
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,960
some online fisticuffs.

107
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,600
People might not pay for your product yet but they'll probably pay to watch you virtually fistfight

108
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,000
someone.

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,170
Now here is an example.

110
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:32,380
If you google rock n roll is dead you'll find a bunch of people whining about the current state of music

111
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,240
and Miley Cyrus and everything else.

112
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:40,510
But then if you search for a rock n roll is not dead you'll find plenty of people arguing the exact

113
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,410
opposite.

114
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,880
They don't like Miley Cyrus are either but they're happy with the current state of rock whether it's

115
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,160
an actual rebuttal to a written piece or just a kind of reaction to a general vibe you're getting from

116
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,590
customers.

117
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,890
Your post can state your support for a specific cause or angle.

118
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,110
All in the hopes of getting shares and reactions.

119
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,790
All right so here's another example.

120
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,710
Remember a while back there is that big public backlash against SeaWorld when a documentary called Blackfish

121
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,150
came out accusing them of animal abuse.

122
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:14,440
Well it accused them of animal abuse and you know not telling their trainers that one of their killer

123
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,610
whales what might be a little extra killer.

124
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,750
It cost them boycott's and a lot of online grumpiness.

125
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,860
Well a blog called Awesome ocean fired back and posted Blackfish is dead wrong and here's why.

126
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,370
The writer highlighted a few reasons they called the makers of the film selfish.

127
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:38,770
I personally would have called them shellfish but that's because I'm a little tone deaf ears.

128
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,490
Anyway the blog took a stand they believed in against the source they thought was wrong.

129
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,330
If there's a source you disagree with.

130
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:52,570
You can do the same thing now obviously don't go and write 10 reasons why Japanese whaling is great

131
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,020
unless one your business has something to do with whales.

132
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,320
Oceans are seafood too.

133
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,340
You actually believe that in theory you're a terrible person.

134
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,950
So there you've got three approaches worth considering.

135
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,450
We have the right way versus wrong way post.

136
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:12,010
The something is dead or obsolete post and then we have the rebuttal post.

137
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,520
Now of course in each case that we covered it's going to be really important that you get your headline

138
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,920
right for a controversial post to work.

139
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,490
Got to grab their attention like both hands grab it.

140
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,610
Use your robot hand if you have to shake it violently.

141
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,470
You know what I mean.

142
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:30,190
So how can you put together a great headline for your controversial piece.

143
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,670
I got three tips that I want to share.

144
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:38,200
First off stick with the fundamentals of good headline writing that we covered a couple years ago when

145
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,940
we talked about creating content for your audience.

146
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:47,110
Keep headlines to around 6 to 10 where it's long that keeps the headline fully readable in any format

147
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,910
or any screen and concise enough that it's easy to understand.

148
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,120
Second add controversial adjectives and or terms to the title.

149
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,150
Be confident and almost arrogant with your descriptions refer to things as the best or the worst and

150
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:07,900
use sharp adjectives like terrible crazy ridiculous mindblowing you know the terms that really only

151
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,570
exist in real life when you're goofing around with friends and trying to one up each other.

152
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,670
You know what I mean.

153
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:18,780
If you're with friends you might actually say crazy over-the-top stuff like this.

154
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,740
Pizza is the best ever.

155
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,650
Or where is the train.

156
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,130
It's the worst ever.

157
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,360
Or come on this Batman movie is worse than a minion's movie.

158
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:34,360
For example a site called Noble compiled a bunch of stories from people about terrible dining experiences

159
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,780
but the title doesn't try to sugarcoat anything it's just title horrified customers share their absolute

160
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,410
worst and Kappes dining experience.

161
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:49,180
Not only are the dining experiences the worst but the customers are horrified as well.

162
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,030
Too strong controversial as is for the price of one.

163
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:57,910
Personally I wouldn't say absolute worst because it's a headline not something you'd say to your best

164
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,940
girlfriend while driving down the highway in L.A. but whatever.

165
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,140
That's my preference.

166
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,670
Here's another example.

167
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,840
There's a sales strategist that wrote on their blog we'll throw it up on the screen about how a lot

168
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,360
of sales trainers share out of date information of the people they train.

169
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:15,750
But the blog post and the video within it are called Five Deadly Lies.

170
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:23,320
Every salesperson has been told by sales trainers not only do sales trainers lie but their lies are

171
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,080
deadly.

172
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:28,230
And apparently every salesperson has been told these deadly lies.

173
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,560
So really every sales person ever should just be dead.

174
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,630
OK maybe his title is a bit of an overreach.

175
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,180
Mr. Sales strategist or the spirit of these controversial posts.

176
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,020
Maybe Mr. Sales strategist you're just lying.

177
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:46,500
My advice here is that controversial doesn't mean overselling what you're delivering and your post your

178
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,380
title isn't accurate then it is therefore wrong.

179
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,990
Remember you still have to be credible at the end of the day.

180
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,520
That shouldn't hold you back from using more flamboyant adjectives.

181
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,190
Now here's a third tip for your headline.

182
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,760
Don't avoid conflict.

183
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,140
Highlight it again.

184
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,460
Forget diplomacy.

185
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,610
Don't be Canadian.

186
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,020
If you're going to attack something or someone name names.

187
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:12,210
Neil Patel recently wrote a piece called eight businesses that failed at content marketing and what

188
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,930
we can learn from them.

189
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:21,150
It was in his Forbes magazine and you could have called it lessons we can learn from failed content

190
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:27,990
marketing or something softer like that but he actually called out the companies included in the piece.

191
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,740
Now this technique is strong and it is effective.

192
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,900
Here's another example.

193
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,770
A piece called Why I hate Starbucks.

194
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:40,120
This is a personal lifestyle blog for The Huffington Post and yes the f bomb is censored in the title

195
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,640
but you kind of get the picture.

196
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,500
Strong opinions strong headline.

197
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:43,970
What's that.

198
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,020
The devil's words in your headline.

199
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,430
I will give you one of my clicks.

200
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:47,980
Good sir.

201
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,610
Well done.

202
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:53,600
So again without sounding too redundant headline is a key piece of making a controversial post work.

203
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,690
Now let's think about you.

204
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,050
What kind of controversal post could you write.

205
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,670
You want to stay within your topics and stay relevant to yourself and your audience.

206
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:08,700
But if you're looking for inspiration just go to Google and type in why I hate the term about your industry.

207
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,240
Graphic Designers can search for why I hate Photoshop.

208
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,710
For example while salespeople can search for why I hate sales trainers.

209
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,910
I don't know something like that.

210
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,030
Try some variations.

211
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,640
Photoshop is the worst photoshop sucks.

212
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:26,160
The results could show you post that either agree or disagree with the statement you looked for.

213
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,950
Either way it's great inspiration.

214
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,960
Here's another idea.

215
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,980
Go to read it and look for some controversial posts in some somberness for controversial posts are more

216
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,330
common like politics for example.

217
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:41,180
You can actually sort by controversial post that really polarize the reader with one click.

218
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:46,280
What a controversial post on Reddit means is that there's a big difference between lots of people of

219
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:53,340
voting but also lots of people down voting array as opposed to just top which means a pure mass of people

220
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,200
voting and not a lot of down votes.

221
00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:00,570
Now Photoshop isn't quite as controversial though so what you can do is just go to like the photo shop

222
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,190
sub read it within that then search for the word hate and see what posts come up.

223
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,940
Here's a post that cuts right to the heart of the matter.

224
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,110
Photoshop prose.

225
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,840
What are some task that you hate.

226
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,730
The author asked what do you hate and what eases the pain.

227
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:19,950
Well you might find are people ranting and such but these rancid opinions could be the core of a controversial

228
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,920
post you're right based on that post about Photoshop.

229
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,270
Maybe you could write seven things artists hate about Photoshop.

230
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,320
Doesn't even necessarily have to be about you.

231
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:32,010
Now if you want to see how one site in particular creates controversial posts.

232
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,880
Check out that notable site that I mentioned earlier on their home page.

233
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,100
Actually you can sort by most controversial.

234
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:44,430
Not only can you learn from the articles listed there and see what they touch upon and how you can also

235
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,510
see what the titles look like and if there's a way you can use that to your advantage.

236
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,210
So what do you want to rant about or complain about.

237
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:55,140
What myth do you want to debunk or sacred brand or best practice.

238
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,130
Do you just want to rip apart write your controversial posts.

239
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,890
Give it a nice and Prickley headline and prepare for engagement.

240
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,090
All right guys that's it for now.

241
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,050
I'll see you in the next lecture.
