00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.500
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.090
So our last lecture covered one tactic for getting attention to reporters and that was what I called

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.730
the core a poll and now I want to tell you about another way to grab a reporter.

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.640
But in a nice way and not an aggressive restraining order kind of grabbing way.

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.620
Here's Johnny.

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.140
Remember all we said back in one of our first lectures that day in the life of a reporter lecturer at

7
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.920
one of the things reporters are always doing is research

8
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.430
that along with all the other stuff they do just fills up their day leaves them less time to answer

9
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.360
your pitch emails.

10
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.950
Well one if you could do some of that valuable research for them.

11
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.240
No that doesn't mean you're becoming there in turn or indentured servant.

12
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.890
This means you're going to do them a favor and if it's helpful maybe you can help them out in return.

13
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.690
And if they can't help you on return them at very least you learn some stuff about your industry or

14
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.560
your customers and you're still on their radar.

15
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.600
Not a bad deal right.

16
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.560
So this next we're going to ask us how you can use your own influence and other resources to conduct

17
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.010
polls or surveys on a topic that's relevant to a reporter on your list.

18
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.120
Now I do have to give partial credit to a part of this to Demitri it just reach out.

19
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.250
He has his own variation of how to do this but he kind of pioneered part of the polling method that

20
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.120
we'll talk about.

21
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.710
The first step with this tactic is to figure out what you want to share with the reporter you already

22
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.880
have some interesting data.

23
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.990
Great but usually you'll need to collect some data and that's really not so tough.

24
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.180
You can create a survey and get people to answer it.

25
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.830
Now there are a lot of free tools out there for surveys like Survey Monkey google forms that allow you

26
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.710
to create surveys about really whatever you want.

27
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.430
And then you can use e-mail or social channels to share a link to the survey and get results.

28
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.140
If you're willing to spend a couple bucks on it then you can run Facebook ads which are really really

29
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.600
easy to set up takes 20 minutes set one up design it and then get responses.

30
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.950
You can also do Google ads for responses you can actually do a Google survey ads which is something

31
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.350
they do now they insert ads randomly into pages but you only ask a couple of questions.

32
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.030
So that's another thing you can consider.

33
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.060
You can also do things like Mechanical Turk if you get a Mechanical Turk.

34
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.280
It's just a Web site where tons and tons of people are anonymous and do really really small task for

35
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.990
varying degrees of money so oftentimes the news post and say fill this survey out.

36
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.200
You meet these certain criteria and requirements and that's a really good way to easily fill these out.

37
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.840
The point here is that you don't really need to get a thousand people to answer it.

38
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.510
You get 20 or 50 depending on what it is that's really all you need.

39
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.850
Right.

40
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.700
You can get 50 people to answer a question about a new iPhone feature and then you can say to the reporter

41
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.420
is 82 percent or 85 percent of this survey said they hated that feature.

42
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.510
So let's say you've created a medical app to help trainers and coaches evaluate student athletes who

43
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.360
might have let's say on a concussion to play sports like football hockey or volleyball.

44
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.170
Well there are times when athletes collide or hit the ground hard and well if they have concussion it's

45
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.900
pretty important they sit down and get evaluated.

46
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.610
Now using a mobile app that steps trainers there a process to evaluate the athlete can be helpful ballgame

47
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.650
still going on.

48
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.800
Right now you've got some customers and you've got an active mailing list of people who want to know

49
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.960
more about what you're doing.

50
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.700
OK great.

51
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.770
Well it'd be great to get some coverage about your app from some sports medicine or reporters you have

52
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:26.670
on your list right.

53
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.740
So do a survey or a poll reach out to your customers and ask them to share some numbers about how often

54
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.620
they use the app how often athletes test positive for concussions and how the app was used.

55
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.040
In addition to the answers your questions you might also ask qualitative responses in other words stories

56
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.640
and feedback from respondents who can share specific details.

57
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.970
Beyond these questions for example one high school trainer might get back to you with a survey answer

58
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.600
and a good story about a soccer player who wanted to stay in the game after a collision and appeared

59
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.910
fine.

60
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.400
It failed the concussion test on the app so he was kept out of the game and upon further medical review

61
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.750
he indeed had a concussion.

62
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.810
Now these specific stories are pieces of data that could be valuable research for a reporter.

63
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.590
They can use them as reference to tell their story or they can use the quantitative data you have to

64
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.270
say hey guess what.

65
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.540
I surveyed my customers and I got this percentage of people saying this is what they thought about something.

66
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.640
So once you have all this data share now you've got something specific to offer them.

67
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.670
Include details about this as part of your pitch email which we'll talk about in the next few lectures

68
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.630
or just use that as a way to get their attention.

69
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.770
There you tweet at them.

70
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.360
You send him an e-mail saying hey I know you're writing about this or hey I saw an article about this.

71
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.970
Here's something that I think would help contribute if it helps to get a response in coverage from a

72
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:36.380
reporter.

73
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.140
Fantastic.

74
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.710
If not then at the very least you've collected some good feedback with your product and you have more

75
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.240
information on how people use it.

76
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.110
Maybe even a better way to make it better.

77
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.590
Either way you don't really risk a lot with this one.

78
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.240
I mean worst case scenario is it's been an hour setting it up sending it out and then collecting it.

79
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.440
And if you had to do ads and you spent 30 bucks.

80
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.430
All right this makes sense if you're thinking about what kind of data to collect for reporters on your

81
00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.850
radar.

82
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.050
Make sure you go back and forth and look at the articles they've written are there spots where they've

83
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.880
cited data from sources.

84
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.050
If you can wrap an idea of your own around the data you've collected they might be interested in what

85
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.980
you have to offer.

86
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.540
This is especially true if you're a company that has its own customers you have your own followers your

87
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.490
own e-mail list.

88
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.930
Well if you're in this space the information you can gather is incredibly valuable.

89
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.050
Same thing with like stats you can pull from your product itself.

90
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.390
These are things that you should know really helpful for a reporter who's not an expert in your space

91
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.350
as well as you are.

92
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.310
All right guys that's it for now.

93
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.530
This is a tactic you can do very easily.

94
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.040
It's a great way to wedge yourself into the radar.

95
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.150
I to see in the next lecture.
