1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,420
All right guys we're back we're now we're talking about video equipment.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:03,810
OK.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,570
Now one of the pieces of equipment that we need to talk about is the tripod.

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,550
Now you might be thinking of a tripod.

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,550
Well that means that thing with three legs you put a camera on right.

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,990
Why exactly is that important.

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,150
Can't I just set the camera on a box or table or something like that.

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,830
Absolutely.

9
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,060
You can set it on a table or a box or whatever.

10
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,780
But here's why a tripod is really more useful than just being a three legged camera Holder.

11
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:29,210
Well it provides stability for your image so there's really no shaking while you shoot cheaper tripod

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,960
might be made of plastic and can shift.

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,370
They can bend they can wobble and especially the more you use them that can actually be dangerous because

14
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,300
you can drop a lot of your stuff and break it.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,810
Now more expensive tripods remunerative like aluminum alloys or even carbon fiber like a tennis racket

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,390
and it can provide great stability for much longer times.

17
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,800
And also they can hold heavier and heavier sets on top of them.

18
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:56,400
What I generally say is invest in kind of like the second cheapest tripod at first.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,440
So if you go on to Amazon for instance and your tripod there are ten dollar ones for called Amazon basics

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,730
and those are absolute garbage like they break so quickly.

21
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,850
Having them little break in the process of mailing them to you what I generally say is just suck it

22
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:19,110
up and spend I suppose 10 spend 30 maybe 40 50 and whatever you end up getting will last you for ever

23
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,970
and you can end up reselling it if you get out of video and essentially recoup your costs.

24
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,400
I use what's called the Proline Dholakia.

25
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,620
It's just what it was which is a camera that's in that range it's really easy it's small it's compact

26
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:37,290
it's pretty easy to work with within tripods you have two different types you have ball heads and then

27
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,530
you have pan heads and that's honestly the tripod but it's a head you attach to it and a ball head.

28
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,920
You can guess it's basically at the top is going to be attached to a ball.

29
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,330
And that means that you can move your camera in any direction you want.

30
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,670
Right you can put it sideways.

31
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,180
You can put it up and tilt it down.

32
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,740
You can twist it which is a great thing if you want to do some artsy shots or something fancy you want

33
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,790
to do or if you want to save space because that actually is really small.

34
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,440
However it can be kind of a pain if you don't tighten it correctly or you have a cheap version of it

35
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,730
because your camera can slide and you won't notice.

36
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,890
Now the other one is a Panhead and really all that means is that the place where you attach the camera

37
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,500
is flat and then it has a handle.

38
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,810
And the reason why it's called a Panhead is because with that handle you can pan the camera left and

39
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,160
right.

40
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,320
And that's called a pan when you go left right like this.

41
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,810
So it's easy to make turning motions and do that smoothly.

42
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,460
Those are generally the tripods you see if you plan on having someone behind the camera the entire time.

43
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,400
Now on another piece of equipment we should talk about his memory.

44
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,330
So some cameras will store recorded footage internally using what they call flash memory which is basically

45
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:48,150
a hard drive or you could also record straight to memory cards that go in a slot which will call removable

46
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,030
flash memory.

47
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:55,680
Now in prosumer level cameras the SLR is almost always going to be recording to a camera in general

48
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,750
memory is pretty cheap.

49
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:05,310
You can get a 32 gigabyte memory card for oh man I want to say it's like 20 bucks $25 something like

50
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:11,730
that and if you really want to go crazy you get 128 gigabyte card for about $100.

51
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:17,190
Now if you're shooting in teniente P then 32 gigabytes is more than enough that a lot of time you're

52
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,410
using it for however 32 gigabytes is not going to give you much time at all.

53
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,250
You get to fill up well with under an hour of actual footage and you know there's not a whole lot to

54
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,540
say about memory cards if you're shooting for K you have to make sure that you have the right memory

55
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:30,960
card.

56
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,390
Usually they're just ones that are called Class 3 cards if you ever forget that you can just Google

57
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,900
what kind of car do I need for for k.

58
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:44,370
And usually they're just going to be the ones that are called like super fast or hyper speed or extreme

59
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,070
speed.

60
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,920
Usually they have some angle or they try to make it sound like they're super fast and that's usually

61
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,980
are talking about that we have batteries.

62
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:53,350
Right.

63
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,380
Well most cameras are going to run on batteries and that's generally kind of the standard.

64
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,970
Whenever you shoot you are using you to remember to bring as many batteries as you can because you run

65
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,400
on batteries entirely while you're kind of just grew and you're done until you can charge one and then

66
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,870
shoot again every time you charge a battery it takes at least an hour.

67
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,940
What I personally like do and this is going in my hand because I like to use what are called DC adaptors

68
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:24,360
for camera and what those are are they're actually like look like little fake batteries with cords sticking

69
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,220
out of them you stick them in body or camera and you plug them directly into an extension cord or your

70
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,940
wall.

71
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,790
That way I don't ever have to think about batteries being done.

72
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,440
Personally when I shoot I like to make sure I have everything covered.

73
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,780
So I'm not constantly stopping because the memory cards fall or the batteries dead or you know the light

74
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,600
changed or whatever it is.

75
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,390
So that just removes one extra thing I have to worry about.

76
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,740
Only you know to that is while you have a cord somewhere sometimes you might not access to power if

77
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,550
you're shooting like out doors or something.

78
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,580
Which case unfortunately you have to use a battery.

79
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:02,180
You can also do this thing called battery Grip's which friends and like the Canon 17 dieter's battery

80
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,310
Grip's and what those do doubles your battery capacity.

81
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,800
Basically there are these attachments you put on the bottom and they hold two batteries as opposed to

82
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,480
one in that situation.

83
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,820
You can actually get the cheap Chinese knockoffs of those.

84
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,920
And there are only like 40 bucks or 30 bucks or something like that.

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,530
They actually work perfectly fine.

86
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,540
Don't buy the on brand ones the Canon brand wants to charge you 100 bucks for the same thing.

87
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,280
No way it's not worth it.

88
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,300
Now what else do you need.

89
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,230
Well you might need camera bags.

90
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,290
It's really important and to go into that.

91
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,000
The other thing is the lenses now.

92
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,910
A lot of people ask How important are lenses.

93
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,500
Well it's kind of debatable.

94
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,030
I'm not a video professional so I'm going to say they're medium and.

95
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,180
If you have a really nice lens Well that could actually make up for having a cheaper camera.

96
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,750
And you have a really bad lens.

97
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,450
Well I can create a problem for even a nice camera.

98
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:56,150
The main thing with lenses is that they allow you to have different shots styles and that's really it.

99
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:01,580
Right so some lenses are going to be great for close up shots and some lenses are going to be great

100
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,090
for a wide landscape shots.

101
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,990
It just kind of pends on what you need.

102
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,350
Really the only thing I think is probably worth paying attention to you when you get into lenses because

103
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,100
you're doing marketing videos don't get too crazy with this.

104
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,060
Also this is not a cinematography course.

105
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,890
We could spend an entire course on lenses just look for the millimeter length.

106
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,630
OK.

107
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:26,180
Now what the millimeter length is going to tell you is how wide or how narrow the shot is.

108
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:33,130
Now I don't know if you do a wide angle is but a wide angle image is just an image where left and right

109
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,370
you can see more.

110
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:34,610
Right.

111
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,760
It's just a wider shot but condensed down into the same frame.

112
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,310
Now the extreme version of this is what's called a fish eye.

113
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:50,930
And basically that means that you can almost see 90 degrees left and right in the image and what it

114
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,430
does is it kind of warps the way that the image looks because how else can you fit all of that into

115
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,770
an image that should only cover say like 45 degrees each way of my vision.

116
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:06,290
So generally speaking Whiting lenses are going to really low millimeters and then zoom lenses are going

117
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,140
to be way up at the top.

118
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:13,580
You know they can be 100 millimeters plus etc. So if you for some reason want to shoot and you want

119
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,260
to use that effect or it's wide well then yeah look for something in the low millimeters.

120
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:23,150
In fact they're usually called wide angle lenses or super wide or ultra wide.

121
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:28,080
My advice is don't get into the super weeds and Ultra's but it is fun to have a wide angle lens.

122
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,510
In general I get to say avoid those because 90 percent of marketing videos.

123
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:37,220
Unless you're shooting outdoors you're just not going to want to use a wide angle lens because it's

124
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,410
not good at focusing in on one specific thing.

125
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,210
It's good at taking in all of the possible things you could see.

126
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,790
So I usually say is go for something in the middle.

127
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,050
Right.

128
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:53,120
So right now I'm shooting on a 30 millimeter Sigma and basically what that means is that it's going

129
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,880
to start there and it's going in there.

130
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,560
OK.

131
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:02,240
I could have gone more narrow in which case you would see me but you'd only see here and here and it

132
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,290
could have gone wider or you could see what goes beyond the bookcases.

133
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,310
But I knew that this is the shot I want.

134
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,020
Therefore I just want something in the middle.

135
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,790
Now one other thing that's worth talking really quickly about Lindsay is you are fixed and you have

136
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,130
zoom lenses.

137
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:20,280
Now the difference being that a fixed lens cannot zoom in or zoom out.

138
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,080
It has one literal zoom and that's it.

139
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,510
If you want to zoom out you got to move the camera backwards.

140
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,450
You want to zoom in your two forwards.

141
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,930
Now a zoom lens you can twist a little ones most you are familiar with that's going to zoom in and zoom

142
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,370
out.

143
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,810
OK well fixed lenses are less flexible.

144
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,270
Right so you need to keep in mind that if you're shooting with fixed lenses or prime lenses they're

145
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,440
also called with a prime lens.

146
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,870
Well you just need to know that you don't have to consciously move the camera if you need to zoom in

147
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,330
and out.

148
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,240
Generally those are really hard to shoot with unless you have someone in a fixed position and they're

149
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,620
not moving around or constantly changing or doing different things.

150
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,760
Obviously the advantage of the zoom it's more flexible.

151
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,940
Now here's where the cons come in prime lenses have better image quality.

152
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,530
That's it.

153
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:09,630
I mean I don't know if it's super noticeable but they do definitely have better image quality.

154
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,770
Zoom lenses don't.

155
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:15,260
And this just a function of how the Lynde's extends itself that it just doesn't have the same clarity

156
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,190
of refraction onto the sensor to get the same image.

157
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:24,260
So if you're going to shoot something like an interview right or you're going to shoe like a talking

158
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:30,230
head video explainer like I'm doing right now or even a screen cast for the same thing.

159
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:35,370
Or you know or like a talk show type style prime lenses are usually fine.

160
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,970
You're not going constantly moving the camera around but you are moving the camera.

161
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,160
You're doing multiple scenes and you're doing different things unless you know what you're doing.

162
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,080
It's a lot easier to just get a zoom lens cause I'll give you a lot more flexibility you can zoom in

163
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,600
when you want to zoom out when you want to.

164
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,480
All right so that's it for now.

165
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,810
That's the crash course you need to know about cameras.

166
00:09:53,030 --> 00:10:00,410
Now no resolution and aspect ratio is now at 4 in 10 A.P. is you now know about three different levels

167
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:06,050
of cameras and then within each one what's important then we also talked about the equipment which really

168
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:13,220
just comes down to things like memory your bag your lens and whatever you're actually going to hoist

169
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,180
the camera on.

170
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,750
Our guys in the next section we're going to talk about how to work within a budget that you've set so

171
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,330
you can put together a complete equipment package that actually makes sense for you then or going to

172
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,180
it is going to talk about how to use all the different set up especially some of the easier and more

173
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,070
common setups that a lot of people use.

174
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:28,330
All right.

175
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,090
So in the next lecture.
