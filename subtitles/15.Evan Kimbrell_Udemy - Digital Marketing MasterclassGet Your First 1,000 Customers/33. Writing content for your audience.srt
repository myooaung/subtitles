00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,160
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,380
So the last dozen or so lectures have all focused on ways you could find ideas for writing content and

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,540
then we talked about certain kinds of goals you'd want to achieve with content like building awareness

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,410
increasing engagement or generating conversions.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,720
But you know at some point you gotta start writing this stuff right.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,330
Well the writing process is obviously important.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,550
It's where a lot of these ideas and best practices all finally come together.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:34,710
But no matter who your audience is or who you are you want to make sure your content delivers the value

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,100
you actually had in mind.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,250
So in order to help you write something great.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,880
I want to share a list of topics I've picked up from my own experience.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,990
Now these are ideas you should keep in mind whenever you write anything because you want to make sure

13
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,530
your readers understand what you're trying to say.

14
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,770
Get value and that they feel compelled to share it with others.

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,540
So the first tip may sound weird considering you live on this planet but it's too bright like a human

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,320
being.

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,320
When people read pieces of content they read it in their head.

18
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,780
I know I do.

19
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,980
I'll look at a post I'll skim through it looking for the stuff I care about or if I'm really interested

20
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,150
I might actually go through it word by word.

21
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,460
But as I read it the words do sound like an actual human being is saying everything to me.

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:21,560
Basically what I'm saying is that the content should have a clear strong personal voice.

23
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,520
It should not be like a press release.

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,590
Maybe your voice is professional as if you're delivering a presentation at a conference or meeting with

25
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,570
executives.

26
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,820
Your voice might be casual as if the person reading it is a friend or a coworker or your voice could

27
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:42,840
be snarky or rebellious or inspiring or distracted whatever the voice is it just needs to match what

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,270
you've written so that when your audience reason they hear that voice that professionalism or snarky

29
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,090
ness loud and clear.

30
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,980
No it doesn't have a personality.

31
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,930
Faceless corporations and that's how you escape that.

32
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,730
For example look at Cards Against Humanity Cards Against Humanity as a party game where players are

33
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:05,260
challenged to come up with the most embarrassing and inappropriate match for a statement with a blank.

34
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,560
And it makes no sense.

35
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,480
But it'll will be like nobody's a bigger fan of blank than your mom and then you get to choose an answer

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,330
from an equally random or inappropriate set of cards like Crystal Pepsi or the Ebola virus.

37
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,310
The fun game and maybe you should check it out.

38
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,240
So other Web site.

39
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:27,240
The voice cards against humanity uses when writing their content is as embarrassing and inappropriate

40
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,220
as their game.

41
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,450
There are further questions asked by customers as your dumb questions and call their own game a party

42
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,340
game for horrible people.

43
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,280
You wouldn't catch the people behind monopoly are hungry hungry hippos running in a voice like this

44
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,250
but you know for cards against humanity it is actually very appropriate and it's consistent.

45
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,300
So what's your voice.

46
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,940
What's that personality that needs to shine through when you write your content.

47
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,750
Or let's put it another way if your company was a person what kind of person would they be.

48
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,630
A friend looking to help out as many people as possible.

49
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,550
Or maybe a nerd looking to show off everything they know it can really help to think of your company

50
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:07,320
with a persona in mind because it can make your voice that much clearer when people read what you're

51
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:07,730
writing.

52
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:13,080
Since your audience is most likely made up of customers or perspective one another important tip for

53
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,650
writing to them is to be helpful.

54
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,190
Everything you should write should help solve a problem for the reader whether it's a big problem or

55
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,350
just a little one at any given moment.

56
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,950
Your audience might be under a major deadline and need to troubleshoot a printer with a series of tutorials

57
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:33,270
or maybe they just need to know what time your store opened the next friday what ever they are of their

58
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,550
needs should guide your writing so provide information clearly and easy to digest.

59
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,880
Another tip writing for your audience is to try your best to be original.

60
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,340
I know it's hard to come up with completely original content these days.

61
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,040
Everything's a rip off of something but writing about a topic other people have written about is quite

62
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,300
common.

63
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,290
It's OK to do it.

64
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,790
Just make sure that there's some deviation.

65
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,730
So think of any type of fresh way that you can do this.

66
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:04,440
Come up with a new question about it or a new scenario involving that specific topic or a new angle

67
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,640
of looking at it.

68
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,340
In the end if you really don't have anything new to say about something maybe you just don't say anything.

69
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,540
Try something else.

70
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,340
The key here is just not to waste your audience's time with redundant or repetitive content.

71
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,680
So write like a human.

72
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,130
Try to be helpful and try to be original.

73
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,640
So far these should make sense right.

74
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:28,710
OK now here's a few more ideas on how you can write for your audience and be successful in it.

75
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:34,950
You really really really should use visuals and I know this sounds really stupid like put a photo on

76
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,000
it.

77
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:42,600
You'd be surprised how few people do it and they skip it because they think it's just too basic or obvious

78
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,940
or unnecessary.

79
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,560
You would be amazed at what a difference it makes.

80
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,260
Visuals engage people's senses and can help you communicate information better than text as you write.

81
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,800
Complement your text with visuals and try to appeal to what your audience likes best.

82
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,260
You don't know how to come up with visuals.

83
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:05,000
You can use work with someone to design it freelance gets them on fire for five blocks to make an image

84
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,550
or you can use something like Kanva and to put together your own images on the fly images make everything

85
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,160
look better.

86
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,200
Your audience might even like something like a walk through video that you create for the app you built.

87
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,980
Or they might like photo galleries of designs you've created in Photoshop.

88
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:24,280
Use visuals to break up big pieces of text and really make your content more interesting to look at.

89
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,460
It's like if you watched a lecture of me and we never put any visuals on the screen a while back.

90
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,430
The Huffington Post lifestyle blog to this person is called re-adjusted nine ways of brewing coffee

91
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,680
to find the very best method for many of us.

92
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,130
This is clearly some top shelf stuff.

93
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,450
Pulitzer level importance obviously is essential to know everything there is to know about coffee so

94
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,680
I applaud them for writing this.

95
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,400
I'm being sarcastic now.

96
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,360
They could have just proclaimed a winner with a written paragraph and just left it at that.

97
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,810
But instead they showed pictures of each of the nine coffee brewing methods.

98
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,440
A few.

99
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,630
I had never even heard of or seen before and it made for a more interesting post.

100
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,760
It's really just a simple thing that added visual interest as well as more context.

101
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,290
So remember that one please.

102
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,490
Love God put in images but also don't forget to show and tell.

103
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,290
Now the emphasis there is on the end show and tell.

104
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:22,340
For too many writers their goal is to get all the info about a topic out of their head and onto a post.

105
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,700
But just telling people about stuff is often only half the job.

106
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,940
You have to show them stuff too.

107
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:35,270
Don't be like a college lecturer just listing things out or spouting off information without showing

108
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:40,400
people how it's actually used in the real world or how the reader can use it for themselves.

109
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,320
Just joking.

110
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,560
What else would higher education be without any context.

111
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,210
In the spirit of showing and telling Well here's a listicle called sixty three generation strategies

112
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,320
and it's called from marketing wisdom.

113
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,960
Never heard of them.

114
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,850
Dizzy in wisdom I guess stands for God because you fall asleep.

115
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,270
That's how boring they are.

116
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,260
LOL It is a mess.

117
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,090
The first 21 of these strategies are accompanied by a block of text.

118
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,310
No images no videos no links.

119
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:11,440
And then the rest is just a list like they just ran out of energy or something and said like I only

120
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,620
just figure out the rest doesn't even add up to sixty three strategies.

121
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:21,230
My point here besides finish what you've started is that the content that is here is basically just

122
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:26,570
tell tell tell with no show there are no examples and very little effort was put into it.

123
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,210
Now if you can do some good showing and telling.

124
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:34,010
It might be easier to get your audience involved to something else to remember something that we covered

125
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,770
before trying to create reactions.

126
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:43,280
Some of the best content out there isn't necessarily like a big bold statement or a game changing declaration.

127
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,070
A lot of times though it's just a question that opens up possibilities for people.

128
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,480
Gets them thinking or it just gets them to chime in and represent themselves.

129
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:57,710
It's like lobbing who out there does this or a what if question into a crowd of passionate people and

130
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,680
standing back with popcorn to watch the sparks fly like hey app developers would have Android announce

131
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:09,980
their phones could now run all iOS apps or hey designers would have Adobe made all of their apps free.

132
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:15,980
Could even be as simple as hey where you're from if you want your audience to respond the best way to

133
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,570
do that is to ask them something.

134
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,790
Introduce a concept or an idea and dare people to rip it apart.

135
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,600
Writing for your audience isn't about making yourself look good.

136
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,840
It's about providing good material for your audience to enjoy and react to.

137
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,480
An interesting place to actually find reactions is from brand post on Instagram.

138
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,040
On the Go try to check it out you don't actually have to have him on your phone to do this.

139
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,990
You can do it through your web browser or just search Instagram and then search for a brand that you

140
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:39,560
can think of.

141
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:45,590
Now you could have a car company like Jeep asking where people drive their vehicles or in Airbnb case

142
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,720
asking people where they want to travel to next.

143
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,470
It really doesn't take much to give your audience a chance to join in.

144
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,180
Check out some of these accounts.

145
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,440
They're pretty good at it.

146
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:59,630
Right now there's one more tip law about you for writing content specifically for your audience.

147
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,870
Everybody just learn how to write.

148
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,740
Is that harsh.

149
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,350
Well sometimes you have to be a little bit harsh.

150
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,670
Sorry I'm not sorry.

151
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:13,680
I'm not about to teach you how to check for typos or use proper grammar or avoid run on sentences needs

152
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,180
to work on that stuff yourself.

153
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,970
Truth is if you don't write properly and your readers begin to spot errors they'll begin to distrust

154
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:20,950
what you say.

155
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,790
Les you're like one of those weird internet marketers that thinks by spelling every other word wrong

156
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,350
is more that makes your posts more personal and makes no sense.

157
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,390
Every mistake in your writing is generally like a crack in your iPhone screen.

158
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,570
No matter how small the crack is you know it's there and you can see it at the right angle.

159
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,440
If you have too many errors soon the whole thing just becomes unreadable and it's just painful when

160
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,020
it happens.

161
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,760
People generally go somewhere else.

162
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,330
So if you suck at writing much hey it's perfectly normal if you.

163
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,460
Just admitted to that you can improve.

164
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,170
Guess what.

165
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:59,570
Everybody learns how to speak English way back in like junior high and then I haven't got an English

166
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,000
class since I was 12 so it's it's not uncommon.

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,620
The best advice I can give you here is actually just to write more practice will help you improve and

168
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,970
over time you'll start to avoid silly mistakes and typos.

169
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,440
You just get better at it you'll get better at organizing your thoughts.

170
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,940
You write longer pieces you'll do it more quickly but until you're confident in your skills.

171
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,390
One tip is actually just to get an editor even if you spend five minutes helping you out with each piece

172
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,410
you create.

173
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,990
It could save you and your content from looking bad.

174
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,870
Or you can actually just go the app route and try something like early.

175
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,930
The has a free plugin that will check your writing for errors and other issues as you go through it

176
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,340
and it makes suggestions.

177
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:43,050
It's actually not a bad idea to just install this thing and get used to more red squiggly lines appearing

178
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,970
as you type and stuff so that you can start learning how to write more good or my suggestion is just

179
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:57,040
to spend an hour or two hours googling basic grammar or doing a basic UMT course on grammar.

180
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:03,810
You might think that it's beneath you or it's something that only children do but a refresher is incredibly

181
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,910
helpful.

182
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:11,730
I for the longest time had kind of forgotten what a preposition was until just like six months ago.

183
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:17,340
I just read some blog piece about proposition's how to use them correctly and now I actually remember

184
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,860
where to put commas.

185
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,490
So to recap these are the tips that will help you write write like a human.

186
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,670
Be helpful try to be original please.

187
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,370

188
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,570
Show and Tell.

189
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,850
Don't just show show show try your best.

190
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,030
Create reactions.

191
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,600
It's always free for you to do.

192
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,020
Pop a question at the end.

193
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,830
There's nothing stopping me from doing it.

194
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,340

195
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,470

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,610
