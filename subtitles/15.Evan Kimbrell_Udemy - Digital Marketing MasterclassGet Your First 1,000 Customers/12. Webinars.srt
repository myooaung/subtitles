00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,310
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:08,400
So we've talked about white papers e-books and email courses and our most recent lectures here on lead

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,650
magnet.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,330
Next up we're going to cover one more type of weed magnet that many many marketers use and that is called

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,060
the Web and are now webinars are online seminars.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,490
Generally you use an online presentation platform to give a presentation or conduct some kind of discussion

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,660
with other speakers.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,940
People sign up for this webinars and attend virtually so you can have people from virtually anywhere

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,550
watching asking questions and hopefully participating in different ways.

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,800
Voters are usually 60 minutes long that's just kind of standard and they're usually free because many

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,900
of the businesses hold webinars to generate leads for its business.

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,630
Typically it's the case that they make a pitch at the very end of the 60 Minutes like there's other

13
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:51,630
lead magnet type white papers e-books and e courses and our ads are all about giving away value in exchange

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:57,080
for email addresses and other personal info so businesses can use them for marketing and promotion.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,700
For example leave pages holds a weekly Web and promotes it with a video preview description and bullet

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,420
points you understand the value you'll get by attending.

17
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,250
Pretty common for a company to have one person in the company like the marketing person or something

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,910
do weekly webinars and you know the ideas you get to see it live.

19
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,950
Lots of interesting and someone in that company who knows what they're talking about so it's an expert.

20
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,330
So what are the benefits of creating and running a webinar.

21
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,440
Well showing off your expertise obviously is a big one.

22
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,060
If there is a topic your audience cares about holding Webinars on that topic and sharing helpful tips

23
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,180
and best practices proves your worth.

24
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,440
You've built a project management app it would make sense to hold the webinars about how to manage projects

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:37,800
better.

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,690
For example recordings of your revenuers could also be used to show off the breadth of your knowledge

27
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,400
especially if you do them consistently like once a month.

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,760
What Banaras are also an opportunity to reuse some of your best content.

29
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,410
You wrote a really good blog post about the steps to follow do know keyword research.

30
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:57,690
Google Adwords Well you could base a web on the same staps but use the format to go into deeper detail

31
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,730
and answer questions along the way.

32
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,830
Or you just use it as an opportunity to just do it as opposed to just give instructions.

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,150
Now what is an advantage over other lead magnets and that they're presented in a multimedia video type

34
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:14,580
format video webinars can't feature a shot of the presenter speaking over a full screen image of a presentation

35
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,430
slide or doing a walkthrough of an app or a platform.

36
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,350
One of my favorite benefits of these is that you only have to do them once writes a book.

37
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,850
You have to write the whole thing takes a lot of planning and creating the content.

38
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,790
Writing in and perfecting it with the webinars if you have an expert.

39
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:36,130
Not have to prep that much and you can kind of just put them on for an hour and there you go.

40
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,980
Collecting leads is certainly a benefit but with webinars you can also learn more about the attendees

41
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,110
by asking questions webinars are meant to be interactive so you could field questions from your audience.

42
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,770
But you could also plan times you asked them like poll questions have them jump in discussions and let's

43
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,120
say give them surveys after the webinars over webinars can also be a nice way to show off your personality

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,550
and make new connections the web in our format means you or another speaker will be in front be in front

45
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,160
and center.

46
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,620
Attendees will see and hear you and set of your blog posts or your web site being the voice of your

47
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,130
business.

48
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,300
You could be that voice.

49
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:15,390
Just remember unengaging web in speaker can convert a lot more attendees to paying customers than say

50
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,050
boring and unprepared one.

51
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,760
So what kind of businesses use webinars as lead magnets hold God a lot.

52
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,920
Any business that experts and expertise to share would be a good fit for webinars.

53
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,150
Secondly if you sell info products fantastic for web and are lot online courses will sell through webinars.

54
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,440
You're essentially giving a presentation on line so the more experience you have with different topics

55
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:39,780
the wider range you've got to pick from and thinking about webinars you can do business is offer some

56
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,460
kind of consulting or training services.

57
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,720
Also are natural fits Fitz's webinars and they can just offer a taste of what they do.

58
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,610
That also applies to product based businesses especially like software.

59
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,690
You can do a webinars showing how to use it or showing how awesome it is.

60
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,160
It's also something you commonly see in B2B.

61
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:03,160
So would be to be the business of business sometimes they won't even sell directly on their website.

62
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,680
Sometimes you will just want to do a demo and then sell because it's a higher contract value when you

63
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,160
actually do sell to a company.

64
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,800
These experts don't have to be people from your company necessarily.

65
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,170
Plenty of webinars are produced and hosted by one business but then feature outside experts.

66
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,260
Organizations like the wanto found the society of petroleum engineers know.

67
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,460
You know when they want to educate their members on topics like personal branding.

68
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,410
Outside experts probably probably going to be better for them.

69
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,460
Businesses that sell service platforms specially complex ones with lots of features are also a good

70
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,470
fit for webinars.

71
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,710
Being able to screencast and app talk people through steps and answer questions means the within our

72
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:46,140
format can be used for Q and A troubleshooting and potentially selling people on solutions you might

73
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:46,900
offer.

74
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,810
The platform is popular enough.

75
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,250
Think of something like I don't know Google Analytics you'll find a lot of people offer web in our training

76
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,780
including Google themselves.

77
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,590
However this leads me to the disadvantages of the Web and our format.

78
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,450
Things that you should probably keep in mind.

79
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,960
Well video recording itself might have a short shelf life after business.

80
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,640
The web aren't many of them will post their Web and are recording on their blog or an archive.

81
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,410
Or you put them on YouTube as well.

82
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:16,200
But if the subject of the web in our say is a platform it changes over time new features get added for

83
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,530
example the women are becoming out of date.

84
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,820
If you wrote a blog post on how to use something it's pretty easy to go in an edit.

85
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,050
What's changed with the web are you.

86
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:25,590
It's hard.

87
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,050
You might have to redo the whole thing even with other lead magnet formats like e-books.

88
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,850
It's pretty easy to just swap out swap out screenshots for example or change the tax when changes happen

89
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,940
with webinars.

90
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,990
Well odds are you might have to record entirely new version.

91
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:40,640
That sucks.

92
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,350
There's another issue to consider as well.

93
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,780
You need to have some presentation and public speaking skills.

94
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,030
You're not the kind of person who enjoys giving talks well webinars might not be your fit.

95
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,410
Or maybe you could find someone else to do them for you.

96
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:57,030
This forum generally requires somebody with enough confidence and experience with the topic to stand

97
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:02,220
in front of a virtual crowd or you know probably just sit with a microphone and a headset.

98
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,830
Either way you need to be able to speak well and think on your feet.

99
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,090
If you don't have the experience obviously just don't count out webinars.

100
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,600
It might just be the case that you need extra practice before you do one and I do recommend attending

101
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,060
at least a couple other ones to see what they're like.

102
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,710
Try your best to avoid the really really spammy ones though so all the really webinars have a lot of

103
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,580
potential value.

104
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:26,160
The promise of that value on landing pages and other promotional materials in ads is what can get people

105
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,320
to sign up but the quality of your webinars will keep the audience coming back and recommending you

106
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,070
to others.

107
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:37,170
So in our next lecture on how to plan and conduct the webinars of your own.

108
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:37,580
All right guys.

109
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,240
See you then.
