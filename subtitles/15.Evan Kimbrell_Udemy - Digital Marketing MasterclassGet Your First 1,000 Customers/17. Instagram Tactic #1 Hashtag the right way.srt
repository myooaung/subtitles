00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,860
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,850
So we covered a lot of Instagram Brown on our last lecture.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,360
How do you post what do you post and ways to improve those posts.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,430
Well the big ways to improve your post is the subject of this lecture here and that is hash tagging.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,420
Now you may remember a lecture I did a while back.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,110
We talked about using Twitter and hashtags to get your first bunch of customers.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:19,770
If you do.

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,490
Well that's cool.

9
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,420
If you don't it's not really a biggie.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,570
They're very similar.

11
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,380
The long and short of it is at hash tags are clickable ways to categorize your posts with topics and

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,760
other keywords so that other people can easily find them when they look at related stuff.

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,650
And those people don't necessarily follow you.

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,540
That's kind of the point.

15
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,030
That's how you get exposure to people who do not follow your stuff already.

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,600
Now while Twitter has a limit on characters Instagram actually has no such limit and you can hashtag

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,640
to your heart's content adding really as many as you want.

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,390
However the hashtags will not be visible past a certain point where then people have to hit the Like

19
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,530
view more to see it.

20
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,540
But you still will get added to these things.

21
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,110
And in fact data tells us that post with at least one hashtag get 12 percent more engagement on average.

22
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,470
Whew.

23
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:07,980
Some people recommend as many as 10 or more in fact I generally like to see something in a laugh.

24
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:14,010
I like to see at least a minimum of five five to ten I don't like seeing over ten because it just makes

25
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,220
it look ridiculously tacky or too corporate.

26
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,750
When you have 40 of them looks like a robot wrote the post.

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,000
So which hashtag should you use and how do you decide on them.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,110
Well not really depends on the post.

29
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,370
If you post a product picture well then think of tags that actually describe the product.

30
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,050
Now Best Buy posted this video to promote a cool Sony speaker.

31
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,540
They don't just feel the beat.

32
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,980
See the beat hashtag Sony audio hashtag wireless speaker at hashtag light show.

33
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,420
You know if you're new to Instagram most of these should obviously make sense.

34
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,200
The hashtags describe the product.

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,370
And if you click any of them you'll see other posts from other people on the same topic.

36
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:55,560
Now obviously you have to think why would someone be typing this hashtag in to begin with.

37
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,080
Do a lot of people look for Sony speakers.

38
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,430
Maybe if someone's interested in buying Sony speakers they might type that in.

39
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,210
Would someone be searching for light show.

40
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,450
Possibly depends.

41
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,400
I don't know if that's something that a lot of people use and if I expect to see pretty pictures while

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,790
doing it.

43
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,350
So you have to make sure that people will be searching it and what they're looking for is going to be

44
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,170
somewhat relevant.

45
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,540
MAC Cosmetics another example has a huge following on Instagram over 15 million.

46
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,510
Now in fact fashion is a big industry on the platform because of how perfectly suited it is to the content

47
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,160
that you see.

48
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,440
It's a visual product being shown on a visual channel.

49
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,340
So what exactly can we learn from this account if you have a variety of products.

50
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,970
Make sure you include a tag to identify in the photo description.

51
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,980
This picture shows a specific color of lipstick with a hashtag Russian red meaning if you click it you'll

52
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,680
probably see more people wearing that lipstick.

53
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,240
If you have a product name or variety or even a feature that's unique well then tag it consider a hash

54
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,780
tag your future customers might do if they had a little product research in mind.

55
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,420
It's kind of similar to like running Google ads what are they going to be searching for when they could

56
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,730
potentially find your product.

57
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,420
Let's say that there are people out there who are looking for you.

58
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,730
They just don't know who you are yet.

59
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,800
If they have an interest in a type of product or service they might follow that hashtag.

60
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,080
Wedding planner for example in the hopes of finding someone who could satisfy a need for them maybe

61
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,330
they need wedding planning.

62
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,500
And one way to use the perfect hashtag might be to create your own.

63
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,670
Check out this picture for example it's from buffer we love buffer and now it's a pretty impressive

64
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,220
one.

65
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,850
Buffer posted this as part of their effort to build their own community even using a branded hashtag

66
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,570
called buffer community.

67
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:38,280
Now the pic comes from one of their followers who they credit in the description.

68
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,620
So one of the wonderful features of hashtags is that they're clickable meaning you can tap that tag

69
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,970
and and see who else has posted pictures with that hashtag and their description is branded hashtag

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,360
can be a way to gather people around a topic or an interest.

71
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,980
And also keep it relevant to you.

72
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:53,370
OK.

73
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,920
Here's some other hashtag ideas to think about.

74
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,620
If you post a picture from an event well and include the event hashtag like hashtag South by Southwest.

75
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,990
If you were at that and I guarantee you people are going to be using that hashtag host a picture from

76
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:12,120
behind the scenes well then you can use the abbreviation of that which is B.S. or either you can use

77
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,770
behind the scenes or both.

78
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,300
So we will look for that because those are just more interesting photos.

79
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,910
Also you can try to hook up with weekly trends on a Thursday as people post old pictures as part of

80
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,870
what's called throwback Thursday.

81
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,930
That's always a fun time to show a really old photo could be from the 90s could for when you could be

82
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,100
from when you started your company or you can show some love and share a picture of another account

83
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,000
as part of the hashtag Follow Friday.

84
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,450
Kind of like a Pay It Forward Friday get super general if you have to.

85
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,360
What season was this picture taken in hashtag summer.

86
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,310
Hashtag winter.

87
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,610
Now are you out of ideas.

88
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,770
Well check out the top hashtags on Instagram.

89
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,170
There's a lot of inspiration there.

90
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,960
Now should you immediately start tagging your pictures with hashtag love.

91
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,850
No but this list cloud over here is going to give you some ideas about the kinds of things people post

92
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,090
and what they're looking for.

93
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,560
So if you've got an app used to find empty parking spots on local streets.

94
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,540
Kind of like haystack.

95
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,050
Except maybe you didn't get sued into oblivion.

96
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,420
Let's obviously just say this is possible.

97
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,890
Let's call it parking brake.

98
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,420
Now what visuals come to mind if you're doing a parking spot app called parking brake.

99
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:20,010
You could put a parking spot kind of obvious you could put a street full of cars you put an angry driver

100
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,210
a happy driver.

101
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,080
I don't know.

102
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,100
You can also do that thing that people sometimes do and they want to save a spot like putting a lawn

103
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,970
chair in the middle of it or like a cone obviously as if that's going to stop someone from taking it.

104
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:35,270
Okay obviously it works most of the time but that is what I kind of imagined.

105
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,010
I think of empty parking spots.

106
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,460
So let's say I took a picture of a lawn chair in an empty spot on a street full of cars.

107
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,120
Well we could make it look cool and artistic matching our style of course.

108
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,960
So what.

109
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,910
In that case would we hashtag right.

110
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,920
Like it's something that it's kind of funny seeing someone do this and we can make it stylistic and

111
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,370
artsy.

112
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,070
We could even highlight the neighborhood it's in right.

113
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,630
If you could if you're in Brooklyn you could shoot it in a way that you see the buildings behind it.

114
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,570
So if the hashtags.

115
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,430
Maybe we could do the hashtag parking brake which is our brand name definitely doesn't stop us from

116
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,100
using it.

117
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,200
Girls just do things like parking brake app because a lot of times people don't know that it's an app

118
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,060
because they just do basic things like hashtag parking solid.

119
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,410
Okay you do hashtag parking nightmare something that's funny.

120
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,240
Maybe people are looking for funny things.

121
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,860
Hashtag Save my spot.

122
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,620
Accurate.

123
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,050
Maybe you could use hashtag launch here.

124
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:22,740
I don't know.

125
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,150
Not necessarily the right connection.

126
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:29,040
I want to make but again there's nothing stopping you from putting more hashtags have you come up with

127
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,940
ten off of the back.

128
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,520
Great.

129
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,550
If you can get less than just do some research jump into the Instagram search and then see what some

130
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,430
potential hashtags bring back for your results.

131
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,800
It's pretty easy to look at competitors and see what hashtags they're using and then or you go to their

132
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,980
competitors and look at their followers and see what their followers are responding to or using you

133
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,170
don't.

134
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,170
Most of the parking spot hashtag pictures are on Instagram while they're there.

135
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:57,990
Pictures posted by angry people of a shitty parking jobs by other people.

136
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,010
This is a very commonly shared thing unlike Reddit.

137
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:07,260
People love talking about showing off people who are awful at parking parking obviously on the line

138
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,070
or parking in the ways that people can't pull in next to them or get out of their car.

139
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:15,870
There's generally a lot of angst on that hashtag so parking spot could be a fun one to actually hook

140
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,330
into especially if your photo is equally humorous.

141
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,720
You can easily just do some searches and then see if you're onto the right vibe.

142
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,170
Then decide on a group and just post away.

143
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,960
Now one thing though.

144
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,760
Try not to park yourself.

145
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,430
Guess that's a pun on the same hashtags.

146
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,840
Every single post.

147
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,030
You really do need to mix it up by all means stick with the vital ones like your brand or your product

148
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:42,180
name for starters but vary it up so that the hashtags people see on any given day are different and

149
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,960
it gives you enough exposure ultimately adding hashtags.

150
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,360
Your post extends their life and their usefulness.

151
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,790
This will improve your discover ability if that's a real word.

152
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:55,370
People will be checking out your hashtags you use well the future and it could lead to new followers

153
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,480

154
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:01,630
So make sure you have a plan to include about 10 or so five to 10 tags each time.

155
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:07,110
Make them topical make them useful or try to make them fun hashtags can help show off your personality

156
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,700

161
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,340
some effort into it.

162
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:23,570
All right.

163
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:23,910
Anyway.

164
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,480
