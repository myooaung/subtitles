00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.930
Now that we have completed the configuration of our API gateway routes for user MICRA services, it's

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.860
time to test.

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.410
If they work, let's run or debug API Gateway application.

4
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.160
You will see that it states the Naty started on 2000 as we have configured it.

5
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.180
Now, also, go ahead and run OS 2.0 authorization server

6
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:45.950
and then let's also go ahead and start use a command API and they often use a query API.

7
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.100
Bonnie, let's start use a query application.

8
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.310
OK, they're all running now, as you can see, so let's open postman.

9
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.020
The first thing we will do is to request a token.

10
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.340
And then they'd start with the user look up.

11
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.670
Let's first do a user look up to the direct port port 882 like we've done before.

12
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.190
As you can see, everything works correctly now through the API Gateway Port 2000.

13
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.160
And as you can see, we get the same results.

14
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.370
It's also search by Idy.

15
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.440
Its Take James Doe's ID there

16
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.630
and you'll also see that the user query API returns via the API gateway.

17
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:24.740
What we expect there now we will also search by filter JJ and it returns both Jane and James Doe through

18
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.530
the API Gateway Unpure 2000.

19
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.400
Now let's see if the API gateway route for registering a user works.

20
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.780
Also, at the very token, they can change the port to Port 2000.

21
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.170
And they you will see that it hit a break point.

22
00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.140
Now, I don't want to create another James Doe user, so I'm just going to stop the user command application

23
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.060
and started up again.

24
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.250
Go back to Posman,

25
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.530
change it to put 2000

26
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:26.170
kids, another JWT there for the update, and then we will test if the update works via the API Gateway.

27
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.680
And yes, there you can see it also hits our break point.

28
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.890
Again, we are not going to update just stop and start the user command application again.

29
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.690
Let's get another JWT.

30
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.100
And then we're going to see if they remove Fuser API, Gateway route works.

31
00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.420
At the new take in the.

32
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:10.660
And again, it hits our breakpoint, confirming that API gateway route for removing a user works correctly.
