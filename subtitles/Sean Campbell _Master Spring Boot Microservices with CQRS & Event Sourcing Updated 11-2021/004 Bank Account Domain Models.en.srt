1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:07,360
Now that we have completed the project set up, we can begin to implement our bank account micro services.

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:15,450
Let's start by creating a bank account domain model, navigate the models package under the bank account

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,790
called Project, creates a new class and call it bank account.

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:31,830
First, let's annotate our bank account model class with the entity annotation entities and JPA are

5
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:38,840
nothing but plain old Java objects that represent data that can be persisted to a database.

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,260
More specifically, an entity represents a table in a relational database.

7
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:53,250
In our case, my sequel and an instance of an entity represents a row in a relational table.

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,320
Now let's add the data annotation to reduce the boilerplate code.

9
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,660
The old constructor?

10
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,150
No ARC's constructor.

11
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,680
We can also add the boulder annotation.

12
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:21,500
Let's create a idy the idea annotation specifies that the I.T. field is the primary key of the entity.

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,780
It's also create an account holder I.D. field.

14
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,390
This is going to be the user ID from our user MICRA services.

15
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,390
It's at a creation date.

16
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,040
Also, add a private feel for the account type.

17
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,100
Now let's go ahead and create an Inam count type.

18
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:06,500
You can edit in the same package, let's add a savings and a current account time, OK?

19
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,590
And then our final field is a field for the balance of the account.

20
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,160
OK, now copy the package name.

21
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:32,600
Let's go over to our application clause in our Query API.

22
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:45,330
And here we will tell the application class to scan for the entity by using the entity scan annotation,

23
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:56,460
and yes, we will set the base packages to the package where our bank account model is situated.

24
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,890
Let's go ahead and build our project.

25
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,340
And everything should build successfully.
