00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:08.190
In this lecture, we are going to initialize and generate Auth 2.0 authorization server project using

2
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.380
the spring initialise.

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.620
We will also do the initial setup by configuring additional dependencies and by marking our application

4
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.010
as a authorization server navigate to start that springboard IO.

5
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.660
We will still use MAVEN as both automation tool Java and then version two point three point one as the

6
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.010
latest spring boot version.

7
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:39.660
The time of this recording again, choose Kamden Spring Bank as your group name and for the artifact

8
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.040
let's call it user dot o 2.0.

9
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:56.170
We can also go ahead and give our application a proper description, let's call it Oath 2.0 authorization

10
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.850
server,

11
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.820
our packaging type Stagedoor, and we'll use Java 14.

12
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:14.920
Now, go ahead and add the dependencies at Spring Web, Spring Security and spring data.

13
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.030
Mongo DB.

14
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.280
Click on Generate.

15
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:36.840
Now, I'm going to move the downloaded project to the project where my other exercise files are all

16
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.920
extracted here.

17
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.170
Now let's go to intelligence or to your ID and intelligence.

18
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.340
You can simply right.

19
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.050
Click on the XML file and click on ADD as Mavin Project.

20
00:01:50.010 --> 00:02:00.960
Then open up the parent projects aimed at XML file and let's add the user dot org 2.0 project as a module.

21
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.500
Now let's open the XML file of our OS 2.0 project.

22
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.850
Now we need to add a few manual dependencies that is not available in the spring initialise.

23
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.300
Firstly, we will go ahead and add spring security oath to.

24
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:39.390
We can take the latest release version, let's add another dependancy spring security JWT.

25
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.440
Again, take the latest version.

26
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.760
We also need to add a few EXPE dependencies, starting with Jay EXPE core.

27
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.350
The second day EXPE dependency that we will add is Jay EXPE API.

28
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.750
And then the final Jay EXPE EMPL.

29
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:36.310
OK, now let's open up the application file and at the end enable authorization server annotation to

30
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.790
enable our application as authorization server.
