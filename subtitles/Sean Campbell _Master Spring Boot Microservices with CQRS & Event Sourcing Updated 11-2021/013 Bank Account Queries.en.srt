1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,250
It is now time for us to implement the query side of our bank account domain.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,670
Let's start by creating our query objects.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,470
We are going to create four query objects, including one for returning all accounts.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,730
Another returning a bank account by ID.

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,030
Another for returning an account by Holder.

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:28,530
And finally, one for returning accounts with balances that are greater or smaller than a give and balance.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,740
Navigate to the queries package and the bank account query API project.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,430
Creates a new class and Corlett find all accounts query.

9
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:49,710
Now we don't need to add any fields, create another class and call it find account by Idy query

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,370
again at the data annotation as well as the all ARC's constructor annotation.

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,480
And then we only need to add a single field, basically a field for the idy.

12
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,610
OK, add another query.

13
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,080
Object Aulet find account by holda id.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,040
We can copy the annotations.

15
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:35,000
And then we will add also only a single field, basically the account holder is

16
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:44,960
OK, and then our final query object, the find a card with balance query

17
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,240
also at the annotations data and all constructor.

18
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:03,320
And then we'll add two fields first and enum that we are going to create just now equality type.

19
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,360
Let's go ahead and added and Dito.

20
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:23,340
Add a new Inam, call it a quality type, the first Inam will be greater than basically four accounts

21
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,700
with balances greater than and less than.

22
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,190
OK.

23
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,280
And then add another field.

24
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:47,560
For the balance, so basically this query object will allow us to return balances that are greater than

25
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,410
or less than a certain balance.

26
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,150
OK, let's go ahead and build our applications.

27
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,850
Everything should build successfully.
