00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.660
The next thing that you need to install is the Exxon platform.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.870
There are two ways that you can do it.

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.500
You can either install it on your local machine or you can run it in Docker.

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.600
Now we are going to run it in Docker, and if you haven't used Docker before, you are about to be pleasantly

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.500
surprised.

6
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.850
Just easy.

7
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:28.800
It is to run an application in Docker, but we specifically want to run it in Docker because our containers

8
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.590
needs to connect to the name of a container.

9
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.030
In this case, the Exxon server, and it will not be able to connect back to Oracle machines if it's

10
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.610
on a separate server, that wouldn't be a problem.

11
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.450
But for containers to connect back to local host, it will be a problem because in the context of the

12
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.260
container, localhost means local to the container and not local to the local machine or host.

13
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.890
You can see the document that we are going to use to run the excellent server in a Docker container.

14
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.600
So to run the excellent server, let's use the command Docker Run DSD for detached.

15
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.580
Else, it will be connected to this terminal.

16
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.670
And then let's give it a name, which refers to the container name, let's call it Exxon hyphen server.

17
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.100
And then we need to specify two sets of ports with Dash Space, External Port, Colon, Internal Port

18
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.830
1824 and all six space ports.

19
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.170
Eight one two four.

20
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.510
And then we need to put all of our containers in the same network so that they can communicate with

21
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.140
each other.

22
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.940
You can specify this with Dash Test Network space and then the network name.

23
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.360
Let's call ours Springbank Net.

24
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.270
And then we will specify the container restart policy with Dash Dash Restart, and let's make it always

25
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.520
meaning that it will always start up.

26
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.430
It will always restart if anything goes wrong with the container.

27
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.670
And then lastly, we need to specify the image name.

28
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.290
We can specify this x sonic, which is the Docker hub repo forward slash excellent server, which is

29
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:18.120
the image name Kurland latest basically saying that we want the latest version and then let's run the

30
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.800
Docker command again.

31
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.350
And there you can see that excellent server container has been deployed.

32
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.350
Now open your browser and navigate to local host port at 24.

33
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.040
There you can see the Exxon dashboard.

34
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.550
And there you will see the excellent server instance.

35
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.420
And later on, we can view the commands and queries when we start implementing microservices.
