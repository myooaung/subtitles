00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:09.330
In this lecture, I'm going to introduce you to API Gateways and the Spring Cloud Gateway, an API gateway

2
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.510
creates a unified entry point that cloud applications can use to access MICRA services.

3
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.430
It acts as a reverse proxy that reads the HTTP requests that are made by clients to the correct backing

4
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:31.200
micro services API gateways can also perform other important functions, such as client authentication,

5
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.860
load balancing and SSL termination.

6
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.480
Sprinklered.

7
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.410
Gateway provides a library for building an API gateway on top of spring NVC.

8
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:51.120
It provides a simple and effective way to route incoming requests to the appropriate destination using

9
00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:00.060
Gateway Handly Mapping Sprinklered Gateway users Naty Server to provide non blocking asynchronous request

10
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.960
processing.

11
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:09.560
Now, let's look at how the sprinklered Gateway works, client applications would typically make request

12
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:17.000
to sprinklered Gateway if the Gateway handler mapping determines that request matches an API gateway

13
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.260
route, it is sent to the Gateway Web handler.

14
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.010
This handler runs the request through a photo chain that is specific to the request.

15
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.200
The reason the filters are divided by the dotted line is that filters can run logic both before and

16
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.420
after the proxy request is sent.

17
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.570
All prefill to logic is executed.

18
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.120
Then the proxy request is made.

19
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.850
After the proxy request is made, the post filter logic is executed.

20
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:54.620
Let's look at what you are going to learn in the section, you're going to learn how to create an API

21
00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:01.210
gateway with sprinklered Gateway, then you will learn how to configure API gateway routes.

22
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.430
And then finally, you're going to test the API gateway routes after you've configured them.
