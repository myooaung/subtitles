1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:08,340
Navigators started at Spring Dot Io so that we can generate our bank account MICRA service projects

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:17,660
like we've done with our user MICRA services projects for both automation tool use Mavin Language Java

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,700
Spring Boot Version two point four point one as the latest table release version at the time of the

4
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,500
recording.

5
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,900
Again, make the group name come that spring bank for artifact.

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:43,230
Let's use bank I.C.C. for count dot com the dot API for description, bank account command API project

7
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,720
leave the packaging type jar and select Java 15.

8
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,510
Then we add the spring whip dependancy.

9
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,680
And spring security for the command API, click on Generate.

10
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:21,640
Now for a bank account query API changed that to bank account query API project, and we need to add

11
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,200
two more dependencies.

12
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,740
Spring day to JPA.

13
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:35,150
And the my sequel driver click on Generate again.

14
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,950
And then finally, let's generate our bank account called Project.

15
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:53,200
Change that to core and then we can take away the spring rape dependency because we will not expose

16
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,030
any restful endpoints.
