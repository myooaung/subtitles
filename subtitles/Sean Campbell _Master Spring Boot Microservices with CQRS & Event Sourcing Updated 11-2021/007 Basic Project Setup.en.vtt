00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:08.820
In this lecture, we are going to set up the basic structure of our user micro services project.

2
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:17.940
Let's go ahead and create a new Mavin project that we are going to call user management.

3
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:27.480
This is basically our parent project that will bring all the user microsurgeons projects together.

4
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:36.420
Let's also use the common spring bank name here and select a proper version version 1.0.

5
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.970
Now, the first thing that we need to do is to delete the source folder under the parent poem project.

6
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:56.910
Then we can go ahead and locate the generated user MICRA services projects that we have downloaded from

7
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.380
the spring initialise.

8
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.560
I'm going to move them to the exercise files location that I'm using for this cause.

9
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.190
By the way, you can find these exercise files under the resources section of this lecture.

10
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.580
OK, I'm going to extract the project here.

11
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:30.880
Let's just delete those folders and then you'll see they will be located and the user management directory.

12
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.920
OK, to make it a parent project, we need to specify the packaging type ASPO.

13
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.700
Now let's add each of the projects as modules to the parent project.

14
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.660
Let's start with the library project.

15
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.940
Use it at core, then add the User Command API project.

16
00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.350
And finally, we'll add the user query API project.

17
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.540
Now, this is basically our multi maven project.

18
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.100
The next thing that we are going to do is to turn the user, that core project into an actual library.

19
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.960
The first thing we need to do is select a proper version.

20
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.680
Like we've done with the parent project, and then the biggest thing is to remove the Springboard Maven

21
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.000
plugin built section.

22
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.090
OK, now that we've done that, we can delete our application clause.

23
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.700
And then once we've done that, we can also delete the text on the application.

24
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.740
And that would basically turn our use of coal project into an actual library project.

25
00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:04.320
So let's go ahead and build our project and MAVEN would basically build our project and run the tests

26
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.320
on the command and query API projects and then hopefully everything succeeds.

27
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.340
OK, that concludes the basic set up of a user management project.
