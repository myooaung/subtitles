00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.600
The next thing that we need to deploy is my sequel, because, like I've said in the introduction lecture

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.310
that we will actually use different database types as part of database per service approach.

3
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:23.730
So because our user microservices will have data sovereignty over the user data and our bank and microservices

4
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.280
data sovereignty over the bank account database, we can have separate database types.

5
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.980
And that is exactly what we are going to do in this course.

6
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.220
So for our read database on the bank account side, I opted for a MySchool database, but it could have

7
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.950
been a Microsoft SQL database.

8
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.650
Raiders could have been Cosmos DB.

9
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.610
It could have been any other database type that you would prefer Postgres sequel, whatever it may be.

10
00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.230
So to start with my sequel again, we need to run it in Dhaka to allow our containers to communicate

11
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.340
with my sequel.

12
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.520
And again, we are going to install client tools, but this time we will also install the client tools

13
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.450
using Docker.

14
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.160
Now there is a common client tool for my SQL called at Minah.

15
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.210
It works very well.

16
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.690
It's not the prettiest client tools, to be honest, so if you want something more shinier, you can

17
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.540
go for something like my school workbench.

18
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.440
So again, in the terminal, we can execute the command docker run.

19
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.600
Dash it Dash D.

20
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.870
Let's call our container my school hyphen container.

21
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.680
For the ports, we can use the default MySchool ports three, three zero six internal or external.

22
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.250
Let's also put it in the Springbank Knit Network.

23
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.370
And then she allows you to provide environmental variables.

24
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.720
Now we are going to use it to specify the my school root password and lists use something simple like

25
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.410
Springbank Route P is W now this is just for simplicity's sake, so please use something more complex

26
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.550
in production.

27
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:23.220
The restart policy always again and then will also provide a volume my school and the school data and

28
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.290
the school container.

29
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:32.030
Similarly to what we've done with the MongoDB container and then after the on which is the location

30
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.480
within the container before the colon is the location on our host machine.

31
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.700
It also again pulled the my sequel latest image from the Docker hub repo.

32
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.080
Let's clear the terminal for some space and rent duck space again.

33
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.360
And you can see that my school container has also now been deployed.

34
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.790
And then finally, let's deploy the admin client tools again.

35
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:19.050
Docker Dr. Dash I.T Dash for detached name container name at minor ports, let's use something as simple

36
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.170
as 880.

37
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:28.050
Now, a lot of people already have 80 80 in use, so feel free to use anything else but do not use 80,

38
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:37.890
81, 82 1991 1992 or 80 84 because those are the ports we will use for the microservices that we are

39
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.790
still going to build, as well as Port 2000 to keep those reserved.

40
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:54.300
And then for environmental variable, let's specify at minor on the default and this goes server and

41
00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:01.020
said that equal to the my school contain a name and that is to set up the default connection.

42
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.030
And then again, restart policy always.

43
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:22.160
And then as the image name at mine and latest now again, it pulls the image from the Docker hub repo.

44
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.180
And then once it's completed, we can run duck pace again, and you will see that at Minor has also

45
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.260
now been deployed and is listed as a running container.

46
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:44.170
OK, so go ahead and open your browser and navigate to local host Port 880 or the port you used for

47
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.210
at Minor Username Route.

48
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:54.010
And then the post we just specified for the MySchool container, which is Springbank Route is W..

49
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.200
And there you will see that we only have the system databases as default.

50
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.520
And that concludes the setup of all of our prerequisites.
