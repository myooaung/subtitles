00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:07.960
Insecure is an event sourcing once a command is handled, an event is raised store to the event store

2
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.110
and publish to an event base.

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.510
Therefore, we need to create an event object for each of the command objects that we created in the

4
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.750
previous lecture.

5
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:25.390
Thus, we are going to create an account, open the event funds deposited event funds, withdrawn event

6
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.760
and an account, close the event.

7
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.070
Let's navigate to the event package under the bank account called Project.

8
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.200
Creates a new class and call it account opened event.

9
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:56.190
Let's begin at the data annotation and the builder annotation, the account open event object will look

10
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.830
much like the open account command object.

11
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:07.650
We will again add an ID field, also a field for the account holder ID,

12
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.700
a field for the account type.

13
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.630
Another field for the creation date, basically the date that the account was opened.

14
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:46.160
And then finally, I field for specifying the balance that we are opening the account with.

15
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.270
Creates another class and call it funds deposited event.

16
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.510
Ken will add the data and build the annotations

17
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.340
and an ID field,

18
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:31.980
a field for the amount that was deposited and then also a field for the ballots where we will add the

19
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.720
updated ballots once a deposit has been successfully completed.

20
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.000
OK, let's create another class and call it funds withdrawn event.

21
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:59.780
Just going to paste the annotations there and copy all the fields from the funds deposited event and

22
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.720
paste it in the funds with drawn event, and then finally, let's create an account, close the event

23
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.350
object.

24
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:21.790
Again, we can copy the annotations and we just need an ID field for the account closed event.

25
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.600
OK, now we have created all of our event objects.

26
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.530
Let's go ahead and build our projects.

27
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.490
And everything should build successfully.
