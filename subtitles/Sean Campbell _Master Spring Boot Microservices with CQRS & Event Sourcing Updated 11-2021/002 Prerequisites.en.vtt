00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.390
In this lecture, we will go through all the prerequisites that you need to install before you can start

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.310
building your microservices.

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.440
Let's have a look at the tools and technologies that you will need the after.

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.150
I'll provide you with links we can down at each of the respective tools and technologies.

5
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:26.430
Importantly, I uploaded a file in the resources section that contains all of these download links and

6
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.600
Docker commands.

7
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.680
The first thing that you will need is the Java development kit with JDK eight as a minimum.

8
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.220
You will also need a built automation tool.

9
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:47.340
And for this course, we will use MAVEN only then you will need an I.D. or code editor such as Intelligent

10
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.160
NetBeans Eclipse or the Popular Vehicle Code Code Editor.

11
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.570
You will also need postmen.

12
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.940
The Exxon platform.

13
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.080
Mongo DB and my sequel.

14
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:14.420
For the JDK or Java development kit, you can either go for the open JDK or Oracle JDK.

15
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.410
Now I'm using open JDK 15.

16
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:26.180
So if you want to follow exactly what I'm doing, then I'll recommend that you also install JDK 15.

17
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:36.230
You can get the open JDK from open JDK to Java, that net forward slash install and the Oracle JDK from

18
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:45.070
Oracle dot com forward slash Java forward slash technologies forward slash Java s e hyphen downloads

19
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.130
dot html.

20
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.890
And once you've installed the JDK, we can run the following command.

21
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.040
I'm going to open my terminal and run Java Dash version.

22
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.840
And there you can see that I'm using open JDK 15.

23
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:13.830
Then for MAVEN, you can download MAVEN from MAVEN Dot to patchy dot org forward slash down the dot

24
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.820
CGI.

25
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.800
And once you've installed MAVEN, you can run either MAVEN Dash V or MAVEN.

26
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:30.090
Dash Dash version and as you can see, I'm using MAVEN three point 6.3.

27
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.770
And then you need to install an I.D. or code editor.

28
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:44.490
Now most of you will probably already have a JDK installed, as well as MAVEN or Gradle as bold automation

29
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.000
tools.

30
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.060
And then obviously an I.D. as well.

31
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.170
I'm just including this for developers that are new to Java.

32
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.250
You can download interrogÃ© from Jed brains that.

33
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.690
Com Forward slash idea forward slash download.

34
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.410
I'm going to use intelligence in this course.

35
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:11.070
So if you don't have an I.D. installed yet and you want to follow exactly what I'm doing, I can recommend

36
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.500
the intelligence community version.

37
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:22.310
You can also download NetBeans from NetBeans that Apache dot org food slash download forward slash indexed

38
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:31.560
HTML eclipse from Eclipse, that oak food slash downloads and voice code code that visual studio dot

39
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.360
com forward slash download.

40
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.520
For.

41
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:43.770
You can download it from Postman dot com forward slash downloads and then probably one of the most exciting

42
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.340
tools that we are going to use in this course is Docker.

43
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:55.710
I've added a direct link for Docker, for Mac or Windows from Docker dot com forward slash products

44
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.110
forward slash Docker desktop.

45
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:08.940
I've also added multiple Linux downloads, one for Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS and Fedora.

46
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:17.250
I'm not going to read out all of these your eyes, but please look in the pre-requisites installation

47
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.010
file that I've attached in the resource section.

48
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:29.820
And then finally, once you've installed Docker, you can run Docker version and as you can see, I

49
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.180
am running Docker version nineteen point zero three point one three, and then you can also see the

50
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.050
build number.

51
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.340
Importantly, you have to start all Docker commands with Sudo, which refers to running commands in

52
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.450
Linux with security privileges or as a super user.

53
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.660
The equivalent in Windows would be to run command prompt or PowerShell as administrator.

54
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.450
We can use the command sudo Docker pass.

55
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.190
And then you can see that no containers are currently running.

56
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:09.660
We are going to run a few of our dependencies in Docker instead of installing them onto our local machines

57
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.280
in the traditional fashion.

58
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.700
But before we can do that, we need to create a Docker network so that our containers will be able to

59
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.590
communicate with one another.

60
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:26.490
Therefore, we are going to run the following Docker command have been your terminal and run Docker

61
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:36.930
network create Dash Dash Attachable, which will allow us to manually attach our containers to this

62
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.540
network that we are about to create.

63
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.510
Then Space Dash D, which allows us to specify the network driver.

64
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:52.170
Let's go for overlay, which would enable this network to span multiple Docker hosts.

65
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.820
We are, however, only going to work with a single Docker host in this course.

66
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.910
So you could really change overlay to bridge.

67
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.910
However, I'm going to leave it as overlay.

68
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.380
Then lastly, let's give our network a name.

69
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.120
Let's call it Springbank net hit.

70
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.690
Enter.

71
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.160
OK, now go ahead and run Ducker network.

72
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.820
Else to list all of the Docker networks on the host.

73
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.590
And then you can see our newly created Springbank Net Network.
