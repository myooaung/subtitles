1
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.130
All right.

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.740
So let's take a look at the Jupiter notebook that we are going to basically use to develop our machine

3
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:18.250
learning algorithm where we going to classify Again cancer in two or tumours in two malignant or benign

4
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.930
cancers here and just include a kind of a quick description of the problem statement.

5
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.880
Again we have our feature sets.

6
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.570
We have three features and kind of all occurred are presenting the characteristics of the cell or the

7
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.020
nucleus that you're paying out of the patient.

8
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.840
So we have reduced tecture of premiere areas mootness and so on datasets in general they are linearly

9
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.750
separable.

10
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.450
OK.

11
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.150
And we have we have 500 to 16 insistences and classes they are divided into two hundred and twelve malignant

12
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.290
cases and 357 benign kits.

13
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.540
OK.

14
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.990
So in total we're going to be five hundred and sixty nine.

15
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.520
And again the top of the class we're going to be either a malignant or benign.

16
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.010
All right.

17
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.770
You guys can download the data set.

18
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.630
If you follow that link or you can again I'm going to show you.

19
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.990
We're going to use the skm learn to actually load our deed.

20
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.950
All right so let's get started.

21
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.460
So first step is we're going to import all the libraries that we need.

22
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.100
OK.

23
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.680
So first step is going to import penders spdr.

24
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.430
What do you spend the suspenders.

25
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.350
Mainly it can be used as a library that can be used for data manipulations using data frames.

26
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.860
It's kind of like kind of Excel basically for Python.

27
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:30.560
Right.

28
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:38.200
And then the next step we're going to import nump high as MP nump I can be use ported data statistical

29
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.100
analysis.

30
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.690
Right.

31
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.550
And then moving forward we're going to import.

32
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.240
Matt plotly had met La lib.

33
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.600
Pipelet as PLG.

34
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.830
Okay.

35
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.690
And then afterwards we're going to import what we call it seaborne again metalled label can be used

36
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.220
for data visualization.

37
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:05.100
And I'm going to use kind of a library that we call it seaborne which is very powerful to do statistical

38
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.110
data visualization.

39
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.310
I'm going to show you the power and the beauty of Seymour as we move forward.

40
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.910
So going to import seaborne as s.a..

41
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.690
Right.

42
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.120
That's pretty much the first step.

43
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.110
It's done the celso so once would undersell it tells us OK so that means it's loading.

44
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.700
And we're a good case once you see the number of that means to a good the next step is going to actually

45
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.740
lower the actual kenzer datasets.

46
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.570
So I'm going to say from Escuela in the assets.

47
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:50.080
Import we're going to load the business on low breast cancers are going to load underscore breasts underscored

48
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.620
cancer cancer.

49
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.090
Okay.

50
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.200
So the first step.

51
00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.200
So that window the data first and then second step would connect connected kind of an instance of that

52
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.740
low bit low breast cancer.

53
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.630
So we're going to do cancers equals we're going to take simply the load get Ken low low breast cancer.

54
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.520
Let's see here I'm is going to take an insistence on it.

55
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.640
Let's stay on it.

56
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.690
Now we have our cancer information.

57
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.380
Okay that's all pretty much the data.

58
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.460
Let's take a look at it let's view it.

59
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.510
So we're going to just run this cell that would show us basically okay.

60
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.600
So we have the data that's kind of the numbers that we have all the features you know we have all the

61
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.460
Target data showing is a zero order one showing simply if the cancer is malignant or benign.

62
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.530
And he would just you know a bunch of like messed up information as you can see here.

63
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.560
So let's see how can we view the data in a better better format so we click a that will simply create

64
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.430
your cells as a human is going to be creating couple of you were.

65
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.770
That's right.

66
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.800
So the next step is we wanted to see okay the key is within the cancer.

67
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.050
Okay let's see the kind of the titles.

68
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.740
Okay.

69
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.480
The key is within that dictionary.

70
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.380
So we're going to do was going to say Cancer keys and that will tell us pretty much looking at what

71
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.760
columns that we have or what dictionaries that we have.

72
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.870
So we have the data we have our target how our target Nemes which is kind of the title of the target

73
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.290
which is simply going to be malignant or benign description.

74
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.040
I'm going to tell us the description of the data and then going to have all the feature names which

75
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.120
is the actual feature name scanning screen or radius perimeter and so on.

76
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.650
Okay so let's print them all one by one.

77
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.660
Okay so the first up we're going to print right now in a print cancer and then we're going to do that

78
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.970
we're going to select the description section describe hey let's click run.

79
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.460
Once we see here it's actually going to show you in kind of the information that we wanted to view earlier.

80
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.260
But in a better format.

81
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.940
So we're just going to show you look at number of instance we have a 69 attributes 30.

82
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:55.220
And if you guys can see these are all the information regus pre-eminent and so on and so forth.

83
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.380
If we scroll down as we're sure the classic malignant or benign.

84
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.230
And if you go down it was just going to show you all the minimax or the values or the minimax or the

85
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.480
value.

86
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.630
So basically I'm sure you'll hear all the differences you know like the date 1995 and so on and so there's

87
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.410
kind of a quick description let's do the same as well.

88
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.580
So let's keep going.

89
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.210
So let's print.

90
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.670
We're going to do they're going to print cancer.

91
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.290
But we are going to select Instead our targets.

92
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.320
So I told you it's not going to admit that we're simply going to show us all the detailed information.

93
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.660
That's kind of the target class which is either a zero or one way.

94
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.540
Well again I'm going to do print and we're going to open and thinking about cancer.

95
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:45.600
And then going to select simply the target Nemes target underscored the names that would tell us.

96
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.610
Either we have to classic the malignant or benign.

97
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:55.580
They use one more time but before they featured names so let's print and then I'm going to buy cancer

98
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:03.930
sorry cancer and then we are going to selects simply our featured names.

99
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.210
It's going to take features.

100
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.690
Underscore names that will tell us simply all the feature names that we have.

101
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.990
So I mean regus infection and so on so forth.

102
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.890
All right.

103
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.640
So what if we wanted to look at the for example the shape of the of the data so we could do with it

104
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.400
going to write again cancer.

105
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:29.390
And then we're going to select the actual data which is simply all and we look at the data and then

106
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.490
apply a method for what shape they can tell us what's the shape of it.

107
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:41.060
So here we have as we expected we have five hundred and sixty nine Okay rolls or data sets and have

108
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.450
three columns three columns indicating three features.

109
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.010
Simply put right.

110
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:51.590
So the first step is what we're going to do in order to deal with it in a much easier way.

111
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.400
We're going to create a better frame.

112
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.090
Okay.

113
00:06:54.190 --> 00:07:00.020
When we see a frame it would make our life ten times easier when we simply use penders later for him

114
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.910
to actually present the data.

115
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.710
And let's see how can we how can we do this.

116
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:12.050
So simply what we could do actually have the mandate here so we could do that we could drive PD the

117
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:18.010
airframe that would create a data frame out of our cancer data and the target there.

118
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:24.740
So here we're going to specify cancer data and target which means that we're going to include 30 columns

119
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.020
of all the data we have and then can add an additional column which the first column that includes a

120
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:35.390
target date which is kind of you know we can include all the training the NSA all the inputs and outputs

121
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.670
in just in one kind of data frame.

122
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:39.180
All right.

123
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.190
And he's not going to mention columns or specify the columns going to specify in P that append.

124
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:49.880
We're going to use append which is simply just to append two vectors or two columns together.

125
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.360
So going to have cancer but feature names and then we have target as well.

126
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.940
All right let's run.

127
00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:01.060
This comment will simply create a frame of d.f. underscored.

128
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.760
Right.

129
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.170
Let's support the date offerings for I am d.f. underscore cancer.

130
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:13.270
Okay let's say we specify want to look at the first couple of the titles and the first couple of rows.

131
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.880
Okay.

132
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.390
So if we're right ahead they'll actually tell us of case we have them.

133
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:17.940
Yes.

134
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.690
I mean picture been premature and so on.

135
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.670
And if we keep going that we've tell us target as well which is pretty cool.

136
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:31.880
So now we have all our 30 basically features along with the target which is along with the goal or the

137
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.350
objectives that we wanted to implement.

138
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:34.980
Right.

139
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:35.700
Okay.

140
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:41.360
What I wanted to simply look adf cancelled as well but I don't want to look again let's create some

141
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.570
yourselves in here.

142
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.860
And let's instead of cleaning the hair let's look at the tail.

143
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.380
Let's look at the end of it should that make sense.

144
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.250
We have five hundred and sixteen find a 68.

145
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.440
And we have 31 columns again.

146
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:58.400
If we scroll down here again we'll see all the data but that's who we are looking at the last semples

147
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.360
basically.

148
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.030
Right.

149
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:00.620
OK.

150
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.450
Great.

151
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.000
That's pretty much all what we need to load the data.

152
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:08.740
The next step is that we wanted to check and just going to go and delete all these cells should I need

153
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.060
them.

154
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.140
So let's take a look at how can we visit the data.

155
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.140
So we're going to do.

156
00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:19.860
They're going to use peer plot count plaque and scatterplot to actually view all the data using the

157
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.010
seaborne library.

158
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.810
So first let's try the plot.

159
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.270
I'm going to give you just you know on it.

160
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:30.430
First just to give you an idea for what the purpled does actually particle it give you get of a one

161
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.410
a one stop shop a quick glance at the entire data in one place.

162
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.260
So let's get started.

163
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:43.180
We're going to we're going to get a sense the pair the pair plot and what to do with think going to

164
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:44.550
IDF kinser.

165
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.490
We're going to call it the refrain.

166
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:47.860
We're going to do it.

167
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.890
We're going to use simply what variables do we need.

168
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:51.530
OK.

169
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.700
So what we're going to do.

170
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.220
They're going to write the virus which is all the very ones that we want.

171
00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:56.720
OK.

172
00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.940
I'm not going to plot all the 30 samples.

173
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:03.200
I'm going to plotless see the first five or four six OK have them copied here so we're going to just

174
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:09.470
going into the membraneous mean that Shesh area I mean pre-eminent use this day one very well that we

175
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:15.470
need to let's actually let's go unplugged this for us and see what's going to happen as best I can see

176
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:16.080
here.

177
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.660
It's actually really powerful.

178
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:24.290
You can see it just showing you all going to one step or the relationship between the radius or the

179
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:29.980
video that we chose with the means smaller than it's been pre-eminent in area and so on.

180
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:34.330
So the only problem is we can actually do the deed and it just looks fine to me.

181
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:39.140
But the only problem is that in sure the Tonga class it does ensure the actual look which one of these

182
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.060
samples is malignant and which one of them is benign.

183
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:48.080
So what we're going to do instead I'm going to actually write in a select call Hugh which is specify

184
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.530
the targets class.

185
00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:55.490
So going to H U E equals going to specify what you use a column which has.

186
00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:02.960
Okay to simply specify that going to use the target column which is simply this column right here which

187
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.800
is indicated.

188
00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:04.710
See you on one.

189
00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:05.350
Okay.

190
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.800
Kind of the hue which is indicating the cup.

191
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.200
Let's run this and see what's going to happen.

192
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.740
Well actually that's pretty mild this way better.

193
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.020
So as you can see here in classifiers as well.

194
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:23.130
Sure your key target if it's 0 0 1 0 0 indicates malignant and one in the kids benign.

195
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:29.320
What I mean by this is the blue points in here that's the malignant case.

196
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:34.690
That's mean the kind of his feet severe case or like the life threatening case per say.

197
00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:41.740
So here you would see that area for instance for malignant cases a little bit more compared to the benign

198
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.060
cases the mean Premarin is a little bit more.

199
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.940
You will see that kind of the main area here is a little bit more.

200
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.280
You will see that even the distribution.

201
00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:57.160
So this is kind of a distribution that shows you the distribution of samples for the memory as you can

202
00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.650
see the radius for the malignant cases.

203
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:01.750
Actually more is actually higher.

204
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:07.310
And if you differ about the images that we had before actually let's go and view the images.

205
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.270
So.

206
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:15.890
So you go back to the images you would find that the malignant cases actually make mix a little bit

207
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.710
a little bit of sense so the tumour is kind of the malignant cases.

208
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:25.410
So you see the cells a little bit like you know like bigger persay and the arm of the area is little

209
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:26.090
bit bigger.

210
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.990
It's kind of a little bit more uniform a little bit smooth here.

211
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.740
The Bean I think is right.

212
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.080
OK.

213
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.880
The next step is that we're going to use the ascent as well.

214
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.210
Good luck with the seaborne going.

215
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.550
He was the counterplot.

216
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:40.070
OK.

217
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:45.020
So going to later today is tennis s dot count plot.

218
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.010
Going to do.

219
00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:52.510
They're going to call the frame which is again d.f. on the squawky So you have underscored cancer and

220
00:12:52.560 --> 00:13:00.180
organist's shoes simply would to choose the targets to an account with how many samples is zero and

221
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.140
how many samples is one.

222
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.870
Just to give you kind of visual as issue we know the symptoms beforehand.

223
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.640
We just want to look at Adam.

224
00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.150
Right.

225
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.820
So we're going to do is going to detect cancer.

226
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:12.000
And then going to use simply the target colon to do with the counting.

227
00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:12.760
All right.

228
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:13.520
Okay.

229
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.000
Let's run it together.

230
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:15.410
Okay.

231
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.220
This is a target classic to show you okay this is you on one.

232
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:24.630
We know that the nelligan case is that over 200 samples and the benign cases is that at one hundred

233
00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.940
and fifty samples in total about 560 something okay.

234
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:29.740
All right.

235
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:30.930
Let's keep going.

236
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:35.490
So the next step is we're going to right we're going to just take maybe one of these slide graphs and

237
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:36.480
see how can we play.

238
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:41.280
It's going to use as as again seabourn but we're going to do the scatterplot.

239
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:41.890
Right.

240
00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:49.890
So I'm going to right we're going to get a sense that scareder plot and we are going to do they're going

241
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:54.880
to select which will run a plot on the x axis following a plot on the y axis.

242
00:13:54.900 --> 00:14:00.170
What you are going to be selecting and what's the frame that we need to be selecting basically.

243
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:06.210
So the first step is going to type x let's say we're going to print let's say the mean Area mean area.

244
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.420
Okay.

245
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:08.890
Any one particular plot.

246
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:16.680
Why was she going to be mean smoothness per say mean smoothness and we want to apply the hue.

247
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:18.620
We're going to be my target.

248
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.600
And we need to select what.

249
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:27.450
What's the DNA that we do which is simply that what they are offering which is d.f. underscored kentz.

250
00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.460
All right.

251
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:33.890
Let's run this and that's pretty much our scatterplot which is pretty interesting to see that the area

252
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.230
means more than this and he would are the third request.

253
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.050
Right.

254
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:37.930
Okay.

255
00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:44.400
What if I wanted to select the correlation for example I want to just just run maybe like one man they

256
00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:48.090
can tell us tell okay how these columns how these speeches are really.

257
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:54.050
So what we could do that we could use the seaborne heat map as follows.

258
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:59.680
So we couldn't just write as an as heat map and what were going to do with it were going to call it

259
00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:06.680
a frame the f underscored cancer and we're going to apply a method that we call correlation which is

260
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:14.100
see all the are basic is just a simple method and simply to plot our heat map.

261
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:19.790
What we're going to do that we because we wanted to plot as well the values or the numbers of correlation.

262
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:27.890
We're giving you the annotation we're going to apply to maybe the make it to the test on this and stickling

263
00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.140
see it's little bit like messed up in here.

264
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:33.860
So what we're going to do instead we have to change the size because we have plot in so many different

265
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:38.680
samples what were going to do with going to use the figures size to actually adjust the size of the

266
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:39.210
figure.

267
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:50.000
So again Tim's plot figure and we're going to set the figures size in to let's say 20 and 10 4 of them

268
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.240
20 and 10.

269
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:51.930
Okay.

270
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.220
Let's run it.

271
00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.620
That's much better.

272
00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:01.760
So this is pretty much the overall view of the correlation of the deed.

273
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:03.290
So here we have I would say if we choose.

274
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.060
Help me out there if you choose.

275
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:12.400
You see that simply we have you know point nine nine values for example between the main area the main

276
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:16.640
preliminary which means that there's a very high correlation between the two heat we have between let's

277
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.800
see the embryos.

278
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:23.160
I mean there is a very high correlation and so on you can just go through with the correlation it is

279
00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.300
going to give you an overview of the correlation values between it.

280
00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:27.020
All right.

281
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.420
That's all what we have afforded today the individualisation.

282
00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:30.510
Let me recap.

283
00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:36.020
So first of all we use clarges to plot to plot basically all the connotations or relationships between

284
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:42.260
the different variables and then we use counterplot to count the samples we were scatterplot just to

285
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.400
plot specific two variables.

286
00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:49.040
So that's where the taiga class and then musical relations to actually show me the relations between

287
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:49.840
out of each.

288
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.810
I hope you guys enjoy their section and see the mix.
