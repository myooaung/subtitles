00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:07.900
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture in the biggest lectures we learned how can we kind of develop

2
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.210
a little bit of a user name password system where the user can enter the user name and password and

3
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.840
you can compare it to what we have which is you know they use an impasse that we have in the system.

4
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.040
If the user name matches we're going to get say OK access granted if not if not we're going to say Well

5
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.360
access has been denied.

6
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.870
Perfect.

7
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.700
So what we could do right now.

8
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.480
Let's go ahead and actually build our code.

9
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.770
OK.

10
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.720
So first of all we need to if the access has been granted which is here the body.

11
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.530
If we're going to do here we're gonna say OK let's ask the user for time to insert their time and they're

12
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.990
going to say OK.

13
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:58.790
Going to say input and then ask the user What's the time now let's actually make it like this actually

14
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.890
make it double here.

15
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.590
So what's the time now.

16
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.900
All right.

17
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.860
And then we can give him guidance to say OK let's please use

18
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.420
24 hours formats and maybe you can give them example.

19
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.200
So let's give in and give them an example let's say for example time in some time between 8:00 a.m.

20
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.380
and 3:00 p.m. OK.

21
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.310
Which is simply equivalent to eight and 15 right.

22
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.800
Figures remember.

23
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.200
So that's 8:00 a.m. and that's 15.

24
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.530
OK.

25
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.820
Why is that.

26
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.440
Because what we're going to do here we're going to create a dictionary that explicitly take these values

27
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.070
only.

28
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.870
OK.

29
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:47.340
All right.

30
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.740
It's good all right.

31
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.100
And the user will get to get data.

32
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.450
And what we're going to do here we're going to say OK we're going to insert that into time on the score

33
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.440
hours on the score.

34
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.560
Now that's the time right now.

35
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.560
And if you remember input we're going to return this string right.

36
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.200
Obviously we're not interested in the string.

37
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.690
We want to cast it into a float or integer or whatever.

38
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.910
But I'm going to use a float because we might need for example 10 and half hours or something like that

39
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.560
so that we're going to turn our time here.

40
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.520
OK.

41
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.590
All right let's test it.

42
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.530
So let's run it into user name so we have right here entered our password.

43
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.490
We can secure ASCII percentage.

44
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.150
One two three.

45
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.740
Daniel K..

46
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.230
That's good.

47
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.000
X is vented.

48
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.590
And now what's the time right now please enter the format something like that you're going to say okay

49
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.430
to say the time is 10.

50
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:37.550
Looks good.

51
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.470
If you take a look at time H now looks great.

52
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.920
Now we have the time is 10.

53
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.560
That's perfect.

54
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.730
All right.

55
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.560
OK.

56
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.960
Looks good.

57
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.800
What we could do afterwards here is that we want to call the function and that function will going to

58
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.800
simply do all our planning for us.

59
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.260
So the function is called day underscored planner.

60
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.780
I'm going to call that function and send to it the time H now which is a time call the function and

61
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.280
tell it what's the time right now.

62
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.670
And the function we have to define it.

63
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.530
Obviously you haven't defined it yet.

64
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.470
So can you define it.

65
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.510
And what's the function is defined.

66
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.300
OK.

67
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.860
What we wanted to do here is this we wanted to if you remember one of the elements here that wanted

68
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.100
to the program to provide students with previous lecture notes.

69
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.110
Let's actually do this here.

70
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:34.040
That would be the body of the if it's going to take my file equals two guys remember open you can open

71
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.700
the file.

72
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:42.800
We're going to say open lecture notes file a score lecture on the score notes dot text write that once

73
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.550
we open the file.

74
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.250
Oh my apologies.

75
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.480
And after we open the file we're going to keep print.

76
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:55.460
We want to print the data to the user write my file dot read and that's it.

77
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.270
Let's take a look.

78
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.890
So let's try it again.

79
00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.650
Let's introduce a name and set our password.

80
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.260
Actually forgot the password why is key.

81
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.330
Why is key percentage.

82
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.060
One two three.

83
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.850
That's it.

84
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.180
What's the time right now.

85
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.330
Let's say 10 and it's tell me well something is not right.

86
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.900
First of all date planet is not defined which makes sense because we haven't defined the function right.

87
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.090
Let's actually common that out because we haven't found it yet.

88
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.130
I just wanted to test that portion of the file opening the file and exiting it because we have the fight

89
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.600
already right.

90
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.960
We have Ryan we have the password is why ASCII key percentage 1 2 3.

91
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.980
What's the time right now.

92
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.800
Let's say 10.

93
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.780
And here we go.

94
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.940
So we have the lecture notes we have the date and the professor of lecture and pretty much we read the

95
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.180
exact file which is you know the data that we have here in our file.

96
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.250
All right.

97
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.460
That looks great.

98
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.120
There is obviously one missing piece which is you know that the day planner function.

99
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.430
All right.

100
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.470
So let's go ahead and design our day planner functions separately.

101
00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.010
All right.

102
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.610
Let's see how can we do this.

103
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.820
If you guys remember when we wanted to define functions in general let's actually define the function

104
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.330
here beforehand.

105
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.080
I'm going to say and say I could define right.

106
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:17.490
I'm going to say day underscore planner and the day planner will simply he we call the function and

107
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.320
we send out the timeline or what we need.

108
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.730
He does time and hours a time on the score.

109
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.270
Our other score now we can.

110
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.820
You guys can call it whatever you want.

111
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.650
Right.

112
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.420
And what we could do is that we want it here to define kind of addiction that he say let's say a time

113
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:40.140
for example between let's say 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. You need to attend this specific lecture at time

114
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.850
between 10:00 a.m. and let's say 12:00 12:00.

115
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.900
You need to attend this specific lecture and so on.

116
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.410
So what we could do let's define that as a dictionary.

117
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:58.750
It's going to say okay daily discourse task equals to when open curly brackets going to say okay a time

118
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:06.960
10 we are actually having a programming lecture and let's specify the location is we're going to say

119
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:13.200
a room a that's actually should be put years and there's four.

120
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.490
All right.

121
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.360
So that's the first element within our dictionary because remember we can define a dictionary in a form

122
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.260
of a key value pair.

123
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.010
So that's the key.

124
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.910
And that's the value right.

125
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.780
I say OK.

126
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:35.500
Time 12:00 we wanted to go to a computer vision lecture and that should be in Room C. All right looks

127
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.810
good.

128
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.130
Let's go to 13.

129
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.170
Let's say OK.

130
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.650
And then basic when I say 13 that means I'm talking about time from twelve till one o'clock.

131
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:47.550
Right.

132
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.680
That's actually lunchtime.

133
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:55.300
So let's say lunchtime at the maybe make it like that at the cafeteria

134
00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:58.630
OK.

135
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:05.110
It's good let's make it like you know like fun time you know something like this.

136
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.500
All right.

137
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.450
Looks good.

138
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:15.470
And what we could do afterwards say OK a time 15 what we're going to do we're going to say OK.

139
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:25.450
That's actually my group project meeting which is at room E. R right.

140
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.070
Looks terrific looks great.

141
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.980
All right.

142
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:37.330
So that's that's a first project what we need to do as well here is that we wanted to simply compare

143
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:43.850
OK the time they're going to be sent here to the time that we have you the zone as per say.

144
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:50.080
And once we do that then we'll get a print which day which lecture you should be attending and which

145
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.160
room you're going to be each would be attending the lecture.

146
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:54.670
OK.

147
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:55.620
All right.

148
00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.430
Let's take a break here and let's continue in the next lecture so we can actually run the entire code

149
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.440
together and build it together.

150
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.410
I hope you guys enjoy the lecture and see you in the next lecture.
