00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,660
Hello everyone and welcome to this election.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,540
Let's keep going.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,920
Let's continue with the solutions.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,500
So the question number five all we have here is a wanted to remove the name Peter from my list.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:12,730
OK.

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,330
Using two different methods again and give you a hint to use the Remove method and to use a delete listicle

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:18,950
look.

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,350
So what we could do then say OK I need to apply my list.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,270
Got to use the Remove method remove and then it can list whatever.

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,070
Name one or two more from my list.

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,360
So if I say okay I need to remove Peter.

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,250
Okay that should do it.

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,960
So if I were on my list if I allowed it and if I wanted to let's say.

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,810
Print him of this one so give print my list.

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,980
And if I run it you'll find that basically named Peter had has been removed from my list.

16
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,060
That's the first method which is not bad.

17
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:00,810
Let's take a look at another way or another method of actually deleting an element within the lists.

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,810
You can do that.

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,660
Let's create a couple of lists here a couple of lines you're going to say okay I need to delete say

20
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,170
Dell.

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,680
I'm going to specify my underscored list.

22
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,360
OK.

23
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,810
And what I could do here.

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,640
I'm going to specify the index of the element then I wanted to delete.

25
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,520
Again this is indexed zero in the first one.

26
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,500
Index 2 which is basically what I'm looking for.

27
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,930
So if I list here too.

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,510
If I out of this cell and run this so and then specify again print.

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,580
Oh my apologies.

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,230
So Agnes Okay print.

31
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:37,260
My list and if I read it then you'll find that you're able to believe that in Peter from your list which

32
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,750
is exactly what I was looking for.

33
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:39,440
All right.

34
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,560
Perfect.

35
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,810
I hope that wasn't too hard.

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,490
The next question that we have that one or two sort elements in a list and an even worse one elements

37
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,460
to go for maximum to a minimum.

38
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,060
So you need a couple of numbers.

39
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,220
And what I'm asking you to do is to sort my list again here I'm giving you a hand signal say okay on

40
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,290
my list and I'm going to say.

41
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,790
Dot sourced which is applying my method on it.

42
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,850
That's all sorted.

43
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,800
That's it.

44
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,180
If I actually take a look at my list here you'll find that the AB been sorted for you know I mean in

45
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:15,420
ascending order from 10 15 20 and so on and so forth which is great for to versus It's going to say

46
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:24,540
okay I'm going to do all my lists which are the new one dot reverse kit for it and that's and if I come

47
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,850
here and show my list again.

48
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,670
And I know that you'll find it actually went from the maximum to minimum which is 50 45 40 and going

49
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,270
in in descending order.

50
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,290
Great.

51
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,550
The next question that we have is we have here kind of a grocery list couple of you know like nested

52
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,560
lists several nested lists actually to get in.

53
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,770
So to have chips you know jelly chocolate sweet potatoes potatoes peanuts and protein bar.

54
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:55,910
What I'm asking you to do is I'm asking you to create a new list that contained the last elements only

55
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,360
in the enlisted list.

56
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,310
So I want to create a separate list.

57
00:02:59,330 --> 00:02:59,560
OK.

58
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,280
That might be a little bit of challenging.

59
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,590
Okay.

60
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:08,570
But I wanted to not just the grocery list actually want to go and create a new list which is let's call

61
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:13,510
it new list for example what I am going to initialise it's kind of empty.

62
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,730
Just get in here a.

63
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,840
And then I start to append different elements to it.

64
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,150
OK.

65
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,300
One step at a time.

66
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,250
So I'm going to say OK I need to go to my new list right I'm going to say OK if you as a member got

67
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,920
append to a then new elements.

68
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,120
Open.

69
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,230
All right prentice's I'm going say Okay.

70
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,460
Go to my list here which is grocery list grocery.

71
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,470
Underscored list.

72
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,280
Right.

73
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,320
And then open.

74
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,900
I need to get the last elements right so I need to get it again here in this element.

75
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,280
And this list which is has index of zero right.

76
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,870
I need to get the last element so to do that I need to go.

77
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,290
Kim neston nestled in negative in the sink because a member at minus one.

78
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:53,910
That means Okay.

79
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,580
Go to the first.

80
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:02,170
The zeyda Indicates the first element within the largest mine the swan indicate the last element in

81
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,190
the first list which is great.

82
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,170
That's exactly what I was looking for to do that again.

83
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,100
I'm going to say okay copy paste.

84
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,070
I want to do it actually several times but I want to change it and then say okay when one.

85
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,480
And here in two.

86
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,840
That's basically what I was looking for.

87
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,130
All right.

88
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,060
If I don't get this from the socialists first and then around this and let's take a look at my in your

89
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,770
list.

90
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,140
Perfect.

91
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,710
You came up with chocolates which the less elegant potatoes and then protein which is exactly what I

92
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,670
was looking for.

93
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,890
Again this is a very basic you know kind of way of doing it.

94
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:40,190
What we do moving forward when we cover the fallen troops and why lose it then instead of writing this

95
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:45,350
code line you know a couple of times we actually manage just to run a loop that repeated let's say thousands

96
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,790
of times or hundreds of times whatever we wanted which is going to be very handy very powerful.

97
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,690
When we covered it for loops and looks great.

98
00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:00,530
The last question that we have here now wanted to be asking you to list for example the name five of

99
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,990
your closest friends and saw them in an ad for medical audit.

100
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:04,990
Let's take a look.

101
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,880
And I created a name this ticket quality whatever you want.

102
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,710
He was just going to list whatever names.

103
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,650
Okay Amanda for example.

104
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:19,800
Common Mistake need let's say whatever she or Ryan for instance and then say we need to define let's

105
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:28,160
say Joe I need to list for example schnall and let's say I'm going to have another name let's say Peter.

106
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,070
OK.

107
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,020
And on that that's a list of names I wanted to sort of them in and for medical order actually pretty

108
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:41,420
interestingly you can do the exact same sort of than four number so you can do it as well here for ching's

109
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,020
as well.

110
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,620
So then say okay go to name dot sort.

111
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,340
Right.

112
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,940
An open prentice's here.

113
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:54,420
And if you're on it and if you take a look at name on it you'll come up with this which is basically

114
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,730
a for from and then Chanel and Joe Peter and then ran off the which was street.

115
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,790
That's exactly what I was looking for.

116
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,390
Right.

117
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,040
That's pretty much what I have for this lecture again.

118
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,150
Now you guys should be familiar with this.

119
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,140
How did it work.

120
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,880
You guys should be proud of yourself.

121
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,750
Keep it up.

122
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,510
Why getting closer to amassing them.

123
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,200
I because it with the lecture and see you in the next lecture.
