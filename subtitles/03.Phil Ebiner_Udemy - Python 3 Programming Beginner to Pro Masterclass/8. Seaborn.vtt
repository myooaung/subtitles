00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.460
Everyone and welcome to this section in this section we're going to give you kind of a very powerful

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.320
module.

3
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.080
It's what we call a seesaw.

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.420
It can be used for images.

5
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.050
Mainly visualization.

6
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.760
In science scientists very powerful very interesting actually instead of actually going in here and

7
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.870
show you step by step how can we do that.

8
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.240
We're going to take a look at two examples to show you how powerful keyboard could be.

9
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:32.370
So first we get imported penders as important umpires MP import metalocalypse penalty with them many

10
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.490
times imported seaborne s s n s.

11
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.220
That's kind of statistical data visualization tool.

12
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.320
They were going to be using.

13
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.540
That's right it and here's what I'm going to do here.

14
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.830
I'm going to import simply a kind of a dataset that's already contained within what we call of the year

15
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.360
Escuela library.

16
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.090
It has tons of data can be used for machine learning.

17
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.720
So what are we going to hear in a notebook.

18
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.580
Breast cancer.

19
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.620
It's just it's a beta said.

20
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.400
They can be used to simply classify cancer as malignant melanoma or benign cancer.

21
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.260
I'm going to want to go into the details of it.

22
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.720
I just want to give you the data so let's assume there's just going to view the data so that's hitting

23
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.220
an important data first.

24
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.950
So I'm going to important Lord breast cancer.

25
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.430
There's a dataset I'm going to put different escola in the data sets.

26
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.680
All right.

27
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.840
And then I'm going to the deadliest cancers here I'm going to create a data frame.

28
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.940
I hope you guys are experts right now.

29
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.430
Wouldn't you consider it a flame.

30
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.000
Well I'm going to do it in a credo.

31
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.290
OK.

32
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.490
Create the data and the target and these other columns are going to be selecting feature names and Target.

33
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.090
Right.

34
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.520
Bear with me on this little bit.

35
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.310
Might look a little bit confusing but if we view the data frame d.f. and skin cancer head this isn't

36
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.820
going to be getting so we have seams of columns 31 columns actually showing the different characteristics

37
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.390
of the data.

38
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.790
So we have let's say I mean radius mean sherrard mean perimeter area and so on and so forth.

39
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.320
Okay that's all the data we're getting.

40
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.220
All right along here the last column of the target which indicating you put zero on one indicating if

41
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.450
it's if the cancer is malignant or benign.

42
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.510
Simply put you get images of cancer.

43
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.810
Date of breast cancer in what it going to do with going to say okay I'm going to look at the nucleus

44
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.350
and see what's the I mean what's the radius What's the area what's the how smooth the cells are and

45
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:30.220
then you can specify if that cancer is tumour is cancerous or malignant or benign cancer on it.

46
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.780
So it's assumed again all that just don't worry about it.

47
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.980
Let's assume that you know we haven't seen anything so far or what we have just I have a data frame

48
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.670
and we're going to do he is going to show the power power of seabourn.

49
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.400
OK.

50
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.320
So what we could do here going to plot what we call in the s.a. peer plot.

51
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.380
What you need to do once you have a data frame you can pass along your lead a frame d.f. underscoring

52
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.730
cancer and here you can specify what's your variable What.

53
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.520
What do you want to plop you know just pick let's say five variables mean regus mean texture mean Area

54
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.520
mean perimeter and mean smoothness.

55
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.770
And here you specify the heel which the target they're going to show what they mean by this if you're

56
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.650
on that front that little bit of time.

57
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.580
And that's the Bula of Seaport.

58
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.430
Okay.

59
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.260
See it's just it's really beautiful.

60
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.230
To me it's just you know it's it's incredible that you just you don't need to worry about actually plotting

61
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.350
this data if you want to do that from scratch that you're forever to do here.

62
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.770
It's very intuitive really interesting here just showed you kind of your chametz exploring all the data

63
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.540
you selected you selected mean regus mean text should mean Area you mean smoothness mean primly you

64
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.590
plug them all together end you selected the hue.

65
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.170
What were the targets here.

66
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.310
If as you call it was any kind of a kind of an index of your of okay that's kind of a label that tells

67
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.180
you if it's zero for it's one.

68
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.100
And that's why here it will show you okay that's why zero one once with these are the two different

69
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.930
colours were getting.

70
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.300
It's pretty interesting it shows you the details actually pretty much linearly separate separable.

71
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.220
You can actually separate them here.

72
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.240
And again this is just that when we go to the machine learning section this is just a quick overview

73
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.510
of what we could do with seaborne plodding capabilities.

74
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:17.640
So is the peer plot you pass along your a frame you specify which was the column that has kind of justification

75
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.680
our label if 0 and 1 and you pass along which variables you want to plot and see more and what you're

76
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.730
going to do that for you.

77
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.250
It's pretty pretty powerful.

78
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.680
Correct.

79
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.860
What if I wanted for example to count let's say the number of cases within Let's see how many cases

80
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.250
were malignant or benign what you could do.

81
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.720
You say okay what I'm going to you're going to see.

82
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:46.080
S.a. don't count plots any parcel on your date of Fame cancer and he bets along what column you want

83
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.500
to count.

84
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.620
So he wanted to count the targets.

85
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.180
You can see here it shows you how many elements are how many cancer elements were lignin and how many

86
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.590
cancer were benign.

87
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.940
And that's what we're getting here.

88
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.430
So d.f. on their so-called cancer bracket targets and you get a shawqi.

89
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.220
That's my label.

90
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.490
This label is count.

91
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.540
Let's run it.

92
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.850
And that's what we're getting.

93
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.680
So that's my label account.

94
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.120
That's my target here.

95
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.480
And that's how many allow many numbers so you know we have going two hundred and twenty temples that

96
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.760
are classified as zero.

97
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.360
OK.

98
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.160
Which is in target so if you counted the number of elements there was 220 if you count he had the number

99
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.810
of elements.

100
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.450
And I wanted two hundred and fifty.

101
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.320
That has a label of one.

102
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.650
What if I wanted to it's a plot the scatterplot which is kind of you know pretty much one of those but

103
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.660
just you want to plot one just don't want to do the pure plot which gloss all of them you can actually

104
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.940
go here and do it as well you can specify SNL staats counterplot you can specify what do you want to

105
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.350
plot on the x axis reader so the selected menially you can select what do you want on the y axis means

106
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.890
smoothness anyone and specify the hue as well of the target which you know the classes the cholera's

107
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.630
of his blue or image and you have to pass along the deed okay.

108
00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.870
OK.

109
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.290
I'm going to get these columns.

110
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.700
But from what I've been offering so he'd You specify would be in a frame you're looking for which is

111
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.610
the f kin's if you're done that.

112
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.990
That's why we're getting so we a plot of the x axis.

113
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.410
You mean area Y axis hoople other means smoothness and the hues.

114
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.830
Actually the audience lines is in the dots sorry and the blue dots.

115
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.200
And this actually coming from the data from the from the sawkins.

116
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.680
What if I wanted to plot let's say the core relation between the dead.

117
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:34.050
You can do that using the what we call it s.a. stuff heat map and you pass along the F cancer which

118
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.840
is our data frame dot correlation.

119
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.420
You can play a method core to ashes to its end.

120
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.360
If you run it.

121
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.300
To take a little bit of time.

122
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.790
And basically this line just to show the size here.

123
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.080
If you have really powerful to chose you'll get out what's the correlation values between the primaries.

124
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:57.400
We have 31 columns instead of doing all the loops on them you can just do that with just one comment.

125
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.190
It would show you how many premolar as of how many elements of a lead.

126
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.330
So obviously you have point nine nine.

127
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.650
That means a very high correlation.

128
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.840
So that means the Mean area.

129
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.330
And if you scroll down here the move premature and the are correlated they are positively correlated

130
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:13.840
for example here.

131
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.270
If you have let's say.

132
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:22.520
You go down point 1 9 that means there is a minimum colation there is minus point nine seven that mean

133
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.590
the word is pre-eminent in mean radius the odd inversely called a later date and so forth.

134
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.930
That's how can you just one stop shop.

135
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.130
You can view of the data using the keyboard or a.

136
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:32.800
OK.

137
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.620
What about the annotation equates to when a nation equals two.

138
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.580
That would show you all the numbers in here if you want any more of this.

139
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:44.900
Okay if you want to let's say do this and replot it again it will show you that without a number okay

140
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.300
without all the other data.

141
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.920
Let's actually go back.

142
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.340
Okay so that's.

143
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.570
Again you should plot it.

144
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.140
If we show you the animation that we have.

145
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.110
All right.

146
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.120
Sounds great.

147
00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.690
Let's take a look at another example for seabourn which is example to here.

148
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.050
And again I'm going to load another datasets that were quality the Titanic the IT asset it's pretty

149
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:05.530
interesting.

150
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:12.820
They said it would sure your key was the possibility or probability of you know someone surviving the

151
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:14.470
Titanic disaster.

152
00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:19.820
Okay based on utility age based on your reclass than in your if you're a family you're not.

153
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:24.180
It's pretty interesting the a.f. can be used extensively for machine learning needs.

154
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:29.500
So going to the lead sort of going to load the data again s n s dot did a set Titanic and that will

155
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.040
load the data for us.

156
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.900
It would show us okay that's my survive.

157
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:36.410
That's the actual person survived or not.

158
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.110
Okay PE class.

159
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.310
That's my class.

160
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.380
I'll give a class if it's you know one this mean needs luck and luck has like a better ticketing or

161
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.240
more expensive ticket if it's male or female.

162
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.480
The age and parche unfair.

163
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:55.140
How much did they pay for it embarked which poured at the blog from.

164
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.520
Again I'm not going to go through all that data.

165
00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:02.210
Just going to show you how can we use keyboard to plot you know kind of a subset of the dealer.

166
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.130
So this is my way to count plots.

167
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.720
You to pass along the date of Fame Titanic data.

168
00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.540
And I took to talk about let's say the class.

169
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:10.120
Okay.

170
00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.590
So that would show me okay.

171
00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:16.580
So how many people are willing the first class how many people do in the second class and how many people

172
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:17.290
third class.

173
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.730
There's the class common here.

174
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.080
So a a majority of them were actually in the third class which makes sense.

175
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.490
The next step is okay what if I want to let's say to count how many people survive that I teneycke if

176
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.930
you run this now I would tell you that's the number of people survive.

177
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.710
So that's where people survive.

178
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.810
So unfortunately a lot of them actually died in the disaster.

179
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:43.270
So again you specify s.a. don't count plant use.

180
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.670
You pass along you were the column that you wanted to count.

181
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:52.230
And from what data from what did a free you tagalong the data from here which is the tightening dealer

182
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.740
and there's an offering for it.

183
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.090
What if I wanted to plug a little box.

184
00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.620
Plotz And I wanted to show the class along with the age.

185
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:07.020
If you had that that would show you let's say if you had a first class second class third class and

186
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.030
it would show you the age basically very Asian.

187
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.650
So that's kind of a one way again.

188
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:17.600
It's very interesting to analyze the data before running any machine learning algorithm.

189
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:23.340
If you want to plot lived this wiring plots you know and that's Which one sure you kind of you know

190
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:28.260
the distribution of the different elements use you have first class second class third class and there's

191
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.890
a bill that's on the x axis on the y axis.

192
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:31.690
I'm sure the age.

193
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.410
And that's kind of you know a different type of plot.

194
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.200
You know I just wanted again to show you the power of seabourn.

195
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.090
You can do box lards can do swamplands.

196
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:45.050
What if I wanted to do this see joint plots that you done that that would show me the joint class.

197
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:50.430
We had a plot of the fear along with the edge and would show you kind of you know the distribution has

198
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.730
worked here for the joint plot too.

199
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.430
OK.

200
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:58.710
Again you can use it extensively if you're doing a lot of machine learning algorithms or statistical

201
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.450
analysis using keyboard.

202
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:01.650
All right.

203
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:06.930
Well if I wanted to plot the distribution you can use walk out distribution plot it would show you the

204
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:11.970
fear again how many people do you see it can specify kind of a histogram you can show the bins how many

205
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.520
bins he does 525.

206
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.420
Any case specify the colour as well.

207
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.340
More red.

208
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.570
And he would show you the fear.

209
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.390
How many people actually bother the fear.

210
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:25.620
So a lot of people actually bought it for cheap and is very leery of who bought it or paid more than

211
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.950
two hundred dollars for it.

212
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.510
All right.

213
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:35.210
And finally you plot again the correlation of that before you can pass along the data frame Titanic

214
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:41.450
underscored data dot correlation any kind of specify annotation for to to actually plot or view the

215
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.200
stations.

216
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.880
If you do this it will show you you know kind of you know the correlation between the dealer.

217
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:53.540
So there's kind of you know a pretty much very minimal coordination between the dealer Okay.

218
00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.100
And.

219
00:11:55.530 --> 00:12:00.230
And yeah that's which is going to give you an overview of the detail before applying any machine learning

220
00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:00.870
algorithm.

221
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:01.470
All right.

222
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.400
And again perfect job.

223
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.200
Now you guys are ready for the practical part of the course.

224
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:10.750
You'll enjoy that section and see you in the next section of the course.
