WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.710
Low everyone and welcome to this project and this project we're going to do some fun kind of activities.

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.890
We're going to use our Web cam to actually draw our kind of live sketch you know which is pretty pretty

3
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.930
interesting pretty fun project.

4
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.540
Again I'm going to use some open CV concepts here and we're going to as well see how can we use the

5
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.120
web cam will you use it to extract information out of the actual environment that we have right now.

6
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.740
All right.

7
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.380
Okay.

8
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.410
So first we're going import our library so we're going to put metal clip.

9
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.000
We have done that before several times really imploded for plotting to name poor none pye's MP name.

10
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.270
There's one open CV function first.

11
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.640
And then here.

12
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.430
We're going to simply create two functions.

13
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.350
One of them is call of cartoon.

14
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.850
Actually have done that before in the stylization using open CV and all going to as well use what we

15
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.440
call it Camie edge detection.

16
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.150
Kenny edgett action is actually a very famous kind of edge action technique.

17
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.680
Can be used for all a face it a cognition for self driving cars for so many different applications.

18
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.400
I'm not going to dig into a lot of mathematics of how can you actually implement Kenny.

19
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.770
What do you mean by Kenny.

20
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.150
But the whole idea is to see how can we actually use it.

21
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.150
So the whole idea that we wanted to define the different edges within the image so we have let's say

22
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.230
an image of a face within a specified the boundaries of the face or the features of the face using what

23
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.730
we called the caney edge detection or eye.

24
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.410
OK.

25
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.580
So these are the kind of the two functions are going to be implementing khartoum and lie detection Kenny.

26
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:39.390
And then he had not going to simply utilize our Web cam to actually accept the data show our two image

27
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.740
camera image and show our cartoon and show our life section as well.

28
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.880
OK.

29
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.580
Let's what is through for us.

30
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.740
So first of all going to find out cartoon that would be our function the function would simply going

31
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.050
to take our image.

32
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.730
OK.

33
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.190
So the first question is why it's taking image why is not taking video.

34
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.420
Simply put he was defining stickling image.

35
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.520
But we're going to call that function several times.

36
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.810
What it really is simply is just to see these images in a state of shock.

37
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.590
So going to college several times send it to a separate separate images are going to appear as a video.

38
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.550
OK.

39
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.000
So what you're going to do here I'm going to call ketu a dot stylization which you have done before.

40
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.350
I'm going to pass along our image colours which is our image you know separate images going to our venemous

41
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.080
team.

42
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:33.360
He's not going to specify our sigmas and sigmar yet again that number ranges from zero to 200 range

43
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.380
from zero to 1.

44
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.930
Just specify how smooth you wanted your image to be.

45
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.550
And then that function just going to turn out opport image which is simply the opposite coming would

46
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.060
form from our function.

47
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.300
Well that's our our first function.

48
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.520
Again it's very simple.

49
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.060
Let's run it.

50
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.720
And then the next step is they're going to apply Kenny edge action.

51
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.360
Okay.

52
00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.770
Kenny h.s. again it's another function that simply is open CV CV 2. cvt Coller firsts for Kenny injection.

53
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.540
Think the image which is coming out from our webcam varied from colour to greyscale first and then going

54
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.910
up like any edge detection it's better to apply any section on a basic image compared to a coloured

55
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.810
image.

56
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.050
So we're going to specify our two sessions.

57
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.970
We were threshold one and we were special two.

58
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.800
OK.

59
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.490
And this is kind of you know tuning Prema they can be can be used to increase or keep what edges do

60
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.810
we need.

61
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.060
How accurate the algorithm would look like.

62
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.970
I can assure you how can we how can we achieve these values to get like better results as we move forward.

63
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.470
So first we're going to convert an image we've done that before from from college to great talking to

64
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.960
you CV to dot College.

65
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.940
B.g. are stand for blue green and red to green along our image column.

66
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.650
And they'll go to our imagery first.

67
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.820
Next step is going to use open the Kenny function so CV 2. can get a pass along our image.

68
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.390
GREY to the greyscale image along with there are two specials.

69
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.520
Which as you know Lord of the upper threshold you can set it to 30.

70
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.240
I'm going to do as well how can we tune this premieres all they'll get out of turn out Kenny.

71
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.930
And then they're all going to be turned out of Old Forge.

72
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.040
And that's pretty much the function is going to be used to detect our edges.

73
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.980
All right sounds great.

74
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.060
So I have two functions one to do stylisation of to go kind of curve to the image and the second one

75
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.270
we're going to be fought Kenny edge action.

76
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.570
All right.

77
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.590
So let's see how can we utilize our Web cam which is very powerful.

78
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.300
Very interesting.

79
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.090
So what we're going to what we're going to do here is we're going to specify again using open CV.

80
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.120
We're going to use wine to our own and which reached are going to be running all the time.

81
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:52.050
We're going to do we're going to use cap OK which is simply capital treid can be used to capture our

82
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.360
Web cam so you can actually if you have a web cam are going to be used to capture the webcam.

83
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.710
And they're basically functional going to be turn determine.

84
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.810
Return simply is a boolean that tells you okay if there's been successful or not so if it's one then

85
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.130
it has been successful.

86
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.460
If it's zero that means that successful frame is the actual image that's actual images you know a video

87
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.200
stream that you're getting all the time.

88
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.840
All right.

89
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.080
That's the first step.

90
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.900
OK.

91
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.760
The next step is going to simply put just call our function.

92
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.730
Let's say going to call us to first call car khartoum.

93
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.220
Pass along our train which is the images we're going to be getting.

94
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.710
We're just getting open CV and sure they're going to show.

95
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.930
Show your CV to Don Imus show.

96
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.160
He We're going to show the title which is light edge detection and he did get to show the actual processed

97
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.150
image which is our cartoon bracket frame which is simply the call for the function so he would get to

98
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.570
call the function to pass along the image.

99
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.900
OK.

100
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.810
Or the frame and the function going to turn our output image and image you're going to be listed here

101
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.150
simply and then within a plotted out a way to show that right away.

102
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.110
So then I'm going to be showing our image right away.

103
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.320
All right.

104
00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.310
At the same time I wanted to the original image too so I wanted to show the actual processed image along

105
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.840
with the actual image we were going to see a web cam video that region and video and the actual frame

106
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.240
without any processing.

107
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.560
So this one without any processing.

108
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.170
This one with the actual cartoon application after we apply the costume function to it.

109
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:31.290
And then he was going to say if our CV to the weeky equal to 13 15 is actually the enter sign into a

110
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.460
keyboard entry.

111
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.710
So when you press enter the exit loop that means going to break.

112
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.940
We're going to break simply.

113
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:38.360
Why.

114
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.290
Why loop.

115
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.620
And then we're going to do can release them you're going to leave our camera and then destroy all images.

116
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.000
And that's the objective of what we were going to perform.

117
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.560
Right.

118
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.280
OK it sounds great.

119
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.290
So first of all Lester on the second one around the edge section looks good.

120
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.000
And then to specify the camera running the camera before around the camera what you're going to do we're

121
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.410
going to change the lighting a bit and just to show you the actual effects.

122
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:03.050
All right.

123
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:03.770
And.

124
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.760
OK let's let's let's get some let's see how can you actually do that.

125
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:08.280
OK.

126
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.170
All right so let's take a look at the cartoon effect first.

127
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.290
He would change the lighting a little bit just to show you can see.

128
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.350
So once we run this then you will see that the kemeny the actual camera has started.

129
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.750
And then you will see that we have here where we have two images.

130
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.650
So we have our original image which is you know basically myself.

131
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:36.400
And he would have our kind of you know cartoon view for where the image actually looks.

132
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.180
Looks pretty looks pretty interesting.

133
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:45.150
So you guys can do it yourself and then you can try different different lighting conditions as well

134
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.610
you can change the values of the threshold to the show with a cause to an effect.

135
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.580
That's one of them.

136
00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:50.180
All right.

137
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.550
What are you going to do instead as well you're going to run.

138
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.220
Kenny edgett section.

139
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.410
So let's actually start there.

140
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.940
I'm going to start it's going to release the camera.

141
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.160
So once you press into that we're going to release it.

142
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.890
Well let's let's let's actually do Coronel.

143
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.880
Let's clear.

144
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.910
Let's first interrupt.

145
00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.090
Ed let's start things clean up.

146
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.300
In Oregon to do here instead of enabling that line which is a quote to me one.

147
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:23.610
I'm going to this e-book this one I'm sorry but this evil this one and let's enable this one it's going

148
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.140
to be for Kenya just action.

149
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.680
Okay let's on Run ground defined for two and define the action.

150
00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.240
Let's do this.

151
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.020
Our rights.

152
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.640
Okay.

153
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.130
That's pretty interesting.

154
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:46.460
So guess I can see here that's me here and there is my objection or kind of you know like the cartoon

155
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:46.930
effect.

156
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.970
It's pretty interesting as again I can see here.

157
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:54.590
Here are the edges you know are appearing you know and if you can can draw you a sketch you can even

158
00:08:54.590 --> 00:09:00.200
develop like an app using Python here showing all the features so all the details.

159
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:06.460
And that's pretty much how can you use your web cam to actually pime you're a cartoon image.

160
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:13.760
If you wanted to entertain as well you edges using Open cvn using Python I hope you enjoyed that section

161
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.910
and see you in the next section and have fun with this.
