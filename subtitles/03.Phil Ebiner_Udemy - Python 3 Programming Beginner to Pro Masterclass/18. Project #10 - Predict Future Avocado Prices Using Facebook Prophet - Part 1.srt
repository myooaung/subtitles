00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:08,440
Hello everyone and welcome to this new project and this project we're going to do a very interesting

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:17,380
and exciting strategy to actually predict avocado prices using what we call it Facebook profit.

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:27,550
OK we're going to be a lot of data analysis a lot of seaborne usage a lot of data manipulation manipulation

4
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:34,420
using pandas data frame and we're going to see how can we actually predict you know like avocado prices

5
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:40,150
you know something you know in the future let's say in 2019 or 2020 using the data that we have right

6
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,680
now and the data in the past the.

7
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,480
This basically case study is really important because now we can apply it to whatever application you

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,110
have.

9
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,450
So anywhere anytime seed is that you have you can actually apply the exact same strategy to predict

10
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,780
the prices for example in the future.

11
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:04,270
You can use it to predict let's say stock market data in the future and so on so forth.

12
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:04,620
All right.

13
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:05,410
So let's get started.

14
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,620
So first what is the data.

15
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:14,940
So the data represents weekly to 2018 retail skin.

16
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,160
That data from national retail volume units and price.

17
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:18,850
OK.

18
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,300
All right.

19
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,420
So if we scan through the data you will find that there is several columns in there.

20
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,750
You'll find that there is date.

21
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,380
OK.

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,640
That is the average price for a single avocado.

23
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,690
That is the type.

24
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:36,390
Is it conventional or is organic the year as well.

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,130
The region which region in the United States basically have been this data have been collected.

26
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,150
The total volume.

27
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,030
How many avocados have been sold.

28
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,260
And here it's kind of you know the total number of avocados within a specific product category.

29
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:57,610
So those people you you know 40 40 6 4 2 2 5 4 7 7 0 actually not gonna be using all the data per say

30
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:04,390
because here with that objective is to try to predict for the average price of the avocado over the

31
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,610
entire United States.

32
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,540
And for a specific region as well.

33
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:07,990
All right.

34
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,490
And that's the image of you know the beautiful girl that we're trying to predict.

35
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:12,920
All right.

36
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,650
So let's get started.

37
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,360
So what we could do first.

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,830
Again I tried here to summarize it as much as I can into kind of different steps and I'm going to walk

39
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,960
you through the different steps as we move forward.

40
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:30,550
So first you need to install what we call the Facebook profit FMG profit package so you simply go to

41
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:36,700
the Anaconda and you go in and you take this pip install FBI profit.

42
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:45,430
If you encounter any error please try to install do this install Conda and install dash C and then conduct

43
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,160
dash forge and then FBI profit.

44
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,240
OK please.

45
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,000
If you don't if you have any if you experience any issues downloading the these packages please post

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,400
them post your questions in the Q and A and maybe do a quick google search.

47
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,690
If not I will try to solve the issues.

48
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,560
Obviously there is no way that we will let you might run through some issues through content installation.

49
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,780
But that's that's basically the two issues that I've came across so far.

50
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:12,770
All right.

51
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,340
OK so what's profit.

52
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:21,750
Profits basic and open source software that had been released by the Facebook core data science team.

53
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,920
It's really really powerful because you know it can give you kind of a prediction of in the future and

54
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,620
it's actually very very accurate too.

55
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,740
OK.

56
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:29,920
All right.

57
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,580
So let's get started by inputting the data.

58
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,880
Let's see what's going to happen here.

59
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,990
So first we're going to import the important packages.

60
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,600
Now we're gonna be using the libraries we're going to be using.

61
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,370
Let's go ahead and import.

62
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,440
We're going to import again pandas as PD because remember we use pandas mainly for data manipulations

63
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,690
for data frames and it actually has been very very powerful.

64
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,120
It's like words like excel.

65
00:03:53,230 --> 00:04:00,280
Just imagine having excel within a python development environment and then we're going to import num

66
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:09,730
pi as MP K which is meaning we use num PI for data statistical analysis and then we're going to import

67
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:19,300
mat plot lib dot pi plot as specialty which is again we're gonna use it for data visualization and we

68
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:28,010
have we're going to use as well imports we're going to import random and we're going to import as well

69
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:37,520
seaborne as as an S because remember we can use seaborne for data visualization as well mainly you know

70
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,640
like it's it's really it's way more powerful compared to that plot lib when it plus statistical data

71
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,230
and we we actually had an intersection for the previous part of the course.

72
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,480
If he wasn't familiar with seaboard Don't worry I'll try to cover a in this section if not please go

73
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,660
back and defer to the original notes.

74
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,020
All right.

75
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,410
So first what is the data.

76
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,360
So the data is contained in Estonia C as we file within the court's package.

77
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,230
It's called avocado dot c as V.

78
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,700
OK so if you don't know the court's package you shouldn't have a problem finding it.

79
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,640
And what we need to do here is we need to read our data frame.

80
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay read our CSB file and store it in a data frame.

81
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,610
Okay let's do that.

82
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:26,110
So going I say okay Avo carto we can call it whatever you want data frame equals to PD dot read on the

83
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:34,270
score C as V and we want to read the avocado that C is v all right.

84
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,530
So let's run that.

85
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,070
Let's see if that happens.

86
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,270
Well you key PD was recognized.

87
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,650
So let's run that first.

88
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,420
Okay.

89
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,460
So it's loading and let's run that after.

90
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:47,880
All right.

91
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,030
Looks good now.

92
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:49,680
Okay.

93
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,150
Actually one more package.

94
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:56,700
My apologies I forgot to install we need the profit which is you know Facebook profit.

95
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:09,940
So going to say okay from F B profit OK we're going to import prophet OK.

96
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,740
All right.

97
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,890
Looks good.

98
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:17,740
And if you don't have prophet installed or correct installed using pip installed or using condoms install

99
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,690
second to forge profit you should find that error here but because they have it.

100
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:28,090
So when I run it you know it might take a little bit more time but again it ran perfectly which means

101
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:32,260
it's recognized what profit is right fair and that looks good.

102
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,700
Let's take a look at our data frame.

103
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,310
So let's go ahead dig that data frame.

104
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,430
Let's see if this data has been installed or not.

105
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,130
All right.

106
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,950
And here the data what we were getting the data.

107
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,990
So here we have a column called Date.

108
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:55,540
Here we have our average price for one single avocado one point three point ninety three dollars one

109
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,200
dollars one point to six.

110
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,880
Actually I've got us a really expensive here in Canada or in the United States two in total volume.

111
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:08,350
That's the total volume that we know of the number of avocados so let's say six 64000 avocados have

112
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,520
been you know like sold for example within that specific date.

113
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,930
Here we have the different call APL new numbers which stands for the specific product.

114
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,340
We're not going to be using all that data that much.

115
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,820
These are the total number of bags.

116
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,820
So there are basically the bags contain certain number of avocados right.

117
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,970
So there are small bags just large bags eggs X large bags.

118
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,610
Again we're not going to be touching any of that information.

119
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:36,610
This is a type of avocados either conventional or organic.

120
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,510
And that's the year.

121
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,780
Right.

122
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:42,430
So here is 2015 which is basically going to be you getting the information is contained within the data

123
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,750
as well.

124
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,000
And we have as well the reason.

125
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:45,200
OK.

126
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,800
Which region within the United States.

127
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,110
You know like there is West that is total U.S..

128
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,440
Okay.

129
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:56,800
And if there is if you scroll down it is like West like Texas like New Mexico and that's pretty pretty

130
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,690
much it.

131
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,180
All right.

132
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,280
Again we're not gonna be using all that data.

133
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,680
This is just you know like it quick.

134
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,240
This is the full data we're not gonna be using it for a profit.

135
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,290
We're going to be using mainly our price and our time.

136
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,760
That's the two important factors because what's trying to predict the price in the future.

137
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:20,100
Obviously this data you can you can you guys can use it for tons of machine learning applications right

138
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:26,470
you can use it for price predictions you can use it for like specific trends for unsupervised learning

139
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:32,920
and that's again out of the scope of this like case study and out of the scope of this course here the

140
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:38,650
objective is just try to use the fees that pay Facebook profit just try to predict the avocado prices

141
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,130
along with the using the time.

142
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:46,880
See it along with the price column only and we're gonna much ignore the entire all the data moving forward.

143
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,190
All right.

144
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,230
And that's pretty much all what I have for this lecture.

145
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,580
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

146
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:58,030
And in the next lecture we're going to see how can we load media and visual aid load the data again

147
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,790
and visualize the data using seaboard.

148
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,110
See you guys in the next lecture.
