00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,450
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,400
Let's keep going.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,360
So this

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,770
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:19,400
I'm super excited because we're getting closer to predict our price for the avocado.

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:20,300
OK.

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,830
So in the previous lecture we discussed how can we view the data.

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:31,520
So we actually been able to view the data versus different regions with youth as well the sales or the

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,210
number of you know number of of elements that we have per years.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:45,440
And we also created our own data frame which is specifically made to fit our profit operation.

11
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,780
So we only took these two columns which is date and average price.

12
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,380
And we put that into the average offguard or profit data free.

13
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,490
All right.

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,000
OK.

15
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,920
Sounds great.

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,420
Let's take a look at all gonna do here.

17
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,760
So what we gonna do here.

18
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,700
We are going to rename our columns.

19
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,420
So we're gonna go ahead to our avocado.

20
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,830
I'm going to tell you exactly why right now and go to avocado underscored profits on the score data

21
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:13,880
frame.

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,480
OK.

23
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,680
I'm going to do renaming so I'm going to rename our columns

24
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,550
I'm gonna rename them from date.

25
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,300
I'm gonna call it D Yes.

26
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,000
My apologies.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,360
This need to be date.

28
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,130
This need to be d s OK.

29
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,350
And then we're going to rename as well the average price we're going to call it Y.

30
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,410
Average price.

31
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:46,250
And that will should we call it y right.

32
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:52,250
And then we're going to take that and put it in our data frame again.

33
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:59,570
So basically we're just gonna go ahead and rename our data frame again.

34
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,530
So what's the point.

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,800
Why are we doing this.

36
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,750
So in order for the up for the order for the profit to actually operate.

37
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,190
OK.

38
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,180
These two columns has to have that name.

39
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,400
So the date has to have the s name and average price has to have wining that's it.

40
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,540
Once we do that they're going to be very easy afterwards to actually feed the data into the profit prediction

41
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,170
function.

42
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,820
So let's run it looks good.

43
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,580
Let's take a look at it again the data frame.

44
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,720
And here we go.

45
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,930
That's our the data frame and that's our y data frame.

46
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,070
Looks great.

47
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,830
All right.

48
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,540
So let's take a look at how can we actually train our model.

49
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,650
Let's see.

50
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,790
So what we could do here.

51
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:48,220
I'm going to instantiate the prophet object so we're going to instantiate an object in let's say m m

52
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,090
equals prophet.

53
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:49,310
OK.

54
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:56,320
So basically what we did that we imported our class before which is f here we had import profits.

55
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,590
Right.

56
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,040
So here we instantiate that an object out of this.

57
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,450
All right.

58
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,850
So let's take a look at how can we actually perform the prediction.

59
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:09,190
So what we did here have just instantiated an object called M what we could do.

60
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,700
It's actually very very simple because the m dot fits.

61
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:23,770
And we're going to pass along our data frame avocado on the score profits and underscore data frame.

62
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,220
That's it.

63
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,320
That's actually pretty simple.

64
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,830
So let's run it let's run it.

65
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,120
So take a little while

66
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,030
so basically what we're doing here.

67
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:41,340
You know we're just trying to train kind of a model to try to predict the future in a way.

68
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,110
OK.

69
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:47,570
Again it's taking a little while to actually run and after after that.

70
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:47,800
OK.

71
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,380
Looks good.

72
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,270
That's done.

73
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,030
You know we don't need to actually take a look at what's happening in the background there's a lot of

74
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,600
mathematics.

75
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,420
Obviously it's not that simple it's actually really very complex.

76
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,230
But the overall idea here is just to try from an application perspective is how can we use it.

77
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,000
OK.

78
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,470
So let's go ahead and actually forecast the future.

79
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,300
Let's forecast forecasts the futures.

80
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,970
Let's go ahead and see how can we do that.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,550
So what we could do here we could

82
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,460
go ahead and use our train.

83
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,380
So basically m here contain all the training.

84
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,710
So we use the input input data which is date and time.

85
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,310
Right.

86
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,410
And we use that to train kind of a model.

87
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,400
And then we can take that model and make predictions.

88
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,130
So going to say OK let's predict the future.

89
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:41,180
So the future equals to m dot we can use a method called m make on the score future underscore data

90
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,350
from thing and then it can pass along.

91
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,530
How long do we need.

92
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,330
Our our future going to be so heat I'm trying to predict in the future one year ahead is going to take

93
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,940
a period going to be 365 days a year I'm predicting in the future I want to see what do what do you

94
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,840
see in the future.

95
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,610
What we could do afterwards I'm going to say OK let's do two.

96
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:13,720
Here we created the future and then we can say OK our forecasts equals to m DOT predicts apologies predict

97
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,380
and we can pass along our future.

98
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,560
That's it.

99
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,930
That's right.

100
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,460
That's

101
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,340
sticking liberal while.

102
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:29,950
All right.

103
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,000
So now we're good.

104
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,360
Let's take a look at the forecast.

105
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,580
If we take a look at the forecast now put on it that's pretty much it.

106
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,440
So we find these two columns of the input which D.S. basically that's our input and you will find that

107
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,700
there is a lot of columns in here.

108
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:42,930
OK.

109
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,040
There's tons of information.

110
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,980
OK.

111
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,520
So simply put what what the profit function is doing is just giving you kind of the trend.

112
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:50,720
OK.

113
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,200
What are we expecting.

114
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,070
You know in the future what's going to happen moving forward if you scroll down here you would find

115
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,550
something really interesting.

116
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:04,210
You'll find that there's 20 19 appear even though the data or it was already like you know until March

117
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:11,400
of 2018 so you'd find that basically we what happened is the appended new columns in here for the future.

118
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,440
They are looking one year ahead.

119
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,060
OK.

120
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,220
And they're giving you a trend.

121
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,360
They're giving you what's the price you know expected in the future.

122
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,450
It seems that the price actually going down I'm going to watch it again and plot it right now and see.

123
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,950
And the beauty about it then giving you kind of as well like a bound to get there.

124
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,230
OK.

125
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,010
That's my trend.

126
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,240
That's my expected value and that's my why hat lower.

127
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,070
And that's my white hat up upper.

128
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,990
That's the expectation.

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,870
That's the bound.

130
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,070
And actually when we plot it it will show us the balance as well.

131
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,880
Let's take a look and see how can we do that.

132
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:49,430
So if we go here we say OK let's plots figure equals to end of plots.

133
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,770
So we're going to plot what's contained within the M..

134
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,740
But I wanted to simply plug the forecast OK which is simply our data that we have here.

135
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:02,220
There's a number that's forecast and I'm going to pass along our X label.

136
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,870
I'm going to be equal to our date.

137
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:12,630
And I want to pass along my Y label which is equal to our price.

138
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,090
All right.

139
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,760
Let's take a look.

140
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,930
Beautiful.

141
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,100
That's incredible.

142
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:18,720
Okay.

143
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:24,010
Like even though it might be like you know actually it's actually very very accurate because now this

144
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,050
is a data that we have.

145
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,870
That's the data we have got up until you know March of 2013 per say.

146
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,030
And that's the expectation for the future.

147
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,950
Just looking into the future and trying to like you know like predict what's going to happen in the

148
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,830
future.

149
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,430
So you guys can see here.

150
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:39,490
This is the trend.

151
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,180
So the expectation is actually the price we're going to go down and it's giving you like kind of a bounce.

152
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,150
You know maybe the price maybe it will be between these two bounds per say but that's the trend.

153
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,680
You know that's kind of you know the prediction.

154
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,860
So you can make predictions into the future.

155
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,300
Obviously it's like you know it's it's very complex to actually understand what's happening in the background

156
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:04,060
but the overall idea is just trying to look back and trying to find trends within the data and that's

157
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,650
how they are trying to predict the future in a way using that profit thing.

158
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,000
All right.

159
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,270
What we could do as well.

160
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:15,770
We can view as one other figures within a circle it's a figure equals to m dot plots.

161
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,970
And it can plot components second circuit components

162
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:28,420
and I can use the forecast as well which contains all my data but I get some that and that's pretty

163
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:28,960
much it.

164
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,880
It's amazing.

165
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,240
So here is showing you the trend.

166
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,700
So that's our column here.

167
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,110
If you remember that was attending here.

168
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,140
So it's showing you simply what's what's the expectation.

169
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,600
So it shows that's the price this the data provided.

170
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,560
Right.

171
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:41,860
All right.

172
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,230
So that's the expectations that all that data is provided.

173
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,630
So they're predicting basically the trend we're going to be something like this.

174
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,460
And with that with these bounds in mind and here the yearly.

175
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,920
So you'll find that this is basically over the entire year.

176
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,670
That's kind of the that's kind of the trend.

177
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,340
You know like it seems like in January you know the price goes a little bit down maybe the lows legs

178
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:05,170
are low they go up up up the peak around October timeframe.

179
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,430
OK.

180
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,720
Well people you know maybe around fall timeframe with the crave avocados for example and then the price

181
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,450
goes down by January timeframe or like during wintertime.

182
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,970
All right.

183
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:15,960
OK.

184
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,310
That's great.

185
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,300
And that's pretty much all what I have for this lecture.

186
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,120
Let's recap recap what we have done so far is that we were able to actually train our model using applying

187
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,060
the fit method on our end and then we're gonna.

188
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:34,180
We started to make predictions in the future and we extended basically the data provided into the future

189
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,380
by looking at 2019.

190
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:42,480
And here we were able to plot the data as well and to look as well into the future.

191
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:47,830
Check out the trends and check as well the yearly trend over the entirety and that's pretty much over

192
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,760
half of this lecture.

193
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,520
I hope you guys enjoy it and see you in the next lecture.
