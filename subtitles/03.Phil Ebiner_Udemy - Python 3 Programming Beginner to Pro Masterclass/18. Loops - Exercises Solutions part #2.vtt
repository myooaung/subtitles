00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.400
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.040
Let's keep going and solve.

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.600
Question for heat I'm asking you to create a rolling dice game.

4
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:09.460
OK.

5
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.050
Well you're basically going to print rolling the dice for example please wait.

6
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.270
And then we need to generate two numbers right two random numbers.

7
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.780
OK dice one and two and then going to ask the user do you want to roll again or not.

8
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.150
You know it seems that it's like kind of a while loop in here.

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.480
Let's see how can we do this.

10
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.790
Say OK we're going to import random.

11
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.660
Oh my apologies.

12
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.380
Let's go ahead.

13
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.850
Let's run that.

14
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.780
Let's go here.

15
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.380
OK.

16
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.910
Import random because they need to generate random numbers right.

17
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.330
OK.

18
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.570
So what I could do.

19
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.960
I'm going to say OK while and I need a variable here that indicates that basically I am going to keep

20
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.360
rolling.

21
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.040
Great.

22
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.910
So I'm gonna say OK.

23
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.290
Keep rolling.

24
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.570
All right.

25
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.160
If they keep rolling.

26
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.610
This equals two.

27
00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.770
Yes.

28
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.420
I'm asking the user if basically like obviously he can do it.

29
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.830
The other two two ways.

30
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.570
First you can say OK while true which is you know all the time I'm going to keep doing it and then have

31
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.380
an if condition that exit the why loop in there or you can have a variable you can call it for example

32
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.480
keep rolling.

33
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.450
All right.

34
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.090
And you can initialize it first because you want to run that game at least once right.

35
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.130
So can initialize it to yes first in the beginning.

36
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.370
Right.

37
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.900
And every time I'm going to go you're going to ask is keep rolling equals Yes yes as long as it's yes

38
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.020
you're going to keep doing and keep repeating.

39
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.070
Keep playing basically right.

40
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.360
So let's see how can we do that when I say OK print.

41
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.010
Obviously here I need to print the message to the to the user right.

42
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.280
So I need to print message like this.

43
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.460
So let's go ahead and actually copy it over there right and say OK print the dice rolling.

44
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.170
Please wait.

45
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.550
Right.

46
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.820
OK.

47
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.480
It sounds good.

48
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.060
And here I wanted to print.

49
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:07.340
I'm going to say OK rolling results for those number one right.

50
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.580
And here I wanted to basically use a random random generator to generate integers.

51
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.120
Right.

52
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.280
Any random integer.

53
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.130
And obviously because it's a dice we know that the numbers have to range between 1 and 6.

54
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.660
All right.

55
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:32.510
So again I say OK random dot round int right number between 1 and 6.

56
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.310
All right.

57
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.620
That's pretty much it.

58
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.750
And that's pretty much it for the first days.

59
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.930
Right.

60
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.500
Let's do for the second dice too.

61
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.990
So you're rolling the dice dice.

62
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.860
Number two mistake generating around random numbers well between 1 and 6.

63
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.890
And that's it looks pretty pretty.

64
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.140
Looks ok right.

65
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.030
The only problem is if we on this here we haven't asked the user if he's going to be doing it again

66
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.300
or not.

67
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.140
So let's actually run it.

68
00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.590
So if we run it you would find that basically you kind of you're stuck in the loop right.

69
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.060
Like there is no there is no condition here I'm not asking because.

70
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.430
Because it's all the time here.

71
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.920
The keep rolling is actually yes.

72
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.270
Right.

73
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.210
Please let's go and interrupt the colonel just in order so we won't we repeat it like you know like

74
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.060
hundreds of times already.

75
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.830
All right.

76
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.880
Again here because keep rolling equals Why.

77
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:21.490
Right.

78
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.640
We came here we is keep rolling.

79
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.540
Equals Y.

80
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.440
Yes.

81
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.460
So we went here.

82
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.260
We generated N number greater than a number.

83
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.240
And then we went up again.

84
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.910
Right.

85
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.040
We kept asking is keep rolling equal why.

86
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.530
Yes.

87
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.750
Because we didn't overwrite that variable yet.

88
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.990
Right.

89
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.490
So basically we need to ask the user here.

90
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.090
Do you want to keep playing or not.

91
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.210
And then I'm going to think that their value whatever using an N insert and put it in keep rolling right

92
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.680
and take it keep the score rolling.

93
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.620
Right.

94
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.370
Equals two inputs.

95
00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:04.050
And let's take data from the users and I say okay do you want to roll again or to play again OK.

96
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.930
And actually can he give him some guy guidance going to say okay let's say print or like let's say Enter.

97
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.420
Yes to Y.

98
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.010
For example if you

99
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.630
policies enter y.

100
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.200
If you would like if you would like to play again.

101
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.560
All right.

102
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:34.630
And we can maybe force him to kind of do this or we actually don't need to to do that you can actually

103
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.270
do that.

104
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.220
I want to confuse you.

105
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.290
You might put like backslash for example if you wanted to skip this.

106
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.750
Just put it as Y and that's it for now.

107
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.650
OK.

108
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.160
So basically you're asking the user OK.

109
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.250
Do you want to play again or not.

110
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.890
If to say yes if you're like play again insert anything else if you'd like to skip right let's run that's

111
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.000
going to say OK you played first.

112
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.640
So here these are the random numbers 5 and 4 looks good.

113
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.350
I mean that they again are not going to see why press enter.

114
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.400
You're going to say OK you played again.

115
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.780
Right.

116
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.800
And they again another random numbers.

117
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:04.140
All right.

118
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.940
Let's run it again.

119
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.970
So here we said OK let's.

120
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.210
Let's try.

121
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.840
Not so pretty.

122
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.670
Press why going to play again and keep going if I want to exit just insert whatever insult and said

123
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.720
no for example insert any value end for instance and then you will find that the code has stopped basically.

124
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.790
All right.

125
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.910
OK let's keep going.

126
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.440
Question number five.

127
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.450
So I'm asking you to develop a code that prints out the multiplication table.

128
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.830
The code will get it from the user to enter the maximum number to be printed on the screen.

129
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.080
All right.

130
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.380
Let's see how can we do this.

131
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.440
Let's take a number equals two.

132
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.590
Obviously we need to get data from the user right.

133
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:49.900
I'm going to say okay input and I'm going to say okay enter number between 1 and 9.

134
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.980
OK.

135
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.680
So the user are going to fill the number into number.

136
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.980
Right.

137
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.330
So here basically I want to print the multiplication table That's actually easy.

138
00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.710
I can use for loop network for I in range.

139
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.060
I'm going to see a clear range from one to eleven.

140
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.310
Right.

141
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.580
Why.

142
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.670
Because I wanted to print again numbers from 1 to 10 right.

143
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:15.930
So here I'm going to go from one to eleven and I say OK let's go ahead and print we're going to print

144
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.080
basically our number right.

145
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.420
Which basically I want to use.

146
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.230
It seems like I wanted to pin the number which is fixed all the time right.

147
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.450
And then I wanted to afterwards print the multiplication.

148
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.530
It seems like there's an X here right.

149
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.810
Yes.

150
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.710
It looks like a multiplication but I wanted to actually printed as kind of a string right in this.

151
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:34.710
Okay x.

152
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:35.810
Right.

153
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:42.270
So that will be the number which is whatever let's say 8 will be 8 and there is X and let's go ahead

154
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.330
and print another variable.

155
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.650
Let's say I.

156
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.070
So that'll be my variable here which is going to be 1 2 3 4 and so on.

157
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.310
Right.

158
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.280
Okay sounds good.

159
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:58.410
And then I wanted to print the equals and I wanted to print the actual results of the multiplication

160
00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.850
light which is here.

161
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.840
This is not a string right.

162
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.180
This is an actual value.

163
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:02.470
Right.

164
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:07.280
So I wanted to print basically my number multiplied by I.

165
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:13.200
Which is a number which is let's say 8 which is fixed here multiplied by I which is are being updated

166
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:18.870
all the time by the for loop which is going to be 1 2 3 4 and so on up until 10.

167
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.420
Let's run it into the number let's say 5.

168
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:27.100
And that's our beautiful multiplication table five times one times two times three looks great.

169
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.420
Let's try it one more time and let's try for example seven.

170
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.240
Looks good.

171
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:31.790
All right.

172
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.010
Now we have multiplication table handy at your disposal.

173
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.140
All right.

174
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.340
Question number six I am asked to write a code that takes a maximum and minimum limits from the user

175
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.530
and print out the even numbers only between the provider range already.

176
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:50.890
So let's let's get the range first on a stick a minimum equals two.

177
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.400
And I'm going to say OK input I think value from the user right.

178
00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:07.380
And I say OK enter a number let's define for example going to call it lower bound OK and let's copy

179
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.730
that again.

180
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.250
Put it here and I need to define that and make it Max right.

181
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:20.370
So I'm going to say OK min max actually let's let's me instead of having kind of you know min max here

182
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:26.390
you can call it let's say x underscore men for example or X underscore Max because these are kind of

183
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.620
reserved keywords.

184
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:33.030
You shouldn't be using them seeing as they enter in lower bound enter upper bound.

185
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:33.300
Right.

186
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:34.000
OK.

187
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:40.260
It's actually tested so lower about let's say 90 an upper bound let's say 200 for example.

188
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:47.190
And if we insert new cells let's take a look at X-Men press run it looks good.

189
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.050
It's on the score Max.

190
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.620
Let's run it looks good too.

191
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.000
All right.

192
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:52.250
OK.

193
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.510
And now to the fun part.

194
00:08:54.510 --> 00:09:03.150
Now we wanted to actually go ahead and create a loop between our lower bound and upper bound and actually

195
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.240
print printouts only even numbers.

196
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:06.540
Right.

197
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:07.030
OK.

198
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:07.920
Let's see how can we do this.

199
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:17.700
When I say okay for i in range and here we have our X underscore men and X underscore Max right.

200
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:25.000
And I'm going to say okay if you found this number which is you know my B whatever number between men

201
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.100
and Max was even or not so was even an art if you guys remember I've done that several times before

202
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.140
in the past.

203
00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:38.860
If you divide by two and take the remainder and the remainder was equal to zero that mean it was even

204
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:39.550
right.

205
00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:45.460
Let's go ahead and actually print I let's go ahead and actually print my number.

206
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:46.180
All right.

207
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.610
So basically I just print only even numbers.

208
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.150
Let's give it a shot.

209
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.430
And that's what we've got here we've got nineteen ninety two ninety four.

210
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.070
And keep going up until one hundred and ninety eight.

211
00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:57.790
All right.

212
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.860
Perfect.

213
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:00.500
OK.

214
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.290
That's great.

215
00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.060
All right let's recap all have done so far.

216
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.540
So we basically created kind of rolling dice game.

217
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.630
Here's a question for you.

218
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:14.740
And here we created a code to basically print that our multiplication table will learned how to do for

219
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.560
loops here before we learned how to do while loops too.

220
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.600
And here question six were practiced.

221
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.880
How can we actually use for an if condition kind of mixed at the same time.

222
00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:25.480
All right.

223
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.370
That's pretty much all what I have for this lecture.

224
00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:31.740
I hope you guys enjoyed it and see you guys in the future lecture.
