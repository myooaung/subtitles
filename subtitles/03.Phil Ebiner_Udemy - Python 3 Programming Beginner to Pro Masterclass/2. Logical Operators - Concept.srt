00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,380
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture in the previous lecture.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:11,970
We covered the comparison operators and we we watched how can we actually compared to preeminence together

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:18,620
using either equal equal not equal greater than or equal and so on so forth in this section we're going

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,930
to cover what we call it logical operators.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,090
OK.

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:29,990
Which is simply if you wanted to compare two parameters in a logical format from a logical perspective.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,330
All right let's take a look at what they mean by logical.

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:41,130
Let's assume that we want it for example to say or to perform an ending between two variables.

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,300
OK.

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,210
What do you mean by an end redeemed by an.

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:50,690
Or let's assume they wanted for example to say it is true and false for instance.

12
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,360
OK.

13
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,960
So again two means one false means zero.

14
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:55,890
OK.

15
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,580
So when I say logical operators that means the here the end or OK.

16
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,180
That's pretty much all what I want.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:10,530
Well look what I what I meant by logical operator operators and and or mainly OK so when I say end all

18
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,490
right.

19
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:19,260
That means I'm saying OK if this condition has to be true and this condition has to be true in order

20
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,980
for the entire result to be true.

21
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,700
All right what do you mean by this.

22
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,480
So let's take a look.

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,700
So when I say true please remember that 2 means one.

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,700
OK that's the overall idea.

25
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,740
True that means one false mean zero.

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,960
So I'm saying OK is 1 and 0.

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,810
What's the answer.

28
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,520
When I do 1 and 0.

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,980
Think of the ending operation as simply as of as multiplication.

30
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,160
Think of it this way it's not clearly a multiplication but think of it as multiplication.

31
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,530
So when you multiply one by zero the answer will be equals to zero.

32
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:52,770
All right.

33
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,610
Which is false.

34
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,640
Let's run that.

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,460
And that's actually what we have got here.

36
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,010
So when I say if I wanted to perform true and false The answer is going to be false.

37
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,220
All right.

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:02,970
So.

39
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,310
OK again from a logical perspective when I say.

40
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:12,600
And that means both conditions have to be true in order for the outcome to be true.

41
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:20,620
So here I'm saying okay this has to be true and this has to be true in order to generate a true output.

42
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,880
All right.

43
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,460
Let's take a look at another example let's assume true and true which is 1 1 and 1.

44
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,050
Let's compare that.

45
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,240
So the answer here.

46
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,050
What what what.

47
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,280
And so do we expect from that.

48
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,240
That would generate two that would generate one which makes sense heat I'm saying this condition is

49
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,940
true and as well this condition was true.

50
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,130
So the ending both of them will generate a true value.

51
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,620
All right.

52
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,840
Let's take a look at another example.

53
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:51,870
Let's assume we're going to ending false and true which is simply I'm saying okay I wanted to false

54
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,700
again mean zero ending the true means 1.

55
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,900
So the answer here we're going to be zero.

56
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,460
That's wrong.

57
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:07,170
That and that will generate false why because in order for the end gate in order for the and logical

58
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:12,170
operator to generate one both conditions have to be true.

59
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,620
So this has to be true.

60
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,360
And this has to be it's true as well.

61
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,560
In order to generate true output.

62
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,510
All right.

63
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,770
What about false and false.

64
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,210
If I say false and false.

65
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,540
Please make sure it's uppercase.

66
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:31,110
That should that means zero ending zero and the output should be obviously zero.

67
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,730
So if we'd say zero false and false that would generate output is false.

68
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,510
All right.

69
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,740
And that's pretty much what they mean by the end operation or the end date.

70
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,950
Let's take a look at the Aldgate or the end or the operation.

71
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,770
So when it comes to or OK if any of the two conditions is true that's it done.

72
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,920
We're good here.

73
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:59,730
I'm saying OK if the first condition is true or the first or the second condition is true the output

74
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,750
will gonna be true as well.

75
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,480
OK.

76
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:08,220
So or is actually better than the end which is you know the or simply will only get to generate zero

77
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:16,080
or only will generate false if both inputs are actually false or both inputs and actually zeros.

78
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,400
All right let's take a look.

79
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:26,730
Mistake Okay let's just let's say true or true that should generate true so I'm saying 1 or 1.

80
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,810
So the output should be 1.

81
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,400
Let's run that they would tell me OK.

82
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,160
True or true is actually true.

83
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,360
So true or false.

84
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:35,860
All right.

85
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,480
Which is simply again here.

86
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,260
That means I'm saying 1 or 0.

87
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,750
That's run that that would generate 2 Why.

88
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:50,820
Because when we use or if any of the inputs is true then the output will going to be true as well.

89
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,160
All right.

90
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,430
If I say for example K false or true.

91
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,050
Okay then here I'm saying okay.

92
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,670
0 or 1 right.

93
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,770
Which is FALSE again mean 0 2 means 1 4 and that that would generate 2 as well.

94
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:13,260
So please bear in mind that for when it comes to all operation if any of the inputs is true.

95
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,880
Again here one of them was true.

96
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,830
One of them was true.

97
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,590
One of them is true.

98
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,560
The outputs were going to be true all along the way.

99
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,460
The only case the order will generate exaggerate false.

100
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,860
Well if both inputs are false so going to say Okay.

101
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:32,700
False or false which seems simply to mean 0 4 0.

102
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,290
That would generate simply zero.

103
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:41,450
He's been in mind that he'd 1 or 0 that would generate 1 and 0 or 1 such that she didn't generate 1

104
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:47,800
gets on that and that's what we got here we got false which makes complete sense all right.

105
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,310
Perfect.

106
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,800
OK.

107
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,240
So that's pretty much all what we're all what I wanted to cover when it comes to end and or let's take

108
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,520
a look at kind of more practical example in an actual combining kind of the logical operators along

109
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,460
with a comparison operators and just one statement.

110
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,550
Let's assume that I wanted to evaluate this condition.

111
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,080
I wanted to say is six greater than two.

112
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,150
OK and is two equals five.

113
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:16,570
Right.

114
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,730
So please without running for example the cell.

115
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,640
Please tell me what what do you expect.

116
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,530
So simple here I'm saying okay is six greater than two.

117
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,420
Well what do you expect here on that condition.

118
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,240
Well that the first element was actually two.

119
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,770
So that means the first one was true.

120
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:39,820
And I'm saying end right I'm saying is to heat I'm asking is two equals five.

121
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,770
Well the answer is false right.

122
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:52,580
So when I perform true and false figures remember if I do true here and true and false the answer will

123
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:59,420
be false because again when you do and that means I'm asking this condition has to be true and this

124
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,790
condition has to be true in order for the output to become true.

125
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,970
So that means here I'm expecting the answer to be false.

126
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,170
That's wrong that's and that's what we got we got false.

127
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:08,390
All right.

128
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,590
So here I'm gonna leave you guys for just a quick challenge.

129
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,620
OK.

130
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,360
And I'm going to ask you to evaluate these two conditions.

131
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:25,430
So again asking is six greater than two or is two equals to five and you're going to have another challenge

132
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,260
as well.

133
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:34,690
I'm going to say is two equals two three and is four equals two three.

134
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,860
And I'm gonna say is 10 equals to 10.

135
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,530
All right.

136
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:49,260
So please go ahead guys and and pause a video and just without running these cells let me know what

137
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:49,910
you expect.

138
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,040
Do you expect here the answer will going to be false or true.

139
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,620
And here the answer is gonna be false or true.

140
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:55,880
All right.

141
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,610
Please go ahead and I'll see you guys after the challenge.

142
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,560
All right.

143
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,140
Hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge.

144
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,230
So here I'm saying OK it's six greater than two.

145
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,480
Well this answer.

146
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,340
Well that's true.

147
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,990
And I'm saying or is two equals to five or not.

148
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,480
Well two is actually not equal to five.

149
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,450
So that means here I'm saying it's two equals five.

150
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,560
Well that was false.

151
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,620
Right.

152
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,590
If I say true or false since we have all here then the outcome should be true.

153
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:36,010
Because again when it comes to or if any of the input is true the outcome will be true.

154
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,210
All right.

155
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,090
Let's run that.

156
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,750
Well that's pretty good.

157
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,780
Let's do the other next challenged I'm saying is two equals to three.

158
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,760
Well that was false.

159
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,390
And I'm going to say okay it's four equals two three.

160
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,730
Well that was false as well

161
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,010
and it's 10 equals to 10.

162
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,630
Well that was true.

163
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:58,960
Right.

164
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:05,040
So when it comes to end if any of the inputs to the end gate is false or a zero the outcome will gonna

165
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:05,470
be zero.

166
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,110
So here I'm expecting to be false.

167
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,620
All right let's run that and that's what we've got we got folks.

168
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,120
All right.

169
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,880
That's pretty much all what I have for the section let's recap what we have done so in the in this section

170
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,100
we cover the logical operators.

171
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,690
So now we know how can we perform ending operation.

172
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,660
How can form or operation.

173
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:31,450
And here how can we mix them make them somehow into some of the comparison operators that we have done

174
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:38,140
in the past in the previous section to come up with kind of more logic or kind of you know like an advanced

175
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,690
logic in a way.

176
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,240
All right.

177
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,100
OK.

178
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,730
In the next section we're going to cover the conditional statements which is very exciting.

179
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,950
I'm super excited because now we actually get to combine all what we have learned so far to perform

180
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:56,900
what we call it if else condition which is kind of the foundation which comes to programming in general.

181
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,250
I hope you guys enjoy the lecture and see you in the next lecture.
