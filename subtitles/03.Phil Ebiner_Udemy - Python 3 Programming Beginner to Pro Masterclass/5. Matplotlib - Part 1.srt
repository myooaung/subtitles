1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,730
Know everyone and welcome to this section and this section we're going to do a lot of kind of fun activities.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,100
We're going to see how can we visualize our data using meth plot lib.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,110
Okay.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:20,730
So first of all before I dig into the basic plodding techniques we're using meth plot lib this one to

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,590
go to that link first which is you know kind of the library the fundamental gotlib and you would see

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,260
that you can do tons of plotting exercises here.

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:36,120
It's an extremely powerful library that you can use within our Python and you can literally plot whatever

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,690
you want.

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,010
You can do really fascinating plots and all the codes are pretty much available for you.

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,840
You don't need to go when you're not becoming an expert you know in programming you can actually do

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,490
here you have an example for you find a job like for example like a heart for instance if you want to

12
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:56,190
do like a box plot if you want to do for example histogram if you want to do his to Glenn demos if you

13
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:02,180
do an error bar plots if you want a plot for example a different interpolations contour.

14
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:07,270
There are tons of you know like beautiful images and beautiful stuff that you can do here using their

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,480
plotly if you for examples.

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,580
Again that's just tons of dozens of examples that you can go and do it.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,660
Obviously can cover all this because that would give me latenight least like 50 hours to go.

18
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,030
So they're all going to take a look at you know a couple of key key examples.

19
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,010
So there's you know wonderful examples to check the buyer bought a demo they can open it you will see

20
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,330
that you know how can this basically they're called if you copy the code and simply run it within the

21
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,630
GOP to modbook you will get the exact same results which is amazing.

22
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,300
Then you can apply to your data is very very easy and very simple.

23
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,910
So let's take a look at some practical examples.

24
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,170
Let's assume that a wanted for example to plotless say a sine wave.

25
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,870
Okay.

26
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:55,260
So I'm going to do an important maths plotly dot PI plot S P L T which is kind of the standard.

27
00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:02,460
Again we imported an umpire in P We import Pand there's as PD We import their plotly the pilot has penalty

28
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,630
on this.

29
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,470
Then you imported it.

30
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,180
Now now we are good then you can use it here we important umpires MP and then what we're going to do

31
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:09,520
here.

32
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,360
I'm going to simply create an x and y.

33
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:19,740
So I need to create kind of artificial data and create an X simply by defining it that a pie array that

34
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,740
are evenly sample data at Stepney interval of point two seconds are going to go from zero to 10 with

35
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,320
the sepik interval of point two.

36
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,680
And that would be the value of X actually let's copy this let's create to win 8.

37
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,070
Let's do this and let's run this.

38
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,890
That would show us X action it's plot x 2.

39
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,290
Then you created x.

40
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,100
That's pretty much my X X as I'm going to create OK is zero point two point four point six and so on

41
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:44,700
and so forth.

42
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,310
Up until nine point eight or eight.

43
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,120
So what I wanted to do they wanted to I apply that specific function.

44
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,560
So on target or the sign of X and put them to Y.

45
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,100
So why equals to MP which is I've done that before dark side.

46
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,390
Ex Okay.

47
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,600
And in order to perform the plotting.

48
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,890
Actually let's separate that to unit X McReady in your cell.

49
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,810
Do this.

50
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,530
There will be the y value.

51
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,600
So now you have the y equals to sign X if you want to view Y.

52
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:20,580
Let's go and view why that would show us the values of why should only have the input which is our independent

53
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,470
variable.

54
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,340
And here you have a dependent variable which is my y axis.

55
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,850
OK the problem is that there looks very dry.

56
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,480
Looks very difficult to actually visualize it so what we need to do that we need to visualize should

57
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,880
plot it within the ship.

58
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,220
That's the beauty of of metalocalypse.

59
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:44,340
You can simply do plot P L T dot plot and you specify you x any specified way.

60
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,460
That's it as simple as that.

61
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,680
Then what you could do.

62
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:53,390
They can specify the label if you want to put let's say something on the x axis do X.

63
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,020
Describe what that signal is.

64
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:00,420
If it's time if its distance if it's whatever you can specify the date on the y axis and then you can

65
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,740
add the title as well to the grab.

66
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,880
Let's take a look.

67
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,950
If you do this.

68
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,580
That will give me perfect.

69
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,550
Now give me actually my input which is my x axis.

70
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:15,330
I'm going to show my y axis and he were going to show the data that a wanted or or the string that it

71
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:21,370
wants to display on the x axis each time I want to do here on the y axis sure it's sine wave and here

72
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,350
showed my tail my first plotting exercise on it.

73
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,690
OK.

74
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,650
Obviously what you could do I'm going to show you as well that later you can increase or change the

75
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,400
thickness you can change colours.

76
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,590
You can change you know and can do like really pretty graphs out of here and show you how can you do

77
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,770
that in the next section.

78
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,290
All right.

79
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,660
So we could do here.

80
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,990
We Let's see if one of you x.

81
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,240
That's my value of x.

82
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:52,060
So let's assume that we wanted to plot scatterplot which is simply I wanted to let's say create random

83
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,120
values for x around the values for Y.

84
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:00,490
And then when I plug them together okay it's not like like the irregular plot that we had before he

85
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,280
had passed the sign we just plodded like so several like go away points in a space so what would you

86
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,080
do here.

87
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,670
You know the final key n.p. around them to rent.

88
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,100
Okay.

89
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,140
For normal anomalies to data.

90
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,050
You'd have six hundred points that's for X here and the fine why again why your end.

91
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,660
MP The trend of the trend.

92
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:26,920
Six hundred and I again can use P.A. Keda and specify X and Y and here what it could do we begin to

93
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,620
create a figure and specifies whether the size of my finger can provide let's say fig size equals 2

94
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,720
7 and 7.

95
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,780
So if I do that that will generate simply my figured he'd want to make a little smaller.

96
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,190
Then because pacifies give four let's say four different one that will make it a little bit smaller

97
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,530
and you can make it obviously way bigger to 14 and put you're going to be crazy going be crazy big.

98
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,180
So how can you the size of the figure and plot scatterplot on it.

99
00:05:52,690 --> 00:06:00,080
What if her wanted let's say to plot multiple curves or on the same on the same plot on the same figure

100
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:11,110
you can do that as well by plotting you know X value Y value common x value Y value common x value y

101
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,860
value and that's going to be on the same plot which is very powerful.

102
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,100
So again important point as MP.

103
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:24,240
Now partly of the pipeline does appear P.A. we have them there before and then humidifying MP to arrange

104
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:31,710
0 5.2 that will create again evenly distributed data with point to second sampling interval and he to

105
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,450
an engine in a Circuit City plot here.

106
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:39,570
Let's assume that one of the plotted say the V8 variable will itself so TNT.

107
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:46,190
I want to specify if say t n square N T and T CUPE for example.

108
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,120
And what I could do as well.

109
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:55,480
They can actually change is whether the the style of the of the of the curve of the deal.

110
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,880
So what I can do here and that's where the ON THESE We are elements come into play.

111
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:05,210
So let's assume that if wanted for example the first curve to be red so we specify R for red.

112
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,590
Then he has specified blue for B for Blue n g for green.

113
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,350
OK.

114
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,030
You can specify the line which says well he'd have the line with the 1 5 for instance.

115
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,370
You can also specify the actual style of that of the line.

116
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,250
So he defined one for example to have desch So to specify the style which is desch.

117
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,430
He just was fired say.

118
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:31,160
So going to be S10 for a square and here is that you know like hat stents for tilings.

119
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,520
If I had done this that would come up with this beautiful kind of graph.

120
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:41,380
As you can see you so have my linear line and then I have my square and then have my cube and you guys

121
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,030
can see that's dash.

122
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:50,530
These are squared and these kind of triangles go it an obvious and I'm going to have an entire section

123
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,920
just as explored.

124
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,860
Not all of these different combinations.

125
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,800
How can we change the width and can we change.

126
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,550
Let's say the columns and so on and so forth.

127
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:03,010
OK it's if I change the line with make let's say 15 on that you'll see the line begins way secured for

128
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,750
the last four for mainly 4.

129
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,890
For all the data.

130
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,610
If you go back here and it's it make it go back to 5.

131
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,580
He can change simply.

132
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:18,390
All this is going to show you how can we change him and create more beautiful growth than this.
