00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.290
Hello everyone and welcome to the machine learning section of the course.

2
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:13.540
I'm super excited because my passion is mainly on machine learning and it's one of the hardest topics

3
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.370
right now as we speak and it's a great skill to have and aquire and this lecture we're going to walk

4
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.350
you through it quick introduction of what you mean by machine learning more about fishell intelligence

5
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.490
and what they mean by deep learning.

6
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.330
Okay which is kind of a buzz word that we're been listening or hearing to for a long time.

7
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.050
And later on in the course we're going to walk you through three key studies or key.

8
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.110
We're going to discover we're going to classify cancer as a case study.

9
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.900
We're going to classify you know smiling or happy faces using evolution or near and your network enel

10
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:54.110
going to predict as well revenues and kind of you know kind of a from a business perspective using simple

11
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.030
linear regression.

12
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.090
I'm super excited.

13
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.600
So Keith let's go ahead and start with the introduction section.

14
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.030
So when we mention actual intelligence or machine learning the first thing that comes into mind.

15
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.550
Okay.

16
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.960
These you know like stuff just released into robotics applications and maybe like sci fi movies.

17
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.150
But that's not necessarily true.

18
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.430
OK.

19
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.600
That's not actually true.

20
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.720
So that's the image that we get once we think about official intelligence actually machine learning

21
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:21.630
or attrition.

22
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.660
Intelligence is literally everywhere around us.

23
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.450
OK.

24
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.950
Can you think of an application for example that you know like that we can apply a machine learning

25
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.830
or artificial intelligence to piece posit video and maybe think of snowfall applications that might

26
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.360
be of value or might apply.

27
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.260
Machine learning or artificial intelligence.

28
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.300
All right.

29
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.400
So let's take a look a couple of applications and actually list of them here too.

30
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.350
So we have tons of applications so for example for face recognition or face facial recognition let's

31
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.810
say Facebook for example or it performs tagging automatic tagging.

32
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.250
That means you know that there's some way of artificial intelligence that had been implemented in the

33
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.650
background.

34
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.960
Seeing for instance it's built on machine learning and artificial intelligence using google search is

35
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.910
built on artificial intelligence and machine learning.

36
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.410
Amazon recommending that the commander system which is when you know for example by let's say a product

37
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.830
and then you'll find that you know like Amazon is it commending to you a couple of other products as

38
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.370
well.

39
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:36.170
That's a perfect application for machine learning to detecting spam emails for example like you know

40
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.070
like how does the urine or a gene mail for instance classify some emails as spam or ham.

41
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.770
We call it that.

42
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.540
Again this is built on machine learning and artificial intelligence.

43
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.930
And obviously one of the hottest topics or hold one of the hardest fields at the moment is autonomous

44
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.690
vehicles which is how can you let a vehicle drive on its own in different you know weather conditions

45
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.110
and different environmental conditions.

46
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.000
It's very very like you're complex challenging strategy.

47
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.850
And that's again deep learning a special intelligence machine learning techniques and applications are

48
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.230
implemented as well in here.

49
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.850
Okay.

50
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.600
So again that has tons of applications.

51
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.080
It's a great skill to have.

52
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.800
So let's keep going.

53
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.320
So let's take a quick overview of the process of how these machine learning algorithms kind of yonder

54
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.010
in general machine learning as a study of algorithms.

55
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.680
Meaning the teachers computers how to learn from experience.

56
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.960
So the overall idea that we want it to train computers to think as you know is us basically as humans.

57
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:40.430
OK.

58
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:41.750
How can we do that.

59
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.380
We do that through experience.

60
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.090
When you say experience which is through training data we feed the lot of teeling data to these machines

61
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.480
of these you know like machine learning algorithms and they learn as we move forward we learn from experience.

62
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.810
And that's kind of you know an overview of the steps.

63
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.180
First we feed the training data to our machine learning model and then what happened is we kind of you

64
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.190
know and data analysis is perform and then we find pattern within the data.

65
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.350
OK I'm going to learn how do we classify you how do you perform or find patterns with the data that

66
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:23.510
in the data and then the model of perform predictions or make a decision and then these models learn

67
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.370
from experience.

68
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.350
And you know the performance keep going up as more details become available.

69
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.780
That's kind of the overall process for machine learning intelligence.

70
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.440
The class in general the what about at the moment because we're going to take like you know tons of

71
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.380
examples of practically examples.

72
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.300
Dig a little bit more deeper into this process.

73
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.220
So the first was this is kind of one of the most important slides to look at which is the big picture.

74
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.220
What's the difference between artificial intelligence machine learning kind of classification progression

75
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.100
and clustering.

76
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.020
All right.

77
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.240
So first at the you know kind of the highest level in when it comes to artificial intelligence.

78
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.780
Right.

79
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.560
This is basically the science that enables computers to mimic human intelligence.

80
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:16.010
We wanted to see how our human brain works and we wanted to copy it basically make a copy out of it

81
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.310
you know in a method using mathematical equations using a bunch of codes.

82
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:27.620
We wanted to replicate or mimic how how do we think humans think which is really powerful because now

83
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.850
you can actually develop like a super hero of you know superpowerful of human beings.

84
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.230
You know I was superpowerful computers there can we be way more intelligent than humans which has been

85
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.760
escape.

86
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.380
Think about it.

87
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:45.920
So a bunch of celek Within artificial intelligence some of subfields of machine learning robotics computer

88
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.720
vision and there's tons of other you know spheres within it within it within it.

89
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.370
Our main focus in this course is we're going to focus on machine learning in general.

90
00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.370
So Machine learning is a subset of official intelligence.

91
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.890
So Machine learning is kind of you know through artificial intelligence.

92
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.360
You know the big picture and within it there is the machine the machine learning simply enables machines

93
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.730
to improve at a past with experience.

94
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:17.120
So through feeding more of the detailed teaching data we can actually teach the machine you know how

95
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:23.630
to be or how to learn and how to perform a specific task and how to get better at performing these tasks

96
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.700
over and over again within the machine learning.

97
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.860
There is only three categories there is supervised learning that is unsupervised learning.

98
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.310
And there is what we call the reinforcement learning k.

99
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.710
Ok so supervised learning is simply training algorithm that use labelled.

100
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.070
Input and output.

101
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.550
And we're going to take a quick example right off of the slide in to what they mean by supervised learning.

102
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:57.200
Simply put when supervised learning we have categorized data we have legal data.

103
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.450
So for example we have let's say seeders of images of dogs and we feed the computer.

104
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:08.690
We give you an image of a dog and we say okay when you see that image that means a dog.

105
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.270
All right.

106
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.450
It's like teaching you know kind of a kid in a way.

107
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.010
OK.

108
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.570
This is a dog you know you keep repeating this.

109
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:19.950
You know when you see different images of different kind of breeds of dogs you're provided with a label.

110
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.610
You know you see this is a dog.

111
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:22.640
This is a dog.

112
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.370
This is a dog.

113
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:29.990
And he keeps repeating this and that's how you know kind of we teach the machine through experience

114
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.830
or through the kinds of teeling dataset in a supervised fashion.

115
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:41.020
The other way or the other is an old form of subset of machine learning some kind of unsupervised learning.

116
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.280
With this.

117
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.850
These are basically training algorithms that has no label.

118
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.130
So we just feed the data to the network without labelling.

119
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:55.180
So we just feed a bunch of images of dogs and that's it used there is no label.

120
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.110
We don't tell the computer that this is a dog.

121
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:05.160
We discover that on its own which is again super powerful if we as humans find it for example difficult

122
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.460
to find different patterns we can feed this data to the machine.

123
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.580
And just in an unsupervised fashion the network would learn on its own.

124
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:19.390
The third category is one called the reinforcement learning algorithms that take action to maximize

125
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.930
the cumulative reward.

126
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:27.910
So for example let's assume they were teaching a kid for example to let's say explore the environment.

127
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:36.030
You leave the kid in a room that has let's say flame or a candle and it has let's say like a like a

128
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:41.390
bottle for example of water and we let you know that kid discovered that environment on its own.

129
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.780
If the kid moves for example instead say touches the water and let's say drink it.

130
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:46.090
OK.

131
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:46.860
He feels good.

132
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.950
Everything looks great.

133
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:53.760
So it kind of you know why the you water doing this action with let's say plus five points or 10 points

134
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:55.770
or something like that.

135
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:01.530
And if the kid for example was around elisei pouches let's say that fire okay we'll get hurt.

136
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.550
So we know that he would be penalized if he touched this and if we keep repeating this you know in a

137
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:12.360
kind of law enforcement fashion and that's how we teach for example you know what colour the agent to

138
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.210
maximize the reward.

139
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.220
So we leave the agent in an environment and we let adjust learn on its own as well.

140
00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:24.360
Quote from the enforcement fashion or reinforcement learning fashion these are kind of the categories

141
00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:31.560
and this course will get if they focus on supervised learning aspect of it within the supervised learning

142
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.760
there are two categories there is classification and there is aggression.

143
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.980
Okay going to discuss what they mean by classification of aggression in the next lecture and in the

144
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.140
unsupervised learning.

145
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:47.670
Well getting to use one of the major categories will clustering which is how can we clustered the data

146
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.300
you know which without any labelling will just feed the data in.

147
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:56.580
And we just you know of the technique of the machine learning algorithm just learns on its own and just

148
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.940
class the deed in a different klosters.

149
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.240
Alright and that's pretty much all for this lecture.

150
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.880
Let's recap what we have covered so far.

151
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:09.990
So we in this lectures we covered that you know we learned that machine learning is not just robotics

152
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.490
applications that are actually everywhere around us.

153
00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:19.020
There are Siri Facebook face detection Google search Amazon self driving cars and even SPAM and ham

154
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.800
detection email detection.

155
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.750
This is kind of an overview of the process.

156
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:29.160
You know we feed the tinny data analyze the data find patterns make predictions and decisions and then

157
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.180
learn from experience.

158
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.740
And finally we went through the big picture.

159
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:40.080
We learned that machine learning is a subset of a of our intelligence and it's mainly categorized in

160
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.830
to see categories supervised unsupervised reinforcement.

161
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:49.310
And in our Of course women are to mainly focus on this section which is supervised learning classification.

162
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.380
Andrew Gresh Alright I hope you guys enjoy their lecture in the next lecture.

163
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:57.600
We're going to dig a little deeper into what do you mean by the classification where the embetter aggression

164
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:01.030
what they mean by reinforcement learning in the little bit more details.

165
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.890
I hope it doesn't do their lectures and see you in the next lecture.
