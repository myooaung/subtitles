00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.110
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.020
This lecture we're going to discuss in a little bit more details.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.650
What do you mean by supervised learning unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.210
All right let's get started.

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.910
So as we mentioned earlier in the previous lectures that supervised learning mainly used training use

6
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.190
training algorithms.

7
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.280
OK.

8
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.450
Based on label data based on labelled input and output.

9
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.130
Let's take a look at an example.

10
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.380
Let's assume that we wanted to use supervised learning OK to train a model and that model will simply

11
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.930
gonna categorize you know we're going to field certain images and we're going to categorize these images

12
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:50.420
into let's say teeshirt trouser pullover dress code sandal shirts niekro a bag an ankle boot.

13
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.540
So simply put we have our what we call it extreme which is our training dealer which is our input to

14
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.390
the model and that's our what we call it white tree which is the output of the model.

15
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:11.060
Again it's like teaching a kid when you see this image of let's say it's NACAR then assume that the

16
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.310
output you know that the true label is niekro.

17
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.130
OK.

18
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.930
Basically another image if we for example saw that image you are teaching the kids when you see this.

19
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.870
That means it's an ankle boot.

20
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.760
All right.

21
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.460
One more image.

22
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.020
If you see this image if you see it's a t-shirt that means that's belongs to the label class t-shirt.

23
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.340
If you see this that means it's a bag and so on.

24
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.370
And that's how we actually performed the training in a supervised fashion.

25
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.750
You basically have label data that you know as we mentioned here and we will mention these are the kind

26
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.570
of the labels that we're referring to the data structure that the dealers organize and the dealer is

27
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.970
labelled Okay.

28
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.640
And then you can feed all that training data exchange and ytn you know like tons of them tons of these

29
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.740
images to the model in a supervised fashion.

30
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.540
And the modern dern's that when you sees for example any new image of a t-shirt for instance the model

31
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.860
will learn moving forward.

32
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.500
And that's how we do it in a supervised fashion.

33
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.540
Right.

34
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.740
And then we can assess the performance of the network.

35
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.360
Okay.

36
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.110
By comparing the predictions of the model compared to the two label.

37
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.450
Why.

38
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.790
Because we know the truth since we know the truth.

39
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.140
We can compare the performance of it to our predictions coming out of our models are they.

40
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:43.230
The next category of learning or machine learning is all of the unsupervised learning here.

41
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.650
We don't have labels.

42
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.450
We just have input data.

43
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.430
We just have a bunch of pictures.

44
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.820
We just have a bunch of images.

45
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.990
Okay so we don't have Lieben data.

46
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.570
And what happened is the algorithm attempts at discovering hidden patterns within the chindit so the

47
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.250
algorithm would go in there and try to find maybe categorize it.

48
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.920
Unsupervised learning is zeni particle.

49
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.350
Why.

50
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.330
Because we don't need to have a label date providing label data is actually very expensive process.

51
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.080
Just imagine for example going to Google and try let's say to categorize images let's say cats or dogs

52
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.840
in two different categories and assigning labels to each of them.

53
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.440
That's like you know like a daunting task.

54
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.530
You know he was takin it say you know 10000 images or maybe 100000 images and so on for the unsupervised

55
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.870
learning week it can be used to analyze complex data set that humans might find difficult to interpret.

56
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.570
OK.

57
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.050
And obviously there's no feedback why because we don't know the truth.

58
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.380
We don't know the the truth because we don't have labels.

59
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.160
Right.

60
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.120
Let's take a look at an example.

61
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.550
Let's assume that we have our input there and our input data consist of let's say red stars let's say

62
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.760
Green for example.

63
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.430
Circles you know bluish tangles and so on.

64
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.350
And the data here it's just so much that humans you know is having it very difficult to actually interpret

65
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.180
the data.

66
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.440
We feed that data to the model and it's very important here to realize that there are there is no labels.

67
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.030
Is the overall idea where it comes to unsupervised learning.

68
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.290
The more than simply will learn on its own.

69
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:26.810
We say okay maybe these categories okay these like you know like like purple colour you know like maybe

70
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.960
crosses are classified in a specific cluster.

71
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:38.030
The first cluster and then maybe ludic feingold's or another cluster maybe green circles in another

72
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.780
cluster and you know a red star is another cluster and that's how we do what we call a deed clustering

73
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.410
a within unsupervised fashion on supervised learning.

74
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.140
OK.

75
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.210
All right.

76
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:56.110
The last category will quality enforcement learning and reinforcement learning is actually one of the

77
00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.750
hardest kind of topics now in machine learning and learning in general.

78
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.120
Why.

79
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:09.130
Because we can use it to simply you know like like like teach the machine to do you know like tasks

80
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:16.260
at a much much better rate or much even better performance compared to humans which is fascinating.

81
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:23.230
So reinforcement learning allows machine to take actions to maximize or cumulatively war.

82
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.130
And then we we discuss that example before in the past in the previous lectures booklets to discover

83
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.270
it again.

84
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.560
Let's assume that we have our environment which let's say our room in here and we say put a kid for

85
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.530
example in this room and in this room we have let's say kendel and we have let's say you know like a

86
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:47.930
milk for example model N we asking the Asian to kind of learn in the environment just like we'll get

87
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.090
what we going to do with get to maximize the reward.

88
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.810
So.

89
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:57.640
And you know like so the kid we're going to give him points if he discovers the environment in a correct

90
00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.460
fashion we're going to penalize that kid if we discover the environment in a wrong fashion.

91
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.850
So the kids will start learning Okay.

92
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.680
So we're going to say for example go ahead to that milk bottle and let's say touch it.

93
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.570
So found it safe and maybe start drinking from it.

94
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.230
Maybe he feels good and then the reward will be let's say plus 10 points.

95
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.630
We're going to give give that kid 10 points.

96
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.570
So moving forward as we go ahead that kid knows that.

97
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.940
Okay.

98
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:29.790
Now I can actually if I do this I'm going to get more points and that's how we do what we say we can

99
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.000
maximize the cumulatively Ward.

100
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.810
That's what we meant by if the kid for example went in there and let's say pictures for example like

101
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:38.590
a candle.

102
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.080
OK.

103
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.850
He would get minus 10 points here we get penalized.

104
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.540
And that's kind of you know all a car.

105
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.260
So he would not moving forward.

106
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.560
OK.

107
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.020
I should not touch that candle flame ever again.

108
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.490
Why.

109
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.590
Because has been penalized.

110
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.070
Right.

111
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:57.760
So it has been you know kind of impacting or just impacting the costs of for him or is just again impacting

112
00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:58.950
that awarded for it.

113
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:05.260
And that's the overall idea that the information algorithms learned through trial and error through

114
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:11.080
Colorado awarded and penalty to import and kind of you know naming conventions we call of the environment

115
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:16.510
which is like say the room here that the kid is within and we have all the learning agent which is the

116
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:17.740
kid in this case.

117
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.190
OK.

118
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.120
And again based on the award of penalty Asian improves it's environment knowledge to take or make better

119
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.070
decisions.

120
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.150
And again you know we think of the agent lipsey robot and Elliotts environment and that's what we do.

121
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.820
You know we give you know that lesion is rewarded.

122
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.580
And you know like the agent we're going to start taking actions within the environment.

123
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:42.910
When you say thinking actions for example touching you know let's say that you know fire or whatever

124
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.430
and you know they're drinking from their milk bottle for example.

125
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.560
All right let's recap what we have discussed so far.

126
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.750
So here in this lecture that we cover supervised learning which is when we have label data input data

127
00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:02.490
we have there's an update and we started teaching the model in a supervised fashion.

128
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.780
We discussed what do you mean what you mean by unsupervised learning which is when we have input data

129
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.600
in order to squashers what we don't know like we don't have labels for it.

130
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.240
OK.

131
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:18.760
And the machine on its own tried to categorize them in two different klosters and that's what we call

132
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.110
it unsupervised learning.

133
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:27.490
And the third category is reinforcement learning when we try to maximize or pick actions to maximize

134
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:32.440
cumulative reward by for example getting more points when you know when you do something wrong when

135
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:38.070
you do something right and penalize the agent when they do something wrong.

136
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.500
All right.

137
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.600
In the next lecture we're going to dig a little bit deeper into what do you mean by deep learning.

138
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.770
We just kind of a very buzz word that has been you know common nowadays.

139
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.500
And I'm going to learn as well what are the different categories what are different techniques when

140
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.410
it comes to supervise unsupervised and deplaning.

141
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.570
I hope it doesn't do their lectures and see you in the next lecture.
