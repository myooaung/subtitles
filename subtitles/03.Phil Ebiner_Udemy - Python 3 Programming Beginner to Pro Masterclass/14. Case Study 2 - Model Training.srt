00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,810
Hello everyone and welcome to the model training section.

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,010
All right so just let me recap real quick.

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,700
So first of all we know that the data the cancer data and we loaded it the we didn't have to clean the

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,530
data or anything.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,390
Everything was pretty much ready for us.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,170
We knew the head and tail all the data and then we verify the data afterwards using keyboard.

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,290
And then what we're going to do right now is that we wanted to simply set up the taining data set the

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,610
testing data set and actually run or turn our model.

9
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,750
Okay so let's get started.

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:41,640
First step is we wanted to define what are our x values or what's our inputs.

11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,910
And I want our y events which is our outputs.

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:44,370
Okay.

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,370
So first step is to define our inputs X simply.

14
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,600
So what we're going to do.

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,070
They're going to let X equals to simply other data is contained within our data frame which is d.f.

16
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,390
underscored kenson if you go as they call that was simply our data free.

17
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,610
So we're going to do here is that we can do d.f. underscored cancer.

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,320
That's our data frame.

19
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,860
And what we need to do with that we need to include Yes it's the Empire values we want.

20
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,670
And fortunately we have the target in there.

21
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,300
We have the output included.

22
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,610
And what we need that we not only include the input and the X..

23
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,620
So we're going to do we're going to call that data free but instead we're actually going to drop the

24
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,570
last sample we'll drop the target column.

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,690
How can we do this we can actually use the method drop to actually drop our

26
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,220
column in order to do this.

27
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,760
We're going to define This is basically our target that we want it to drop.

28
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:39,420
Okay.

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,890
Any to define at what access we're going to be dropping from the dropping the in column that we're going

30
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,480
to find the access one is specifying the column.

31
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,870
Well again let's recap so I'm going to do that we called the Data frame need in time data for him except

32
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,020
the target event.

33
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,170
That will be our x value.

34
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:57,820
Okay.

35
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,950
You want to view it as a site X and let's run the cells.

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,900
That we tell us okay that's been much all very values.

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,470
And if we scroll down here.

38
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,510
Let's see if we have the target or not actually we don't have the target which is perfect.

39
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,240
That's what we expect.

40
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,600
The next step is that we wanted to define the output or why we're just simply our target column.

41
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,340
So we'll get to the final y equals to d.f. underscored cancer.

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,290
All right.

43
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:28,950
And we're going to do is we are going to simply the target column.

44
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,830
Simply that we're in the final weeks right.

45
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,700
So let's run let's fund the cell and then let's you why.

46
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,500
So simply you can see here this is simply our target values again.

47
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,770
So the users are ones.

48
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:47,810
If it's so if it's malignant or benign and we have the next 500 system on it the next step is we want

49
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:55,080
to let's insert a couple of cells and I'm going to need to do that we wanted to split our data into

50
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,940
training data and testing it.

51
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:03,940
If you get a call that we have to take in our model we're were going to do that we use a subset of our

52
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:09,310
data for training and then after them on the list trained what we're going to do in order to test the

53
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,420
model we're going to use the testing dataset which is data said that the modern has seen ever before.

54
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,180
OK.

55
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,050
OK.

56
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:24,430
So what we're going to do we're going to use the killer learn to actually does that for us.

57
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:32,170
So were going to do is going to load from Escuela and we're going to try to model selection underscored

58
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,640
selection.

59
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,440
And again we're going to specifically imports.

60
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,550
Okay gene tests split actually full a tab that will actually do like an auto complete for you so that

61
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,370
what you're going to your team to split which is simply the method going to be using to split the split

62
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,270
data into testing entity.

63
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,010
Let's run this gets done successfully.

64
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:59,200
The next step we're going to do it that we are going to use to split screen test if we're going to have

65
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,630
a complete and if we click shift tab that will tell us OK how can we actually view the data.

66
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,650
How can we how can we call the team split.

67
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,490
If you scroll down you would find that there's an example so you can actually simply just copy and paste

68
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,580
this example.

69
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,900
So this girl is sort of more of this let's copy and paste.

70
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:25,730
So we have extreme excessed Whiting weightiest team splits and he just specifying the values of x and

71
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,320
y.

72
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,470
Okay.

73
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,290
So and that's pretty much all one means to have to split.

74
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,110
We have X we have y here we have a size.

75
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,810
So what percentage do we need to be included in testing.

76
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,330
So here we generally specify let's say point three values.

77
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,020
Okay or maybe point two.

78
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,750
And he didn't specify them in them state.

79
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,440
Those One answer is to be to match specifically.

80
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,090
And so you have to select kind of a random state that matches mine.

81
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:58,360
So let's say I'm going to select five for example v. the Basically the method I'm going to work and

82
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,030
get into usually turnback extreme X test y teen and white test.

83
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:03,940
Okay.

84
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:04,660
All right.

85
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,840
Let's run it let's see what's going to happen so successfully.

86
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,750
And what are going to do with it.

87
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:15,920
Actually when have you what's extraneous so extreme actually going to show you this next scene looks

88
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,530
fine.

89
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,150
And how do you see that this 450 overall.

90
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:26,150
So we actually divided the Empire State cancer dataset into proportion a subsequent of it which is only

91
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,160
80 percent which is 155 Rose.

92
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:29,860
All right.

93
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,750
What if I wanted to view let's say Why.

94
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,670
Why teen for example.

95
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,360
So were going to do let's say Why there's good team there.

96
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:43,730
Tell us okay this is why our team and the values is that's our basically our target.

97
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,030
Okay.

98
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:53,600
And the less 455 I ought to do is let's say if one of you let's say X tests ok if you want to view the

99
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,770
actual testing data you will see that we have hundred and forty laws which make sense.

100
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,340
Now we actually divided the data set into training and testing on it.

101
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,230
Okay.

102
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,660
I think right now we are ready to change our model.

103
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,790
This simple it's really simple.

104
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,270
The first step we're going to use Escuela and we're going to use support of the machines simply to do

105
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,740
the classification right.

106
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,050
So we're going to do we're going about from Escuela.

107
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:19,670
Right.

108
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,460
And going to dog as VM was said for support of a machine.

109
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,690
We're going to import s.

110
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,260
Okay.

111
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:32,420
And what we're going to do let's run this and the next step is that we're going to simply use as well

112
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,540
the metrics inside which is kind of classification report and confusion Matrix because we use it as

113
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,490
well as moving forward.

114
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:46,520
OK so I'm going to do was going to write from scaler and dot matrix.

115
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:54,390
I'm going right in Port and we're going to import classification to port justification underscored reports

116
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,860
and we're going to import confusion underscored metrics.

117
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,480
Okay.

118
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,540
Let's run it through successfully.

119
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,520
What we're going to do is 10 shift simply an object out of the B C.

120
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,250
Okay.

121
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,590
So going to do is going to right let's say you can limit whatever you want.

122
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:16,620
You know I'm just name is vishy underscored model that's pretty much what object is going to be using.

123
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,160
I'm going to write as see.

124
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:18,640
OK.

125
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,950
That's basic Is she an object is a b c model.

126
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,670
So we're going to do in order to do the perform the training.

127
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,710
We're going to use the fit method on in on the object that we just created to actually train our model.

128
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:36,680
So are you going to use a key as we see underscore model which is basically an object that we had here.

129
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:42,680
And they're going to use a fit method and we need to pass simply our input and output which is simply

130
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,480
our tuning.

131
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:50,350
So gettings underscore team I'm going to use y underscoring to simplicio the date if we don't get that

132
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:55,090
done that means the model has been trained and we are good to go.

133
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,340
Obviously here within if event with the model yet.

134
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,480
And that's all going to be doing in the next section.

135
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,880
I hope you enjoy that section and see you in the next section.
