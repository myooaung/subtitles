00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,530
Hello everyone and welcome to this section and this lecture.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,750
We're going to keep going and solve questions 6 7 and hopefully 8.

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,390
If we if we can.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,410
So I'm asking you to write a code that takes a number and indicates if it's positive negative or zero.

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:18,910
All right.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,590
So it could do me to say okay x equals two.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,160
We're going to take an input from the user which is whatever input I mean to say okay please.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:28,560
Okay.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,540
My apologies please enter a number.

10
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,700
Okay.

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,470
And please bear in mind that that value has to be casted into an integer format.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,330
If you're on that let's take it into number let's say 30 and we got the 30 number here and then we have

13
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,170
to compare if x is less than zero.

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,590
We're going to do something.

15
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,680
I'm going to say Okay print.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,690
Well number is negative.

17
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,040
Right okay.

18
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,970
I say okay.

19
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:13,450
Else if if x is greater than zero going to say Okay print say number is positive.

20
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,830
Right.

21
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,900
And the last one I'm going to say else if these two condition not satisfied.

22
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:28,260
Well print the number is zero all right.

23
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,820
So here I entered 30 right.

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,140
Let's run that's going to say well the number is positive.

25
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,480
Okay let's try one more time.

26
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:43,290
Let's say for example enter zero and press enter and let's run that's but me well the number is zero.

27
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:49,260
Okay so one more time I mean to say for example minus 40.

28
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,100
Let's run it and let's try it again here.

29
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,630
Tell me okay.

30
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,780
Well the number is negative.

31
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:54,720
All right.

32
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,280
Perfect.

33
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,940
Let's keep going.

34
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,170
So question seven.

35
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,590
I'm asking you to write a script that will prompt the user for an input and check if the number is divisible

36
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,310
by five.

37
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,230
But not a multiple of seven.

38
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,840
OK it might sound a little bit confusing but it's actually pretty pretty straightforward.

39
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:22,150
Let's enter an integer or enter number or whatever and say okay I equals two ends and I say input apologies

40
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:32,290
inputs and we're going to say enter and number between 1 and 100.

41
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,450
Okay let's run that looks good.

42
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,420
Let's run it to 40 and list the check.

43
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,310
I make sure that actually makes sense.

44
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:39,960
I equals.

45
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,470
He looks good.

46
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,110
And let's write the condition here.

47
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,740
We're going to say OK here we wanted to see if the number is divisible by five.

48
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,070
If you remember to compare it to do this mosaic.

49
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,040
If and then I have to condition that I have to satisfy because here they have divisible by five but

50
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,600
not a multiple of seven.

51
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,840
So kind of I have two conditions two conditions this and this.

52
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,720
Right.

53
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:10,350
And if that condition is satisfied I can have dinner right the condition yet I say Okay print let's

54
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:20,230
say for example number satisfies satisfies the requirements.

55
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:32,890
And we're going to say OK for example let's say the number is actually divisible by five and not multiple

56
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,090
multiple of 7 which is the requirement.

57
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,930
Okay I am going to say okay.

58
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:49,400
Else if their condition is not satisfied I'm going to say okay for example print when I say no.

59
00:03:49,850 --> 00:04:03,360
Does not satisfy the requirements requirements get and you can write for example numbers divisible by

60
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,390
five not divisible by seven.

61
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,650
Here too if you wanted to write.

62
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,710
That's the easy part.

63
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:12,900
Let's go ahead to that little bit tough than to say okay how can we check if the number is divisible

64
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,510
by five or not.

65
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:21,410
Well if you take the number if you divide it by five and got the remainder right.

66
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:28,620
If you divide by five and the remainder which is what you obtain is a member that mod here that basically

67
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,610
divide by five.

68
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:34,860
They take the number divided by five and obtain the remainder and see if that remainder was equals equals

69
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,730
to zero.

70
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,440
That means the number has been successfully used to be divisible by five.

71
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,680
So to save divide twenty five by five.

72
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,870
Well the remainder to zero.

73
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,570
That means Why.

74
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:51,350
Because that means 25 is actually divisible by five which is the first element here.

75
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:58,980
When I say end right here I wanted to say but not a multiple of 7 which means if I divided the number

76
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:09,090
if I divided it by seven and obtain the remainder right then I mean there should not be equal to zero.

77
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,190
I know it's still a bit confusing OK but that's pretty much how can you say it's not a multiple of 7.

78
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:22,050
That means that number let's say for example if the number is let's say 14 for instance OK.

79
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,230
Number 14 if I divide 14 by seven.

80
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,830
OK that means that the number is that I mean there is no remainder right.

81
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,280
The caution is to show that I mean there is zero.

82
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,160
That mean this condition is not satisfied.

83
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,530
Why could that mean number 14 is actually a multiple of seven right.

84
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,620
OK.

85
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,490
Any other number let's say four let's say 12 for example.

86
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,760
That's not a multiple of seven.

87
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,920
And so on so forth.

88
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,260
And that's it.

89
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,330
Let's run it.

90
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:53,720
So actually let's run it one more time so I can say okay let's enter number.

91
00:05:53,750 --> 00:06:00,420
You know I'm asking to enter number say for example number 30 for instance let's run and let's run that

92
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,160
number 30 and let's run this.

93
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:03,480
Tell me.

94
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,180
OK.

95
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,690
Number satisfy the requirements which means the number is divisible by five.

96
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,020
And not a multiple of seven.

97
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,310
Well let's take a look.

98
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,530
So I enter number 30.

99
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,200
OK so number 30 if I divide 30 by five.

100
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,020
Well 30 is divisible by five.

101
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,780
Because you know the answer is six.

102
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,360
Right.

103
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,760
So I mean the remainder is zero.

104
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,240
However if you'd like 30 by seven actually.

105
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,650
There is a remainder right.

106
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,320
So that means a number is not a multiple of seven is not divisible by seven.

107
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:32,990
Right.

108
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,220
So number satisfy the requirement.

109
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:41,760
Let's run it one more time and let's enter for example 35 one at one more time one more time.

110
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,330
They mean well no it does not satisfy the requirements.

111
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:44,670
OK.

112
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,040
Why is that.

113
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,890
Because 35 is actually divisible by five.

114
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,070
Right.

115
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,970
So that I mean that is actually zero.

116
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,340
Right.

117
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,680
Let me that among number is divisible by five.

118
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,570
OK but thirty five is actually a multiple of seven.

119
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:58,820
Why.

120
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,520
Because if you divide 35 by seven you actually get an answer out of it.

121
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,900
Right.

122
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,800
And that's a very important concept.

123
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,820
That's pretty much what we're looking for here.

124
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,690
And that's why this condition has been false when we use the number 35.

125
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,370
You guys can test it pretty much on whatever values afterwards.

126
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:22,330
And that's pretty much conclude section question number seven.

127
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:22,610
All right.

128
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,620
OK.

129
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,850
And that's pretty much all what I have for this lectures.

130
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:33,610
In the next lecture going to keep going and solve questions eight through 10 please stay tuned and see

131
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,970
you guys in the next lecture.
