00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.990
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:11.030
In the previous lecture we discussed how can we lower the data which is simply our smiling and smiling

3
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.440
faces.

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.740
So here we are in the previous section we just came up with extreme ytn accessed weightiest which is

5
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:25.760
kind of you know the data that we need to start training our our model and the section in step 3.

6
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.370
What we're going to do that we're going to go ahead and start visual either data.

7
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.090
Let's take a look at know a couple of images and see if they actually make sense or not.

8
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.990
All right.

9
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.300
So I'm going to do here that we're going to first generate around the number.

10
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.020
Okay.

11
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:49.130
And using the random package and we're going to do that we're going to image use plot that image show

12
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.330
to actually show our image.

13
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.620
All right let's go ahead and see what can you do with this mistake.

14
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.530
I equals two random dot reined in.

15
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.990
And then I can select any random number from one to six hundred.

16
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.320
Why.

17
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.590
Because we know that we have 600 images in the training dataset.

18
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.400
Right.

19
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.190
So when we add on this letter on it and actually it's take a look at that one generally.

20
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.930
Just any random number it's 4 9 3 any number between one and 600.

21
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.010
Let's run it again.

22
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.320
8 5 9 3.

23
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.050
One more time.

24
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.540
They'll get five 10 whatever.

25
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.430
Right.

26
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.640
Then all we need to do here.

27
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.590
They're going to go ahead and say okay LTE The images show actually show our image and we're going to

28
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.850
pass along our exchange.

29
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.050
OK.

30
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.500
Which is our an umpire Ray and we're going to select in the eye.

31
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.160
So simply put a single key.

32
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.820
Let's go with index you in here.

33
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.360
And you know whatever that round the number is and actually plot or show us our image.

34
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.970
All right.

35
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.260
Let's run it again.

36
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.280
Let's sit on it.

37
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.780
And that's our image in here.

38
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:53.280
OK.

39
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.850
He looks kind of you know pretty pretty sad he doesn't look like it smiling to me.

40
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.020
So let's make sure that the actual label which is you know the opiate intended output of our network

41
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.820
which is supposed to be either zede or one actually makes sense to.

42
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.150
So let's go ahead and do this.

43
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.450
We're going to do going to take a print and we're going to pass along a word why underscored teen age.

44
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.980
We're going to see the exact same eye again here.

45
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.260
I'm just plodding the index or the kind of the label.

46
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.940
All right.

47
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.790
Bringing the label you know ytn corresponding to that image extreme.

48
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.400
All right so let's try that.

49
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.180
And it looked like one for us which is you know a kind of little bit strange because he was expecting

50
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.770
the person to be like you know one means smiling right.

51
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.350
It doesn't look like smiling to me.

52
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.440
So let's hear it again.

53
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.050
Let's pick one random number again and the number again doesn't look happy to.

54
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.190
And that makes sense.

55
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.460
So it should show zero.

56
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.960
That's fine.

57
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.610
Again one more time.

58
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.780
OK.

59
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.240
And zew as well.

60
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.010
He doesn't look happy.

61
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.650
Let's run it again one more time.

62
00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.960
Zero.

63
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.550
Key I want to see a happy face.

64
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.060
Unfortunately we can't see any happy face Xu as well he looks sad as well.

65
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.190
One more time.

66
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.560
That's a look smiling.

67
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.690
And that's where the tag actually showed one which makes sense.

68
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.370
So instead of actually doing this you know in a very like you know like a menu one way or when to do

69
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.750
here they want to create a grid okay of 25 images.

70
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.130
So simply put I wanted to show five rows and five columns and going to put all our images in there.

71
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.060
OK.

72
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.060
And just to let you know what kind of in one just for a loop what were going to do here and then go

73
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.850
ahead and plot all our images in one in one shot.

74
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.020
OK so let's define the dimensions of the grid and say okay deblois underscored a grid.

75
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.800
You can call it whatever let's say equals five.

76
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.620
And length of the grid equals two five as well.

77
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.130
All right.

78
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.260
Kate looks good.

79
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.980
Let's run there.

80
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.190
Looks good.

81
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.820
All going to do it as well.

82
00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:05.550
They were going to use the subplots P.A. subplots from Matlock live which is well done before the games.

83
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.640
You know we're not familiar with it.

84
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.270
Please go ahead.

85
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:14.650
Back to the introduction sections within the course that talk about how can we use map or live misick

86
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:15.490
figure.

87
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:23.500
And then we're going to say axes equals two tlt Dot sub plots.

88
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:31.360
And they're not going to pass along our underscore grid deblois underscore grid and we're going to pass

89
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.230
along our figure size of Fig size.

90
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.690
Big size I'm not going to pass along.

91
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.600
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:40.860
Fixes equals two.

93
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.860
They're going to pass along here our 25 by 25.

94
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.230
This is just a very lucky number here.

95
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.230
I tried it before and it looks pretty good.

96
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.710
So that's how we justify the subplots.

97
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:59.510
We're going to do here afterwards when I say okay axes equals two axes dot raval that's simply we're

98
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.180
going to flatten our our our matrix our matis was just going to make it.

99
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.890
The axes were going to flatten it up.

100
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.080
I'm going to show you why we do that right now when we start plotting.

101
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.340
Then we need to get before going ahead and doing the full loop.

102
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.740
We're going to get the number of training data sets we're going to say entraining which is number of

103
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.580
tiny dataset equal axes dot I'm sorry.

104
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.570
Equal to length of our extreme.

105
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.100
So we went to the extreme in which we know that there are six hundred samples which is good the length

106
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.840
of exchange.

107
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:36.570
And with that in entry and now we are ready to do ahead go ahead and do the full loop and say okay for

108
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:47.680
I in n.p. that range and we're going to pass along our beta can do a full loop from zero up till 25

109
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.800
which is the length of the grid and the width of the grid.

110
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.450
What to do there.

111
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.260
So could you underscore a grid multiplied by underscore grid.

112
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.000
Correct.

113
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:05.910
And afterwards we're going to say okay let's select any random index again empty dot random which I've

114
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.760
done before dot rent in it.

115
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.500
And again select any random number from zero up till underscores training.

116
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.200
That's looks looks good.

117
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:24.810
Again just healed we to do a follow up from to do basically loop around our 25 semples which is you

118
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.900
know L. great times w off the grid.

119
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.930
Every time I'm going to select a random number from 0 to 600.

120
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.910
Okay.

121
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:36.210
And then afterwards let's start plotting it to say it axes.

122
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:44.970
And I'm going to pass along index dot images show and we're going to pass along some discord treen and

123
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.280
Wiggin pass along our index or here then and the number we're going to feed it back here.

124
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.570
And we're just going to show that image in that specific index which is you know like let's say the

125
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.680
first element within it and then go ahead and loop again.

126
00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.670
And that index we're going to be updated.

127
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.550
Come here select a random number and then plotted again in the second for example element and the Matrix

128
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.410
and so on and so forth.

129
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:13.560
And then afterwards what I wanted to show as well that wanted to show the label so and so key axes but

130
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:24.220
I dont set underscored tidal and what going to pass along our y underscored train of index index or

131
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:24.550
I.

132
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:31.140
And actually let's go ahead as well and said the font size to let's say equal to 25.

133
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.330
And one last step.

134
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.060
Actually it looks good.

135
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.320
Now let's go ahead and start to plot in and see what's going to happen.

136
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.320
Let's run that Gates a little bit of why that's good.

137
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:48.210
As long as we'd have seen any error and here we go here we have again our meetings or grid 20 basically

138
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.320
five key elements and five elements.

139
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:57.400
And he reported the actual image along with the actual intended label or in the intended target class.

140
00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:58.600
So this is smiling.

141
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.500
So it shows one good this is not smiling he said Zero.

142
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.730
He seems said zero sad sad.

143
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:09.760
Looks good smiling smiling Okay smiling in the kids one.

144
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.560
All right.

145
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.810
It seems like the data is pretty good makes sense to us.

146
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.790
He's smiling you know smiling.

147
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:20.040
The point is if you don't make sense of the data if you're being tough you know for the deep deep network

148
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.090
or the convolution your networks actually make sense of the data too.

149
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.240
So what you need to do with it actually first to review the data.

150
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:33.960
And that's kind of you know the strategy going to follow anyways to before running any before actually

151
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.750
training the model you need to make sure that he has a human.

152
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.330
Actually this makes sense to you.

153
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.040
All right now we're ready for a quick challenge.

154
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.610
What I'm asking you to do is please go ahead here.

155
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:49.380
And I wanted to instead of plotting a grid of five by five.

156
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.570
I want you to great to plot a grid of 10 by 10.

157
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:53.220
OK.

158
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.600
And showing the indices as well.

159
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:54.960
All right.

160
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.510
Please go ahead and post a video.

161
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.990
And I'm going to be back after the challenge.

162
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:04.920
All right.

163
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.590
Hope you were able to figure out the challenge yourself.

164
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:12.980
So when I ask you to do it simply go ahead and plot 10 by 10 matrix.

165
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.970
So let's go ahead here and change this number from five to 10.

166
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.850
He is changing from five to 10.

167
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.380
And let's give it a shot.

168
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:27.950
So sticking to a bit more obviously because we're played pleaded think he had hundred images.

169
00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.540
And here we go.

170
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.270
Here are all our images.

171
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.170
So first point is okay.

172
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:38.690
The data looks good to us but the only problem is you know it seems like we need some space in here

173
00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:45.090
and we need to remove as well of the slaking all kind of the number of pixels you have 64 by 64.

174
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.210
I know that the pixels are 64 bit 64.

175
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:51.220
Anyways in order to do they're going to select axes.

176
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:59.740
I am going to say Dot access and we can't send that to off that we're simply going a kind of you know

177
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.760
a disable of the x and y here.

178
00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.450
Labels and wanted to do as well actually written on them.

179
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.810
Let's see what's going to happen.

180
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:14.180
All right.

181
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:15.220
Okay looks good.

182
00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.080
One more change we can do as well.

183
00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.910
Maybe we can increase the hype here between the images.

184
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:29.290
So all we could do going to look at the ulty dot sub plots underscore a just an we can set each space

185
00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:36.010
which is extensive and the likely height here was kind of you know the space in a vertical direction

186
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.890
equal to two point four or eight or whatever whatever number you want it to.

187
00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:41.990
Let's run it again.

188
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:47.710
Here we go.

189
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:48.460
Looks great.

190
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.030
So now we have our image and we have our label as well.

191
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.610
Looks pretty good to us.

192
00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.590
And the data make sense now.

193
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.390
All right.

194
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:56.060
Okay.

195
00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.400
So that's pretty much what I have for this lecture.

196
00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.460
Again let's recap what we have done so far.

197
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.430
He just selected around the number we plotted the image along with its label.

198
00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:05.470
That looks good.

199
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:11.710
And he did we went and plotted basically a grid or kind of a matrix of 10 by 10 or five by five showing

200
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.700
all the images along with the labels.

201
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.860
And the next section we're actually going to be a very exciting section because now we're going to actually

202
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.190
go ahead and stop training our model.

203
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.390
Please stay tuned and see you in the next lecture.
