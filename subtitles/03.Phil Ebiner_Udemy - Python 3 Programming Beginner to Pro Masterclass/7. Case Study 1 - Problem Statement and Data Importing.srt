00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,230
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,400
I'm super excited to talk about these simple linear regression and to actually program and write our

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,450
code initial in book right now.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:11,970
All right.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,860
So please go ahead to the hour course package.

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,980
You'll find the jupe the lawbook and nick name predicting Lavigne using simple linear regression which

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:28,920
is kind of our extreme example Morgan to do here is going to walk you through step by step into a how

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,550
can we actually develop our model.

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,340
OK.

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,220
All right.

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,550
So just a quick overview of our steps.

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,930
So first we're going to import libraries.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,050
We're going to import our data set and then I'm going to visualize our data set and we're going to create

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,180
testing and training data.

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,880
We're going to train the model that's the model and evaluate our model which is pretty much kind of

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,220
tied to our testing the model.

17
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,440
But we're just going to do it in a kind of a more visual form and that's pretty much it.

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,350
That's pretty much to conclude our section here.

19
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,260
Alright.

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,520
So first step is the problem statement.

21
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,080
Again we cover that problem statement before when we walk through the intuition of simple regression

22
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:14,820
look let's walk you again through it again let's assume you own an ice cream business and you would

23
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,730
like to create a model that could predict the daily revenue in dollars based on the outside temperature

24
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,000
which is in degrees C.

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,140
You decide that a linear regression model should be a good candidate to solve the problem.

26
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:35,070
Our dataset contains our independent variable x which is our outside temperature and our independent

27
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,430
variable is why you choose our over all day revenue generated in dollars.

28
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,650
OK so again we only have to call.

29
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,800
That's why we're going to call it simple.

30
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,480
And the next question is or the second point is why it's called linear because we can assume a bit as

31
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,420
a linear relationship between the two.

32
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,390
OK all right let's get started.

33
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,870
So first insert new cells.

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,610
We press a few There's a number from before.

35
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,770
Once you press a that will in new cells the first step is we're going to import our library we're going

36
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,140
to import pandas spdr we're going to import.

37
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:16,570
No pie is n.p. because as a member of getting pandas for data freeing for many predation.

38
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,230
Again what it's like excel in a way you can import.

39
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:19,600
No.

40
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:19,810
None.

41
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,250
Pies.

42
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,740
M S N P.

43
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,380
I'm going to use some pie mainly for for detre many pollution going to show you show you what we're

44
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:33,240
going to do with pie and penders right now and then we're going to do some plotting as well.

45
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:41,350
So in a poor maths plot libya's Well map plot lib dot PI plot as realty.

46
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:50,430
Anyone going to import seaborne as well import seaborne seaborne as s.a. again Seaborne is very powerful

47
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,080
when we wanted to do some of it.

48
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,990
Again it's kind of an advanced form of metal gotlib for plotting but we use it mainly for for.

49
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,850
Very pretty.

50
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,260
Kind of images or diagrams meaningful statistical analysis.

51
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,270
I'm going to show you as one how can we do that.

52
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,920
Well that's pretty much a first step.

53
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,820
Let's sit on the cells let's sit on it.

54
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,560
So here it is loading and now we're good.

55
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,040
And that's the first step.

56
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,140
That was pretty easy it's actually delete so to delete cells we just come here and press d d.

57
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,300
D this is so deep the Delete delete delete.

58
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,730
We wanted to insert new cells or just going to press sequence press a again.

59
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,700
So the new cells first step is we wanted to obtain our data set.

60
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:40,500
So if you go back here you would find our way to a basically machine learning in the machine learning

61
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,670
section or machine learning and by section.

62
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,110
And what you could see here is that here we have our ice cream.

63
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,970
It's actually opened that fire.

64
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:59,610
So once we opened the file if you guys can see here simply in this data we have two columns.

65
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,360
We have temperature n head we have revenue.

66
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,210
OK.

67
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,940
And let's scroll down and you'll see that we have around 500 than 1 or 5 on the semples.

68
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,750
Pretty much.

69
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,330
Okay.

70
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:11,960
All right.

71
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,000
So go back and let's get started.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,250
Let's see how can we load the data.

73
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:23,200
So the import of the dataset was going to use pandas to say okay I'm going to call the data or my data

74
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,140
from I'm going to call it let's say ice cream.

75
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,660
They're not going to do here.

76
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,170
It's going to use a PDA.

77
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,180
Dot read underscore.

78
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,550
C is V.

79
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:41,950
And then we're going to pass along the name of our fire which is ice cream data dotsie is V.

80
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,330
All right.

81
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:48,250
And that's pretty much again wagonload the data using read discourse is the that we're going to put

82
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,190
it in our data free ice cream free.

83
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,120
All right now what.

84
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,720
Good.

85
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,980
Let's take a look at our ice cream.

86
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,760
We're on it.

87
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,180
That's pretty much our dealer here.

88
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,940
It's again.

89
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,210
PANDAS is very powerful.

90
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:06,910
Only the like it because it's kind of again it's like you know again using excel within a python development

91
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,060
environment.

92
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,340
So you have a temperature here we have our everything.

93
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,160
All right.

94
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,920
Again we have our 500 rose by two columns.

95
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,360
Looks exactly right.

96
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,150
What if what if for example.

97
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,080
I don't want to plop fully in a sense of that difference.

98
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,370
I wanted to play cricket see the first five samples ONDI.

99
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:31,300
What it could do is say okay ice cream and then a person let's see the first song let's say first story.

100
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,600
Ice cream let's say dot head.

101
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,530
And then add a person on five.

102
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,990
That means a one of the head.

103
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,320
I went the beginning of it and I want it only the five samples.

104
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:48,100
What if I wanted to get the last elements of nhp ICE CREAM messy dot tail and then let's say let's say

105
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,690
five or six or nine or instance or 10 for example.

106
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:58,410
And that will give me simply because I mentioned 10 here that will give me the 10 last samples within

107
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,720
our debate offering our own perfect.

108
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:02,890
OK.

109
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,920
The next step is we wanted to use or called the described method.

110
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,390
So were going to say okay ice cream that's again our data from.

111
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:20,980
They don't describe any food on it that will give me kind of a quick run over on the statistical data.

112
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,560
Then you'll see the account number of samples.

113
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,930
500 samples.

114
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,860
I mean the average kind of value is 22.

115
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,280
The temperature.

116
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,080
Our revenue was around 500 dollars a day.

117
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,820
We have our standard deviation which is our dispersion from them is around 8.

118
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,800
And our revenue is one hundred seventy five level of minimum value.

119
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:47,710
The minimum temperature actually is zero of our maximum value was 45 temperature.

120
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:57,250
So the temperature ranges from zero to Greasy to 45 degrees C the revenue ranges from ten dollars to

121
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,720
up to 1000 dollars.

122
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,090
And he would give you kind of you know the 25 percent down to 50 percent percentile and 75 percentile

123
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,610
I don't worry about it at the moment.

124
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,590
Again we're going to discuss that when we actually seen the model moving forward.

125
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,560
OK.

126
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,750
All right.

127
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,450
Just to clarify I wanted to make sure that this is actually a beta free.

128
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:23,070
If you remember from before we can say okay type and then you kind of pass along our name now then Milkie.

129
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,920
That's actually a pen.

130
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,540
There's a called Dr. fremont's the frame which is simply that the three or eight.

131
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,940
Okay.

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,410
Before we conclude that section let's go ahead and do a little bit of just a mini challenge.

133
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,580
Let's assume that only one in two of pain.

134
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:47,070
The first let's say 15 semples of the heads and the last 15 samples within the data.

135
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:47,690
Okay.

136
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:54,960
Please go ahead and parse the video and I'll going to give that that challenge a try.

137
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:02,680
Let's try to again we wanted to applaud the last the first 15 semples of the data and the 15 last semples

138
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,500
of the data.

139
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:08,480
Again you guys can perform that he only can insert new lines and do that he does well.

140
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,280
Again please go ahead pause the video.

141
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,490
And we're going to solve the challenge after the pots.

142
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,530
All right I hope you were able to figure it out the challenge.

143
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:33,130
So in order to pain or get our first 15 samples and last 15 semples I say okay ice cream which is our

144
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,210
data from the head and then we're going to say OK only 15.

145
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,300
That's all we need.

146
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,020
And that again will get open for us.

147
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:46,630
Our 15 first few samples and in all the talk in the last last 15 semples I'm going to say again our

148
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,610
ice cream.

149
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,380
Dot tail.

150
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,210
And again we're going to pass along the last 15 semples.

151
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,100
If we're on that that will open in our last 15 sackfuls within our data.

152
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,920
Again that was pretty much a very easy challenge.

153
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,550
I hope you were able to figure that out.

154
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,560
All right let's recap what we have done so far.

155
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:11,240
We have done so far that we were able to in step one important all our libraries which is simply panned

156
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,130
there's no pie metalocalypse and keyboard.

157
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,840
And in step 2 we're able to obtain or load our dataset from our sleazy file and Walgreen were able to

158
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,110
as well obtain or review the data.

159
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:31,100
The first couple of samples using the data frame had is the head method on the our data free and he

160
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,330
pass along our number of samples that we wanted to view and he were able to as well obtain the last

161
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,030
samples as well.

162
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,570
They could look at the data and were able to use the described method as well to show us kind of a quick

163
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:49,890
statistical overview of our data showing them to count the mean standard deviation of the men and Max

164
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,620
venues.

165
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,570
All right.

166
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,360
And that's pretty much all ahead for this lecture in the next election.

167
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:02,310
We're going to see how can we actually go ahead and create our testing and teaching dataset and we're

168
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,430
going to visualize our dealers as well and you'll see more in the plot.

169
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,950
A lot of our beautiful choice.

170
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,250
I hope you guys enjoy their lecture and see you in the next lecture.
