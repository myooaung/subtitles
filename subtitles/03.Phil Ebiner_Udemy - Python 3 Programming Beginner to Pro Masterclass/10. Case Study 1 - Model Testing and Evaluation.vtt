00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.660
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture and this lecture.

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.330
We're going to test our model.

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.180
Okay.

4
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.970
All right.

5
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.310
So let's recap what we have done in the previous lectures and the previous lectures we were able to

6
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.550
train our model.

7
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.520
So we teach actually our modern using our extreme and whiteread and we're able to apply in our aggressor

8
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.220
using the Filter By applying the method.

9
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:28.470
And then he was able to simply obtain our slope and our y intercept as well Kate and we had this kind

10
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.760
of a little bit of a mini challenge comparing the intercept when it's set to true.

11
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.490
And we set the false and let's actually go ahead and set it to true first because we're going to test

12
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.470
our model now.

13
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.280
Let's run all the cells again.

14
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.580
And now we actually saw the value for the way intercept which makes sense.

15
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.580
Let's go ahead and test our model.

16
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.300
OK.

17
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.270
So in order to test our model or going to do here they're going to say okay I'm going to use I wanted

18
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.890
aggressor which is ours.

19
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.740
This is basically our team country model.

20
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:05.860
If we use the Predict method on our aggressor we can go ahead and pass along our Instead of training.

21
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.560
Going to pass along our testing them and say okay X test and then simply we're going to be our.

22
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.610
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.660
That's simply all going to be our.

24
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.700
Why predicts.

25
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.340
So again here we have regressive dog predict X test and that should determine the premiere and this

26
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.600
premera Begin to be out.

27
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.320
Why predict then what we could do.

28
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.210
Can compare the Y predict to the action y value which is why underscored tests.

29
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.750
So simply put why test that out to actual data points.

30
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.520
Okay why predict.

31
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.640
That's kind of the best fit that the model was able to oppty take less action on this.

32
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.280
Let's take a look at why predict.

33
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.770
Let's see what's what does it look like why underscored predicts that strong it.

34
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.690
And this is simply our alpert's.

35
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.920
These are our output from the training data.

36
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.780
If we take a look at why test that's our data that should you know that the two values that were able

37
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.950
to obtain from the testing data.

38
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:15.270
Okay let's go ahead and actually plot simply our training and our testing to compare the results so

39
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:24.000
to do here is a game to use our IMET put the scatter function in a smoky dot scanner scatter.

40
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:32.120
Then we're going to pass along our X underscored T and I'm going to pass on why tree an We're going

41
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.180
to set let's say the of let's say to red.

42
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.920
Okay that's good.

43
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.640
Section on that right there where we plot our data for us.

44
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.060
This is simply all our data exchange waiting.

45
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.950
I haven't done anything yet.

46
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.020
Now we want to plot outline one plot out aggressive.

47
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.230
How can we do that.

48
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.920
I'm going to say skip the P.A. dot plot and all going to do here.

49
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.130
There's going to say okay we're going to pass along all our extreme again.

50
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.190
That's on the x axis.

51
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.030
Same points seem extreme.

52
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.870
But instead of plotting the whity while going to do here we'll get a plot the predictions coming out

53
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:09.540
of the model.

54
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.170
Okay.

55
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.140
What do you mean.

56
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.300
Let's see how can we do it first.

57
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.770
Going to get aggressive.

58
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.630
Dot predicts n.

59
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.840
Going to pass along our exchange.

60
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.830
And let's actually call it college equates to let's say Blue Ray.

61
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.300
So what happened here.

62
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.370
Here we simply say okay I'm going to plot here.

63
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.420
Our true data is these are two points here.

64
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.440
We plotted the outcome of the output from our outer model.

65
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.410
So again plot exchange versus whatever just coming out of our aggressor.

66
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.720
I'm going to use extreme.

67
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:46.730
Run the model.

68
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:47.530
The mother in.

69
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.390
Why.

70
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.800
And that will get to be y kind of Y predict.

71
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.200
Let's run that.

72
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.740
And that's pretty much it.

73
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.340
That's the state line that we where that model has been able to obtain.

74
00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.530
Looks pretty good.

75
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.910
Actually that's no longer a very great fit.

76
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.970
I want to point out a data point.

77
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.210
Or we could do here just to make the graphics a bit pretty messy skip plot plot realty go to y label

78
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.040
and we could pass along why you will get to be our revenue.

79
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.750
Let's say that will be in dollars.

80
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:28.820
Four of them are going to say p l t dart's X label and that would be our temperature SH Let's say units

81
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.230
in degree.

82
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.880
In degrees C K looks good and can give it a title as well plot title.

83
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.060
I could say for example revenue.

84
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.210
In dollars versus our temperature.

85
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.220
Okay.

86
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.430
And kind of call it as well to specify that that's for our team indeed.

87
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.450
A very key point very important.

88
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.900
Well it's from that first so let's run it again.

89
00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.690
Here we have our temperature at our Xed label.

90
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:00.950
What we wrote here.

91
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.740
We have old why build revenue in dollars and yet we have revenue versus temperature for the TV deal.

92
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.620
Very important point a key element here is that we're just using the taining data set and we have an

93
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.290
visualize the testing data set yet.

94
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.350
Let's go ahead and visualize our testing data set.

95
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.280
So what world going to do here.

96
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.710
They're going to again I'm going to be our kind of mini challenge when I'm asking you to do is please

97
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.470
go ahead.

98
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.290
And I wanted to use the exact same code.

99
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.000
Okay.

100
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.270
Two visual testing beta said instead of the training data set.

101
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.090
OK.

102
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.940
I hope you guys were able to solve the challenge.

103
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.380
Please go ahead and pause the video and I'm going to be back right after the challenge.

104
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.130
All right.

105
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:53.420
I hope you guys were able to figured out the challenge so well ask you to do is simply plug the exact

106
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.050
same graph but using the testing data.

107
00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.200
So we're going to do it and say okay go here copy and come.

108
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.840
He had controller V4 paste an organ to do he is going to plot instead of the training.

109
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:06.580
I'm going to say Okay.

110
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:16.160
And I plug the testing x test versus Y test and he's not going to use sort of X I'm going to use X desks

111
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.440
and he's going to say OK get aggressive dog predicts instead of passing along the extreme.

112
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.090
We're going to pass along our next guest.

113
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.570
We have our revenue.

114
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.230
Temperature hasn't changed everything versus temperature.

115
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.130
And they'll be for our testing.

116
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.350
Testing data.

117
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.510
Right.

118
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.920
Let's try that and see what's going to happen.

119
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.920
Okay.

120
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.000
Looks great.

121
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.080
So first of all first observation is OK.

122
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.370
This decline was actually a great choice.

123
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.420
That's a full step even for the testing.

124
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.650
The key element here is that you see the point here of so many.

125
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:52.010
Right.

126
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.310
Why.

127
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.650
Because that's kind of you know 75 percent of the need for the testing.

128
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.480
Points out a little bit less why.

129
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.730
Because there's only 25 percent of the deed because that's how we divided the data before.

130
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.570
Right.

131
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:04.690
Okay.

132
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.650
And why you can see here this Dateline was actually a pretty good fit even for both for training and

133
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.820
for testing as well which means or indicates that's that's a great was a good choice to start with.

134
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.850
The last point that I wanted to say.

135
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.680
Let's assume that one of you know to utilize the models.

136
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.330
Now I have the model.

137
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.720
How can a applauded that modelling and practice what it could do and say okay why.

138
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.540
Predicts Okay equal is too aggressive.

139
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.910
That's simply our teen model kind of like a package within that aggressive object to mistake.

140
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:43.100
Dog predicts and here can literally pass along any value you want.

141
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.620
So you can say okay that's for example simple.

142
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.860
So what you guys can do is you can say okay that's my sample sample temperature.

143
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:56.720
Let's call it simple t key section to underscore smpte and let's say there will be whatever temperature

144
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.230
let's say for example it's 35 degrees.

145
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:04.470
So this is 35 degrees C what you could do going to say Okay.

146
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:06.100
Go ahead here.

147
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:12.170
Now I have my train model then it can predict but he the Predict method on our team model and pass on

148
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.630
any value any value you want the mother will go.

149
00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.000
Then predict the expected revenue.

150
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.100
And that's the power of machine learning.

151
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.220
Now once it's been the model that it can use it to whatever value.

152
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:29.240
Even then for example the 35 sample that if I'm the grisi wasn't seen by the model during training or

153
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.860
during testing which is great.

154
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.660
Let's run that.

155
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:40.520
Let's take a look at why underscored predicts if you run it and that's it that's our expected revenue.

156
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:46.000
So for example let's say if you run the exact same model for example your company and someone came and

157
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:53.240
tell you Okay let's test that model for example let's say 45 degrees C and I say a 45 and let's run

158
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.840
it run it and the expectation is a thousand and 1000 dollars.

159
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:02.110
If I had the grisi the explications down 1000 dollars makes sense what you could do as well.

160
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.240
And that's kind of again another minute challenge I'm asking Les to do.

161
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.530
Let's select three values.

162
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.160
Okay.

163
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:13.340
So going to say okay sample t we're going to select it to see values pick whatever values you want and

164
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.260
test our model.

165
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.570
Get me please three revenues corresponding to this temperature.

166
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.370
Please go ahead and pop a video and see you after the challenge.

167
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:26.510
All right.

168
00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:32.060
You guys were able to figure out the challenge yourself so I ask you to do is simply pick three parameters.

169
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:39.260
Let's assume they're going to pick For example 10 I'm going to pick 20 and I'm going to pick 30.

170
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:45.220
So first there were going to pick let's say 10 let's sit on it run it and 10 etches in the rate down

171
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:45.890
to 60.

172
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.000
Makes sense.

173
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.610
Greg please go ahead change it to 20.

174
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:54.400
And when you're up to 20 that will generate around for 473.

175
00:09:54.430 --> 00:10:02.500
Makes sense to granstedt it to 30 percent run it and 30 will indicate around 600 87 looks pretty good

176
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:03.370
right.

177
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.720
Actually the way that our mother works.

178
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.020
All right let's recap what we have done so far.

179
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.590
So we have done so far is that we were able to test our model.

180
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:17.590
So here after we've seen the model we use it to predict We have a clinic method on our aggressive to

181
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:23.500
give us a kind of worldwide predictions and what we have done here is were able to plot our training

182
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:30.340
data versus our model and our testing data versus our model and to test as well outmoded for different

183
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:36.980
values of temperatures to kind of predict various values for our everyday rates.

184
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.740
I hope he was able to.

185
00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.370
I hope you guys were able to enjoy this case study.

186
00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.830
I hope you were able to.

187
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:48.320
All right.

188
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:53.690
Look you guys were able to figure it out of the challenges along the way.

189
00:10:53.690 --> 00:11:00.020
I hope you're able to find you know the case study useful and informative and see you again in future

190
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.500
case studies.
