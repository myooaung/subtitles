00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,400
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture and the PBS lecture.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:11,910
We're able to do some data visualization and what if I've been able to use Word Cloud to actually visualize

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,050
you know the kind of all the important words in here in any text.

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:23,070
That was kind of our mini challenge and we're able as well to use our reviews Colin and actually visualize

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,160
some information in here regarding our dataset which is Amazon reviews dataset.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,820
And this lectures I'm going to show you how can we perform some data cleaning or some feature engineering

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:33,900
again.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,460
And in this course we're not going to be focusing mainly on machine learning.

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,210
We're going to have obviously a section on machine learning.

10
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,330
But here the objective is just we're going to walk you through how can you just do maybe some data manipulations

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,810
and just get it ready just do some data cleaning and we'll see how can we make it ready for to be to

12
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:55,800
be processed afterwards.

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,270
But this is not the objective.

14
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,030
The objective is just to review the data view it and maybe do some visualization as well.

15
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:02,870
All right.

16
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,020
So let's see how can we do that.

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,740
So first let's make sure that you have psychic learn installed on your computer.

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:20,810
The next step is to say okay from scalar dot feature extraction dot text we're going to import something

19
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,330
called Count vector laser.

20
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,440
OK.

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,930
So what's going to happen here is when I wanted to do it I wanted to see for example how many times

22
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,120
let's say the word love has been mentioned in the reviews.

23
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,610
How many times let's say the word quality have been mentioned the reviews.

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,730
These are very important words or very important keywords that might like might affect us kind of you

25
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:48,830
know as a product manager for instance in a company or as like a decision maker you need to know what

26
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,490
people are talking about especially we are dealing let's say with big data like this that's not big

27
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,650
you know that big but it's but it's a lot of information so we need to kind of you know kind of do some

28
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,510
feature engineering and do what we call it count victimizers.

29
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:06,870
In a nutshell what we need to do they need to convert all these reviews which is a bunch of words into

30
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:12,080
a bunch of numbers indicating how many times let's say the word love has been mentioned how many times

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,350
or what quality how many times the word let's say awesome has been mentioned and so on.

32
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,270
So let's say how can we do that.

33
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,560
What we could do we can say okay we're going to instantiate so now we imported the class.

34
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,760
So let's go ahead and essentially hit an object out of our class.

35
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,870
So going to say Victor riser equals to count Victor riser.

36
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:40,810
So instantiated an object and then afterwards we're going to say OK let's do vector riser which is our

37
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:41,880
object.

38
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:49,420
We can say dot fit underscore transform and you're going to pass along here simply what I'm looking

39
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,140
for.

40
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:57,220
They wanted to pass along my the F Alexa which is simply go up.

41
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,820
This is simply what I'm looking for right.

42
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:06,160
I wanted to translate my verified the views into the count victories of words.

43
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,880
So let's go down.

44
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,490
And here we go.

45
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,900
So I could do and say Okay let's go here and paste this.

46
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,020
So I can say okay vector risers actually.

47
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,490
My apologies this supposed effect vector riser.

48
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:22,040
This is a vector could apply fit transform and that should simply transform our reviews.

49
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,630
Actually it is simple and pretty straight forward into what we call it here.

50
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:34,640
I call it Alexa on the score count vector riser vector riser

51
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,560
get shift enters.

52
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,690
Looks good.

53
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,500
And here we go.

54
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,410
Let's take a look at Count victimizers.

55
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,220
Copy paste and let's do that shape.

56
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:48,880
Entered.

57
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,830
And that's what we're getting.

58
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,500
So it's actually powerful because now we simply transformed our 31 50 views.

59
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:56,800
OK.

60
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,770
Three thousand one hundred and fifty views into a matrix in a way.

61
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,190
OK.

62
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,730
What an array per say.

63
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,990
What's what the Matrix says.

64
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:04,220
OK.

65
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,010
So we have see 150.

66
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,820
However we have for almost 4000 columns.

67
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:15,170
So the matrix has you know like 320 150 views which is equivalent to the how many views do we have.

68
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,670
But it has almost 4000 columns which indicates how many words do we have.

69
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,830
OK.

70
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,750
So simply put I'm going to show you the mathematics right now.

71
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:32,930
But the overall idea is that we what we did is that we took simply this if these reviews you know and

72
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:38,360
we convert all these reviews verified reviews into just a bunch of zeros and ones and a bunch of numbers

73
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,510
basically say let's go ahead and actually visualize a mistake in print.

74
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:48,750
And I wanted to print Alexa count down Victor riser and we're going to do.

75
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,790
Going to say Okay let's take it and convert it to array so I can actually view it shift enter.

76
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,500
And here we go.

77
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,780
So simply we have kind of a metric matrix and that matrix has a bunch of numbers indicating Okay like

78
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,640
how many times let's say the word let's say Love has been repeated how many times a word let's say happy

79
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,690
has been repeated.

80
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,880
If you guys are not you know like following still let's take a look at how many words are there.

81
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:18,790
So what we could do are going to say OK print and I'm going to say OK let's show me the vector either

82
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:24,300
and I will say it gets feature names shift enter.

83
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,500
And here we go.

84
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,570
This is simply every single word that have been repeated somehow within the reviews which is incredible.

85
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:39,810
So apparently there is like you know like apparently OK this is like word Apple there is appliance.

86
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:44,450
People are talking maybe about like audibles about like audio audiobook for example.

87
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,830
These are all the words and these words actually constitute of the columns.

88
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:53,970
So all the columns in there the 4000 ones are simply consisting of all these words in here which is

89
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,510
incredible OK.

90
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:03,270
So what you could do is let's say go here scroll down every single words you sign for a find for example

91
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,450
there is let's say the word love the word looks.

92
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,160
Well let's say loose you know longevity.

93
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,920
What is this they love without an E.

94
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,220
You know love.

95
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,900
He is loved.

96
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,080
You know a lover loves loving.

97
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,890
That's good that's every single word has been contained within the reviews.

98
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,950
Which is again incredible.

99
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,400
All right.

100
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:21,830
OK.

101
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,190
So the question is what I'm going to do with this.

102
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,130
You know what's the point.

103
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,760
So let's see how can we do this.

104
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,930
What we could do.

105
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:38,580
I mean I say OK let's grab our Alexa Cohen victimizer and let's actually do something pretty kind of

106
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,510
fun with it so I'm gonna do.

107
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,630
Who's going to take Alexa.

108
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,610
Count victimizers to array which is what I had here.

109
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,450
Copy it and it's basic.

110
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,330
Here OK.

111
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,590
And what I could do.

112
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,910
I'm going to say OK let's take this which is basically again the matrix that has a bunch of zeros and

113
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,920
one that's actually view it again just view it matrix a bunch of zeros not zeros and ones.

114
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,480
My apologies it is a numbers.

115
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:07,830
So let's say for example actually get a plot like one of these rows to give you an idea of what what

116
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,950
do I mean.

117
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,610
So I'm gonna say again I think this and simply put it in words on the score count underscore array.

118
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,550
I just called it this way.

119
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,780
You can call it whatever ketchup.

120
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,580
Enter.

121
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,820
Looks good.

122
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,030
And what it could do.

123
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:30,490
I'm gonna say OK maybe go into word underscore count on the score array and maybe grab for me.

124
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:36,850
Let's say the first review so I'm going to take a zero comma and all.

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,660
Which means I need to grab all zero that means the first row.

126
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,440
Right.

127
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,510
And all I need to get all columns.

128
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,390
OK let's actually view this.

129
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,510
You'll find that simply here we have a bunch of zeros and numbers to write.

130
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,490
OK.

131
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,600
So let's maybe visualize it.

132
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,400
Let's maybe view it.

133
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,490
So let's see how can we do that.

134
00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:03,580
We gonna say okay T dot plots and we could simply take this and plot it here.

135
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,520
So let's make shift enter.

136
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,450
And here we go.

137
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,320
It's amazing.

138
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,750
So you'll find that simply here there is all the words are zero or every single word which is four thousand

139
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,680
ones all of them are zero.

140
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,890
However there are three spikes in here of count one which means I have three words in here.

141
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,110
The question is what these words are.

142
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:23,680
All right.

143
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,900
So maybe we can go ahead and grab that review with that specific index when I say ADF on the score.

144
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:37,980
Alexa let's go ahead and to verify the reviews verify the views and let's maybe grab our zero which

145
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,200
is our first index right this ship enter.

146
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,100
And here we go.

147
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:48,180
So here basically love my echo has been translated into love my echo which is incredible.

148
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,660
Maybe grab let's say index number one which is my second view enter.

149
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:53,560
You'll find that there is.

150
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,470
Love it.

151
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,090
Which is has been translated into one word and one word.

152
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,200
OK.

153
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,850
Maybe grab it say three.

154
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,640
Loved it.

155
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,490
Oh my apologies.

156
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,560
This should be three 2.

157
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:05,840
Right.

158
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,650
So we're applying three and three so that's what we're getting.

159
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,940
So you guys can see here.

160
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,140
You will find that we have the word count.

161
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,910
Race is I love.

162
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,190
I have had a lot of fun with my thing my four year old learns the dinosaurs all this stuff I've been

163
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:25,170
translated into like all these like you know different peaks in that showing indicating because every

164
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:30,060
single location and he had every single number has a word meaning there is a meaning behind it.

165
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,260
Right.

166
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,840
Which is translated into one of these words in here.

167
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,390
All right.

168
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:41,740
Okay maybe one more time describe maybe five and maybe five.

169
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,050
Okay.

170
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,550
Again you'll have tons of words in here.

171
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,690
Maybe let's go up and take a look at our the F reviews and maybe grab it.

172
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,640
Easy one is simple want to make sure they actually understand this correctly.

173
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:59,250
Let's assume they're going to go here and maybe grab like I need to show you guys an easier one

174
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,110
so this one for example that's actually a very good example.

175
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,450
This is called Love love love right.

176
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,520
Which is single word but has been repeated three times.

177
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:10,980
Right.

178
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:11,790
OK.

179
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,360
So let's go ahead and actually do it.

180
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,300
So let's go ahead here which is 15.

181
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,450
Let's go ahead and get the word 13 and get here the word 13.

182
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,530
The actual review along with the convict tries.

183
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,320
And here we go.

184
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,110
Amazing.

185
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:29,880
So this is this is the index of the word love which is around let's say twenty two hundred or something.

186
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,430
And here you will find the count has been three which mean the word has been repeated three times which

187
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,380
is great too.

188
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:36,840
All right.

189
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,280
OK.

190
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,500
And that's all what it is when it comes to applying the count victories either.

191
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,890
Let's go ahead and actually do one more kind of analysis before we conclude our project.

192
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:54,080
So what could do against the ADF underscore Alexa and Hill could pass along our lines.

193
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,690
What we going to do we're going to create a new kind of features within our data frame that has a lens

194
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,140
into it.

195
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,160
You're gonna see ADF on.

196
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,030
Alexa.

197
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,450
And what I could do I could say okay verified the views

198
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:14,820
and I could say Doc apply and I can pass along the length simply.

199
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,260
All right.

200
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:21,250
So simply we're going to do going to say OK let's go ahead count how many words in here within our verify

201
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:26,860
their views and added in a new data frame new element in the frames called defense.

202
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:32,380
Let's take a look maybe at the f on the score Alexa that heads enter.

203
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,110
And here we go.

204
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,730
So now we have the ratings.

205
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,800
Now we have the dates.

206
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,470
Now we have the variations.

207
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:43,070
Now we have the verify the view's feedback and lends to indicating actually how many characters were

208
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,860
there not words my apologies.

209
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:50,970
So loved it for example here there is l o v e d space I.T. exclamation mark 9.

210
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,730
Here we have one hundred and nine feet 1 5 1 7 2.

211
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,310
Why are we doing this.

212
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:00,200
We're actually doing this because that might add some important information for us.

213
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:07,550
Maybe for example you know like people who write more more length or more words maybe they are a little

214
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,820
bit more bitter.

215
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,640
Maybe they have they are not that happy.

216
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,500
So something along these lines.

217
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,030
So we can extract more information regarding the length of the reviews.

218
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,290
OK.

219
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,800
Obviously if someone is not happy you're are not going to say you know for example I have one word for

220
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,710
instance maybe.

221
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,300
For example.

222
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:27,070
OK so most of the time people actually don't like the product.

223
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,300
We're just going to say you know what.

224
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,090
Like I hated or something I'm going to say like write an essay or something.

225
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,350
Right.

226
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,660
People actually do write reviews that much unless they actually hate the product.

227
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,970
So we could do we're going to say okay maybe go ahead and show me a histogram of the lines in a sec

228
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:50,380
ADF on the screen Alexa and let's go ahead and show me the lengths GTA H dot histogram and maybe I can

229
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:55,420
pass along our bins equal to let's say a hundred ships enter it we go.

230
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:59,850
So now I have my histogram and he gets can see here you find that there is an actual.

231
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,940
Somebody who actually wrote 800 characters which is crazy.

232
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,430
Someone actually wrote just my apologies.

233
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,410
Someone actually wrote wrote here zero characters.

234
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:09,650
OK.

235
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,730
So or maybe one very small number of characters maybe like a smiley face or something.

236
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,140
And he is somebody actually wrote almost like fourteen hundred maybe fifteen hundred characters which

237
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,870
is insane.

238
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:27,580
So let's see who who did this who maybe let's go ahead and obtain that's a minimum.

239
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,960
Characters equals to the F underscore.

240
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,860
Alexa let's go to our verified reviews and what we could do.

241
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,180
Going to say that men let's attain the minimum value.

242
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,890
So that's the minimum.

243
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:44,340
And let's take a look at the at the actual Let's go ahead.

244
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,050
If Alexa.

245
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:55,660
And let's go into the f on the squad Alex again and I need to go within the lance data frame right and

246
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:02,800
compare it if it's equal to the men car so here this is the minimum number of characters.

247
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,660
So I wanted to say okay.

248
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,990
Go ahead to our data frame to the lens bring to me please what is.

249
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,700
Which one has the many main characters in there.

250
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,160
Which has the minimum number of words right.

251
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,500
And what I could do as well.

252
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,890
I'm going to say okay what I need to extract out of it.

253
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:28,020
I need to extract my verified reviews the score reviews and I need to obtain if you guys recall from

254
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,770
previously I lock 0 to just obtain for me what's in it.

255
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,900
So please shift enter.

256
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,870
It's actually telling me there is an error in here.

257
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,900
It's to make sure.

258
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,650
So what we're saying.

259
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:48,820
ADF Alexa DFL excel at and Lentz is equal to the men car which is this variable here.

260
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,150
OK.

261
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:54,880
So actually I My apologies here what I wanted to do I wanted to attain the minimum out of the lens.

262
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,610
Right.

263
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,150
We're not we don't want to get the verified the views we actually want to go to the lens column to go

264
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,050
up.

265
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,420
These are the lens column right.

266
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,450
What I wanted to obtain and I just I wanted to obtain the lens of thin the minimum value.

267
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,530
What's the main and what's the max.

268
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,730
So actually it's go here seeing this GBH.

269
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,830
And here we go.

270
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,720
So simply someone actually just wrote like a smiley face with a heart in it.

271
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:16,920
OK.

272
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,180
That's like one the minimum review that has been made.

273
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,760
Maybe let's go ahead and obtain the max.

274
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,900
We're going to take control V.

275
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,220
We're going to see this.

276
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,060
Call it Max car.

277
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,960
And we're going to call it Max.

278
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:35,570
And here we're going to say when was the max car occurred shift enter.

279
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,950
And here we go.

280
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:37,740
Wow.

281
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,890
So you find that there is incredible piece of technology.

282
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,510
I love this right center of my living room.

283
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,070
Actual surprise because this is a good review.

284
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:49,250
So actually someone actually the perfect or good review with which is great.

285
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,040
You know that means he actually wrote the view and he's happy with it.

286
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,950
You know like he did send for me and my floor lamp just perfect.

287
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:59,650
Highly recommended by buy in Ecuador from my bedroom now which is just just incredible.

288
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,430
All right.

289
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:00,860
OK.

290
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,090
And that's pretty much all what I have for this lecture.

291
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,440
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

292
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,510
I hope you guys enjoy the entire project again one last challenge.

293
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:15,200
What you guys wanted to do is to maybe go here and try to obtain the reviews.

294
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,080
That has a number of characters equal one hundred.

295
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:25,310
So what I wanted to do when the number number of characters was equal to one hundred and maybe number

296
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,810
of characters equals to 150.

297
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,040
And I wanted to obtain these reviews I want to see like them if they are not.

298
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:38,730
Maybe pick any number close to it maybe 1 to 1 or maybe hear like let's say 151 or 152 or something.

299
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,370
Please go ahead pause a video and I'll see you guys after the challenge.

300
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,030
All right.

301
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,930
I hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge.

302
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:58,710
I ask you has to do is to simply go ahead and obtain simply this and try to obtain or give me how many.

303
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:03,450
What is the review that has let's say a hundred characters in it or maybe has 150 characters number

304
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,270
of characters.

305
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,900
So simply put instead of getting the maximum what I could do I'm going to say OK maybe set this to 100

306
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,110
and that's it.

307
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,750
Shift enter.

308
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,200
And here we go.

309
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,910
Great for my office.

310
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,770
I use this daily in many ways to include spelling for me and background music looks good.

311
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,640
Maybe grab one one to shift enter.

312
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,000
Got this.

313
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,530
Amazon Prime within pro works great being lazy OK.

314
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,010
That's pretty much all what it is.

315
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:27,380
All right.

316
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,950
I hope you guys enjoy this project.

317
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,730
I hope you find it helpful and useful.

318
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,750
Let's recap what we have done so far.

319
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:38,400
So if you go up here you will find that we just went through and we did a lot of analysis actually to

320
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,720
our Amazon review dataset.

321
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,350
So we're able to load the data so we know how to deal with data frames now able to visualize some information

322
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:53,040
within the data we're able to obtain some kind of somebody using info and using describe method to just

323
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:58,530
give us kind of a summary of the data we're able as well to visualize the data using you know seaboard

324
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:05,190
libraries that scroll down we're able to kind of group the reviews into positive and negative reviews

325
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:12,720
and we're able as well to actually a lot of information we're able to use count plot seaborne count

326
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,760
plot to plot how many reviews are positive how many reviews were negative we're able to as well do some

327
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,740
count plot to review the ratings how many reviews were five star rating or not we did some histogram

328
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:28,530
analysis we did as well some analysis here to show the different variations along with the ratings and

329
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:33,270
we're able to do some work cloud as well which is really powerful we're able to actually convert the

330
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:38,760
entire kind of reviews column into just one string and simply apply the word cloud to it.

331
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,120
We got something like this was really amazing.

332
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,840
And then afterwards we're able to do some data cleaning and feature engineering by just counting how

333
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,300
many words have been repeated in if in each single single review and attain that specific metrics along

334
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:57,390
with a matrix of words then we're able to let's say if you the actual review and if you how many words

335
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:03,170
have been repeated in each one of them and we're able as well to obtain the lengths of how many characters

336
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:09,180
were contained within the reviews and add that column in here in our data frame and to do some histogram

337
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:15,300
analysis entertain the least review which is just one character and the maximum as well which is the

338
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:21,090
entire paragraph here and we're able to go as well through a mini challenge to walk you through the

339
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:25,950
if you wanted to get you know specific length of or how many characters do we have.

340
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:31,230
All right that's all we have for this project I hope you guys enjoyed it and I'll see you guys in future

341
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:31,890
projects.
