00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,120
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture and this lecture.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,190
We're going to talk about simple linear regression.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,060
All right.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:16,930
And we're going to learn how can we use simple linear regression to predict revenue based on specific

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,280
parameters.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:18,940
Right.

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,330
So let's get started.

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:26,830
First in simple linear aggression the objective is that we wanted to predict the value of one variable

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,220
y based on another variable X..

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,850
All right what do I mean by that.

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,410
Let's take a look at a quick example so we can understand what you mean by this.

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:41,750
Let's assume that we have for example that can very simple ice cream cart for example business.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,430
And let's assume that here we collect the temperature measurements of the outside temperature and and

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,430
we have an avenue that we can collect the total daily revenue with that we get out of this basically

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,840
ice cream cart.

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,670
Again this is a very simple example.

17
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:03,910
The objective is is to first start with a simple example then go in and move more on to more complex

18
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,050
scenarios moving forward.

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,870
So basically we collect data.

20
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,520
So let's say at temperatures twenty four point five.

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:19,020
The revenue was 400 and 500 and thirty four dollars per day at 26 degrees Celsius.

22
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,480
The vineyard was six hundred and twenty five dollars.

23
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,280
Twenty seven six hundred and sixty.

24
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,900
And it's assumed that you know as a business you as a business owner you wanted to get the relationship

25
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,500
you wanted to develop kind of a model.

26
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,610
Okay a very simple model.

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,770
Between the temperature and our revenue.

28
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:37,740
Okay.

29
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,370
All right.

30
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:44,440
So the question is here which one of these is the independent variable and which one is the dependent

31
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,170
variable.

32
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:45,760
Right.

33
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:46,220
OK.

34
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:51,450
It's pretty pretty obvious so the independent variable is basically our temperature.

35
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,540
So here this is the this is the the value or the premier that if we change it then the revenue will

36
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,010
be impacted by it.

37
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,410
Okay so that's a long story.

38
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:08,770
Is very simple for the temperature let's say is very cold let's say zero degrees C Well expecting that

39
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,140
everything to be very small.

40
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,080
However once the temperature rises then we are expecting the revenue to be much higher.

41
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,500
Okay that's pretty much in an in a nutshell.

42
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,490
So the relationship between the temperatures and the revenue is a linear relationship.

43
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,180
Okay.

44
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,180
And that's why in this case we're going to use the simple linear regression.

45
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,050
Right.

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,040
OK so again insipidly year regression would predict the value of one of these are the x x is called

47
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,700
the independent variable.

48
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,130
Right.

49
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,900
And why it's called dependent variable.

50
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,990
So the two important questions here are why it's called Simple and why it's called linear so linear

51
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,220
it's pretty obvious because the relationship between them changes in a linear fashion.

52
00:02:52,540 --> 00:03:00,070
Simply put if for example let's say the independent variable increase or decrease the dependent variable

53
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,780
will increase and decrease as well in a linear fashion.

54
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,920
The next question is why it's called simple.

55
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,080
It's called Simple because we only have kind of two variables.

56
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:14,550
We have a relationship between two variables only that are temperatures and revenue moving forward and

57
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,130
then we can have more of the input that can predict for example that everything.

58
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,830
So for example if we add another column here that says for example let's say the location so we have

59
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:30,070
the location of the car of the ice cream for example car and we have temperature then we can predict

60
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:35,250
the future based on it then that would be kind of more of a multiple of linear regression.

61
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,260
Not a simple linear regression.

62
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,060
Okay let's take a look at the exact same example in graphical format right.

63
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,200
Let's assume that we wanted to plot here these points where one of the plot the temperatures in degrees

64
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,880
Celsius and wanted to applaud the revenue.

65
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,440
Here in the US which is a daily revenue.

66
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,510
All right.

67
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,320
So going to do here is a plot of these points so these are the points that basically indicates temperature.

68
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:07,030
An indicator of revenue and what we do here is that we wanted to simply connect here straightline that

69
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,580
pretty much passes through all of these points.

70
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,050
All right.

71
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,310
And that's Peter one of the objectives of simple linear aggression that we wanted to put in a model

72
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:21,940
relationship is straightline for example that governed the relationship between those temperatures and

73
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,500
our revenue.

74
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,330
OK.

75
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,550
That's pretty much the impression for simply an introduction.

76
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,210
So let's take a look at the exact same example.

77
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,730
But let's dig a little bit deeper into the mathematics of it.

78
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,520
So here again we have our temperatures here we have our revenue.

79
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,230
He reported the points.

80
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,080
It seems like temperature increases the revenue increase which makes sense as the weather gets hotter

81
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:50,150
What expecting you know more money to get out of that business if we draw that straight line.

82
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:56,320
And if you guys remember from previous basic mathematics class that any straight line can be presented

83
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,620
by this relationship.

84
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,370
Why.

85
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,980
Which is the opposite.

86
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:08,910
Equal is to be no less be one times x y equals to explore see if you as a member are right.

87
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,630
So what do you mean by this.

88
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,760
Simply put.

89
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,980
X again is our independent variable which is our temperature.

90
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:21,440
In degrees C and why is our independent variable which is our revenue in dollars.

91
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,190
And when we say that we wanted to develop kind of a kind of a machine learning model that means we are

92
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,610
looking for values of b.a. and be one that's it.

93
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,110
Once you obtain the values for the Beano then be one that is.

94
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,280
Congratulations That means you're able to obtain your model.

95
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,630
And that's our goal here in this exercise.

96
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,330
OK.

97
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,210
So let's take a look again at the mathematics behind it or what do you mean by it in a very simple form

98
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:56,220
and once we'll pin that model here that means every 10 degrees for example increase in temperature that

99
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,960
corresponds to 20 dollars increasing your denia everything for it for example.

100
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,820
This is just again are like some random numbers.

101
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:08,970
But moving forward once we go to this you know book and implemented this simple it aggression we can

102
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,110
actually open these values and then be able to predict okay what's the equivalent value.

103
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:21,570
But here just for sake of illustration once we open that model then we can know how much for example

104
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,440
can increase let's say the temperature.

105
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,120
All right.

106
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:29,730
They can reflect fatigues for instance 20 dollar increase in revenue for example.

107
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:34,010
So 10 degrees C is equivalent to 20 dollars increase in revenue.

108
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:34,770
All right.

109
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,740
Let's take a look at Piedmont executive example.

110
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:44,400
But you know like a kind of different parameters for naming conventions if you're getting a number if

111
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,290
we if we have these points here we are going to have our temperature here we have our dollar value our

112
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,100
revenue.

113
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,880
Here we have our independent variable x here we have our dependent very good why we can actually mother

114
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:02,220
the exact same equation exact same you know a relationship of that line using Y equals to explicit be

115
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:09,500
right where m indicates the slope of the line which is simply how basically that line is kind of you

116
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:15,000
know like sloping which indicates Delta y divided by daltex.

117
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,390
Right.

118
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,720
Which is simply.

119
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,710
Let's actually go here.

120
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,400
So when you say M that means Delta change and why then to y divided by the index.

121
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,420
That would give me the slope of the line.

122
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:34,050
And B parameters which has B value here that indicates the y intercept which is how did we how that

123
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,590
straight line simply intercept the y axis here.

124
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:42,580
If it passes through the origin then B will be 0 simply and then the equation becomes y equals to M

125
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,980
x or y.

126
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:51,530
OK so again just to to give again an overview of what we have done so far.

127
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,960
We wanted to predict or game the relationship between two variables.

128
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:01,710
That's why it's called Simple and we assume that relationship between the two variables is linear and

129
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,930
that's why it's called Simple limit regression.

130
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,400
And the objective is to obtain simply these two parameters.

131
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,670
We own it or play in the value of M which is the slope of the line and I wanted to talk in the value

132
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,660
of b which is the intercept of the line.

133
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:18,840
Once we do that then we can talk a how like that line you know tilted that way tilted that way.

134
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,280
Going for example you know like that with a negative slope for instance and so on.

135
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,960
Once we have that model then we have a very powerful thing.

136
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,260
Why.

137
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,660
Because now once we have them order then we can predict for example Okay what's the expected revenue

138
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,120
at certain temperature.

139
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:42,210
Even if that value was in pain before in the training dataset for example let's say viz. let's say 60

140
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,350
degrees C what's going to happen then we can predict.

141
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,160
Maybe when the temperature is six degrees C that evidence might be let's say eleven hundred dollars

142
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:50,830
and so on.

143
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,870
All right.

144
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,930
And that's pretty much all what I have with this lecture.

145
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,300
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

146
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,870
And in the next lecture we're going to dig a little bit deeper into how can we actually or pain that

147
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,490
straightline using really important fame famous method called Lee Square.

148
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,460
I hope to get into their lecture and see you in the next lecture.
