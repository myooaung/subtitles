00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,610
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture and this lecture.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,910
When I walk you through the questions that we have for strings.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,720
Okay.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,380
And please guys go ahead and try to.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,890
You know I tend to solve the questions again if you get stuck.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,060
No problem.

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:21,420
Just you know going to have like a detailed video lectures that show pretty much how can we create the

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,640
entire solutions for these exercise of questions moving forward.

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,810
OK.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,610
So the first question I'm asking you what went wrong.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,150
Okay so here are a couple of code.

12
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,410
Couple of lines I am asking you what went wrong.

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,950
Fix the issue and indicate what does this code do.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,550
OK.

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,710
So simply here you would find that you know like meme has upper case your name has a lower case.

16
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,070
So try to figure out you know what's basically what's that what's wrong.

17
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:54,090
What went wrong and try to fix it and run the court case the next step here is that I wanted to perform

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,350
simple subtraction.

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,440
So I wanted to just subject X minus Y and something goes wrong.

20
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,000
I find X you know and then define Y and I talk to subtract the two.

21
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,020
And something went wrong.

22
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,110
Try to fix it as well.

23
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,010
Try to let me know.

24
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,540
What should I do to actually perform the subtraction.

25
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,880
I want to see your value of 16.

26
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,440
I want to see 20 minus four.

27
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,550
How can white lines really add year.

28
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,670
What should I convert.

29
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,370
For example from one form or another to actually perform this operation.

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,700
All right.

31
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,580
And then Question 3 I'm asking you to write a call that takes an input from a user splits it into words

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,890
and print them on the screen.

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,580
So take whatever How is your day going.

34
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,510
For example the user get into whatever and then you get n30.

35
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,860
Here are the list of words you entered the and then you get a list or the Whereas the user have to get

36
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,500
a question for.

37
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,930
I'm asking you to write a code.

38
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,250
It takes an input from the user converting an upper case and print them on the screen.

39
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,680
OK.

40
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,300
Again I'm going to use the upper method that we've covered before in class and then I'm going to see

41
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,140
how can we do that.

42
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,310
Again you know by kind of interacting with the user by feeding data to the image as an input and prudent

43
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,150
that data on the screen.

44
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,710
Question 5 I'm asking.

45
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:12,670
I called the prompts a user requesting his or her email and then extract the user name simply so we

46
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,050
have first lady named Locke last name and Gina come.

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,920
I'm asking you to simply prompt the users to input their email into the e-mail they were going to extract

48
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,450
the user name from it again using the split method.

49
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,830
It's kind of you know like we use it through email address the user get into that and we're going to

50
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,450
be getting is the same need to extend this.

51
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,360
That's it OK.

52
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:43,380
And then I'm asking you questions 6 to expand on the previous code to print hello and then print first

53
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,540
name space last names I want to get rid of.

54
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,350
And they wanted to print you know hello first name and then last name afterwards.

55
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,160
Okay.

56
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,100
Kind of like this.

57
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,510
You can enter the email around up at for example at.

58
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,710
But that's not my email.

59
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,080
That's not my email though.

60
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,830
It just alright whatever names and they were going to say hello and then and a specify a rhyme and then

61
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,380
afterwards are in question 7.

62
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,190
I'm asking you to write a code that requests the first name last name and age and print them on the

63
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,670
screen.

64
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,450
OK.

65
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:18,060
And when you print them I want you as well to kind of you know print in addition f why I like Chalo

66
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,260
you're name is whatever you are whatever a years old and an ad for example.

67
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,360
Age is just a number you are younger than ever.

68
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,130
Again this is a very simple example.

69
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:31,800
The object of this example is actually tied to the question number eight which is I want you to do the

70
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,190
exact same stuff exact same you know Ryan and you know age 23 whatever.

71
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,800
And then I want you to print the f why I.

72
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,090
Age is just a number in a new line.

73
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,820
OK.

74
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,090
Which is stuff that we didn't covered before during the actual lecture.

75
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,850
How can you want to retouch what we call a or backslash and I want to thicker.

76
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,890
Likely soulish.

77
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,940
Take a look at what that mean and even go to this link and read.

78
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,230
I'm going to open it because if I open it that means I can explain it for you.

79
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,930
The idea is I wanted to go ahead to somebody to understand what being in my flesh and actually implemented

80
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,440
here because they were going to be very helpful for you to actually develop.

81
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:16,340
All I can do all these search and look for whatever data afterwards that's not presented here in class.

82
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,450
OK again I'm going to describe what they mean by flesh and the whole idea is they wanted to just do

83
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,930
these exim stuff as we have done before but print.

84
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,720
Why are you know.

85
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,570
Age is just a number in a new line using the backslash end here.

86
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,280
OK that we have done before.

87
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,380
My question I am asking you to write a code that takes the use of email and counts the number of user

88
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,010
name characters.

89
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,870
Again we did uncover how to do that.

90
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:46,120
But again I want you to research the length okay which is kind of a function that you can apply.

91
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,800
That would give you basically the number of characters within the string k..

92
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:58,350
And then at number 10 I want to write a code that extracts the word hello from hello world in two different

93
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,400
ways.

94
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,910
So I wanted to you do what we call listing slicing which is kind of exacting you know the hello from

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,020
Hello world.

96
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,920
Again you can do your research here.

97
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,210
You can go to that link and just learn more about what they mean by this.

98
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,370
Simply put any two ways of sticking in the words.

99
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,750
Hello from Austin.

100
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,210
It's called Hello World.

101
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:18,980
OK.

102
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,260
That's pretty much all I want to have.

103
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,400
I hope you guys will be able to figure it out.

104
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,660
Well a couple of at least couple of the questions.

105
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,710
I hope you guys enjoyed it and see you in the solution.
