00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,310
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:10,050
All right and this lecture we're going to continue through the files questions.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:15,270
Okay so question number seven I'm asking you to write a code that takes several inputs from the user

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,280
as long as the user does not enter stop the data then saved on output file.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,240
OK so it seems like we need a while loop.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,190
Right.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,210
So what we could do.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:32,520
I'm going to say OK we are going to save the file of the data into a file open and let's call it for

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:40,770
example output underscore user underscored data the text.

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,520
Right.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,910
And we're going to open that.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,430
As for appending purposes is going gonna append file elements to it when I say a while true.

13
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:50,720
OK.

14
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,490
So every time I'm going to take an input from the user right.

15
00:00:53,490 --> 00:01:02,310
So I need simply to take a sentence from the user sentence equals to input and I'm going to say okay

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,350
enter something right.

17
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,720
I'm going to ask you is it please enter something I'm going to say okay if you found this sentence

18
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,860
equals to stop uppercase because he indicated all of them on uppercase right.

19
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:27,670
If you find that the sentence was what's top well close the file file the close and let's get out of

20
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,010
here.

21
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,370
Let's break.

22
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,190
So a pretty good loop.

23
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,410
OK.

24
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,220
Else other than that.

25
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,270
Just write it to the file right.

26
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,020
That means doesn't it not stop them.

27
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,230
There's something in their file.

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,570
Right.

29
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:49,670
And we're going to pass along our sentence and we're going to add a backslash end for a new line all

30
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,880
right.

31
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,640
Let's go ahead and maybe change the name.

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,480
Call it let's say trial for example.

33
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,870
You can easily track a trial to for instance because I have the same pretty much the same name in my

34
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:05,200
folder on the circuit it's run that and let's again run the simulation again again.

35
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:05,620
Okay.

36
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,640
Happy happy learning python.

37
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:17,580
Python is amazing okay.

38
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,940
And let's press top and looks good.

39
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,430
Let's take a look at it.

40
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,820
Let's see what we have here.

41
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,230
So we have child to right.

42
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,790
So we have out names.

43
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,220
I'm sorry output user data.

44
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:38,650
CHILD 2 let's open that one and if we take a look at it you will find that that's exactly what we've

45
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:38,980
got.

46
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,190
Right.

47
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,650
Happy learning python and python is amazing.

48
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,600
Looks great already.

49
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,570
Question number eight I'm asking you to write a code that basically search for all the text files on

50
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,110
your computer and print print all the files and their path.

51
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,790
You guys we're gonna find that there is very like you know like famous kind of you know

52
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,130
function that we could use which is we'll call it os walk or dot walk.

53
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,540
It simply can be used to look up you know search for whatever you want.

54
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:15,420
It's really powerful because you know you can use it to look for files look for images look for whatever.

55
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:15,850
OK.

56
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,740
And it's really powerful.

57
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,340
Let's see how can we do that.

58
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,270
Well we could do here.

59
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,870
We're gonna say OK we're going to import what we call it F and match.

60
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,560
OK we're gonna see how we're gonna be using it.

61
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,280
I'm going to say OK.

62
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:39,480
Import os angle first we're going to get the pass rates are say OK path equals to OS dot get current

63
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,890
working directory.

64
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,600
You're just getting my pass right.

65
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:49,260
And afterwards I'm going to say okay let's search let's for let's look for within the root.

66
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,970
Let's look for directories and let's get the files in OS Dot.

67
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,440
Walk and we're gonna walk the path basically here.

68
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,340
I'm just gonna get in my path and.

69
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,050
Apply OS walk for the path get all the routes directories and files.

70
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,400
Right.

71
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:22,300
And here are going to see a four fine name in F and match f n match K Dot filter.

72
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:22,620
All right.

73
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,850
What we could do is say a Please compare the files that I'm getting okay and compare it to.

74
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,120
I'm looking for text files right.

75
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,890
I'm comparing this to start the text or text.

76
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,660
Okay.

77
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,530
And I'm going to do here to see if you find it.

78
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,480
If you find a text file this please give me the parts.

79
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:42,860
That's of.

80
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,760
Okay Os dot path the join I'm going to join again.

81
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,340
Our route.

82
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,410
I'm going to act basically attach the route along with the fine name I wanted to print on the screen.

83
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,040
Basically the route of the file along with the finding so something with this going to show up.

84
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,210
Let's run that.

85
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,100
And that's what we're getting.

86
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,800
So simply here you find there is tons of text files right.

87
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,750
So simply these are all the text files we've been generating right.

88
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,850
So we generated you know output files and to amplify data use the data.

89
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,690
These are all the data we have been getting.

90
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,280
All right.

91
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,800
Perfect.

92
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,030
One last example.

93
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,850
Let's do the exact same thing but we're going to do here.

94
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:25,290
I wanted to you guys to search for

95
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,250
images instead of text files.

96
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,250
So I wanted to do the exact same thing but I wanted to search for p g j peg and G.

97
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,660
Let's do it.

98
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,250
Let's take a look.

99
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,320
Okay.

100
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,890
Import F and match.

101
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,010
Just for comparison.

102
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,880
Right.

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:51,100
We're going to import os and I'm going to say okay let's return all the found images.

104
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,410
I'm going to put it for example an empty here string and T list sorry.

105
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,370
Okay let's define the path.

106
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:58,840
All right.

107
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,800
You can get in defining a path you can say OK for example here we can do the same thing.

108
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,250
Path equals to get current working directory.

109
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,820
What we could do here are going to say OK I need I need to look for specific extensions lights I'm going

110
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,110
to define image underscore extensions

111
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,320
extensions.

112
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,230
Looks good.

113
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,840
Equals too.

114
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,740
And I'm looking for specific extensions.

115
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,120
That's looking for its asterisk dot JP.

116
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,550
Gee I'm looking for

117
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,280
asterisk dot JP e.g..

118
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:38,620
Right.

119
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:44,650
I'm looking for Estrich that P N G right.

120
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:45,340
Okay.

121
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,630
Looks good and let's go ahead do the exact same for loop that we have done before.

122
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,350
So it's okay for roots.

123
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:59,200
I need directories I need files in OS walk.

124
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,670
Of path.

125
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,900
Right.

126
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:12,190
And I wanted to for I in image underscore extensions because I'm gonna simply loop on the extensions

127
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:12,520
right.

128
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:19,090
So gonna say okay extensions right because I'll have to check for all extensions right.

129
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,620
So I'm gonna say okay.

130
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:36,680
It's okay for if you find fine name in F and match f n match dot filter on going to compare our files

131
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,600
with ie.

132
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,120
So basically to compare the files with the extension.

133
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,050
Right.

134
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:55,100
We're going to say Okay print to us O S dot walk dot join we're going to join simply our route along

135
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,450
with our file name.

136
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,520
All right let's run that's something is not right.

137
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,520
So he does a function object has no object join.

138
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,110
So here's we did filter we did.

139
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,010
Or s I'm sorry not.

140
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:22,190
I walk it with DOT pass join that's on that and that's what we're getting we actually got image 1 image

141
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,940
2 and all of them are JP jira.

142
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,580
These are all the image within our folder here.

143
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,490
If you guys obviously change here the path to whatever for example your you know your your drive for

144
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,680
example or D Drive or C drive you can get literally all the images within your computer which is amazing

145
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:42,560
really powerful you can do that here and then what you could what you could get you know here you can

146
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:50,540
simply export it for example to like an Excel file or something like that to have it really handy for

147
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,630
you.

148
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,660
All right that's it.

149
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,940
And that's pretty much all what I have for this lecture.

150
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,230
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

151
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:02,500
Now you became experts were comes to file operations and see you guys in the next lecture.
