00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.440
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.640
This lecture we're going to cover what we call of the order of operations which is very important kind

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.440
of concept when we're doing any mathematical operation.

4
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.140
OK.

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.600
The order of operation has kind of a different name in what we call it presidents.

6
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.160
OK.

7
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.690
Which simply describe which operation should be performed first.

8
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.700
Right which is you know which one has kind of a higher priority compared to other operations.

9
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.200
All right let's take a look.

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.500
So here we have kind of a table that shows the order of operations from the highest or the most important

11
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.760
down to the least important which means that first step or first thing they're going to be executed

12
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.430
if you perform any mathematical operation is simply if we do use these prentice's that's the first you

13
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.770
know high is the highest priority item that we're going to be perform followed by that we're going to

14
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.240
be doing exponents.

15
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.720
All right.

16
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.710
And then followed by the multiplication and division.

17
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.350
Right.

18
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.460
And then the least kind of priority one is Will Call of the addition and subtraction.

19
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.970
These are the least one.

20
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.680
All right.

21
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.290
Okay.

22
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.880
Maybe it looks a little bit weird The little it's kind of the concept looks a little bit different here.

23
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.460
But all we could do that we were free once we go through a couple of mathematical know kind of examples

24
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.850
everything will get to be very clear for us.

25
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.550
All right.

26
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:20.340
Okay.

27
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.400
So let's get started.

28
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:30.530
So let's assume that I want to for example some two numbers together and then the result of that summation

29
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.410
are going to multiply by a new number.

30
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.830
All right.

31
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.710
Let's take a look.

32
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.440
So let's assume that I wanted to for example add one plus two.

33
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.030
OK.

34
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.570
So going to perform one plus two and then multiply whatever the result by three.

35
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.310
Okay.

36
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.570
So if I add on this that will give me nine which means that because here I put these these prentice's

37
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.410
which means I'm asking what I'm requesting.

38
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.620
Kind of you know Python.

39
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.310
Okay.

40
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.880
To do this operation first.

41
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.220
Why.

42
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.750
Because the prentice's has the highest presidents.

43
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.470
Okay.

44
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.290
So here's what happen is one plus two we've been in the become three and then the result of this.

45
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.080
We're going to be multiplied by three.

46
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.140
And that's why we got here the result of money.

47
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.960
All right.

48
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.350
Let's assume that for example you know what I don't know kind of the order of operation and he said

49
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:22.270
okay I'm going to do a one plus two time three and I'm not going to do the prentice's OK if I wait on

50
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.440
this you'll find that you come up with a completely different answer.

51
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.220
Going to come up with number seven.

52
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.430
Okay.

53
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.910
Are they helping us capture or you know like at least knew what happened to what happened here is because

54
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.580
they didn't do or didn't put these prentice's who happen is that the multiplication has been performed

55
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.090
first.

56
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.400
Why.

57
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.030
Because multiplication has hired presidence compared to the addition and subtraction superfood multiplication

58
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.570
first.

59
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.500
So three things to happen first and then whatever the results were going to be added to one.

60
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.700
And that's why you come up with the number seven here.

61
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.440
OK.

62
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.390
Which means that if you're if you're going to perform any mathematical operation you need to make sure

63
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.080
that the order of operation just you know can generate completely two completely different results to

64
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.880
each other.

65
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.330
If you wanted to perform any mathematical operations first just to do the apprentice's and then you're

66
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.080
going to be safe.

67
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.560
That means this we're going to be operated first for sure.

68
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.850
They can look a couple of other examples so let's assume that they wanted to take let's say 60.

69
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:23.180
Right.

70
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.430
Divided by four.

71
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.430
OK.

72
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.590
And then again do some nation and then do 25 divided by five.

73
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.520
So simply put here.

74
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:34.790
What do you guys expect.

75
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.960
So first step in that going to do multiplication first and division first were 16 the better for that

76
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.810
will be for 25.

77
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.820
Divided by five that means five and then four plus five the addition going to be performed after.

78
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.670
So if we're on it then we're gonna come up with a number nine.

79
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.190
OK.

80
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.690
Why.

81
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.540
Because again 16 divided by 40 plus.

82
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.390
So the division happened first division happened first and then the results of two.

83
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.230
We're going to be basically added together.

84
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.620
And that's one car with number nine on it.

85
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.730
Let's say you're going to copy this and copy paste cotopaxi Control V.

86
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.780
And what I'm going to do here is I'm going to add let's say percentages here.

87
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.590
Right.

88
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.290
Between these two.

89
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.030
Again I didn't change anything I just put prentice's.

90
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.940
What do you guys expect.

91
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.490
They expect to going to get number nine again.

92
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.360
Obviously not so for it.

93
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.220
Come up with point one one one which is two completely different number.

94
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.040
Why.

95
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.670
Because what happened here is that because they put these prentices and since prentice's has a higher

96
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.820
kind of Presidents compared to the division.

97
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.850
So what happens is I'm going to do the prentice's first so he can come up with number 29 so I'm going

98
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.690
to divide 16 divided by 29.

99
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.110
And then the results were going to be divided by five after.

100
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.330
And then you come up with that number.

101
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.700
Point one one one out.

102
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.900
Okay.

103
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.910
And that's pretty much kind of a quick overview of what they mean by order of operation or presidents.

104
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.540
And that's pretty much all ahead for this election.

105
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.050
I hope you guys enjoyed it and see you in the next letter.
