00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:04,830
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture and this lecture.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:11,400
We're going to learn how to take beta from the users using the input function.

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,400
So let's take a look.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,980
Let's assume that he wanted to for example prompt the users to enter their name.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,490
Okay.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,320
And then afterwards I'm going to print to the users say hello and then followed by the name that they

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,590
use had just entered.

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,300
Let's take a look again.

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,160
User get how to get user input along with the print function.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,370
They are extremely important because the enables you to actually enter act with a user which as you

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,640
know makes your code way more handy and way more actually practical.

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,850
It's the kulluk.

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,330
So what it could do here going to say okay let's assume name equals two.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,560
And what I could do.

15
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,150
I'm going to use the input.

16
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,030
Okay.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,900
And open prentice's.

18
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:58,500
And here it double quotes and say OK what's let's say What's your name for example.

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,030
Right.

20
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:05,020
So what is going to happen here which is very powerful that you're asking the user input basically value

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,980
first going to prompt data to the user.

22
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,780
This kind of a command is kind of a mix.

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:16,140
You're printing something on the screen at the same time or expecting beta to be fed and whatever they

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,740
do at any fed from the user.

25
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,650
We're going to be put into the variable me which is very interesting.

26
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,940
Let's take a look.

27
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,290
So I actually will on this.

28
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:29,810
You will see that you know here's the cell becomes have an asterisk so stick means that kind of them

29
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:37,860
which is very important that the code is stuck which means it's swathing for the use of inputs something.

30
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,940
So what we have here is that what's your name which is what you guys draw applauded here.

31
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,990
And then here the kind of the python is just waiting for you guys to enter a value here.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,340
So going to say for example whatever they're going to see right for example you know has any case.

33
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,800
And you have to press enter and when you once you press enter you will see that basically here it doesn't

34
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,780
become asterisk anymore which means the cell has been executed successfully.

35
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,680
And now if I could look at a name on it you would see that there is value of Ryan which had the you

36
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,640
know look they're very they're actually entered as as an input which is really powerful.

37
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's assume that he wanted to kind of have a more interesting example.

38
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,120
Let's assume they're going to.

39
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,180
The users to enter their name and then followed by their age afterwards and then enter the address to

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,030
okay and they're going to print to them.

41
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,340
Okay.

42
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,420
My name is you know your name is whatever you are or whatever is old and you're live at that specific

43
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:31,990
address.

44
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,540
OK let's take a look.

45
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,770
So what I could do he is going to say okay meme define any baby name equates to I'm going to because

46
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,340
I'm asking the user to input the value of getting the input.

47
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,790
Again function here.

48
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:51,180
Open prentice's again double quotes and say okay enter your name.

49
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,130
Right looks good to me.

50
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,530
The next step will ask the user to improve the H.

51
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:05,170
And say okay age equals 2 again input and then open parentheses open double quotes and then wilkie into

52
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,630
until you age gimmick that kind of thing or maybe a little bit more pretty.

53
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,210
Here just add two columns here.

54
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,130
Okay.

55
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:20,020
And then afterwards mean ask the user to input their ads Signus the key address equals to input or print

56
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,160
parentheses double quotes enter your address.

57
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,700
Looks good.

58
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,160
Looks great right.

59
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,050
Columns as well.

60
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,880
Looks great.

61
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,660
It's actually let's run it and let's test that first so you know run it until you're name and say let's

62
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,780
say right for example let's say in AIDS you call college whatever.

63
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:46,430
Again 23 whatever and do you adjust to say okay for example like Toronto for example.

64
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,340
Canada.

65
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,140
Whatever.

66
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,710
Okay.

67
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,180
I'm going to run it and then you'll see that everything went ran perfectly.

68
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,710
So the cell has brain and now I have Neame agent and this has the everyone is nicolaides check if we're

69
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,150
playing name maybe there is rain in there.

70
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,630
If I do the address and if I run it down it's.

71
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,610
Toronto Canada looks great.

72
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,870
Perfect.

73
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,140
It's what it could do here.

74
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:17,840
And I wanted to print to the user that basically your name is whatever your age is whatever and you'll

75
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,520
live at that specific address.

76
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:19,850
OK.

77
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,260
Let's take a look and say okay print open prentice's.

78
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,890
I'm going to say that because I'm going to say okay.

79
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,210
Your name is open to any brackets.

80
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,000
OK.

81
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,040
You are whatever year old Kate.

82
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,280
Again comma and say okay you will live X.

83
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,640
And then curly brackets and then you can pass along all of that using this format method.

84
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:50,240
If you get it of course after the after the double quotes here you're going to say OK you format right

85
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:56,340
open parentheses right and then pass along everything in order to say.

86
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,890
Meme I'm going to say age I'm going to pass along the address.

87
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,060
Okay.

88
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,160
I hope everything looks good.

89
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,960
Let's try let's try it again.

90
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,930
And to name Ryan again 23 again and then enter the address let's say.

91
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:18,500
Again Toronto Canada run it and then after the input there you'll see okay your name is Ryan.

92
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,580
You are 23 years old.

93
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,910
You live at four of them.

94
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,800
But Toronto looks great to me.

95
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,770
Well that's exactly what we're expecting.

96
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,400
So now we know how can we use this to improve value.

97
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,710
How can we take data from the U.S. and have conjecture printed as well to the user.

98
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,460
Okay perfect.

99
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,570
Let's take a look at another example.

100
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,510
Let's add you know creates couple of new Will new cells here.

101
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:46,580
Let's assume that I wanted to ask the users to enter an integer to integer values and then print the

102
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,750
sum to the user.

103
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,350
Okay let's take a look.

104
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,320
So I'm going to say okay I'm going to instead of having a string I can ask you is it okay to a equals

105
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,830
two.

106
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,500
Okay I'm going to use input or I open parentheses.

107
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,440
I'm going as the user.

108
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,350
Great interview.

109
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:00,880
No.

110
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,280
Okay.

111
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,060
For example.

112
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,610
Right.

113
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,060
And then you should enter a number and that number should be fed here in a string.

114
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:06,410
OK.

115
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,880
In a vat the value.

116
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,950
And then you ask you okay one more time going to copy paste.

117
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,050
And then I go here.

118
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,380
Call is be an orgasm is to enter another number.

119
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,130
OK.

120
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,670
And what I could do here.

121
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,880
I'm going to say okay print open parentheses open double quotes.

122
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:33,160
I'm going to say give some of let's say A and B is.

123
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,810
Open again curly brackets come here.

124
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,340
They say God for a Mets.

125
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,740
Okay.

126
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,160
And here I'm going to pass along them in order to A and then B.

127
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,000
And he had a have two options either to actually perform let's say the summation previously and you

128
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,900
say okay.

129
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,080
See for example equals two a plus b.

130
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,320
I can do that and can pass along.

131
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:02,430
Here the value of c and then simply say okay the sum let's say of two plus three is let's say five.

132
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,770
That's what I was expecting.

133
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,520
Okay.

134
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,490
Let's take a look.

135
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,240
Let's Jonathan see what's going to happen if I went on it and there are no it's going to take three.

136
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:17,280
Press enter enter another number in minutes let's say to enter and then you come up with that surprise

137
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,290
that the surprises.

138
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:19,900
Yes.

139
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,950
All that looks great.

140
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:28,160
The sum of three and two is this is the problem what happens here is that you simply want it liquid

141
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,200
Python did here is that just it concatenates simply this ching's.

142
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,390
Well do you mean by that simply it just shows three followed by two.

143
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,660
It didn't actually perform the summation.

144
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,420
OK.

145
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,530
So why is that OK.

146
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:48,730
That's actually very important because here we need to differentiate between string and integer values.

147
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,730
So let's take a look.

148
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,410
So what we have done here is that when I ask the users to enter a number.

149
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,140
OK.

150
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,740
The user Yes the user entered three.

151
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,430
But if we take a look at let's say the type of a.

152
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,460
And if we're on it you would come up.

153
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,430
That's not an integer.

154
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,020
It's actually a string which means think of it as kind of you know it's a character OK again within

155
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,200
and covers things so far.

156
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,540
But this is not a number.

157
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:17,810
This is not a value that you can actually use to add to perform mathematical operation on it.

158
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,440
Similarly put Similarly if you do type let's say B and you run it you come up with again with this string

159
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,000
two.

160
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,570
And that's why he went to put a plan B.

161
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,120
It just d dealt with them as kind of strings not as numbers.

162
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:31,400
OK.

163
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,510
Well how can we actually overcome this.

164
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:41,010
We to overcome this by using or by converting the values that the user are going to be inputting here

165
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,690
from the strain's to integers.

166
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,560
Okay let's take a look.

167
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,680
So what I could do here is is going to copy these to be exact same going to copy them here and what

168
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,750
I could do here is simply going to convert from string to integer.

169
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,000
Let's take a look what I could do again think the value of a.

170
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,470
Or a.

171
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,060
So going to say okay int.

172
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:08,170
When it do end open parentheses pass along the value of a.

173
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,780
Okay then what I could do.

174
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,150
You're going to pass along this again.

175
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,270
Call it a underscore it's.

176
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,440
Which means.

177
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,400
Now I can convert from a string to integer value.

178
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,720
Let's take a look.

179
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,290
So if I actually run this all right.

180
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,120
OK.

181
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:30,000
Before look in before running this I want to confuse you what I could do what I did here is let's copy

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,940
that code men do it separately here.

183
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,520
I just took the value of a and convert it to integer.

184
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:42,810
Let's run this and if I get the type of a underscore it is not found on it you'll come up with a value

185
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:48,150
of integers which means that simply now a is not a string anymore.

186
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:53,370
If I actually take a look at it there's actually you see that we converted the value of three which

187
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,260
was a string value of three.

188
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,310
But now that has a type of integer.

189
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,470
Then you can do mathematical operation on it.

190
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,120
All right.

191
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:00,890
OK.

192
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,180
Go Heat again.

193
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,300
So again I want to confuse you.

194
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,540
We until the number we put in in a is a string.

195
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,880
Now let's take a converted from a string into an integer.

196
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,210
Now looks good.

197
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,420
Now I'm going to take on another number which is B which is again still string have to do the conversion

198
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:27,870
for me as well go Duby underscored int equals to n s bracket B or 8 and then go do the mathematical

199
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,200
operation not an even B.

200
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,240
Well actual ain't right plus b.

201
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,000
It's great.

202
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,140
And that will generate the value of c and that's it.

203
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,710
That's pretty much all what I need to do.

204
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,650
Then you're going to perform the actual operation.

205
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,480
Some of them up and then you should be printing valuev see which is supposed to mean the actual true

206
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,860
summation values.

207
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,580
Let's try this.

208
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,520
Let's run it.

209
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,760
This is 3 percentage 2.

210
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,660
If you're on it you'll come up actually was what are you expecting.

211
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,620
The sum of 3 and 2 is 5 in a Instead of actually 3.

212
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:01,260
Could get the weighted order just next to 2 which makes complete sense.

213
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,380
Let's try it again.

214
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,450
Let's Destino let's say for example the value of 10 and value of 20.

215
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,600
And if you some of the summation 30 looks great that's all expecting and that's pretty much all what

216
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,480
we have for this section.

217
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,320
Again you guys are getting closer to mastering python.

218
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,530
Keep it up eureka's enjoy that session and see you in the next section.
