00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.260
Hello everyone and welcome to this new lecture in the previous lecture.

2
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.200
We were able to load the data load our libraries.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.990
Let's go ahead and review.

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.130
So we were able to import our libraries here.

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.010
We're able to import our reviews files as we file.

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.240
And we did some kind of quick analysis to take a look at the data.

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.070
Take a look at the reviews and so on.

8
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.750
And now let's go ahead and do some data visualization.

9
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.120
All right.

10
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.150
Get more interesting as we move forward.

11
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.390
All right.

12
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.070
So if you guys remember first of all what is our data frame so all the information is contained within

13
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.840
our data frame.

14
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.790
The F underscore Alexa shift enter.

15
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.220
This is our all our information.

16
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:48.510
So first let's maybe see how many positive or maybe group or the positive reviews and all the negative

17
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.600
reviews in two categories.

18
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.900
All right.

19
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.400
So I'm gonna say positive equals two.

20
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.490
I'm going to go into my data frame which is the F underscore Alexa.

21
00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.810
Right.

22
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.680
And what I'm going to do I'm going to say OK go to the F underscore Alexa within my feedback column.

23
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:14.770
If you guys remember I have so many columns right so I had the Rating Rate date variations that if I

24
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.820
the views and feedback.

25
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:16.670
Right.

26
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.960
So feedback here.

27
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.970
That's the column I'm like you know checking out.

28
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.150
So basically there are either 0 or 1 1 means good review.

29
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.190
Zero means bad review.

30
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.560
So what good are you going to say okay.

31
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.720
If you go into my data frame Alexa within that column that's call it feedback.

32
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.340
If you find that feedback was equals equals to 1 then that means it's positive feedback else.

33
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.770
So we're gonna copy the same thing just put it set that to zero.

34
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.420
I'm gonna say else other than that that means it's a negative one it's a negative review All right that's

35
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.060
it.

36
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.240
Shift enters looks good.

37
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.320
And let's take a look at it.

38
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.640
So here I have positive shift enter.

39
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.160
Here we go.

40
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.870
These are all simply out all positive we use it all feedback equals to 1.

41
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.100
Let's take a look at negative

42
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.860
again.

43
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.370
This is a data frame that has all feedback of zeros.

44
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.980
Let's maybe take a look at some of the reviews here.

45
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.970
People are saying you know it's like Siri.

46
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.240
In fact Siri doesn't you know does and says more accurate.

47
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.580
So some people are complaining here you know sound is terrible.

48
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.510
They are saying obviously these are the good ones.

49
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.760
OK.

50
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.870
We know that there is a lot of good ones which is great the product actually great.

51
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.230
He is saying sound is terrible if you want a good music to get something.

52
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.280
Not much features actually all that information here in here in these bad reviews.

53
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.610
Literally they are gold.

54
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.360
OK.

55
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.270
If you wanted to improve your product you know don't listen to the good reviews good reviews are good.

56
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.060
You know obviously to keep going and maybe improve what you are actually good at but bad reviews are

57
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.540
amazing.

58
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.900
These are literally like gold mines.

59
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.280
If you think about it why.

60
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.080
Because if you know what customers are complaining about you can go back and feed all that information

61
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.900
or all of these kind of new requirements into your future products and actually fix it and maybe make

62
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.120
it 10 times better product stopped working after two hours so it seemed or two weeks it seems like there

63
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.450
is a quality issue here.

64
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.260
Maybe you can see and how can we improve the quality for example of the product.

65
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.110
Sad joke.

66
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.860
What is this.

67
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.010
You know that's I hear these reviews because these reviews doesn't mean anything like you know like

68
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.450
it's you know what we need like we need an actual like knock it down into some specific information.

69
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.890
So this one stop working.

70
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:35.910
This is a quality issue.

71
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.830
I can link it somehow not much feature.

72
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.610
So people are complaining maybe maybe we need more you know more features.

73
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.980
I don't know what features maybe you can tell us you know what features you need here.

74
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.540
Really disappointing Alexa has to be plug in.

75
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.310
OK.

76
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.600
All right.

77
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.490
It's not great sound and base so it seems like you know yes it's kind of you know smart assistant but

78
00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.710
if you want to use it as kind of a player maybe you can go like music player I mean you can maybe go

79
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:08.800
to let's say beats for example might be better quality or maybe like you know like that is like solos

80
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.430
one for instance might have better quality too.

81
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.320
So it seems like you know maybe Amazon need to like step this up a little bit maybe I'm not super impressed

82
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.980
with Alexa.

83
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.210
OK too difficult to set up.

84
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.670
So maybe try to make the software a little bit easier.

85
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.270
You know it's no longer working up to five months quality issue.

86
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.620
This thing barely works.

87
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.710
A quality issue not working doesn't always respond when spoken.

88
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.670
So maybe improve the A.I. algorithm in there you know like and so on.

89
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:36.050
All right.

90
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.220
Obviously it would take us forever to go through all these reviews.

91
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.420
I just want to give you an idea of of of like what what can we do with it.

92
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.660
OK.

93
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.460
And that's actually can you apply it to pretty much anywhere you know in your company or wherever you

94
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.140
could do if you can have access to this data.

95
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.930
You don't even even if you go let's say to like whatever glass door for example and maybe look at your

96
00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.810
company maybe you can get an idea you know like if you work in the H.R. department for instance you

97
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.410
can get an idea of like what people are saying you know these are kind of again a goldmine.

98
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.770
But the key is how can you actually visualize the data and get information out of it.

99
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.560
So that's a good way of doing it.

100
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.680
The second step is maybe we can count how many positive and how many negative feedback.

101
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.030
All right.

102
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:26.910
We're going to take it as an S that count plots here will pass along our def on the score Alexa and

103
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:34.380
what I need to do is I need to count my feedback column right and he I need to specify my label equals

104
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.230
two let's say count enter.

105
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.330
Here we go.

106
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.410
This is simply the count.

107
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.420
So we know that there are three thousand views right here.

108
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:49.260
There are simply one we need again feedback one that means positive feedback.

109
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.440
We have around almost twenty seven hundred which is great.

110
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.660
Here we have maybe half like you know I don't know 200 or 300 maybe bad reviews which is great.

111
00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.380
Obviously the product is has good feedback.

112
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.550
So what I want you guys to do and they are going to be our quick challenge challenge mini challenge

113
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:12.510
to please go ahead repeat pretty much the same comment do count plot but do it for the reviews instead.

114
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:19.320
So here's if you go up to the star rating I wanted to see how many ratings were five stars how many

115
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.210
it was two stars and so on.

116
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:28.250
Please go ahead pause the video and I'll see you guys after the challenge.

117
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.950
All right.

118
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.490
Hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge ask us to do simply to do count plot.

119
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:41.170
So going to say using Seabourn as well as an S dot count plot and what we could do we could say OK maybe

120
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.720
we can pass along our rating instead.

121
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.810
So we're going to say let's say there's two ways of doing it.

122
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:52.360
Let's do the first we're going to say OK X equals to our rating OK.

123
00:06:52.450 --> 00:07:00.910
And what we could do going to save our data our source of data is DLF underscored Alexa shift enter.

124
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:01.490
Here we go.

125
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.070
So what you guys can see here is that we had a lot of five star reviews right.

126
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.820
So there's almost twenty five hundred five star reviews which is great.

127
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.090
Here there's around five hundred four star reviews which is not bad too.

128
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:21.020
And it seems like there is you know maybe a little bit around two hundred maybe that one sort of view

129
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:26.230
and so on and not much to star reviews and three star reviews.

130
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:31.920
All right let's go ahead and maybe plot a histogram of the ratings.

131
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:40.780
So could you get a sec ADF underscored Alexa to open up our ratings column.

132
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.310
We can apply hist and then pass along how many bends do we need.

133
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.060
So let's say beans equals let's say 10 for example shift enter.

134
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.020
Here we go.

135
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.920
These are the beans obviously 10 doesn't make sense in here because we are categorized based make them

136
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.060
let's say beans a five.

137
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.740
Here we go.

138
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.390
So obviously most of the reviews are five start of use.

139
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.360
That's good.

140
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.310
And that's pretty much consistent with what we have done here when we did count plot.

141
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.380
All right.

142
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:15.190
Now to them kind of you know one of the best way of visualizing the data we didn't know how many variations

143
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:15.700
do we have.

144
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:22.630
So it seems like there are you know like there are charcoal fabric there is like Heather Gray that is

145
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.610
like sand sandstone there's like black.

146
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:31.810
So we could do we could go ahead and maybe try to see how many variations are there and maybe take a

147
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:41.810
look at the bar cloth as well to visualize to see how many variations and how many readings do we have.

148
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:42.560
OK.

149
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:48.120
So let's see how can we do this first maybe let's go ahead and count the.

150
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.780
The elements are going to say OK we can do that using bold plot so I'm going to say S.A. that bar plots

151
00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:00.370
and what we could do going to take x equals to our variations which is our variations column actions

152
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.830
only end.

153
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:02.820
All right.

154
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:09.190
That's on the x axis on the x axis I'm going to show every single variation on the y axis.

155
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.360
I wanted to show the ratings right.

156
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.880
So I want to show the ratings and what we could do here we're going to say pass along our data.

157
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:22.130
Going to be def underscored Alexa and maybe show the palette which is a color

158
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.710
you guys can pick whatever he'd just selected deep for example.

159
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:29.010
All right.

160
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.400
Okay just enter OK.

161
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.060
Something is wrong so obviously maybe this is ratings for the ratings.

162
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.450
Again I'm guessing correct good right.

163
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.500
So that's not bad.

164
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:45.000
But obviously here there was I messed up so what we could do here instead we could just increase the

165
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.930
size of the figures.

166
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:54.550
I'm going to take a BLT that figure and we could pass along our fig size equals two and maybe set it

167
00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:59.510
let's say two forty and let's say 15 for instance shift enter.

168
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.330
Here we go.

169
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.570
All right looks great.

170
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.730
So what's happening here.

171
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:10.600
Let's zoom in a little bit so if you guys can see here there are so many variations already that are

172
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.010
charcoal fabric walnut finish.

173
00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:18.440
Heather you know like Gray fabrics sandstone fabric oak finish and so on.

174
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:24.160
And this is kind of you know that distribution to the mean here of this is around 5 pretty much most

175
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.110
of them has like five star reviews.

176
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:26.560
Right.

177
00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:32.410
This is kind of the variations like you know it seems like you know maybe this one the White plus you

178
00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:37.710
know maybe like has a little bit more a little bit less and so on but they are pretty much consistent

179
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.350
right.

180
00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.090
Nothing has.

181
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:44.170
And I think it's crazy out of the North but maybe the White one has kind of you know the minimum for

182
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:48.910
rating right but it's not much difference compared to let's say this one this one is it's like kind

183
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.190
of the highest walnut finish or maybe oak finish.

184
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.860
So people are happy with that.

185
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:59.020
Here people are not that happy with it but again they are forced out of use that they are not like one

186
00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:03.250
star or something that you can make a dramatic change to the product.

187
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.280
OK.

188
00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:04.870
All right.

189
00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.860
And that's pretty much all what I need to do in regards to data visualization.

190
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.380
I hope you guys enjoy this lecture.

191
00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:13.090
Let's recap what we have done so far.

192
00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:20.260
So in this lecture we're able to group first our reviews into positive and negative reviews and maybe

193
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:25.510
visualize and take a look at couple of these reviews maybe see what the people are saying put quality

194
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.220
you know like or maybe the the the issues here so we can try to improve the product.

195
00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:36.430
Scroll down you will find that these account plots how many were positive and negative.

196
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.760
He had how many would five star reviews how many were forced out of use.

197
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.470
He did showing you the ratings as well the histogram for the ratings he did showing you the variations

198
00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:49.180
and the ratings here and that's pretty much what we have for this lecture I hope you guys enjoyed it.

199
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.990
In the next lecture we're going to do actually like two more steps.

200
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.370
We can do what we called a word cloud.

201
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.830
It's really amazing.

202
00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:01.560
We're going to see which words are kind of the most frequent and try to plot it in a really nice way.

203
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.280
I think we do some data cleaning and some feature feature engineering afterwards and that would conclude

204
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.570
the entire project.

205
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.150
I hope you guys enjoy this lecture and see you in the next one.
