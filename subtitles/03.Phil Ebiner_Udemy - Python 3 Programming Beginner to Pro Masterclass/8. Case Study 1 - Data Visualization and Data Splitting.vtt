00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.170
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:10.750
In the previous lectures we went through how to load our libraries and to load our data as well.

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.510
Right so if you get the call from a previous lecture We loaded all our libraries.

4
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.860
And here we were able to load as well or import all our data set which is our ice cream data.

5
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.140
Here we have two column temperature revenue are eight in the section.

6
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.960
We're going to see how can we visualize the data and we're going to see as well how can we create testing

7
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.560
entraining dataset.

8
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.930
All right.

9
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.190
Let's get started.

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.420
So we wanted to insert some new sense does going to press a insert cells n division of the data we're

11
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.670
going to use a sebald library.

12
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.470
So when I say Okay s.a. Dot joint plot.

13
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.320
Okay.

14
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.930
And then we're going to need to pass along an extra value and our y value.

15
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.520
And we're going to pass along our data.

16
00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.970
Okay.

17
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.650
So simply put out the data that's the easy part.

18
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.190
We wanted to actually or pain our ice cream they're offering.

19
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.260
There's our data thing here.

20
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.410
We prepare a single case.

21
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.280
Now I know the data frame but I need to specify what is what.

22
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.620
Which column will be using to plot on the x axis and which column going to plot on the y axis.

23
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.140
So if you go here we need to make sure that the naming is exactly the same on the upper case lower case

24
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.900
of the seam.

25
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.770
So this is our temperature right.

26
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.090
We're going to copy that going to come here.

27
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.640
We're going to plot the temperature on the x axis.

28
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.600
I say OK that's our temperature.

29
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.870
And I will make sure that we pass along these simply Bosso if you were going to do here looking at lifting

30
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.970
the revenue going to copy the revenue and we're going to go here's an pasted and we will make sure that

31
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.030
it's again in a sitting kind of format.

32
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.160
So now we have the parcel on SNL the joint plot temperature of revenue and what single came when in

33
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.210
these two columns out of our bedframe ice cream.

34
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.010
Right.

35
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.280
That's granite.

36
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.020
And that's the data looks great.

37
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.430
So you can see here the data looks.

38
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.760
It's kind of you know the temperature normally this thread that normally distributed You know we have

39
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.820
our revenue again normally distributed in a way.

40
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:25.560
Here we have our kind of you know like midpoint is down 20 20 in the grisi have at our midpoint is around

41
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.780
it's a 500 dollars and the relationship is actually pretty linear Yes there are a couple of points in

42
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.180
all like our like outside you know with the the kind of scatter and in a way.

43
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.950
But the overall idea it looks like if we pass along here a straight line that were pretty good that

44
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.040
will be perfect.

45
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.620
So simple linear regression might actually work in this case.

46
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.540
Right.

47
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.090
Okay.

48
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.880
So on other plot that will may be useful in that one to plot or call a peer plot in seaboard.

49
00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:02.060
If you guys are not familiar with the pirit lot Please go ahead and check out the seaborne section in

50
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.920
the in the previous parts of the course.

51
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.450
So I'm going to do to say Okay s.a. Dot mean to say okay payer lots and again would get a pass along

52
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.860
our ice cream or dataflow nor need here to put the X and Y did.

53
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.440
So let's run that.

54
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.060
Once we hit on it that will pretty much kind of tell me what's the relationship between all the variables

55
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.640
that we have in our data.

56
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.110
So we do have our temperature you have our revenue and the temperature and again kind of you know the

57
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.620
change in a linear fashion.

58
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.860
Here we have all kind of distribution with Aperture.

59
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.460
We have a distribution for the revenue and we have our our revenue as well.

60
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.340
On the x axis versus temperature on the way access again the relationship is pretty much in your book.

61
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.870
The last point that we could do we're going to use a method called plot.

62
00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:00.660
Let's see how can we do that going to say Okay as soon as dot plot and then we're going to pass along

63
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.390
go at x value which is our temperature.

64
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.930
Temperature.

65
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.930
Not going to pass along our y value which is our revenue.

66
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:21.350
So make sure it's revenue and let's pass along our data which is our ice cream cake.

67
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.040
Let's add on that.

68
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.440
Sorry there's an error here it's a CNS dart alleged plot.

69
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.140
My apologies.

70
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:36.810
And as you guys can see here we alleged plot is mainly used for plotting kind of oaky before doing a

71
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:43.360
machine learning before doing anything okay maybe try to pass along a line here or alenia a line or

72
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.410
keep the pass through the data and it actually looks pretty good.

73
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.230
That means you know it might be a great good option if you just wanted to use the same as the alleged

74
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.100
plot.

75
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.080
Again LMR plotted plot the best fit line that would pass along through all that they'd give you here.

76
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.020
We don't have much details ruthenian actually it's been didn't actually divide the data into training

77
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.310
data and testing data.

78
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.840
We were just going to do l.m. plot and they will pass on the data just to see if we can actually use

79
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.850
it as a line or not.

80
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.080
Which is you know even without running this this.

81
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.350
We know that a straight line would be a good candidate for this problem.

82
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:24.300
Alright the next step step forward we're going to create testing entraining data set.

83
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.940
OK let's see how can we do this.

84
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.290
So what we're going to do here.

85
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.560
You going to say Okay let's change the naming convention a little bit and let's define our X..

86
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.020
Which stand for the input we send for the input to the model and Y which sent for the output.

87
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.820
That's coming out of the Model K.

88
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.310
So going to say okay X equals 2 we're going to go into our ice cream which is outdebate offering an

89
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.240
organ to do here.

90
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:59.480
I'm going to say okay we are going to take our temperature right and that would be the extra value.

91
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.970
Let's strand that and let's take a look at the X and he we simply open our first column which is our

92
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.780
first column contained within our offering.

93
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.840
And that's our temperatures.

94
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.260
That's the first input to the data input to the moderate.

95
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:21.440
When I took the opiate I'm going to say occupy why equals to our ice cream and we're going to pass along

96
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.390
our output.

97
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.290
We're going to be our revenue.

98
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:25.560
Let's run there.

99
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.130
Let's take a look at the why.

100
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.360
And you will see that's the value of what.

101
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.490
Okay looks great.

102
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.590
So what we're going to do afterwards we are going to again the in the object the objective will the

103
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.240
section that we want to create testing ntd dataset.

104
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.270
If you question a member from previous from the actual lecture that we went through from the intuition

105
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.320
lecture.

106
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:55.040
What we do in general is that we divide our dataset into 75 percent for training and 25 percent for

107
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.920
testing.

108
00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:02.320
In order to divide the dataset we use the team that's split from eskies learn to do this for us.

109
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.570
Let's say How can we do that.

110
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:10.770
OK from its killer dot model underscore selection.

111
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.240
We're going to import our train underscored.

112
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.350
Test underscored split.

113
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:23.340
This is simply kind of we're going to import from our from our library.

114
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.160
We're going to import this class which is quite cheap split which is really powerful will do we'll have

115
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.350
to go and actually split the deed ourselves.

116
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.790
We're just going to you know let's just call team discipline.

117
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.370
We'll do all the measure for us.

118
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:35.000
Let's run.

119
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.590
This looks good.

120
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:44.030
Next step is we're going to say okay we're going to run treen test split and then we need to pass along

121
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.470
the arguments.

122
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.410
We're going to pass on the input first.

123
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:52.830
That's an X which is our input that's along our output which is why.

124
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.230
And then he'd wanted to specify our ratio.

125
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:56.680
Okay.

126
00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.040
How are we going to divide it 25 percent 75 percent.

127
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.360
That's kind of an old rule of thumb but that's not the general rule.

128
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:09.680
Some people can say okay maybe 30 percent 70 percent maybe it's let's say 20 percent 80 percent here

129
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:16.330
and say okay I'm going to say OK test underscore size equals two point two five.

130
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.920
And simply hearing you call the team they're split the teens to train this split.

131
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:27.250
Well it's going to really turn back our next train.

132
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:36.510
Our X test our y train n our y test.

133
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.130
All right.

134
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.590
OK.

135
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.370
What do you mean by this.

136
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:40.400
Simply put.

137
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:47.430
Once we run this basically time again we're going to pass along the Inspire entire column.

138
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.940
It's all going to pass along our X column.

139
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.060
He was puzzling of why column entry and they're split.

140
00:08:53.060 --> 00:09:00.050
We're going to divide the data for us into training data exchange NYT and into testing did extent than

141
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:04.340
white test using this reissue which is 25 percent 75 percent.

142
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.080
All right let's have a little see what's going to happen.

143
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:06.460
OK.

144
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.410
Looks good and successful.

145
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.410
Let's take a look of then at extreme one extreme.

146
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:13.360
Who goes first.

147
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.550
That is very important observation.

148
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:22.310
First step is you'll find that the data here number of columns of 375 which make sense.

149
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:27.650
That's simply 75 percent out of 500 samples.

150
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.090
If we take a look let's say at our.

151
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.320
X test.

152
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.460
If we'd done it again you would find there.

153
00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:42.590
We have the rest of the deed which is 125 rows makes complete sense.

154
00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:47.900
One key element here is that what X were take to split do as well.

155
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:53.510
It does kind of shuffling to the dealer so you can see other indices have changes dramatically.

156
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:58.130
Right so before it was actually in an ascending order the forgets can see you're in that origin of data

157
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.780
set here.

158
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.200
It has been shuffled which is great.

159
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:03.090
That's a good thing.

160
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:03.400
Why.

161
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:08.560
Because when we treat our model we want to make sure that the model doesn't capture kind of you know

162
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.150
the v.v. independency that the data for example is going in ascending order or in a descending order.

163
00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:15.720
Will just want to shuffle the data.

164
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:16.630
That's a good thing.

165
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.590
That means the model going to generalize better.

166
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:20.820
All right.

167
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.210
So now we take a look at the extreme.

168
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:30.560
It's 375 semples and expressed they are 125 semples as well.

169
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.610
Let's take a look at why train.

170
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:41.450
Why team again they are saying that 75 percent of there's a shuffle too.

171
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.350
And let's take a look as well.

172
00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.420
Why tests.

173
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:50.220
If they could look at why tests were on it again we have a couple of simple see.

174
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.590
The rest of the semples which is 125 attempts are eight.

175
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.460
So now it's a good time for a quick challenge.

176
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:04.770
Let's assume though you want to split our set in to 65 percent training in 55 percent testing.

177
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.570
Please go ahead and pause the video and try to achieve kind of that challenge.

178
00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.390
All right again we're going to pause.

179
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.110
Please go ahead.

180
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:17.080
Up on the video it's supposed to be very kind of quick easy challenge and then we're going to solve

181
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.800
the challenge right after the break.

182
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.300
All right I hope you guys were able to do that challenge.

183
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:32.750
So what I ask in the challenge is they wanted to divide the data set instead of 25 percent forward training

184
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.570
25 percent for testing 75 percent training.

185
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:41.500
I wanted to divide it into 65 percent training and 35 percent testing.

186
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:47.660
So in order to do that what they need to do here that they wanted to come here instead of point to five

187
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.090
I want to set a two point three five.

188
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.750
Okay.

189
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.160
And that's it.

190
00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:58.690
Let's actually make sure that that you know what we have done here is correct let's say the cell and

191
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.880
let's go here and run this cell that would be so extreme.

192
00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:09.440
And let's take a look at the size of the exchange if you can see here here we have 325 rolls which is

193
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.930
pretty pretty which is pretty much right.

194
00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:16.330
That means that 65 percent of our data is changing.

195
00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.110
Let's run out west again shift entries to run the cells.

196
00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:26.630
If we go down here you will see that we have 100 in 75 instead of 100 and 25.

197
00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:31.580
That means he and we shifted the deal a little bit into more testing compared to training.

198
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:38.310
If you go to ytn Let's run it again or go down you would find there is through 325.

199
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.380
Why test.

200
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.640
You will find that if you go down here they will become 175.

201
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.050
Right okay.

202
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.520
Are you hoping the challenge was pretty pretty easy and straightforward.

203
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.810
Let's recap what we have done so far.

204
00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.400
So in this section we went through step three and step four.

205
00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:00.320
We're able to go ahead and visual of the data using as soon as the joint plot.

206
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.490
And we saw that straight line will be perfect in this case.

207
00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:09.650
We use the pin plot to view the data as well and we use ascent as the alarm plot to just quickly draw

208
00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:14.270
a straight line with the best straight line that fits the data and we see the streetlight and actually

209
00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.210
work pretty well in this case.

210
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:22.550
And here we were able to opt in our X and Y which is you know indicates our input and output for our

211
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:30.920
model and we able to as well use chain test plitt to divide the data set in two again testing data and

212
00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:36.020
taking data exchange for training an X test for testing.

213
00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.360
And we divide the data set.

214
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:40.900
In general the rule of thumb is 25 percent 75 percent.

215
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:46.810
And we get a kind of a quick challenge to go ahead and change it to 65 percent for training and 35 percent

216
00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.840
for testing our right.

217
00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:50.840
And that's very much what we have with this lecture.

218
00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.270
I hope you enjoyed it and see you in the next lecture.
