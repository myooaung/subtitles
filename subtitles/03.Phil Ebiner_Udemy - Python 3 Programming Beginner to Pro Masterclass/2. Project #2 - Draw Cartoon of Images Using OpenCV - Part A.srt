00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,630
Hello everyone and welcome to this project and this project we're going to do some fun kind of activities.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,110
We're going to see how can we use Python to deal with images.

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,480
So we're going to see how can we take an image you know any image.

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,950
I'm going to show you how can you do that on basically any image from the Internet.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,940
They're going to convert that image to let's say greyscale.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,120
So change it from a colour to greyscale and then I'm going to show you as well how can we create some

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,100
cartoony effects so I'm going to look at some images of let's say politicians or you know like whatever

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,120
it may be you can use your images where you were face to and they don't get to make kind of a cartoon

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,320
effect so it's a little bit of kind of fun project.

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,710
But before we do that we need to understand how can we actually present or store image digitally within

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,470
a computer.

12
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,100
All right.

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,010
OK.

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,790
So first we're going to walk you through a couple of slides just to show you how can we present an image

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,170
in general and then afterwards we're going to go into the book.

16
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,980
I'm going to show you how can we perform the conversion again from colours to greyscale and to quote

17
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,040
effect as well.

18
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:00,790
OK.

19
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:07,830
So all right so I'm going to represent an image so as you can see here this is the image and this image

20
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,090
is in a greyscale.

21
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,150
When you say greyscale that means just black and black and white.

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,710
Right.

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,880
So when we say how can it present an image within a python environment within let's say a digital platform.

24
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,800
So the idea is the image here is divided into different pixels.

25
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:23,440
OK.

26
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:30,130
And each of these pixels has a certain number that number ranges from zero to 155.

27
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:30,710
OK.

28
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,130
So the number represents zero.

29
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,360
That means black.

30
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:39,090
So when you say actually when you look at the image are they able to tell when different pixels which

31
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:39,750
are different.

32
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,350
Let's say like corners or boxes.

33
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,860
Each box is simply a number.

34
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,760
That number range from 0 to 255.

35
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,870
The number is zero.

36
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,030
That means the pixel is black.

37
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,660
If the number is 255 that means the pixel is white.

38
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,340
OK.

39
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,360
In between that's grey.

40
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,350
That's a great value.

41
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,690
And that's pretty much it.

42
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,660
How can you present any image.

43
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,140
So if you actually think that image and break it down you will see that there is basically just bunch

44
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,210
of pixels and each pixels.

45
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,580
If it's black pixel is black like this pixel for instance.

46
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,440
That means the actual numerical digital value in there is actually zero.

47
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,620
If you look at this pixel for instance which is a bit like lighter let's say it's white.

48
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,590
That means let's say it's about 255 of value.

49
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,810
Anything in between.

50
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,520
Anything grey in here that means let's say it's 150 or let's say 100 and so on.

51
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,130
Right.

52
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,930
So here this is simply our image in a pixel format or in a digital format.

53
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,400
That's all the zeros because as a black 155 because it's grey to 155 because it's white these pictures

54
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:52,320
and these pixels are actually presented in digitally what we call a V in a bind in a format and that's

55
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,560
OK.

56
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,680
And again any any value that stored in the computer is actually a bunch of zeros and ones not actually

57
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,370
decimal values.

58
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,580
I think those can see here.

59
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,750
So these are the values in decimal format.

60
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,570
These are the values in a binary format.

61
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:11,350
So their value is there's value zero indicates actually bits of zero value all of them as heroes.

62
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,860
If you have to hunt fifty five That means it's all 1 1 1 1 1 1 okay.

63
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,670
If you don't have background in digital logic design just don't worry about it.

64
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,440
Just the whole idea of that and wanted to convey if there were any present image in a different format

65
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,200
Greece can image again as a bunch of pixels.

66
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,770
Each pixel has a value from 0 to 255 on it.

67
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,370
So how can to present the coloured image.

68
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,490
OK so columnist a little bit more complex.

69
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,130
So in general each image as you can see here this is a coloured image.

70
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,660
It's actually divided into kind of three channels.

71
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,000
Each panel represent different colours of red green and blue.

72
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,290
OK so a greyscale image is just kind of one.

73
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,300
They are however a coloured image it's actually consists of three lakes or eight.

74
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:07,200
And each layer represent again colour which is either red green and blue and by mixing all that then

75
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,470
you can see all the colours.

76
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:15,180
You can actually see within an image like in all a car they like yellow for instance is a mix of lets

77
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,940
see red and green and so on and so forth and that's how you can actually create different ranges of

78
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,490
colour.

79
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:26,720
OK so again each pixel contains an x in X Y.

80
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,520
Three values ranging from 0 to 255 and that's whether you want it.

81
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,530
RG B.

82
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:38,130
College space is presented which is again different layers of different chain of red green and blue

83
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,530
and that's how you present ecology image.

84
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,240
All right.

85
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,210
OK.

86
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,820
So again if we look at this image we can divide that image down into a bunch of pixels.

87
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,150
You will see that this is kind of really a number of yellow coloured yellow.

88
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,600
So the coloured yellows actually consists of three pixels because of three layers.

89
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,240
It's actually two 1 there 55 55 0.

90
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,100
Okay.

91
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,830
So simply put you put.

92
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,750
It's a mix of of red.

93
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,610
And if you go back actually no yellow sexual mix of red and green.

94
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,300
And that's why here you would see it's red is 100 percent or like 155 green is to under 55.

95
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,370
And the blues is here.

96
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,120
There's no blue in there.

97
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,760
However if you want to present to the number of blue it's again it's a pixel.

98
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,500
It has three valleys in there of 0 0 and 255.

99
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,100
The present thing that there is no red.

100
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,160
There is no green.

101
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,170
However it's all blue.

102
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:30,980
Is there no green.

103
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,420
It's zero hundred and zero.

104
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,120
Prisoner number Red It's 255 zedong's you're on so and so forth.

105
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:43,660
And the key difference between the colour image and degrease image is that the greyscale image has only

106
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,510
eight bits.

107
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,060
OK.

108
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:51,380
However for a coloured image actually had eight time three because we have three layers straight.

109
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,160
And that's why is what we call it has 24 bit coloured format.

110
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,950
And that's where the 24 bit colour came into play.

111
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,630
All right.

112
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,680
OK.

113
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:05,310
So again assuming that we have the exact same image a greyscale and it is a Scollard.

114
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:11,340
You could see that the image actually three times the size larger compared to the reskilling.

115
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,170
All right.

116
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:12,980
OK.

117
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:18,250
So that's pretty much kind of the foundation that they want you to to see them in the next section.

118
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,150
I'm going to show you how can we actually take all that learning that we all seen.

119
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:26,440
We try to use all of that open CV which is a very famous library within python.

120
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,540
They actually use to make life way easier.

121
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,010
Okay.

122
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,920
Going to use it to load images.

123
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,690
Make it you know converted from greyscale to Colorado from college to reskill.

124
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,180
A load.

125
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,860
How can we make these different cartoon effects.

126
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,530
It's going to be a lot of a lot of fun.

127
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,660
I hope you guys enjoy it and see you in the next section.
