00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.880
Hello everyone and welcome to this project and this project.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:09.450
Again it's a similar project that we were going to build called the paper fortunetellers okay.

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.910
It's kind of you know like a fun game used by a by kids that we hear.

4
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:23.260
We're going to select an ask mainly the or the the player to enter or give us one of four colours.

5
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.750
So he was selected are mainly yellow green blue and red.

6
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.150
And once the user feeds in the colour you can ask him to see the number which is you know ranging from

7
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.830
one to eight and then based on that combination then I'm going to tell them Okay what's your fortune

8
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.950
going to look like.

9
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.890
Let's say the president of the US we're going to be like a millionaire or whatever.

10
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.470
Okay.

11
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.100
Then you can build kind of you know a fun game of actually building your game yourself.

12
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.470
You can do it in python.

13
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.400
Again this code is pretty simple.

14
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.570
It's a fun game.

15
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.800
And again in future prises are going to have way more complex and practical projects moving forward.

16
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.370
So again that's the paper people fortune teller.

17
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.880
So here we have the code for it so let's walk you through it.

18
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.080
So first we're going to import random.

19
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.730
OK.

20
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.500
And then the next step is going to ask the user or a journal you know having that kind of a welcome

21
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.580
message to the user.

22
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.850
So I'm going to show you what do you mean by ncvs first.

23
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.490
But here we're going to print.

24
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.590
Welcome to the fortunetellers.

25
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.890
So just what kind of a player for example.

26
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.910
And then we're going to say okay what are the rules for the game.

27
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.310
OK.

28
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.150
So going to print you select the colour and the number.

29
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.860
And I would tell you what the future holds for you.

30
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.200
Again you can write whatever welcome message you want.

31
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.930
All right so let me actually skip that part in press B to create a new cell.

32
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.810
So what we're going to do here is I'm going to run there that will get you okay.

33
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.960
Welcome to the fortune teller who led the column.

34
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.400
No.

35
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.370
And I will tell you what the future future will hold for you.

36
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:58.440
The next step is we're going to simply create a while loop because we wanted to ask the user if we wanted

37
00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.880
to play several times or not.

38
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.090
OK so we're going create a while you put one let's set it to wave to as we have done before you you

39
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.470
ask it kind of you know check on a condition and say Okay why answers equals two yes.

40
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.990
So as long as the users say yes which means I want to play more.

41
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.650
We're going to keep looping through the game.

42
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.000
Once the user feeds whatever value nor whatever value they're going to exit basically there's game.

43
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.740
OK.

44
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.070
All right.

45
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.270
So first again as I mentioned when you ask the user to enter a scholar first and then followed by a

46
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.100
number from 1 8.

47
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.140
So first we're going to ask the user prompt the user input the colour which is again very simple.

48
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.380
We had that before.

49
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.820
So colour equals to input select the colour.

50
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.420
Then we actually gave them the options.

51
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.500
Yellow green blue and red.

52
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.740
And then once the user inputs the colour.

53
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.730
Okay the colour is yellow or green.

54
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.580
Then we actually have within the actual design of the game.

55
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.680
If if the column is within one of these two columns the number.

56
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.190
Okay which is again going to be 1 to 5 or 6.

57
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.180
These are the numbers under the colours.

58
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.290
So when the user select these two columns one of these two colours.

59
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.520
That's why we have the column is yellow or the column is creep.

60
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.380
Then we're going to ask all of the user to actually input our number which ranges from yes from 1 to

61
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.970
8.

62
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.740
But here once the user inputs the collared yellow and green then we then the number were going to be

63
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.170
that 1 to 5 or 6.

64
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.710
We actually from the use of the input not any number from one to eight.

65
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.320
Actually no.

66
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.060
1 to 5 or 6.

67
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.150
OK.

68
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.850
And they're not going to simply put we're going to implement that if condition can go through all of

69
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:39.590
these numbers.

70
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.920
Okay.

71
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.110
If the number is 1 8 1 everyone.

72
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.130
Okay they're going to be the you know the fortune telling.

73
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.370
Part of it.

74
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.840
The number is equal to one.

75
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.810
I'm going to say okay print you know like what are there what are your future career.

76
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.030
Don't worry I will one hundred percent get you what you would get one hundred percent get what you want.

77
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.070
Just be patient else.

78
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.470
If the number equates to 2 you would become a millionaire at the age of let's say 35.

79
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.150
OK.

80
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.820
If number is equal to five you will have a great family with let's say 10 kids and so on.

81
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.920
And that's you know kind of you know how you build your fortune teller.

82
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.050
All right.

83
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.930
And then if if the number is six you would become famous.

84
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.750
They will all love you so whole year as you can see.

85
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.730
These are the options that we have.

86
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.470
So again what's the use that feeds in the column which is going to be yellow or green.

87
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.160
OK.

88
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.540
We're going to have again kind of a nested nest if conditions.

89
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.370
You know we have a first condition that tells you okay what colour did you select.

90
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.840
If they are you know green.

91
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.530
We're going to go there if they are blue or red.

92
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.400
We're going to go there with them.

93
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.500
These two we're going to select based on the number that the use going to be empty.

94
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.890
That's why there is a kind of nested those two if conditions within each other.

95
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.730
Okay.

96
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:52.540
All right.

97
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.450
What if the user input you know any of the numbers the oil if you're if you have one to five or six

98
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.700
of those inputs let's say Whatever for.

99
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.680
So he's going to say okay print only numbers 1 2 5 but the only numbers allowed.

100
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.570
That's kind of you know to prompt the user input numbers within the actual options that we have.

101
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.340
OK.

102
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.690
So that would be our first if condition are in the next if condition if the college was selected.

103
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.870
The other two collars which is red or blue.

104
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.380
So else if if our collar equals to blue all of a column equals two red.

105
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:32.060
We're going to have again use it user input a number that number has to be between three four seven

106
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.750
or eight.

107
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.290
The rest of the numbers that we have here.

108
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.210
So again I'm going to ask the user input select the number again and there will be again an integer

109
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.690
value and then going to feel it is a number.

110
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.730
And then we're going to check the numbers again.

111
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.790
That's our IF condition within the big or major condition.

112
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.790
Simply put we have a condition for our collars Now if condition for our numbers.

113
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.370
So we have no equals 2 3.

114
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:04.620
They are going to have to live a happy life 100 years if no equal for six for a doctor one day.

115
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:11.190
Number seven you know number eight and so on and then else the last else he had for our condition.

116
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.940
Sorry for our condition.

117
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.150
Huge mistake.

118
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.180
Numbers out of the 478 numbers that came out.

119
00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.140
Okay.

120
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.210
And then what is the use of actually feeding collars to start with.

121
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.510
So here we have again we have a condition.

122
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:32.870
The big one Okay you're selecting the number of yellow green coloured yellow green or here of the number

123
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:39.980
in our column is blue or red then were here if the colours are whatever it is in puts you know any colour

124
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.670
that's not in the list.

125
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.700
Okay no else print.

126
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.820
These are the ones that are.

127
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.910
Orange.

128
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.210
And then you're going to probably use it if you want to play again or not use it.

129
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.580
So why we stand for yes.

130
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.720
Are going to keep looping.

131
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.710
If not we're going to say no and that's it.

132
00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:58.740
All right.

133
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.480
So let's try it.

134
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.630
Let's see what was the fallenness.

135
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:02.810
OK.

136
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.820
So let's run it let's stand here.

137
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.030
Say OK select the colours.

138
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.280
Yellow green blue or red.

139
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.450
So going to say OK I'm going to select red assuming obviously there are no.

140
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:11.760
Here are the options.

141
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:18.110
Then go and as you look at the numbers and say okay select number 7 then yawkey all your dreams will

142
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.630
come true.

143
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:19.590
Just be patient.

144
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.020
OK.

145
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.840
That's just one word fortune.

146
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.330
OK.

147
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.120
So let's take a look and see actually if we if that makes sense for us.

148
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.720
So first we select dread.

149
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.950
So that means we skip that portion.

150
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.660
We actually came here and then we're going to select the number we're going to be seven.

151
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.710
They'll be my number here seven.

152
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.070
And all of is true.

153
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.290
Just be patient meta sense.

154
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.820
And then we come down here we ask the user Okay do we need to insert another number or not only keep

155
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.910
playing or not.

156
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.670
And that's way that's why you need to answer.

157
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.010
Okay.

158
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:47.650
Yes.

159
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:54.490
And since you say okay select the column again because here the answer is yes you we came here the wireless

160
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.360
to keep going.

161
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.090
Let's insert for example blue number eight.

162
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.550
And with that you're lucky you would have it all in one day.

163
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.330
So there will be eight.

164
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.930
You're lucky in having all one dick.

165
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.950
When I play again that's a yes.

166
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.270
Let's assume that have you know like a user who doesn't follow the instructions.

167
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.900
All right.

168
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.770
So let's us do you want to select the colours.

169
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:22.790
I'm going to say okay the column is whatever vial it for whatever whatever collocated.

170
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.510
Okay.

171
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.100
These are the only cause that allowed you know.

172
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.730
So basically you went into the sport which is in the in the insert into the collar.

173
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.110
That's not in the in the list.

174
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:33.380
You want to play again.

175
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.550
That's a yes.

176
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.920
Let's select the colours yellow green blue or red or green to say okay let's see is green.

177
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.170
Let's assume the numbers that are allowed only 1 2 5 and 6.

178
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.150
So the user selected let's say three okay.

179
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.410
These are the only numbers allowed.

180
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.060
Do you want to play again or not.

181
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.600
Would simply put here you insist on a number that's not one of the options.

182
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.170
Right.

183
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.390
So again the code is pretty intact.

184
00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:05.090
Persay which means that you can you know to be the user if the user inputs input any value is not within

185
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.020
the options.

186
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.620
You know the game doesn't crash anything's actually and still say it works or say no.

187
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:17.990
Then say okay again you broke the loop here and you're done because you insert insert white on it.

188
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.540
Okay that's pretty much what I have for the section.

189
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.350
I hope you guys enjoyed it and see you in the next part.
