00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,750
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,360
Let's keep going.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,910
And let's continue.

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,610
Questions for till 9:00.

5
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:14,130
OK so here I am asking you to read the file fruits underscored input the text and compare it to the

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,230
list of fruits in my fruit.

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,950
So here I have kind of you know like a list called my fruits has apples pepper orange watermelon tomatoes

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:30,270
and I'm asking you to simply compare this to to my fruits.

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:30,530
Okay.

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,060
In return only matching elements.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,330
All right.

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,190
Let's see how can we do that.

13
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,880
So only matching elements would work.

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:47,950
It's going to say OK with open and let's open our fruits underscore input the text.

15
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,500
Right.

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:58,520
Actually let's do this and we're going to open this for reading purposes and we're going to say as file

17
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:06,220
right and going to say OK let's call it all underscore fruits ricotta Collard fruits collards whatever.

18
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:06,920
Okay.

19
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,040
File dot read lines.

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,430
So he was just going to read our lines in here.

21
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:11,970
Let's run.

22
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,150
That's OK.

23
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:13,810
He looks good.

24
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,730
Let's take a look at all fruits.

25
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,830
Just to make sure we're actually on the same page.

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:18,790
OK.

27
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:19,300
Here we go.

28
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,240
So here we have all the names of fruits.

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,700
And that's kind of the original fight right.

30
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,640
So now to the fun part.

31
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,290
Now we actually need to compare both lists.

32
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,370
Now we have two lists right.

33
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,750
And one to compare the two.

34
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,170
So what we could do here is before doing anything need to remove again the backslash and Rachel can

35
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,830
do the comparison properly.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,500
I say OK.

37
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,000
That's easy so going to say we have done that before and I see all fruits equals two.

38
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,760
Let's go ahead.

39
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,380
Here again do it again.

40
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,510
I'm going to say OK for right let's call it Ward.

41
00:01:50,660 --> 00:02:02,220
So for anywhere if you find any word in all fruits OK so for any word in all fruits of take go to all

42
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:13,730
fruits take every single word and simply take it and strip it remove from it any backslash and all right.

43
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,260
Looks good.

44
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,260
Let's actually make a little bit better.

45
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:17,640
All right.

46
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,850
So let's run that.

47
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,610
Let's take a look.

48
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,970
Let's take a look at all underscored fruits.

49
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,920
And here you go.

50
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,680
So simply here you got rid of all the backslash ends which is good.

51
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,120
Now you can actually do the comparison right.

52
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,110
OK.

53
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,720
Let's do the comparison now.

54
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,690
It's inserting your lines.

55
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,510
And what we could do here.

56
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:34,880
Yes.

57
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,630
OK let's call it selected fruits.

58
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,090
That's kind of the selected fruits.

59
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:41,450
Yes.

60
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:41,800
OK

61
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,740
to say for right.

62
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:56,500
I for example in all fruits so here I'm saying ok for each.

63
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,260
So go to the all fruits elements all the list all the huge list that we have.

64
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,930
Take each fruit right so that fruit is going to be I.

65
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,040
OK we can call it Fruit and fruits for example to make it.

66
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,140
Let me live it meaningful.

67
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,770
Let's do an if condition I'm going to take it.

68
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:18,930
If you find I in my fruits again my fruits is simply the list here that we have that was then provided

69
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,070
in the actual code right.

70
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,500
So he did we provided you with the lists you know what I'm trying to compare what I'm reading here to

71
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,840
this list right.

72
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:34,440
So if you go back here again take it for I in all fruits if you find if that the fruit was equal is

73
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,010
in my fruits if you basically find it.

74
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,250
Well I need that right.

75
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,810
So let's return it let's return.

76
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,020
I am going to be in my selected fruits and that's it.

77
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,940
Let's go ahead and go ahead and print selected underscore fruits.

78
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,250
That's it.

79
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,240
Let's run it.

80
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,060
Let's run it.

81
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,350
And that's what we're getting which makes complete sense why because Apple is actually a fruit.

82
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:00,460
What I meant it was a fruit orange fruit which means that we didn't select the vegetables based within

83
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:07,000
acrylic but we didn't select pepper within select tomatoes and so on all right.

84
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,690
Question number five I'm asking to write a code that takes an input from a user and store it in a new

85
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,390
text file separated by new lines.

86
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:24,310
All right so let's take a sentence from the user first to take a sentence that equals two inputs.

87
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:32,490
And I'm asking the user to enter five names for example of your best friends.

88
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,400
I'm giving him guidance to say okay separated

89
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,570
by a comma.

90
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,600
All right let's run that key.

91
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,680
Ryan let's call it it all like like ly love.

92
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,450
Let's call you know like Joe and call like Frank.

93
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,970
Couple of names press enter.

94
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,260
Let's take a look at the sentence and that's what we're getting here.

95
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,570
These are all the list of names right.

96
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,790
OK so we could do that we can what we wanted to do it's basically just store it in a new text file.

97
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:16,740
So what we could do going a circuit with open and here I called it names out file and called a trial

98
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:26,490
OK the text and I'm going to open this for appending purposes because remember a pen.

99
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,190
I'm just going to like you know move elements to it.

100
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:29,990
Right.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,070
Going to take a for every time I'm going to read the word in my sentence right.

102
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,820
So this is my sentence list right.

103
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,340
OK.

104
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,170
All right.

105
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,250
And sentence and actually like this is not correct.

106
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,580
But bear in mind that skip going to see what's can happen.

107
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:52,910
File dot right and are going to write simply our word every word we're going to be getting.

108
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:58,460
And let's add as well backslash end for a new line simply

109
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,600
OK.

110
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,420
Looks good actually something is still missing.

111
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,700
But let's see what's going to happen.

112
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:11,870
So if you're on that and let's take a look at what we're getting here.

113
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,460
Go back to you should find the file that's name

114
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,190
output names output file trial.

115
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:25,440
Get it open that one and that's what you're getting here.

116
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:30,610
You know what it's looks a little bit weird to have Ryan here and then we have Layla here and then we

117
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,190
have Joe.

118
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,570
It looks like you know it's not it's not what I was expecting right.

119
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:41,170
So actually let's go and add maybe like a couple of lines of code to fix that issue.

120
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,050
So what we could do is say OK let's take that sentence and actually split it.

121
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,720
So we're going to see a sentence that splits.

122
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,610
I'm going to split it based on the comma.

123
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:51,910
All right.

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,170
Let's see how can we do that.

125
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,350
Let's run it.

126
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,090
Oh my apologies.

127
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,450
Let's run it again.

128
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,280
You're going to say OK.

129
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,280
Like Ryan.

130
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:04,970
Lyla let's call it Steve let's call it Joe so it's supposed to be Joe.

131
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,680
But you know what.

132
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,870
Okay that's fine.

133
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,790
And he will split it once you do the splits OK.

134
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,540
What happened is instead of having now we have it is a form of a list.

135
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,250
Right.

136
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:14,970
Which is great.

137
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,020
You don't have it as one.

138
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,670
You know like one as one sentence before we have in one sentence.

139
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:26,400
So when we add backslash n OK we look at every character as an element separate element.

140
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,330
That's why we had you know they are on a single line.

141
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,300
Why in a single line and so on.

142
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,500
But here when we split it now we divided different words.

143
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:34,740
Right.

144
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:43,800
So now we can actually like if we run that's ok and if we go ahead here and check actually have to close

145
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,450
it first.

146
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:54,740
So let's run it again and let's take a look at the file again names I'll file trial.

147
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,310
Actually we didn't close the file.

148
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,740
That's why we're going through this issue at the moment.

149
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,720
Let's let's actually save it in a different file let's call it you know like name file Title of child

150
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,500
2 for instance.

151
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,000
OK.

152
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,180
And

153
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,840
actually it's let's do a sentence that split and we need to put that somewhere right.

154
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,150
So let's put that in sentence on the score lists for example.

155
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,630
And when we do it here's we'll do it on lists.

156
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,390
All right let's run that.

157
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,010
Let's run that and let's take a look at it.

158
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:34,660
So if you take a look at this one now that's what we're getting now it looks perfect.

159
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:34,960
Why.

160
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,240
Because now we divided them into different words and each word basically has been saved separately in

161
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,380
the file.

162
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,880
All right.

163
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:49,690
Question number six I'm asking to read the CSB file S&amp;P 500 stock data and printout of the heading and

164
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,620
first five rows of the data.

165
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:51,910
All right.

166
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:59,170
If you guys remember that was my Excel essentially C as we file if you have interest rates you have

167
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,090
employment and you have S&amp;P 500 price.

168
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,080
What we need to do here is I wanted to print only the heading on its own separate.

169
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,990
I mean I'm asking you to simply

170
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,930
print the first five rows within the file.

171
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,520
Let's see how can we do that.

172
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:15,930
All right.

173
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,800
So what we could do.

174
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:28,050
We're going to say OK here I wanted to import C is V and I'm going to say okay with open and then open

175
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:36,740
our C as we file as follows we going to say OK with open is the fight is called S&amp;P 500 on discourse.

176
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:42,210
Talk underscored data dot c as V.

177
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,140
And we're going to open that for reading purposes.

178
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:51,270
And I say K. that was going to read it as see as V file right.

179
00:09:51,990 --> 00:10:02,250
And all we could do was take reads C as V right equals to C as v dot reader would have done that before

180
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:09,610
we were reading C as he files a c c as we file and we'll get us to say delimiter which is kind of you

181
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,330
know the separators going to separated by comma.

182
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:14,760
All right.

183
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:25,870
And then we're going to see a case talk we'll be equals to lists of my read or read C as V.

184
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,000
All right let's run that looks good.

185
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,090
Let's take a look at this talk and that's our my stock data.

186
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:36,500
So if yes take a look at it you'll find that we have interest rates we have employment I have S&amp;P 500

187
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,710
price looks great and well what I'm asking you to do is I wanted to print the head heading only I wanted

188
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:48,860
to print interest rates employment S&amp;P 500 and afterwards I wanted to print the 5 5 first rows.

189
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,920
Let's see how can we do this.

190
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,220
So to print simply think of it as kind of you know net.

191
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:02,150
Now we have it as illustrates something going to keep print talk and I wanted to get the first element

192
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,370
stock zero once once we do that.

193
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,170
That's it.

194
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,730
We'll get the first simply the first row right.

195
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:08,630
OK.

196
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:14,320
To get the next Rose which is you know rule number one because this is rule number 0 right.

197
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,440
Ask any door number one up until row row number six.

198
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,570
Let's see how can we print that.

199
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:20,460
Yes.

200
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,300
OK I'm going to say

201
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:31,410
let's define for example selected equals to an empty list.

202
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:40,400
Take a for row in stock and we're going to go from one till six because I wanted to print the first

203
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:40,960
five right.

204
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,820
Right.

205
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,170
Mistake every time you see selected Delta Rho also selected dot appends.

206
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,410
And I'm going to append our row that we obtained right.

207
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:55,910
So every time we get the row and appended so that we going to create it in a separate selected one.

208
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,680
Actually it's an invalid syntax.

209
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,780
So something is right or something is wrong sorry.

210
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,920
So here selected equal should be equal to looks good.

211
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:08,200
And if we take a look at selected that would give us our first five elements.

212
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,150
All right looks perfect.

213
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:11,950
All right.

214
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,820
That's pretty much all what I have for this lecture.

215
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,210
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

216
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:20,300
And in the next lecture we're going to keep going and finish off the exercises.

217
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,420
See you guys in the next lecture.
