00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,510
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture and this lecture.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,570
I'm going to walk you through the exercise.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,070
Question for the print end user input.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,830
Right.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:17,370
So the first question that we have here is I'm asking you to write a code that takes the speed input

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,720
from a user in kilometres per hour and converts it into miles per hour and print both speeds to this

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,520
claim.

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,980
Basically here is what I'm showing you is kind of the example we're expecting it to see.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,810
We're expecting to see into speeding Columbus but our let's say the user input 30 for example the program

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:42,950
that we're going to print speed in Colombia put out equals to 30 kilometres an hour and then speed and

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,350
miles per hour equates to 80 miles per hour.

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,020
OK.

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,600
Again this should be pretty much kind of an extension of the exercise that we have done before but now

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,870
because we know how to get data from the user how to print data to this creed we should be experts in

15
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,240
actually doing this and using the print for print as well along with a format method as well.

16
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,350
OK if you guys will be able to figure that out easily.

17
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:13,340
The next question asked me to do is to ask you to print the calendar for the month basically and whatever

18
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,130
months you have.

19
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:14,480
OK.

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,310
So again this is kind of you know extended release which I generally like you know encourage students

21
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:26,660
not to just stick to the course because there are tons of like Python commands and a guy can be covering

22
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:31,280
this because you're like yo I need 500 hours to cover all the Python commands for example.

23
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,070
So here I'm asking you to go ahead and research for example import kelan there.

24
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,670
OK.

25
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:42,150
And I tried to include kind of you know like a like a like a hint here that if you use calendar this

26
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:48,470
month and you pass along the year end the month then you'll be able to clean something like this again.

27
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,070
You guys do your research.

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:58,870
And I want you to come here and just print whatever month whatever you're you you specify OK exemplars

29
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,280
three.

30
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm asking you to expand the code above actually ask the users to enter them in three years or enter

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,260
a year.

32
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:12,090
For example let's say 2019 and then entered a month let's say March for example and then here the.

33
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,340
This would be going to be printed on the screen which is simply the calendar for that specific month.

34
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,000
All right.

35
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,760
Again you be able to use this month to print whatever you want on the screen.

36
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,810
It's very simple just one single comment.

37
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,810
But I want you guys to go and do some research as well to see how you can use the print command and

38
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,310
on with it get it.

39
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:37,050
The next example that we want you to do is I wanted to write a code that takes two integer two integers

40
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:43,430
values from the user and printout the summation along with a multiplication something like this into

41
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,810
any integer number.

42
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,340
Let's say the user input for another number.

43
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:54,120
Letting the user enter it let's say 5 and then the multiplication equals to 20 addition equals to tonight.

44
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,440
That's what I wanted to do.

45
00:02:55,490 --> 00:03:01,340
Again please leverage the format method that we used before to basically print out the summation and

46
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,120
with the addition multiplication sorry along with the addition.

47
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,920
OK.

48
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,270
Right.

49
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:12,050
Question number five I'm asking the user to write a code I you to write a call that takes a value from

50
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:17,340
the user and print out the number the number of square and the number.

51
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,890
Q Something like that.

52
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,930
Enter any integer.

53
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,550
Number two things are in the four and then they going to print the code in their print for 16 and 64.

54
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,110
That's it get.

55
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:32,330
All right question number 6 I'm asking the user to ask Are you sorry to write a code that takes a temperature

56
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,280
input from the user in Celsius and converted to at night.

57
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:40,800
Again the scandium an extension taum I've done before but here this is kind of you know like something

58
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,270
and actions with a user.

59
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:47,760
So I'm asking the user to enter temperatures in degrees Celsius lipsey 30 degrees C and then get a pre

60
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,140
printing out both entries and temperature in Celsius.

61
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:56,030
Were going to be something and then you have to add the grisi afterwards and then temperature in Fahrenheit

62
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,540
is 86 F and then you can actually compared it as well.

63
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:06,970
Let's say by performing a simple Google for example search just to make sure the conversion is pre is

64
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,230
right.

65
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,500
Again you can leverage what we have done before using the equation that we discussed in previous previous

66
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,790
sections or in Question 7.

67
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:23,720
I'm asking to asking you to write a code that takes the length and width of kangol from the user and

68
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,600
prints the area and the premiums.

69
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,710
Again we have done that before but he did just kind of you know a little bit of that action.

70
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:35,600
I'm asking you know the user to enter the wits with you as before and to leontes 5 and then a print

71
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,580
area a quick 20 and deliver it equally.

72
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,300
One last example.

73
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:46,880
I'm asking you to write a code that takes the radius of a circle from a user and print the area they

74
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,710
ammeter and circumference to again try to encode kind of a summary of what we need to do instead of

75
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,840
actually going there and doing your research.

76
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:59,770
So the idea would get to be PI Our Square they emdur is two times R and the circumference is two.

77
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,680
Ah OK.

78
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:07,430
Again the radius of a circle should be used should put three and then you're going to be printing out

79
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,490
Circle diameter to six Circle area.

80
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,060
Is this and then circle the conference.

81
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:13,330
This.

82
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,740
That's all what I wanted to do.

83
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,470
Okay and that's pretty much all of what I have for this section.

84
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,650
Best of luck and hope.

85
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,050
I hope you know you will be able to figure these questions out.

86
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,790
If not if you get stuck Don't worry again.

87
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,980
You know we are still you know giving up all your knowledge.

88
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,280
Please check out the solutions video.

89
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,660
And by that you should be familiar with print and how to get data from the user.

90
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,770
Great job I hope you guys enjoyed it and CEO in the next election.
