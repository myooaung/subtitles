00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,950
Hello everyone and welcome this lecture.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,730
I'm super excited because we're going to start building our conclusionary network and this lecture.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,990
So let's get started.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,620
Please go ahead to the smiling face faces the doctors using CNN ads.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,500
OK.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,730
In the course package.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,420
And let's get started then build our network from scratch.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,550
So here as you can see here we have a series of steps.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,810
First we're going to introduce the problem statement and then step two.

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:37,410
We're going to see can we improve the data visual either data train our model and then evaluate our

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,100
model.

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,300
Ah right okay.

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,120
It's the problem statement.

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,000
Again as we've discussed before in the series lectures that the dealer set contains a series of images

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,660
that can be used to solve what called the happy house problem.

16
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:52,780
Okay.

17
00:00:53,130 --> 00:01:00,030
We can use it to build an artificially network to detect happy or smiling faces only smiling faces will

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,030
be allowed to enter the house and the data set consists of seven hundred and fifty images.

19
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:13,900
Six hundred examples are for training and one fifth the hour for testing and the data source.

20
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,280
All right.

21
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,840
Let's go ahead and import our packages and our data as well.

22
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,430
So what we're going to do here as we have done before.

23
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,620
We're going to import pandas as PD.

24
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:38,780
We're going to import num pie as n.p. and we're going to import maths plus clear thought.

25
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,610
PI plot as.

26
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,350
NY going to import as well import seaboard.

27
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,640
Seaboard's as s.a. and as well.

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,860
We're going to import two important packages too which is going to use them later to call it import

29
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:09,340
each 5 p y which going to be used mainly to read our specific images which is you know kind of stored

30
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,310
in a and reformat I'm going to show you right now.

31
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,180
And then we're going to import it as well.

32
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,840
Our Random form of random number generation.

33
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,670
That's from these gay ran good or good.

34
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,410
Now let's go ahead and let's import our data set.

35
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:33,220
So if you guys go to you the Course package you would find that here there are two datasets we'll call

36
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,500
it test underscored happy dot H H5.

37
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,700
And this train underscored happy.

38
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,160
H five.

39
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,100
All right.

40
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,230
So let's go ahead and read the lead these fights.

41
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,980
First let's see how can we read the keys out of this file.

42
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,990
This is kind of this very special file.

43
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:50,950
Show how can we need it.

44
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,100
It's very simple.

45
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,900
But before we did it let's see how the data within that file is actually classified.

46
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,920
So let's assume they're going to say okay fine I mean equal to.

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,830
We're going to say train underscore happy and let's see Dot H five.

48
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,470
Okay.

49
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:19,340
And let's say okay f equals two he were just reading a file that say okay where do you use H 5 p y dot

50
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,780
file and please make sure that the f is uppercase.

51
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,750
And we're going to pass along the finally an OR get a pass along and open that file for reading purposes.

52
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,390
Okay.

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:31,940
Let's run.

54
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,230
That's Gail looks good.

55
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,430
And I would add the file and the file hugest thing with an F..

56
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:43,340
Let's go ahead and indeed the keys within that files or win a sale key for key in F dot keys.

57
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:50,120
And what are going to say okay let's print out the keys.

58
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,510
So that's one that I'm sure to spend the key because we're just getting key on that.

59
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,850
And that's what we give here.

60
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:03,680
We have got the list classes and he we have team set x and we have train set.

61
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,920
Why.

62
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:12,120
So simply put our team and the squad happy look each 5 which is a training data campaign simply these

63
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,490
you know three we're not interested in just in this one really interesting the input upbeat.

64
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,960
I just wanted to do that mean so we can call them accordingly.

65
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:20,820
Okay.

66
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,460
All right.

67
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,340
Let's see how can we read them.

68
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,830
Miss Let's read again let's open our file.

69
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:36,630
So going to say okay I'm going to call happy underscored training equal to h 5 p y dot file.

70
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,310
And what are going to open our chain underscored.

71
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,470
Happy H fi quality underscore happy thought.

72
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:51,120
H5 and we are going to open this as well for reading purposes right.

73
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,610
And then we're going to do the exact same thing.

74
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,300
Then a copy paste.

75
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,870
I'm going to read that instead of happy training.

76
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,860
You're going to read happy but we're going to keep happy.

77
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,270
Testing and instead of teen.

78
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,080
I'm just happy with is going to be test of discord.

79
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,900
Happy that age 5 again for reading purposes.

80
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,890
Let's run that.

81
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,630
OK you know what.

82
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,130
Good right.

83
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,580
So now we have simco HAPPY training and help testing and what we need to do with it.

84
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,970
We need to go ahead within these two.

85
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,120
Okay and that's why we actually performed this step.

86
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:30,720
We wanted to go ahead and capture or fetch our train and just set X entertain underscore set Y and that's

87
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,940
what we're looking for.

88
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,630
Once we have that then we're good to go.

89
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,170
Then we can simply prepare the data as extreme.

90
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,740
Why train ecstasy and why tests are it.

91
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,770
Let's start with exchange we're going to get say OK extreme sequence to what we wanted to do that we

92
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,370
wanted to get.

93
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:56,760
Extreme whiteread excess weight in an umpire array so we can say okay n p doc array or agreed to call

94
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,940
our happy underscore training which is what we are paying here.

95
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:09,720
Okay but we want it to simply go ahead within this and actually capture team underscore sets and discotheques.

96
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,910
So let's take that.

97
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,470
Let's copy it here and let's do this.

98
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,710
And wanted to get all the data so you can say okay let's go ahead.

99
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,450
Colin indicates we're gonna need all the data within treen said X. Let's do the same thing here.

100
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,020
But we wanted to mr. that extreme.

101
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,990
I'm going to call it ytn.

102
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,850
And again I'm going to go in with an happy training.

103
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,520
Which is here which is our fire that you're in here.

104
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:43,890
But when old painting set in the X women equality and said why are we going to do the exact same thing

105
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,390
but not for training.

106
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,910
We're going to do it for testing.

107
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,070
So we're going to go here with happy.

108
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:50,980
Vesting.

109
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,850
And happy.

110
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,160
Best thing.

111
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,740
I'm going to have extreme tests.

112
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,400
Why tests are right.

113
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,160
Looks good.

114
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,270
Let's sit on it.

115
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,160
Let's stay on it.

116
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,220
Let's try it.

117
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,400
Okay that is an error here.

118
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:11,850
So my apologies.

119
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:18,540
These are called test set X or these so-called tests and these are called testers were strong.

120
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,850
It looks good.

121
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,540
Now we're good now are good to go.

122
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,970
Now we have extreme ytn X test what they're stylistic.

123
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,530
Look and view some of the data so extreme.

124
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,490
Take a look at extreme.

125
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,040
And that's all we've got here.

126
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,760
What do you mean by this.

127
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,980
These are basically a bunch of images that our image if you just remember it when we represent any image

128
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,110
it's simply a bunch of pixels and these pixels has values fridges from 0 to 255.

129
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:49,490
We're zero indicates total black 255 indicates total white.

130
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,380
And these are the values of the pixels.

131
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,670
That's our all our images here.

132
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,540
So basically this is a kind of a little bit dark or black pixel.

133
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,460
This is like kind of a grey pixel.

134
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,130
If you go down here that's you know like let's say that's two hundred and four.

135
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:09,590
That's all kind of very white pixel 255 that's pure white pixel and so on so forth.

136
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,700
OK.

137
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,920
Let's take a look at let's see how many images do we have.

138
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,580
Let's confirm if we actually have 600 knots let's say.

139
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,070
Extreme shape.

140
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,520
Let's run that.

141
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,150
And that's the format.

142
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,970
So now we have 64 by 64 which has dimensions of the pixels.

143
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,300
And because it's a coloured image and it's not a greyscale image.

144
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,740
So you would find the column image actually consists of three layers.

145
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,690
And that's why we have 64 by 64 by three and we actually have 600.

146
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:45,260
It's kind of you know 14 dimensional array in a way where 600 in the kids the number of images we have.

147
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:45,900
Yes that's right.

148
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,180
We have 600 images and there's the format of each specific image.

149
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,830
Let's take a look at why train for the train.

150
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,400
You will come up with this which is basically a bunch of Zoos and once we're zino indicates no smiling

151
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,330
one indicates smiling.

152
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,420
That's it.

153
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,900
Let's confirm the whiteread shape so you can see why train dogs shape they can look at it.

154
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,290
Again it's 600 values which makes sense because that's the opaquely.

155
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,620
Right.

156
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,060
It has only 600 values of from a training perspective.

157
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:22,770
And we have a bunch of zeros and ones corresponding to each of the images that we have in our training

158
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,370
did.

159
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,330
All right.

160
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,450
Let's recap what we have done so far.

161
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,670
Well done so far that we went through the problem statement.

162
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:37,410
We imported all our libraries here and then here we imported all our data into extreme Why treat ecstasy.

163
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Why test.

164
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:44,870
We took a look at the images right and we took a look at the shape as well so now we have 600 images.

165
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:51,390
When it comes to training and we have 150 actual testing and that's pretty much all we have for this

166
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:51,870
lecture.

167
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,580
I hope you guys enjoyed it and see you in the next lecture.
