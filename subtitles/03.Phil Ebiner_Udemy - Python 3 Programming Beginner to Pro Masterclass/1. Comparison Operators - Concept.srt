00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,380
Hello everyone and welcome to this course in the previous section.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:16,120
We learned how to define basic variables how to perform some mathematical operations how to do some

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:22,010
presidents which is you know kind of very important foundation if you're going to start learning programming.

4
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:28,230
And this section we're going to dig a little bit deeper into more a kind of intermediate concepts per

5
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,630
say.

6
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,160
So we're going to cover what we call it the comparison operations.

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,710
So we're gonna cover the comparison operators.

8
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:40,180
We're going to cover what we call it logical operators and we're going to cover condition statements

9
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,730
which is what we call it if else statements.

10
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:42,970
All right.

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,110
OK.

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,880
I'm super excited because this section will going to be kind of the first step to actually start building

13
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,930
kind of professional read world codes in Python.

14
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,020
So let's go ahead and define the.

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,950
What do you mean by comparison operators.

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,890
OK.

17
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:05,110
So when we perform any programming in general what we need to do that we wanted to compare two values

18
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:05,860
with each other.

19
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,410
OK.

20
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,030
So in order to compare two values.

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,790
All right let's say I have two values for example of two two parameters.

22
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:19,200
Let's say A and B for instance and I wanted to compare these two parameters together.

23
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,570
How can I do that comparison.

24
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,180
Let's see.

25
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:28,990
So let's assume that I wanted for example to compare number 15 compared to let's say Number 8.

26
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,220
So he would have number 15.

27
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,880
And I wanted to compare to number eight.

28
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,520
And I wanted to say for example if 15 is greater than eight.

29
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:44,390
So in order to write greater or less than we use basically these kind of operators to do this.

30
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,740
So let's go ahead and run this cell and let's see what's going to happen.

31
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,620
So if we're on the cell you're going to get a feedback or you know pay something to the playback telling

32
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,980
you actually that was true.

33
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:54,970
Yes.

34
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:55,330
Why.

35
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:59,990
Because you are asking kind of you know Python OK is 15 greater than eight.

36
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,320
OK.

37
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,720
So the answer is true.

38
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,680
That's right.

39
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:10,890
That means you actually have done comparison between the value 15 and between the number eight.

40
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,120
All right.

41
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,300
OK let's take a look at another example.

42
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:20,230
Let's assume that I wanted to compare for example five equals greater than for example or equals to

43
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:20,730
five.

44
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:26,260
Just very simple again example if we're done that that would tell me yes that's actually true.

45
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:26,530
Why.

46
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,570
Because I said I asked Python again is five greater than or equal five.

47
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,670
Yes actually five was equals to five.

48
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,340
So again Python replied back and tell you Well that was true.

49
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,630
OK.

50
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,960
And you can actually check pretty much all the operations in here.

51
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,810
So the first operation that's kind of the most important one we're going to be using extensively in

52
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,190
the practical part of the Course is we'll call it equal equal.

53
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,430
OK.

54
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,930
So simply you're comparing two values.

55
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,490
OK.

56
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:59,770
And you are saying if a equals equals B or if a equals b.

57
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,130
All right.

58
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,670
If it's true if that's true then post I'm going to apply back to you tell us.

59
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,610
That was true.

60
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,770
If not it will apply back tell you it was false.

61
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,120
Let's take a look.

62
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,440
So let's say I'm asking is five equals equals to five.

63
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,470
Let's run it shift enter.

64
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,160
That would tell me what.

65
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,200
Well that was true.

66
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,020
Right.

67
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,470
So I'm asking is five equals equals let's say six.

68
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,610
If I run it they'll tell me no.

69
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,410
That was false.

70
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,470
That wasn't right.

71
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,250
OK.

72
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,700
So they think the key important element here is why we don't just he was one equals.

73
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,390
Why did it and say for example five equals two six.

74
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,240
If I do this.

75
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:41,040
Tell me know that well that's not right because one equals sign is what we call it assignment.

76
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,740
That means you are assigning value.

77
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,780
You are copying value from the right hand side into the left hand side.

78
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,650
So if I say let's say x equals to six.

79
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,540
Yes that would work.

80
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:56,230
That means I'm putting six into the parameter x.

81
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,640
If I take a look at X you'll find it X contains six.

82
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,340
Which makes sense right.

83
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:01,610
All right.

84
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:02,870
OK.

85
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:09,130
So in order to perform conditional kind of perform a conditional comparison we use equal equal.

86
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,860
If you wanted to do an assignment which is you know putting value in a specific variable we use just

87
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,370
one single equal.

88
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,860
All right.

89
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,840
So what we could do as well is that we can actually perform comparisons on strings as well.

90
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,470
So let's take a look.

91
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,600
Let's assume that I wanted for example to compare.

92
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,260
Hello.

93
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,710
OK is hello.

94
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,020
Equals equals two.

95
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,900
Hello.

96
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,360
All right let's run that.

97
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,870
Now tell me whether that was true.

98
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,600
OK let's do it again.

99
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,470
Let's say it is Hello equals equals to Hello.

100
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,500
OK.

101
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,960
So please notice the difference here.

102
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,390
So the difference here was one of them was total.

103
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,780
All of them were uppercase.

104
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,760
And here the first letter only was uppercase and all of them were lowercase.

105
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,690
If we're wrong that you will find that the answer is false.

106
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:05,730
Which means when we tried to perform any comparisons on strings we have to make sure that all the letters

107
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,790
are actually the same.

108
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:13,240
Of all of them are uppercase then all of them here has to uppercase in order to get a true answer.

109
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,270
OK.

110
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,030
All right.

111
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,620
One more operator.

112
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,900
Which is what we call it not equal.

113
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:19,900
OK.

114
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,500
So for example if you're competing let's say the value of six and your value of five and you wanted

115
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,880
to compare five and six.

116
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:34,950
What we do is that we use the simply the exclamation mark equal the exclamation mark equals means not

117
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,430
equal.

118
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,160
So here if I'm saying for example is six not equal five.

119
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,130
Well that was true.

120
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:41,640
That's right.

121
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,880
Why.

122
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,940
Because six was actually not equal five.

123
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,740
So again if we press shift enter that will return back true.

124
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:53,860
If I say let's say it's five let's say not equal five.

125
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,220
And if I done that they'll tell me Well that was false.

126
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:56,510
Why.

127
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,260
Because five is actually equal to five.

128
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,130
It's you know when I ask if it's five.

129
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,080
Not equal five.

130
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:02,320
What.

131
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,100
Actually the statement was false.

132
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,620
All right.

133
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:06,370
OK.

134
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:06,900
Sounds great.

135
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,390
So let's go back a bit here to the table.

136
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,460
So again the equal equal that means if you're comparing two values you know like equal to the equal

137
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,140
to each other or not.

138
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,970
Exclamation mark equals.

139
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,940
That means they are not equal.

140
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,880
OK.

141
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:28,320
Here if you wanted to do greater than or less than he had you wanted to do if we are greater than all

142
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,340
right that's less then that's greater than or equal.

143
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,140
And that's less than or equal.

144
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,960
And that's very important comparison operators.

145
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,700
We're going to use them extensively throughout the course and they actually really really interesting

146
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,570
really powerful too.

147
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,770
All right.

148
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,650
Let's take a look at you know kind of a mini challenge.

149
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,360
I'm going to give you two examples.

150
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:53,820
And I'm going to ask you to pause the video and please go ahead and try to do that challenge yourself

151
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,990
without running the code please.

152
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,000
Because if you're on the code you know it doesn't make sense.

153
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,180
I wanted to kind of practice and tell me if you if you get the idea or not hear them saying OK is 15

154
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:16,680
greater than let's say six and is 15 not equals to six and a 15 is equals equals six.

155
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,290
And if 15 is less than or equal to six.

156
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:21,700
All right.

157
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,360
Please go ahead and pause a video and just you know guess what the answer should be on all of these

158
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,220
four conditions.

159
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,950
All right.

160
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:35,420
We're going to see you after the challenge.

161
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,120
All right.

162
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,980
I hope you guys were able to figure out the challenge again without running the code.

163
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,410
So here 15 is 15 greater than six.

164
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,460
Well that was true.

165
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:50,220
So the answer I'm expecting was actually two is 15 not equals to six.

166
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,600
Well that was actually true as well.

167
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,970
Right.

168
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,960
So here 15 was not equal to six.

169
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,150
That was true is 15 equals to six.

170
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,480
Well that was false.

171
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,750
That doesn't make sense.

172
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,100
It's 15 less than or equal six.

173
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,570
That was false as well.

174
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,200
All right.

175
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,950
Let's make sure that our answers are true.

176
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,180
So can I go here to the cell.

177
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,730
Please shift enter shift enter shift enter shift enter.

178
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,560
And that's what we're getting we're getting true true false false.

179
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,670
All right looks great.

180
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:21,850
OK.

181
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,710
And that's pretty much all what I have for the for the first section.

182
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,750
Let's go ahead and recap what we have done so far.

183
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,540
So here we have just quickly covered what we called the comparison operators which is can be used to

184
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,870
compare two variables together.

185
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,630
If you're comparing you know that values wanted to compare if they are equal.

186
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:47,130
And please remember they are equal equal not equal greater than or less than greater than less than

187
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,680
greater than or equal or less than or equal.

188
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,400
And again the answer might be true or false depending on the condition.

189
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,560
And one important thing as well regarding the strings you need to make sure when you're comparing two

190
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,120
strings together is that all the letters have to match so that all of them are lowercase here.

191
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,750
All of them have to be lowercase.

192
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:11,030
If he had all of them are lower case here one of them for example is just upper case then the answer

193
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,130
is going to be false right away.

194
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,390
All right.

195
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,160
I hope you guys enjoyed that lecture and see you in the next lecture.
