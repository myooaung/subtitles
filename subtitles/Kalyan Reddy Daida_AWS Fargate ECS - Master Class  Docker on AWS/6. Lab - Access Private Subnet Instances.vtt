00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.870
In this lecture, I will show you how we can access our instances, which is running on private subnet
1

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.110
from the instance which is running on public subnet.
2

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.270
So here you can see I have 3 instances.
3

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.930
2 are running on private and one is running on the public instance.
4

5
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.550
So I have already logged into my this instance, which is on public subnet.
5

6
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.940
So let me select any one of the instance.
6

7
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.480
So here you can see this is my instance, which is on private subnet.
7

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.310
So this instance is only having the private IP.
8

9
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.620
So let me copy this IP.
9

10
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.160
So here you have to give SSH EC2-user.
10

11
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.790
So this is a default user @ the IP address.
11

12
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.190
So here I'm getting permission denied because you have to provide the private key.
12

13
00:00:48.210 --> 00:01:00.540
So the key which we had selected was this one ECS-demo testing-kp, So just copy this key and
13

14
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.130
come back to your instance.
14

15
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.370
And here you have to create a file.
15

16
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.090
You can give any name and paste your private key.
16

17
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.400
So without this key, you won't able to access your instance.
17

18
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.470
Now I'm going to fire the same command, and here you have to specify the key.
18

19
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.270
So and before to fire this command, make sure the permission.
19

20
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:33.650
So permission of the key it should be 400 and then fire this command ssh -i key.pem.
20

21
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:42.060
EC2-user @ IP so IP is 10.0.0.54.
21

22
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.120
So here you can see I'm able to access my instance which is on private subnet.
22

23
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.520
Now exit and let's see what is the IP of my another instance.
23

24
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.400
So this is the IP copy coming back and same command.
24

25
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.930
And here you have to specify the IP.
25

26
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.130
Now you can see that I'm able to access my another instance.
26

27
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.700
Suppose if you are still not able to access your instances, then what would be your troubleshooting
27

28
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.650
steps?
28

29
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.510
So obviously you have to look for the security group.
29

30
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.690
So select any one of the instance because the security group I have selected that is common for both
30

31
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.790
the instances.
31

32
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.940
So you can have different security group as well.
32

33
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:43.190
But at the creation of the cluster, I have chosen the default security group, so just check whether this SSH
33

34
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.140
port is allowed or not.
34

35
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.650
So click on your security group, which is assigned to your instances, your private instances, and
35

36
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.930
check for the rules.
36

37
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.910
So here you can see the SSH is enabled if it is not enabled.
37

38
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.390
So we just need to edit the inbound rules and from there you just need to add the SSH port.
38

39
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.610
So that's all we'll see you in the next lecture.
