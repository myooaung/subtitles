Hi.
1

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.640
Let's continue.
2

3
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:11.310
So let me first click on clusters and here we have this Fargate demo cluster and you can see we have
3

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.380
one service which is already defined.
4

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.500
So let me create one more service.
5

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.300
Let me click on this task already having 2 tasks which I had created in the previous lectures.
6

7
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.110
So simply let me add one task from here.
7

8
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.610
Run new task.
8

9
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.970
And launch type.
9

10
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.390
I want.
10

11
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.800
It should be Fargate because my cluster is Fargate operating system Linux.
11

12
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.600
And here you can see I have task definition.
12

13
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.860
Earlier it was showing only one task that is first run task definition.
13

14
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.290
Now you can see it is showing 2 task.
14

15
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.260
So this task I had created in the previous lecture.
15

16
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.640
So let me select this one.
16

17
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.840
And this is my platform version, I want this task should be the part of this cluster.
17

18
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.030
Fargate demo cluster number of tasks I want.
18

19
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.210
It should be running 1 and VPC.
19

20
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.390
I want it should be my VPC subnets here.
20

21
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.640
I'm going to select public.
21

22
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.720
Else you can select all the subnets.
22

23
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.840
No worries for that.
23

24
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.380
In the subnets, you have to select all the subnets.
24

25
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.730
But here I am choosing only the public because it's a testing one only.
25

26
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.390
And security groups.
26

27
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.730
I have already having one security.
27

28
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.250
So let me choose this one.
28

29
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:46.530
So in this security group, I have allowed few ports like HTTP, https, 80, and after that I'm going
29

30
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.880
to run task.
30

31
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.380
So this task has been successfully added to this cluster.
31

32
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.800
So once you will add the task to the cluster, then only it would be executed.
32

33
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.770
Now you can see it is in provisioning.
33

34
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.040
State means it is in creation.
34

35
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.050
And this is the task ID.
35

36
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.050
Now all are running.
36

37
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.930
So my task was this one.
37

38
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.610
This one.
38

39
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.170
And.
39

40
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.700
This is the IP.
40

41
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.230
Let me copy this IP.
41

42
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.240
And pasted here, now you can see it is opening the page.
42

43
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.530
We have defined 80 port while configuring the tasks.
43

44
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.420
That's why we are not suppose to provide 80.
44

45
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.110
If I would have taken 81, then I have to provide after that / app1.
45

46
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.420
Inside this we have index dot.
46

47
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.520
html, so here you can see.
47

48
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.340
So I've taken all the options to explain you.
48

49
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.900
So this is one way.
49

50
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.540
In the next lecture, I'm going to create a service, and in the service I'm going to take this task.
50

51
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.420
So that's all we'll see you in the next lecture.
