00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.860
In this lecture, I'm going to discuss how to access your instances, which is running on private subnets.
1

2
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.900
So at the time of creation of cluster, we had chosen 2 instances and also we selected private subnets.
2

3
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.520
So the instances for the cluster has been started on the private subnet only.
3

4
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:28.260
And also we know that there is no Internet connectivity or public IP in the instances which is running
4

5
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.730
on private subnet.
5

6
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:37.170
So in later lectures, I'm going to create my containers on the instances which is on the private subnet.
6

7
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.570
So how to access those instances.
7

8
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.390
So this is what we are going to learn in this lecture.
8

9
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.180
So first of all, we need one instance.
9

10
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.720
It should be running on the public subnet because in our VPC we have two public and two private.
10

11
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.570
So first of all, I'm going to create one instance, and that instance would be the part of your public
11

12
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.380
subnet.
12

13
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.130
So if you want to access your private subnet instances, first you have to log into the instance which
13

14
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.230
is running on the public subnet.
14

15
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.500
And then from that instance, you can easily log into your private subnet instances.
15

16
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.280
So let me show you practically.
16

17
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.890
So first of all, I'm going to launch an instance and let me take any Linux instance.
17

18
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.980
I'm okay with t2 micro.
18

19
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.290
Let's configure the instance details.
19

20
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.570
So number of instances 1 and here under the network I'm going to choose this VPC and this time the
20

21
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.480
subnet I'm going to choose the public one.
21

22
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:47.850
Here we have this public one and the auto assigned public IP, let me put it enabled and everything.
22

23
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:56.550
I'm taking default review and launch launch and it is asking for the key pair.
23

24
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.530
So I'm going to choose this one.
24

25
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.020
So same key pair I have chosen for my instances which is running on the private subnet.
25

26
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.880
I have just given instance public.
26

27
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.510
And this is the public IP.
27

28
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.480
So let me use the MobaXterm to access this system.
28

29
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.120
Click on session and click on SSH Remote Host.
29

30
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.730
Here you have to put the public IP and specify your username EC2-user and then click on advance.
30

31
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.270
SSH settings use private key and browse your private key.
31

32
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.700
So I had selected this one.
32

33
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.150
ECS demo key okay.
33

34
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.120
So here you can see I'm able to access my instance, which is running on public subnet.
34

35
00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.390
So in the next lecture, I will show you how we can access my private instance from that public instance.
35

36
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.100
So that's all we'll see you in the next lecture.
