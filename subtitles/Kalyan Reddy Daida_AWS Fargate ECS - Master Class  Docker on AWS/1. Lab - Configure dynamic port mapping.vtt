1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.240
So you can see 2 tasks are running.
1

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:12.390
So let me stop both of them and then click on task definition and create new task definition EC2
2

3
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.690
next step.
3

4
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.650
And here you have to give the task definition name.
4

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.610
I'm giving nginx demo testing.
5

6
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:35.200
I'm giving number 1 and task role.
6

7
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.500
I'm giving the default one.
7

8
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.400
And here I'm going to choose the bridge and this one.
8

9
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.560
And for task size, it's optional with the EC2.
9

10
00:00:48.860 --> 00:01:04.040
So let me directly click on Add Containers and here I'm giving nginx Web Server Demo 1 and nginx
10

11
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.080
Latest.
11

12
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.890
And this time I'm only choosing the soft limit and I'm giving 250.
12

13
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.560
Now the next is port mapping.
13

14
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.340
So that's very important if you are doing the dynamic port mapping.
14

15
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.710
So for host port, that is your EC2 instance here you have to give 0.
15

16
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.090
And the container port here I'm giving 80  because I know that my nginx web server runs on port number
16

17
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.130
80 and make sure the host port should be 0.
17

18
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.720
So what will happen here once you assign this task to the cluster?
18

19
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:50.270
Automatically it will assign one random port to the host port specifically to the container.
19

20
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:58.430
So here say for example, I have 2 container and let me come back to this PPT and try to explain here.
20

21
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.690
So here I have chosen dynamic port mapping, so I know that my nginx is running on port number 80, 80.
21

22
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.920
So here this container is running on port 80 and another container is also running on port number 80.
22

23
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.590
And we have chosen the dynamic port mapping.
23

24
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.670
So what will happen?
24

25
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.650
Allocate the random port to your host port.
25

26
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:29.030
So once the request is coming from the application load balancer and if will hit to the host port,
26

27
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:38.990
then it will come to that this port which has given randomly to the host, it will map to which container.
27

28
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.930
So here you need not to worry about all these things because this is going to be managed by your ECS cluster.
28

29
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:53.390
So here you just need to give 0 and 80 and then click on add and create.
29

30
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.210
So your task has been created.
30

31
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.520
Come back to your cluster and click on this EC2 Linux Cluster Demo task.
31

32
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.420
And create.
32

33
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.910
Click on run new task EC2.
33

34
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:23.550
And this one nginx demo testing 1 and this time I'm choosing 4 and task group.
34

35
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.910
1, I'm giving.
35

36
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.080
And then finally click on run task.
36

37
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.350
And here you can see all the task has been created this time.
37

38
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.960
Earlier we were getting the errors and coming back to my this task.
38

39
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.650
Now here you can see all of my 4 tasks is started running on this cluster.
39

40
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.720
And
40

41
00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:01.140
here you can see it has given you all the details and all my 4 tasks is running.
41

42
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.890
Click on this ECS instances and here you can see this the running task.
42

43
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:18.270
It is showing 2 or 2 and coming back to my this instance and here let me go first inside any one
43

44
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.290
of the instance.
44

45
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.570
Okay I'm on my this instance and Docker container.
45

46
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:34.610
ls, So I'm getting some output and here you can see it has given you the port as well.
46

47
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:42.170
So 49154 is the host port which has been mapped to the 80 port of your container.
47

48
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.790
And this is the detail about my another container because we have 2 containers on each, EC2 instance.
48

49
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:57.140
So this is the host port of the another container and this has been redirected to 80.
49

50
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.130
Now coming back to this PPT.
50

51
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:07.520
So here, if the request is coming from the application load balancer and if it hits to the host port
51

52
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.480
of 49158 port, it will take you to the port number 80.
52

53
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.200
So that's all for this lecture.
53

54
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.900
In the next lecture, I will discuss more about it.
