00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.370
In this lecture, I will discuss about the creation of clustering step by step.
1

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.680
So let me tell you one more time.
2

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.060
So that's a very easy way for the cluster creation.
3

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.560
And here they have provided you a diagram and we have four steps here.
4

5
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.590
The cluster definition, task definition service.
5

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.170
And finally, you are going to create a cluster.
6

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.520
But here I'm going to show you that cluster creation is step by step.
7

8
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.170
Or we can say in details for that you just need to click on Create Cluster.
8

9
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.430
Now here we have 3 types of cluster template.
9

10
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.010
The first one is your networking only.
10

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.040
Second is your EC2 Linux + networking.
11

12
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.130
And third one, which has been introduced recently, that is EC2 Windows + networking.
12

13
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.150
So first we'll discuss about the networking only.
13

14
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.470
So here are the resources to be created.
14

15
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.450
Cluster VPC optional.
15

16
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.470
Subnet optional.
16

17
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.410
So this is for the AWS.
17

18
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.290
Fargate.
18

19
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.380
It means the infrastructure for this cluster is completely managed by the AWS.
19

20
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.560
Suppose you have created few tasks for this cluster.
20

21
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.180
And those tasks are being managed by the service.
21

22
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.140
So obviously at the back end there would be some EC2 instance, it could be Linux or Windows, whatever,
22

23
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.620
but for us those servers would not be visible.
23

24
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.580
We are not able to access those instances because those instances would be completely managed by the
24

25
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.810
AWS team.
25

26
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.080
And the second one is your EC2 Linux + networking.
26

27
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.420
So if you're going to choose this option, the instances for the cluster would be created.
27

28
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.200
And as a system admin, you can access those instances and manage according to your requirement.
28

29
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.450
And here we have EC2 windows.
29

30
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.390
So here the instances would be created on Windows platform and here this is for the Linux platform.
30

31
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.810
So let me go with this networking only and it's for the AWS Fargate and click on Next Step.
31

32
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.600
Cluster name I'm giving Fargate demo cluster.
32

33
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.550
And this time I'm not going to create a VPC.
33

34
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:19.350
So here, VPC, we all know that VPC is an isolated portion of the AWS cloud populated by AWS objects such
34

35
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.640
as Fargate task, so let me go all defaults here.
35

36
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.340
I'm going to enable container insights so that you want to check any logs related with the cluster.
36

37
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.840
You can check it from the cloud.
37

38
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.230
Watch, let me click on create and here you can see immediately my cluster has been created and this
38

39
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.510
cluster is completely empty.
39

40
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:48.270
And here you can see this cluster state is provisioning and after some time its state would be active.
40

41
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.420
So provisioning means it is in creation state and here we have a number of tasks.
41

42
00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.600
The first one is your service and the service there is nothing because we have not defined any service
42

43
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.560
task.
43

44
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.940
In the task you can see nothing is there ECS instances.
44

45
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.030
So here we know that this is a Fargate type cluster.
45

46
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:17.610
So ECS instance, so here you won't see any instances because this is a Fargate type cluster and if
46

47
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:24.930
there would be any instances, so that would be completely managed by the AWS and we do not have access
47

48
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.930
to those instances in the matrix.
48

49
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.050
We have an option to see the CPU utilization, memory utilization, so we can check it.
49

50
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.870
These utilization from here schedule task.
50

51
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.450
You can also schedule any task from here.
51

52
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.910
Tags, you can define the Tags, and the last option is capacity provider.
52

53
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.740
So this option will only see with the Fargate that is networking only.
53

54
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.080
And here we have 2 types.
54

55
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.290
The first one is your Fargate and the second one is your spot.
55

56
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.770
So basically this is the type of your instances.
56

57
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.340
So we know that whenever we are going to create an instance at that time, we have an option like you
57

58
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.430
want instance as a on demand or spot.
58

59
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.790
So basically it is for the costing purpose.
59

60
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.520
So here you have an option to choose.
60

61
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.290
But when you are going to create the EC2 Linux type cluster, then you will have this option at the
61

62
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.310
initial level.
62

63
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.790
I will show you once I'm going to create the cluster and the cluster type would be your EC2 Linux.
63

64
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.600
And in the interview they can ask you the capacity provider option would be visible with which cluster.
64

65
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.700
So here you can see it will be visible only with the networking only cluster type.
65

66
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.830
So here you can see my status is active.
66

67
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.140
It means my cluster is in running state.
67

68
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:53.190
The next is I have to create a task and with the help of task I'm going to create my container.
68

69
00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:01.080
So first of all, I need the Docker image and that Docker image I'm going to run as a container using
69

70
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.040
this task.
70

71
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.940
So that's all.
71

72
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.690
In the next lecture, I will show you how we can create a task from here.
