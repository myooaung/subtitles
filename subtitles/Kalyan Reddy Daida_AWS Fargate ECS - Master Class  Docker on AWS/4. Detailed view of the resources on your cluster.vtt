00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.900
So here you can see my cluster has been created.
1

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.990
So let me go inside this cluster and see its configuration.
2

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.350
Now you can see its status is active,  registered container instances 2.
3

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.650
So it means that there are 2 instances has been configured for this cluster or in simple words we
4

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.100
can say there are 2 instances in which we can run our containers under service tab.
5

6
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.190
There is nothing because it's a newly created cluster.
6

7
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.490
Also, same as for task, there is nothing.
7

8
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.040
Let me click on ECS instances.
8

9
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:46.200
So here you can see 2 instances showing and both the instances are running in separate subnets and
9

10
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.460
it is in active.
10

11
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.280
You can also cross-check from the EC2 service here.
11

12
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.800
You can see it is showing here as well.
12

13
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.290
And these are my instances and let me choose anyone.
13

14
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:10.640
Now you can see this is the private IP address and there is no public IP because we have created the
14

15
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.190
instance in the private subnet.
15

16
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.420
That's why it doesn't have the public IP address.
16

17
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.330
So this is one thing.
17

18
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.370
Let me go back to my this figure.
18

19
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:27.290
So what we have done so we have created the VPC and while creating the VPC, we have chosen 2 private
19

20
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.820
and 2 public.
20

21
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.950
Now, at the time of creation of cluster, we have chosen the EC2 Linux type.
21

22
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:42.380
And at that time we have chosen 2 instances and also we have chosen only the private subnet.
22

23
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:49.280
So in result, what happened 2 instances has been created and both the instances are running in private
23

24
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.780
subnet.
24

25
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.090
One instance is running in this private subnet and another instance is running into another subnet.
25

26
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:03.620
And if you want to log into this private subnet instances, so first you have to create one instance
26

27
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:10.760
in your public subnet and you can log into that instance and from that you can log into your private
27

28
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.150
subnet.
28

29
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.630
No worries.
29

30
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.860
I will show you practically.
30

31
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.570
So that's all we'll see you in the next lecture.
