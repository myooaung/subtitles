00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.930
Let's continue.
1

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:07.680
So this is my image, which is on the ECR, Amazon Elastic Container Registry, which is nothing.
2

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.490
It's a repository and just copy the URL and come back to your Amazon ECS.
3

4
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.770
And here I was trying to create a task.
4

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.780
So this is the let me cross this one and come back here and here I was trying to create a task.
5

6
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:32.310
I have provided all the information and let me click on add container.
6

7
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:47.460
Container name is nginx container demo and let me paste the image URL and let me go with all default
7

8
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.900
and port mapping, let me put 80 here and here we have option for health check environment.
8

9
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.100
So let me go with all default options and finally let me click on add.
9

10
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:11.550
So here you can see this container has been added and here you can see we have many more options, service
10

11
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.710
integration, proxy configuration.
11

12
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.120
So as of now, I'm okay with all default options and click on create.
12

13
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.750
So here you can see my this task has been created.
13

14
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.540
Let me show you this one.
14

15
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.250
So this task has been created.
15

16
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.950
But this task has not assigned to any cluster yet.
16

17
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.410
So this task is just an ideal.
17

18
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.740
At the back end, it is not running any container.
18

19
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.670
Once you assign this task to any cluster, then only your container would be started.
19

20
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.990
So that's all for this lecture.
20

21
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.220
In the next lecture, I'm going to assign this task to the cluster.
