Hi.
1

2
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.760
So let's start our lab session.
2

3
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.810
So very first step.
3

4
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.510
I'm going to create my own VPC.
4

5
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.810
So this is my AWS management console.
5

6
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.090
I'm already in the VPC dashboard and just click on your VPC.
6

7
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.100
So as of now, you can see there is only one VPC and that is the default one.
7

8
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.150
So let me create one more VPC for my this ECS cluster.
8

9
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.730
Okay.
9

10
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.640
Now choose this option, VPC and more.
10

11
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.850
Now it will ask for information from you.
11

12
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.920
So it is asking the name.
12

13
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.930
So name of your VPC.
13

14
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.730
So I'm just putting project.
14

15
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.970
ECS.
15

16
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.930
VPC.
16

17
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.510
New and CIDR.
17

18
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.810
BLOCK So this is the CIDR BLOCK.
18

19
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.490
10.0.0.0/ 26.
19

20
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.590
And we want to IPv6 CIDR block then here you can choose.
20

21
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:12.140
So let me go with the default option here and number of availability zones I want 2 and how many
21

22
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.330
public subnets you want.
22

23
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.950
I want 2 public and 2 private.
23

24
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.300
This is my requirement.
24

25
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.230
You can customize what all the availability zones you want.
25

26
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.340
So I have chosen this one and this one.
26

27
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.540
So in Mumbai zone there are 3 availability zones.
27

28
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:35.600
So out of 3 I have chosen these 2 and let me customize the subnet CIDR BLOCK So this is the public
28

29
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.140
subnet.
29

30
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:44.380
So the CIDR block, which I have to choose for my public subnet is this 10 .0.0.0/ 28.
30

31
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.920
And for this, another public subnet, we have this one.
31

32
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.410
So what were the default CIDR block?
32

33
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.460
It is showing I have chosen the same as well.
33

34
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.810
So for private subnet, you have to choose this one and you can see by default it is taking the same
34

35
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.530
CIDR block.
35

36
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.300
So that would be easy for you.
36

37
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.610
So after that, you want the net gateway?
37

38
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.330
Yes, I want one net gateway.
38

39
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.170
If you have not chosen the net gateway.
39

40
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.730
So what will happen when you are configuring the cluster?
40

41
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.870
You will start getting the error.
41

42
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.190
So make sure when you create the VPC, the net gateway should be there.
42

43
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.440
If you are going to launch your container or instances in the private subnets, if you are going to
43

44
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.160
launch your EC2 instances in the public subnet, then it's okay.
44

45
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.410
But if you want to choose your instances, that would be the part of your private subnets, then net
45

46
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.880
gateway is mandatory.
46

47
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.770
So here you can see the details.
47

48
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.430
Everything seems fine and let me create my VPC.
48

49
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.430
So it will take some time for the creation of this VPC.
49

50
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.950
So here it is just on this step wait NAT gateway to activate.
50

51
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.460
So friends that's all for this lecture, we'll continue from the next lecture.
