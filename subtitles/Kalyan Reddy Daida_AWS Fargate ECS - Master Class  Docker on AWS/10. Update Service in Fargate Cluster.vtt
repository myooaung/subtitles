00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.360
So in this lecture I'm going to do some changes in the service and let's see what will happen.
1

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:19.260
So let me click on my cluster and here we have this service and let me click on update.
2

3
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.620
So here I'm going to change the platform version from 1.4. 0 to 1 .3.0.
3

4
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.710
And these are the details for the task which is going to manage my this service and 2 task.
4

5
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.000
Next, next, next.
5

6
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.630
And finally, update service.
6

7
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.600
If I'll click on that, will it create the new task for this service or will it do the changes on the existing
7

8
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.190
task?
8

9
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.010
So let's see.
9

10
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.950
So in this service already having 2 tasks, let me refresh it.
10

11
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.100
Now you can see that 2 more tasks has been started for this service.
11

12
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.350
Earlier there were only 2 tasks.
12

13
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.950
We have done some changes in the service.
13

14
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.330
We have just changed the platform version.
14

15
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.240
So once you update the service, it is not going to touch your existing task.
15

16
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.780
Your existing task will be running as it is.
16

17
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.360
It will create a new task for you.
17

18
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:41.580
Suppose you are satisfied with the new task and you feel that now.
18

19
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.770
This is my new version of the task, which is running fine.
19

20
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.340
I do not need my previous task.
20

21
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.280
Then you can click on those tasks and remove it.
21

22
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.770
So here you can see we have lot of advantages with the container running using the AWS ECS.
22

23
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.630
So that's all we'll see you in the next lecture.
