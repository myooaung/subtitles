1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.960
So here you can see my VPC has been created for this ECS cluster and you can view the VPC.
1

2
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.530
So this is the name of my VPC and subnets.
2

3
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.190
Now you can see 4 subnets has been created 2 are private and 2 are public.
3

4
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.660
So here you can see in the name the public and private it is showing.
4

5
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.130
So you can co-relate which one is private and which one is public.
5

6
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.910
And click on NAT Gateway.
6

7
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.490
So here you can see one NAT Gateway is also configured with this VPC.
7

8
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.610
Now coming to my this Amazon ECS cluster and I'm going to create my cluster.
8

9
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:53.010
So just click on create cluster and this time I'm going to choose EC2 Linux + networking and click
9

10
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.720
on Next Step.
10

11
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.300
Now it is asking few information to configure your cluster.
11

12
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.280
The cluster name.
12

13
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:07.040
I'm giving EC2 Linux Cluster Demo.
13

14
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.550
You can give any name according to your requirement instance configuration.
14

15
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.560
So once this cluster would be created at the back end, there would be the instances.
15

16
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.870
So what provisioning model you want on demand, instance or spot?
16

17
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.140
So let me go with the default one on demand instance EC2 instance type.
17

18
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.640
So let me go with this one t2 micro.
18

19
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.530
I'm okay with that t2.micro and a number of instances.
19

20
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.730
How many instances you want.
20

21
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.780
Suppose I want 2 instances and EC2.
21

22
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.490
AMI ID  So let me go with the Amazon Linux 2 and the root EBS volume size.
22

23
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.220
So by default it has taken 30 GB.
23

24
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.500
So I'm okay with that key pair.
24

25
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.510
So I'm already having the key pair, so let me choose that one.
25

26
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.600
So ECS demo testing.
26

27
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.990
KP So this is the key pair I'm going to use to connect with my instances.
27

28
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.030
Now coming to the networking part now.
28

29
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.430
VPC So I'm going to choose the VPC, which I have created subnets.
29

30
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.580
So let me go back to my PPT.
30

31
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.780
So for this ECS cluster, I'm going to choose the private subnets only.
31

32
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.800
So this is the public one.
32

33
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.310
This is also public.
33

34
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.710
This is the private here.
34

35
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.240
You can see with the name.
35

36
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.820
Let me choose one more private.
36

37
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.410
Okay fine.
37

38
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.980
And auto assign public IP.
38

39
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.130
So you want any public IP?
39

40
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.330
I would say no.
40

41
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.460
So this is my private subnet.
41

42
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.570
I want.
42

43
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.550
My environment should be secure.
43

44
00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.290
Security group.
44

45
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.660
So you can choose a default one or you can choose the one which you have created earlier.
45

46
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.790
So let me go with the default one and at later stage you can modify the security group.
46

47
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.810
And the next is container instance IAM role.
47

48
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.220
So that's very important.
48

49
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.490
So let me try to explain what basically this telling.
49

50
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:28.910
So basically when you create this instances so your instances by default one agent would be their ECS
50

51
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:29.570
agent.
51

52
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.300
The agent would be running on all the EC2 instances which you are going to create for your cluster.
52

53
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.540
For this cluster, I'm going to choose 2 instances.
53

54
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:46.610
So 2 instances would be running in your private subnet with ECS agent running on both the instances
54

55
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.840
right now.
55

56
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.860
What is this role?
56

57
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:56.480
So for AWS if one service, if they want to communicate with another service, it requires role.
57

58
00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.170
So here, this is my cluster which I'm going to create.
58

59
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.550
So this entire cluster is going to manage by the ECS service.
59

60
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:12.080
So if your ECS service, if they want to communicate for the instances of your cluster, it requires
60

61
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.980
some role.
61

62
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.190
So here you have to create the role for that.
62

63
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.550
So by default it is going to create this role.
63

64
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:27.770
So basically suppose your ECS cluster, if they want to create some containers on the EC2 instances,
64

65
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:34.280
suppose if they want to create or delete some containers from any particular instances, so such type
65

66
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.330
of communication but only possible if we have that role.
66

67
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.700
So that's why we need the role for that.
67

68
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.900
And if you want, you can give the tag as well and  cloud watch container insights.
68

69
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.410
If you want to enable the cloud watch container insights, you can tick on that and just finally click
69

70
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.370
on Create.
70

71
00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:05.960
Now here you can see your cluster is started creating and you can see that at the bottom auto scaling
71

72
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.820
group is also creating.
72

73
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:17.480
So here basically desired number of instances would be 2 and this desired number of instances is
73

74
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.300
going to be maintained by your auto scaling group.
74

75
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:29.630
If in case one instance is down, your auto scale is going to create one more instance for this cluster.
75

76
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.490
So that's all for this lecture.
76

77
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.100
In the next lecture, I will discuss more about it.
