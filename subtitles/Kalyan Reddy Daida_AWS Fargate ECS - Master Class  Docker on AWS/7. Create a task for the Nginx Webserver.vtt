00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.160
In this lecture, I'm going to create a task from the task definition.
1

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.200
And that task is nothing, a very simple task that is the nginx web server.
2

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.410
And then I'm going to assign the task to my cluster, which I have created in the previous lecture.
3

4
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.660
So in simple word, a task definition is required to run Docker container in Amazon ECS, so let's do
4

5
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.620
it practically.
5

6
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.790
So here you can see this is my cluster which I had created, and here we have 2 instances which is
6

7
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.170
assigned to this cluster.
7

8
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.320
Now I'm going to create a task from the task definition.
8

9
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.510
So let me click on task definitions.
9

10
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.210
And then click on Create New Task Definition.
10

11
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.860
And then select EC2 and then click Next Step.
11

12
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.570
Here.
12

13
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.540
You have to provide few information to configure your task and container definition first.
13

14
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.860
Task Definition Name.
14

15
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.990
I'm giving nginx.
15

16
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.340
Web server demo.
16

17
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.610
Requires compatibility EC2.
17

18
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.400
And next is task role.
18

19
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.010
Here it is showing to option none.
19

20
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.240
And also you can see it has created one task role by default.
20

21
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.920
So let me take an example.
21

22
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:31.500
Suppose I have created a container of nginx web server and my web server is trying to write something
22

23
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.530
on the S3 bucket or Dynamo DB.
23

24
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.390
So I've just taken an example.
24

25
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.050
So here, if one service, if they want to communicate with another service of the AWS, it requires
25

26
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.400
the IAM role.
26

27
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.770
So according to your requirement, you can create a role and assign it here.
27

28
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.110
The next is network mode.
28

29
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.400
So that's very important.
29

30
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.670
So here you can see we have a number of options, bridge host, AWS VPC and none.
30

31
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:07.710
If you'll remember when we had created AWS Fargate at that time we were having only one network mode that
31

32
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.630
was AWS VPC.
32

33
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.640
But if you have chosen EC2 launch type, you have number of options.
33

34
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.740
So in most cases, only bridge network is used.
34

35
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.460
So what is this bridge network?
35

36
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.410
So let me try to explain this as well.
36

37
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.580
So here you can see this is my private subnet.
37

38
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.710
And in this private subnet, we have one EC2 instance.
38

39
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.990
So what is Bridge Network port?
39

40
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.820
So in simple words, we can say it is the mapping between the host port to the container port.
40

41
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.850
So what is host port here?
41

42
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.380
If I'll say host port, it means your EC2 instance in which we are having the containers.
42

43
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.420
So here you can see we have 2 containers running on this host machine.
43

44
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.910
That is an EC2 instance.
44

45
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:03.480
So the mapping between the host port to the container port is called the bridge networking mode.
45

46
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.370
I will show you practically so.
46

47
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.790
No worries.
47

48
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.890
So coming back here, the next is task execution role.
48

49
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.090
So here I'm going to choose the one which is already there and the next is very important.
49

50
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.240
That is the task size.
50

51
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.410
So that's all in the next lecture we'll discuss about the task size.
