00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:07.530
In this lecture, I'm going to assign the task which I have created in the previous lecture to my cluster,
1

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.680
EC2-Linux cluster-demo.
2

3
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.560
So let me click on my this cluster.
3

4
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.800
And then click on the task.
4

5
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.720
And then click run new task.
5

6
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.880
Launch type, I'm going to use EC2 and task definition, this one nginx-web server,
6

7
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:44.710
-demo and this task I want it should be running for this cluster and number of tasks.
7

8
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.400
So here I have given 2 tasks.
8

9
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.470
So what does it mean?
9

10
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.220
It means 2 containers would be running on your EC2 instances.
10

11
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.590
So let me come back to my this PPT.
11

12
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.590
So what will happen?
12

13
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.420
One container would be running in one instance of the private subnet and one container would be running
13

14
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.420
in the another instance of the private subnet.
14

15
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.070
And here suppose I have given number 4.
15

16
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.750
So what will happen here?
16

17
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:24.460
So as I told you that we have chosen the simple bridge network mode and we have not defined the Dynamic
17

18
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.230
Bridge Network mode.
18

19
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.880
So it will only support 1 to 1 mapping.
19

20
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:39.070
But suppose we have 2 containers and both the containers are running on port number 80 as we have
20

21
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.180
given the port mapping.
21

22
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:47.950
If will remember in the last lecture we have given, the host port is 80 and the container port is also
22

23
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.510
80.
23

24
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:58.990
So in that case, 2 container would be running in each of my instances and both the containers is
24

25
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.510
running on port number 80 and it will try to map to the 80 port of the host.
25

26
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.730
So which is not possible with the bridge network.
26

27
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.220
For that you have to use the bridge network, but you have to use that dynamic.
27

28
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.710
I will discuss this in the later lectures.
28

29
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.070
So here suppose if you have given 4, so here suppose if you have given 4 you will start getting
29

30
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.760
errors.
30

31
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:29.170
So there are only 2 instances and hence first 2 containers will take away the 2 ports 80 on these
31

32
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.620
instances, the next 2 containers would not get the required port from the EC2 instance.
32

33
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.300
So I'm choosing 2 here and task group.
33

34
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:50.620
You can give any name, I'm giving this one and all default scroll down and run task.
34

35
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.110
So here you can see create a task successfully.
35

36
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.210
So that's all for this lecture.
36

37
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.240
In the next lecture, I'm going to log into both of my instances and I will show you the containers
37

38
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.920
running on the instances.
