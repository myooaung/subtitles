00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.670
So here we have to create a target group.
1

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:12.000
So let me click on that and it will take you into this service, EC2 service, and it has taken
2

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.270
you to the page of your target group and basic configuration and let me choose a target type instances
3

4
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.310
and target group.
4

5
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.590
I'm giving any name tg Cluster EC2 and protocol 80.
5

6
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.490
I'm okay with that and this is my VPC.
6

7
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.650
Next click on next.
7

8
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.470
And here you can see it is showing all the instances.
8

9
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.500
I'm not going to register any targets as of now.
9

10
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.120
And also, I'm going to delete this target group as well.
10

11
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.910
I will show you.
11

12
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.510
So this target group has been created.
12

13
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.080
And now let me refresh it.
13

14
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.110
So it is important to create the target group, because without the target group, it won't allow you
14

15
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.890
to create the application load balancer.
15

16
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.760
So I've just created a target group, that's all.
16

17
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.190
And click on Create Load Balancer.
17

18
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.940
View load balancer.
18

19
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.750
Now my load balancer is in provisioning state and it will take 5 to 10 minutes for the creation of this
19

20
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.170
one.
20

21
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:33.190
And once this will be created, I'm going to delete the listeners as well as the target group, which
21

22
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.490
I have chosen at the time of creation of this application load balancer, and once I'm going to create
22

23
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.840
a service in the ECS cluster at that time, I'm going to define this application load balancer and
23

24
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.660
also will define the listener as well as the target group.
24

25
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.860
So no worries on that.
25

26
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.880
So let's see, what is the status?
26

27
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.610
So still it is in provisioning state.
27

28
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:10.130
Let me come to my this ECS and here we have my cluster and 2 instances are running.
28

29
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.050
Coming back to this EC2 service.
29

30
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.000
And we have 3 instances.
30

31
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.900
So 2 instances were created when I had created my cluster.
31

32
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.310
And one instance I have created in the public subnet.
32

33
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.170
So let me show you with this figure.
33

34
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.500
So in this public subnet, I have created one instance so that I can access my private subnet instances
34

35
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.440
through this instance, which is in the public subnet.
35

36
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.870
Here I can show you.
36

37
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.560
So these instances I have.
37

38
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.800
Now here you can see my this application load balancer is in active state.
38

39
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.180
So that's all for this lecture.
39

40
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.530
In the next lecture, I'm going to create a service and then I'm going to define this application load
40

41
00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.100
balancer.
