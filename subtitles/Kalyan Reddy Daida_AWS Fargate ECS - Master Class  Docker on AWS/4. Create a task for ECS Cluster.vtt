Hi.
1

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.500
So let's continue.
2

3
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:09.690
So as of now, we have created our cluster and we have 2 instances in the cluster and both are running
3

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.130
in the private subnet.
4

5
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.430
We have also created our application load balancer.
5

6
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.890
Now let's start doing the rest part.
6

7
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.390
So coming back here, click on this application load balancer.
7

8
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.600
And under task definition, I'm going to create a new task.
8

9
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.820
Launch type EC2 next step.
9

10
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.880
And task definition name I'm giving.
10

11
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.110
nginx web application.
11

12
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.550
And here I'm giving.
12

13
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:57.440
20 number and this is the task role and this under network mode, I'm going to choose bridge task execution
13

14
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.440
role, the one which is already created.
14

15
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.240
I'm going to choose that one.
15

16
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.730
And then click on this add container, container name.
16

17
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.840
I'm giving this.
17

18
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:19.400
nginx web app 20, image I'm giving nginx and I want latest.
18

19
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.040
And this time I'm going to choose soft limit and I'm giving 400.
19

20
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.530
And port mapping.
20

21
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.930
I want dynamic port mapping.
21

22
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.350
So that's why I've chosen 0 here and 80 and then click on ADD.
22

23
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.350
And finally, I'm going to take all default options.
23

24
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.800
So my this task has been created.
24

25
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.650
And here you can see under this task definition.
25

26
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.450
So friends that's all for this lecture.
26

27
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.150
In the next lecture, I'm going to create a service.
27

28
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.120
And in the service, I'm going to define this task.
