00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.720
So in this lecture, I'm going to create a service, and in the service I'm going to define a task.
1

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:14.520
So this is my cluster, and here we have a tab for services and I'm going to click on Create.
2

3
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:26.070
A new window will be open and it is asking to configure your service or launch type.
3

4
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:34.540
I will go with the Fargate operating system Linux and again I'm going to choose the same task because
4

5
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.150
as of now I'm having only one task.
5

6
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.240
This is first run task definition and the platform you can choose anyone.
6

7
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.410
Let me choose this one.
7

8
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.260
And the cluster obviously I want this service should be the part of my this cluster.
8

9
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.880
Fargate demo cluster and then you have to give the service name.
9

10
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.970
Let me give Fargate.
10

11
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.340
Service demo new and the next is service type.
11

12
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:18.480
So here by default it has taken replica and replica service place and maintain a desired number of tasks
12

13
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:26.940
across your cluster daemon services place and maintain one copy of your task on each container instance.
13

14
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.330
If a capacity provider strategy is used, the daemon service type is not supported.
14

15
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.670
And how many task you want to run?
15

16
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.830
Suppose I want 2 tasks.
16

17
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.960
So here we have some option for the health minimum health percent.
17

18
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.980
I have to add 100 here and this is basically provides a lower limit on the number of running tasks during
18

19
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.200
a deployment enabling you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity.
19

20
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.450
So as of now, I'm not going in detail with that.
20

21
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.190
Just go with the default option.
21

22
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.690
And here we have this deployment.
22

23
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.180
So I'm going with rolling update.
23

24
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:15.060
It means if something goes wrong, it will roll back and simply click on next step and it is asking
24

25
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.100
to choose the VPC.
25

26
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.540
So this is my VPC and here I'm choosing all the subnets.
26

27
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.520
So let me choose a subnet for the public.
27

28
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.710
Only when you will do the practice.
28

29
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.470
You can choose all of the subnets and security group which I have already created.
29

30
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.960
So, so let me choose the service group which I had created manually.
30

31
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.370
And here we have this load balancing.
31

32
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.090
So we'll discuss about load balancing in a separate class.
32

33
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.950
So let me go with the none and click on next step auto scaling.
33

34
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.280
So as of now, I do not want to add auto scaling here.
34

35
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.740
So let me go with the default option.
35

36
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.490
Now it has given you the review here we have all the options like cluster type, launch type and your
36

37
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.150
VPC.
37

38
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.480
Everything it has mentioned, just click on Create Service.
38

39
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.430
Now your service is created.
39

40
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.290
Let me click on View Service.
40

41
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.430
So I've just created a service and this service is basically for this cluster.
41

42
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:32.940
And in that service I have defined the task and this service is going to monitor this task.
42

43
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:41.940
So let me click on task and here you will see that 2 task is started showing here, but it is in pending
43

44
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.480
state.
44

45
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.890
Just keep on refreshing why it is showing 2 because I had chosen 2 task at the time of creation of
45

46
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:50.700
the service.
46

47
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.760
Now my both of my task is in running state.
47

48
00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:02.730
Let me click on any one of them and this is the public IP copy and just paste it here.
48

49
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.930
Now you can see I'm getting the output and coming back here.
49

50
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.220
This is my cluster.
50

51
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.910
Now.
51

52
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.270
This time my task has been created Via this service.
52

53
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.070
Suppose if I'll select any one of the tasks and let me stop this one.
53

54
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.730
But here my task is being managed by the service.
54

55
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.750
Service is keep on monitoring all the tasks.
55

56
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.810
So it will check and it will come to know that this particular task is in stop state.
56

57
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.790
So what this service will do?
57

58
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.160
It is going to create one more task.
58

59
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.810
Let me keep on refreshing.
59

60
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.610
Here you can see immediately it has created a new task.
60

61
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.850
And as of now, you can see it is in pending state.
61

62
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.380
After some time it would be in running state.
62

63
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.080
Now you can see both of my task is in running state.
63

64
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.370
So this service is maintaining the task.
64

65
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.620
So that's all we'll see you in the next lecture.
