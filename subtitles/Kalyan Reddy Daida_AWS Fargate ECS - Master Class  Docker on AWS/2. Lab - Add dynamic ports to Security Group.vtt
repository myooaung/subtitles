Hi.
1

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.830
Let's continue.
2

3
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.170
So this is my cluster.
3

4
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.460
Let me click on that.
4

5
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.170
And under task, you can see we have 4 tasks.
5

6
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.690
And this time I have used dynamic port mapping.
6

7
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.450
So let me click any one of the tasks.
7

8
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.320
And these are the details here we have and click on the container instance.
8

9
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.050
And here we have got the IP of my EC2 instance.
9

10
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.850
So let me log into that system ssh -.
10

11
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.730
i,  this is my key gen EC2-user @ this IP.
11

12
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.750
So I'm able to access my system docker container ls.
12

13
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.310
So here we have got some output.
13

14
00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.750
So here you can see we have 2 container running on this instance and this is the host port which has
14

15
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.280
been mapped to 80.
15

16
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:10.290
So randomly your system has given one port to your host machine that is your EC2 instance.
16

17
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.240
And that port has been mapped to port number 80 of one of their container.
17

18
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:23.370
Like this way we have another random port that is 49154 and which has been mapped to 80 of the another
18

19
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.150
container.
19

20
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.910
So let me go to the security group of my this EC2 instance.
20

21
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.840
And click on edit inbound rules add rule.
21

22
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.060
And here I'm going to add both the port 49154.
22

23
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.270
49153 and then save rules.
23

24
00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.770
Now that's done coming back here.
24

25
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.710
And.
25

26
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.260
Exit.
26

27
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:22.750
And here I'm just using elinks and the IP of the system that is your this one 10 .0. 0.36 : and this
27

28
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.030
is the port host port.
28

29
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:33.940
So in simple words, the request is coming from the application load balancer and it will hit to the
29

30
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.480
host port on this 49153.
30

31
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:45.310
And then the request will forward to the specific container because your system knows that this particular
31

32
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.960
port has been mapped to which port of the container.
32

33
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.350
80 port of which container.
33

34
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.900
Let's see, I'm getting output, I'm getting some output perfect and same command.
34

35
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.360
But here I have to give the another port.
35

36
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.430
I'm getting some output instead of this port I'm giving any other port.
36

37
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.410
I will not get any output.
37

38
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.870
So I believe with this exercise you got the idea about dynamic port mapping.
38

39
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.640
So that's all we'll see you in the next lecture.
