So.
2

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.070
So this time I'm going to choose my another instance.
3

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:20.280
This is the private I.P copy coming back here ssh -i,  key .pem EC2-user
4

5
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:32.130
and this is the IP now I'm able to access to my another instance and let me elevate my privilege.
5

6
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.460
Docker docker container ls.
6

7
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.680
Here we have 2 containers, so let me log into my first container docker.
7

8
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:55.640
Execute -it, now this is my first container and bin bash.
8

9
00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.990
Okay.
9

10
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.570
USR share.
10

11
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.970
So let me remove this one index . html and.
11

12
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.120
This is my third container.
12

13
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.340
For instance.
13

14
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.010
2.
14

15
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.150
Exit, Docker container ls.
15

16
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.160
Let me choose the container id of my another container.
16

17
00:01:51.550 --> 00:02:04.840
Usr share nginx html rm this one remove cat index . html.
17

18
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.620
Container 004, for instance.
18

19
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.710
02, So in each instance, we have 2 containers.
19

20
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.300
Okay, let me come out from here.
20

21
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.960
Now come to my this web page.
21

22
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.200
Let me refresh it.
22

23
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.860
Now here you can see the application load balancer is distributing the request equally to all the containers.
