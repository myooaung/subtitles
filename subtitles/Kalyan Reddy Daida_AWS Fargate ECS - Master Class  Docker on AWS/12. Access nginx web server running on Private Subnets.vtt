In this lecture, I will show you how to access your nginx web server, which is running on your private subnet
1

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.460
instances.
2

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:18.030
So you just need the IP and here you can see the instance is only having the private IP address so you
3

4
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.550
won't able to access your instances from the Internet.
4

5
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.070
So what you can do here.
5

6
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.660
So you can just log in to your public subnet.
6

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.300
So this is my public subnet and here just type curl and give the IP.
7

8
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.240
And let's see whether I'm getting the output or not.
8

9
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.930
So it is not working.
9

10
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.490
So the reason is you have to go to the security group and click on this security group.
10

11
00:00:50.490 --> 00:01:03.300
So this security group is assigned to both of my instances and edit inbound rules and select HTTP and
11

12
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.970
giving everyone.
12

13
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.350
And save.
13

14
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.480
Coming back here.
14

15
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.880
Let me re-fire this command.
15

16
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.340
And here you can see I'm getting some output.
16

17
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.670
You can also check with the elinks.
17

18
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.780
So let's see, we have the links.
18

19
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.070
So, yum.
19

20
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.180
Install elinks.
20

21
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.780
And here the same command.
21

22
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.790
But you have to use the elinks.
22

23
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.500
And you can see that this page is opening here.
23

24
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.750
So what's the IP of my another system?
24

25
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.060
So let me cross-check.
25

26
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.390
What's the private IP of my another instance?
26

27
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.550
Okay.
27

28
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:08.880
I've just copied IP address and E links and this one you can see it is working fine.
28

29
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.830
So that's all we'll see you in the next lecture.
