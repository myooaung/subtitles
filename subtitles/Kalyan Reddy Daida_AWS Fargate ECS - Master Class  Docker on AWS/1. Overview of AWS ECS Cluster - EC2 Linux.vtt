Hi.
1

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.980
In this section I'm going to discuss about the ECS cluster and the cluster template I'm going to
2

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.870
use is EC2 Linux + networking here you can see in the PPT.
3

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.160
So basically this is your EC2 launch type in which I will show you how to configure and deploy EC,
4

5
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.300
2 instances in your cluster to run your containers.
5

6
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:32.310
In the previous lectures we understood about the AWS Fargate type, but in this entire section I will focus
6

7
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.830
on the EC2 launch type.
7

8
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.120
So let's understand what exactly I'm going to perform in this section.
8

9
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:47.160
So here you can see I have created one diagram and here you can see at the outer layer we have the AW.
9

10
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.460
S in which I'm going to choose my own region.
10

11
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.110
Suppose I'm going to perform this lab in the Mumbai region.
11

12
00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.990
So very first step, I have to choose the region and second step I'm going to create my own.
12

13
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.460
VPC So here you can see this is my VPC, CIDR address.
13

14
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:13.560
And inside this VPC, I'm going to create 4 subnets, 2 private and 2 public, and you can see
14

15
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.350
the CIDR address of each subnet.
15

16
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.330
So this entire lab, I'm going to perform in the private subnet.
16

17
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.960
So basically when I'm going to create my cluster at that time, I'm going to choose the instances.
17

18
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.300
So where those instances would be created for the cluster.
18

19
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.660
So that time I'm going to choose the private subnet.
19

20
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.520
So in the lab I will show you once my cluster would be created at the back end, we would be having
20

21
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:50.290
the instances and my requirement is that my instances should be running on the private subnet.
21

22
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.230
So this is one thing and here you can see we have to configure the net as well.
22

23
00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.780
So basically if you have any critical application and you want, it should be running in the private
23

24
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.560
subnet.
24

25
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:10.300
But suppose if in case you need some Internet connectivity, so you're going to place the net gateway
25

26
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.610
on your public subnet.
26

27
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:22.420
So if there is no net, the ECS agent which is running on the instances would not be able to talk to your
27

28
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.580
AWS ECS service.
28

29
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.790
So here, just keep in mind that suppose you have created 2 instances and while creating the instances
29

30
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.360
or while creating the cluster, I have chosen only private subnets.
30

31
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.320
So obviously the instances that would be created for the cluster that would be created inside the private
31

32
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.190
subnets.
32

33
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:53.380
So once the instances would be created, one agent that is your ECS agent would automatically created
33

34
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.440
or install on each of the instances.
34

35
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.880
Now the question is what is the use of this ECS agent which is running on the EC2 instances?
35

36
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:12.640
Basically this is your entire cluster and your ECS service is going to manage this infrastructure.
36

37
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.750
So how the ECS service is going to communicate with the EC2 instances in which we have to run
37

38
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.680
the containers for that it requires one agent.
38

39
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.710
So that agent is nothing is your.
39

40
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.650
It is your ECS agent which is running on the EC2 instances.
40

41
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.710
So you have to just keep in mind that the instances are running in the private subnet and each instances
41

42
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.780
there is one ECS agent.
42

43
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.230
And also once you create the cluster, it would be providing the auto scaling group as well.
43

44
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.930
Suppose you have chosen 2 instances at the time of creation of your cluster, so 2 instances would
44

45
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:50.800
be created.
45

46
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:58.240
But suppose if in case one instance is terminated by N number of reason, so your auto scaling group
46

47
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.400
is monitoring all your instances.
47

48
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.920
If any one of your instances goes down immediately, it is going to create a new instance for your cluster.
48

49
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.960
So auto scaling is going to maintain the number of desired instances.
49

50
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.580
So that's all for this lecture.
50

51
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.770
In the next lecture, we'll understand more about it.
