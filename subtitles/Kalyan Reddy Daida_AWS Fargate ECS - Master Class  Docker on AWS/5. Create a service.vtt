00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.850
So let me click on clusters.
1

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:13.710
And this is my cluster and this cluster is having 2 registered container instances here.
2

3
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.730
You can see now let me click on services and click on Create.
3

4
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.320
Launch type EC2 and task definition.
4

5
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.200
I'm going to choose this one nginx web application 20.
5

6
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:37.870
So this task I had created in my previous lecture, and this is the cluster and service name you can
6

7
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:46.600
give any name, let me give nginx service demo 20.
7

8
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.070
So number of tasks here, I'm going to define 4.
8

9
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:59.890
So what will happen is going to create 2 containers of nginx web application in this private subnet and
9

10
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.740
2 containers is going to be created into the another instance of the private subnet.
10

11
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.080
So here it has taken few health percentage by default.
11

12
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.480
So take it all default and click on next step.
12

13
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.000
And here you can see it is providing you all the options for the load balancing.
13

14
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.810
So let me go with the application load balancer and here I'm going to choose service.
14

15
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.750
IAM default and this is my application load balancer.
15

16
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.000
So coming back to this EC2 instance and let me click on my this load balancer, this is my application
16

17
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.750
load balancer.
17

18
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.690
Click on this listener and I'm going to delete this listener from here.
18

19
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:58.030
So here you can see I have deleted the listener from here and I will define the listener from ECS cluster.
19

20
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.670
And also I'm going to delete the target groups.
20

21
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.650
Now we have only the application load balancer.
21

22
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.200
Now, let me refresh it.
22

23
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.470
Now, under this application load balancer, you have to first define the service IAM role.
23

24
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.970
So I've taken the default one and the load balancer name.
24

25
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.860
I have taken this one and this container to load balance.
25

26
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.720
So container name and port.
26

27
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.130
So click on add to load balancer and what port you want.
27

28
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.320
Your application load balancer should listen.
28

29
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.490
I'm putting 80.
29

30
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.750
So I had removed the listener from the application load balancer.
30

31
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.550
So I'm defining the same from here.
31

32
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.390
And so this is the target group.
32

33
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.490
So I already deleted my target group.
33

34
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.070
So I want a new target group should be created.
34

35
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.480
So what will happen?
35

36
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.620
This is going to create a target group and it is going to register all the containers in this target
36

37
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.170
group as a registered instances.
37

38
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.420
Next step.
38

39
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.810
So here we have an option for auto scaling.
39

40
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.060
So I'm not going to discuss auto scaling.
40

41
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.250
As of now, click on next step.
41

42
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:28.780
So it will provide you a review so you can check the review and finally create service.
42

43
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:42.320
So first, it has created your target group and also it has created the listener.
43

44
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.620
And finally, you can see it has created the service.
44

45
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.540
So that's all we'll see you in the next lecture.
