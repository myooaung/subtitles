00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.170
Let's continue.
1

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.460
So let me tell you something more about the bridge network.
2

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:12.030
So we know that Bridge Network mode is basically the mapping between the host port to the container
3

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.810
port.
4

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:22.210
And here it is very important to know that for bridge network mode 1 to 1 mapping is only possible.
5

6
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.520
So what does it mean?
6

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:32.340
So here, this is my EC2 instance, which is running on the private subnet and this  EC2 instance
7

8
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.600
is my host.
8

9
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.560
And suppose I have created one container.
9

10
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:45.600
Only one container is running inside this EC2 instance and this container is safe, for example,
10

11
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.470
its nginx web server, and which runs on port number 80.
11

12
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.800
So with the bridge network mode, I have mapped the 80 port of my this EC2 instance to the container
12

13
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.200
on port number 80.
13

14
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.300
So this 1 to 1 mapping is possible.
14

15
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.620
But suppose you have 2 container which is running on the same EC2 instance and both the container
15

16
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:19.770
suppose it's an nginx web server and both are running on the same port 80, 80 or suppose 81 or 82.
16

17
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.570
But if you want to map both the containers port to the same port on the EC2 instance, that is a
17

18
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.060
host port, that is not possible.
18

19
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.740
Let me tell you one more time here.
19

20
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:40.470
Suppose my host port I have chosen 80 and both the container which runs on same port or different port
20

21
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.630
81, 82.
21

22
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:50.070
And if you want to map both 81 or 82 port of the container to the same port of the host port 80 then
22

23
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.020
it is not possible for that.
23

24
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.680
You have to apply the dynamic bridge networking port I will discuss in the later lecture.
24

25
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.690
So here for the testing purpose, I'm going to create only one container inside the EC2 instance.
25

26
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.320
So that's all.
26

27
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.570
We'll discuss more on that in the next lecture.
