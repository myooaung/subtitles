Hi.
1

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.920
Let's continue and do some more practice with the cluster.
2

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.180
So let me click on this cluster and click on task.
3

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.120
So as of now, you can see there is no task because what ever the tasks we're running?
4

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.010
I have stopped all of them.
5

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.400
Now let me click on this run new task.
6

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.500
And launch type is EC2 task definition.
7

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.560
I'm going to choose the same task.
8

9
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.420
And this is my cluster.
9

10
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.650
But this time, I'm going to choose 4 tasks.
10

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.700
It means 4 containers would be running for this cluster.
11

12
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.680
And we have 2 instances.
12

13
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.730
So 2 containers would be running in each instances.
13

14
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.950
And here you have to give the task group, you can give any name.
14

15
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.590
And finally, you have to click on run task.
15

16
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.020
So before to click on run task.
16

17
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.330
Let me come back to my this PPT and let me try to explain you the bridge network mode.
17

18
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.640
So bridge networking mode is basically the mapping of host port to the container port.
18

19
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.180
And there is one limitation with the bridge networking mode that is it allows only 1 to 1 mapping.
19

20
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.990
But here you can see I have run 4 task.
20

21
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.380
It means 2 containers would be running in each instances.
21

22
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.490
So here, both the task or both the containers are the nginx, which runs on port number 80.
22

23
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.790
And also we have defined the host port is 80.
23

24
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.920
If you'll remember in the previous lecture, we had defined 80 port here.
24

25
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.300
One host port is trying to align with 2 nginx container on the same port 80, 80.
25

26
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.130
So which is not allowed with the bridge networking mode and you will start getting errors.
26

27
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.180
So let me show you.
27

28
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.090
Let me click on run task and see what the output.
28

29
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.240
So here you can see it has created only 2 tasks and some tasks failed because of the reason.
29

30
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:16.170
So just click on the task and here you can see 2 tasks are running and 2 task is in stopped state,
30

31
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.750
although we had defined 4 tasks.
31

32
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.460
So what is the solution for that?
32

33
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.570
So the solution is dynamic port mapping.
33

34
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.980
So that's all for this lecture.
34

35
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.660
In the next lecture, I'm going to do the dynamic port mapping so that you can run number of containers
35

36
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.430
in your EC2 instances.
36

37
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.660
So that's all we'll see you in the next.
