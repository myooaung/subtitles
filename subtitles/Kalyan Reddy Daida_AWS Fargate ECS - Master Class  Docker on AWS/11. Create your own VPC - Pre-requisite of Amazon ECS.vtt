00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:07.920
In this lab session, I will discuss how to create your own VPC Virtual Private Cloud, which is a
1

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.350
prerequisite of Amazon ECS.
2

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.220
So when you create the Amazon ECS cluster at that time, it will ask you an option to create a new VPC.
3

4
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.660
If you are already having a VPC, you can choose your own VPC.
4

5
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.990
So first we'll understand how to create a VPC and then I will move towards the Amazon ECS.
5

6
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.820
So I have given all the details.
6

7
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.320
Here we have the VPC.
7

8
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.510
You can choose the same CIDR block in your lab session as well.
8

9
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.680
I'm going to attach the same PPT with the course module for your reference, so let's do it practically.
9

10
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.730
So I'm on this ECS click on cluster and create cluster.
10

11
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.410
Here we have 3 options.
11

12
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.000
The first one is the networking.
12

13
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.130
Only here the VPC is optional.
13

14
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:05.100
But suppose if you are going with this EC2 Linux + networking and click next and here you have
14

15
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.420
to provide all the details.
15

16
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.120
Scroll down in the networking section.
16

17
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.650
Here we have the VPC and you can see it is asking you to create a new VPC.
17

18
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.170
So first I will show you how to create the VPC.
18

19
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.150
So just go to the VPC service.
19

20
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.910
And your VPC.
20

21
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.150
As of now, you can see I have only one VPC.
21

22
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.780
This is the default VPC.
22

23
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.250
And you can see I'm on this reason Asia Pacific Mumbai.
23

24
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.460
And in this reason we have 3 availability zones.
24

25
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.310
So let me create a VPC here.
25

26
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.950
We have the new way for the creation of VPC.
26

27
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.250
We have 2 options VPC only and VPC more.
27

28
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.110
So let me go with that second option.
28

29
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:56.070
So first of all, you have to provide the name ECS- Project and this is the CIDR block.
29

30
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.090
I'm okay with that.
30

31
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:06.090
And let me scroll down IP version 6 if you want, you can select this one as well, tenancy default.
31

32
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.060
And here you can see what are the changes I'm doing on the left hand side?
32

33
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.670
It is reflecting in a graphical way.
33

34
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.670
So this is the best way you can understand the VPC.
34

35
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.490
This is my VPC here we have 4 subnets, so let me choose the subnets as well.
35

36
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.310
So first of all, you have to choose the availability zone.
36

37
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.020
So in Mumbai reason we have 3 availability zones, but I want only 2 availability zone for this
37

38
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.740
VPC.
38

39
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.720
So select on this 2.
39

40
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.680
You can also customize what all the availability zones you want.
40

41
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.060
So I'm okay with that and number of public subnets I want 2 public subnets and 2 private subnets
41

42
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.970
and you can also customize the subnet CIDR block.
42

43
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.910
So this is the public subnet.
43

44
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:54.900
I'm okay with that.
44

45
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.260
Let me cross-check with this diagram 10.0.
45

46
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.010
This one.
46

47
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.770
And here we have 24.
47

48
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.810
This is my.
48

49
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:10.430
30.
49

50
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.480
And this is 24.
50

51
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.310
This is 20, I believe.
51

52
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.340
This is 30.
52

53
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.490
24.
53

54
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.620
And this is 40.0/24.
54

55
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.640
Perfect.
55

56
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.440
And everything seems fine okay.
56

57
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.800
Now scroll down.
57

58
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.620
We have an option for the net gateway.
58

59
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:53.370
So basically this net gateway is to provide the Internet connectivity to the private subnet.
59

60
00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:00.550
Suppose if you want to execute a container and important container or we can say a production container
60

61
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.040
in a some secure environment.
61

62
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:10.030
Then you can choose the net gateway so that you can execute your container in the private subnet, so
62

63
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.680
you can choose one subnet.
63

64
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:19.990
But it would be the chargeable basis and this is for IPv6 and I'm going with the none scroll down
64

65
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.840
and let me create the VPC so you can see my VPC started creating.
65

66
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.590
It won't take much time coming back to my PPT.
66

67
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.110
So once you create the VPC, one Internet gateway will be created automatically, the route tables will
67

68
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.780
be created, it will associate it with the public subnet to the main route table.
68

69
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.350
So if you have chosen the net gateway, so it will associate the private route to the main route table.
69

70
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.350
And you also need to create one security group as well.
70

71
00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:00.640
And from there you have to allow these services, so it is being created.
71

72
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.630
So let me go to this EC2.
72

73
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.270
This is my EC2 dashboard.
73

74
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.250
And here we have this security group.
74

75
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.510
Let me scroll down.
75

76
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.440
Create security group and name.
76

77
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.370
You can give any name.
77

78
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.990
I'm choosing ECS project.
78

79
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.630
Security group.
79

80
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.410
In the description, I'm giving the same VPC.
80

81
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.590
So my VPC, you can see that this VPC has been created.
81

82
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.060
So I want this security group should be the part of this VPC.
82

83
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.540
So I have chosen this VPC, which I have created just now.
83

84
00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.590
And inbound rules, I'm going to add few rules here.
84

85
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.370
SSH, I want to allow for everyone and for web.
85

86
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.790
Traffic.
86

87
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:17.390
I want this http and I want to allow from anywhere.
87

88
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.440
Let me take this https as well.
88

89
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:34.030
So as of now, I'm taking only these services and allowing from the inbound rules and let me save and
89

90
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.690
come out.
90

91
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.360
So this will create my security group.
91

92
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:44.500
So this security group has been created and also aligned with my this VPC.
92

93
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.860
So let's see my this VPC has been created or not.
93

94
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:55.540
So again, coming back to my this VPC dashboard and let's see how many VPCs are showing.
94

95
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.610
Now you can see we have 2 VPC's it is showing here.
95

96
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.640
This is the VPC, which I have created.
96

97
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:08.790
This is the VPC ID.
97

98
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.060
And here we have all the details.
98

99
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:29.070
And if will click on the subnets, it is started showing 4 new subnets 1, 2, 3, 4 and
99

100
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.020
the subnets started with ECS.
100

101
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.220
So it means these subnets belongs to your VPC, which you have created.
101

102
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:40.200
So 2 subnets that belong to public and 2 subnets belong to private.
102

103
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.020
And let's see the NAT gateway.
103

104
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:52.560
It has created one NAT gateway as well, this one, and we have not selected this one.
104

105
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.630
So it has not created the egress.
105

106
00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:04.580
So here you can see it has created one route table as well and which is associated with the 2 subnets.
106

107
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.940
So these 2 subnets basically belongs to your.
107

108
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.150
Let me show the association subnets.
108

109
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.530
Here, you can see.
109

110
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.970
So these subnets belong to the public.
110

111
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:19.970
So that's all for this lecture.
111

112
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.230
In the next lecture, I'm going to create my Amazon ECS cluster.
