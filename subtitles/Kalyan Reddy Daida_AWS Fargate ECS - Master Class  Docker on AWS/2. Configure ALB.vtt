00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.620
So let's start our lab.
1

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.490
So, first of all, I'm going to create a cluster.
2

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.910
So click on this ECS and create cluster.
3

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.730
I'm going to choose EC2 Linux + networking.
4

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.590
Next step.
5

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.660
And I'm giving this cluster EC2 demo and EC2 instance type.
6

7
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.250
I'm giving t2 micro and number of instances I want.
7

8
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.960
It should be 2 and key pair.
8

9
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.790
This is my key pair and I've already created one.
9

10
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.260
VPC So this is my VPC and subnet.
10

11
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.780
I'm going to choose the private subnet.
11

12
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.480
And here I have chosen the default security group.
12

13
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.620
And in the upcoming lectures, I'm going to edit this security group.
13

14
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.660
Create.
14

15
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.870
It will take some time and it is also going to create 2 instances for this cluster.
15

16
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.180
Okay.
16

17
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.640
So one is pending.
17

18
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.660
Another one is pending.
18

19
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.530
It means 2 instances are in process.
19

20
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.540
Now cluster has been created.
20

21
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.280
And here you can see Service task.
21

22
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.480
There is nothing.
22

23
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.080
And in ECS instances, there would be 2 instances.
23

24
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.970
So just wait for some more time.
24

25
00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.990
Now my instances are in running state.
25

26
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.820
Now you can see both of my instances are showing here in the cluster.
26

27
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.440
Now, this is the first thing.
27

28
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.770
Now, next, I'm going to create an application load balancer.
28

29
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.030
So coming back here.
29

30
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.500
And then go to the EC2 service and scroll down.
30

31
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.500
And here we have load balancing.
31

32
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.140
Inside this we have load balancer.
32

33
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.930
Then click on Create Load Balancer.
33

34
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.820
Here we have 3 options.
34

35
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.960
Go with the first one, application load balancer and click on Create.
35

36
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.230
And here you have to provide some basic configuration of your application load balancer, the name of
36

37
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.240
your load balancer.
37

38
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.580
I have given ALB cluster EC2- demo.
38

39
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.520
You can give any name and the scheme I have chosen internet facing IP version address.
39

40
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.430
I'm okay with the IP version 4 now.
40

41
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.680
Coming to this network mapping here, you have to choose the VPC.
41

42
00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.480
I have chosen this one and mapping.
42

43
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.580
I want to choose both of them.
43

44
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.860
This is my availability zones.
44

45
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.630
So I have chosen both of them and by default you can see it has chosen the public subnet because I want
45

46
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.960
my this application load balancer should be running in the public.
46

47
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.890
So here you can see in the PPT also the application load balancer is coming under the public subnet.
47

48
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.450
That's why I have chosen this one.
48

49
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.960
If you are going to choose this one, you will start getting some error.
49

50
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.960
The subnet for your Internet facing load balancer must have a route to a Internet gateway.
50

51
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.460
So here you have to choose the public and coming down and  security group.
51

52
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.620
I'm going to choose the default one letter.
52

53
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.700
I will do the changes on that under this listeners and routing on which port your application load balancer
53

54
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.630
should listen.
54

55
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:59.980
So I'm okay with this one else you can click on add listener and you can choose another port as well.
55

56
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:00.730
So.
56

57
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.170
And let me go with the 80 only.
57

58
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.650
And here you have to create the target group.
58

59
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.580
So this is mandatory for the creation of application load balancer.
59

60
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.090
So that's all.
60

61
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.630
In the next lecture, I will show you how to create the target group.
