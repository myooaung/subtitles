00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.550
In this lecture I will talk about Amazon Elastic Container Service ECS.
1

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.640
It's a very important service of Amazon and nowadays a lot of companies, they are using this service.
2

3
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:19.830
So what exactly this service is? ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that makes
3

4
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.490
it easy for you to deploy, manage and scale containerized applications.
4

5
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.000
So here you can see in the figure the first is Amazon Elastic Container Registry.
5

6
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.920
Or we can say this is a repository where your application team is going to put your application as a
6

7
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.000
Docker image.
7

8
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:49.280
So basically, if you have a Docker image or your application team who is working to develop an application
8

9
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:56.160
and finally they have develop the application, they have used the Docker and created the Docker image.
9

10
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.840
Now they want to execute that image as a container.
10

11
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.830
For that, they need some infrastructure where they can do the execution of that image or where they
11

12
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.600
can do the testing of the image.
12

13
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.690
So one way is to you need one infrastructure.
13

14
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.660
You are going to create one VM machine with some specification of memory and CPU, and then you are
14

15
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.560
going to install the Docker on that and then you are going to execute the Docker image as a container.
15

16
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.460
But here you need to manage the VM machine.
16

17
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.570
If your VM goes down, the entire application will be down and you have to taken care by how many containers
17

18
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.630
you need for this application.
18

19
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.480
And suppose in your application, all of a sudden the request, the load has been increased.
19

20
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.300
So who is going to increase the resources?
20

21
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.810
Or we can say who is going to scale your VM machine?
21

22
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.090
So all these things is taken care by the Amazon ECS service.
22

23
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.330
So what Amazon ECS is saying, they are saying that you just need to create your application as a Docker
23

24
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.570
image and then come to the Amazon ECS service.
24

25
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:14.970
So that service is going to help you to execute your Docker image as a container and Amazon ECS is going
25

26
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.830
to provide 100% availability of your service.
26

27
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.140
It will also provide the load balancing.
27

28
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.780
It will also provide the scalability.
28

29
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.150
Suppose the load on your application has been increased.
29

30
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.560
Amazon ECS  is going to increase the instances which is being managed by the AWS.
30

31
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.380
So all these features you will get in the Amazon ECS.
31

32
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:45.920
So we need to understand how we can create a ECS cluster and how we can deploy our Docker image.
32

33
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.920
So in these figures we have this Amazon elastic container and then you can see we have Amazon elastic
33

34
00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.970
container and then you have to define your application and then we have the Amazon EC2 and AWS far
34

35
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.500
great.
35

36
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.290
And finally you are going to manage the container.
36

37
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.760
So here you can see in the PPT we have a figure and this figure actually tells the functionality of
37

38
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.040
the ECS, how the ECS works.
38

39
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.140
So you need to understand this figure.
39

40
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.400
So at the starting you can see we have Amazon Elastic Container Registry and then we have the Amazon
40

41
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.840
ECS and after that you have to define your application.
41

42
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.310
And then we have the 2 types of task here we have Amazon EC2 and AWS fargate.
42

43
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.390
And finally you can see we are able to manage the containers.
43

44
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.460
So we need to understand this entire no worries we'll do step by step.
44

45
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.890
So let me go to my this Google and here just type Amazon ECS documentation and click on this first one.
45

46
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.990
And then developer guide.
46

47
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:09.450
And here we have the complete documentation about the Amazon Elastic Container Service, and this is
47

48
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.800
a highly scalable and fast container management service.
48

49
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.120
You can use it to run, stop and manage containers on a cluster.
49

50
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:28.080
So here you are going to execute the containers and the container is running in a cluster, so it will
50

51
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.630
provide you high availability.
51

52
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.630
So with Amazon ECS, your containers are defined in a task definition that you use to run an individual
52

53
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.000
task or task within a service.
53

54
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.050
In this context, a service is a configuration that you use to run and maintain a specified number of
54

55
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.060
tasks continuously in a cluster.
55

56
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.980
So I can understand at this point you will be confused what is the meaning of this line?
56

57
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.050
So no worries.
57

58
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.670
In the next lecture I will show you how to create the cluster and once you will try to create the cluster,
58

59
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.720
all these terminologies will come step by step.
59

60
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:09.210
Then you will understand what is the meaning of container definition, what is task, what is service,
60

61
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.330
and at what point you are going to create the cluster.
61

62
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:18.660
So as of now, you just need to keep in mind that if you have the Docker image and you want to execute
62

63
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:26.910
your Docker image as a container, you can use the Amazon ECS service and that service will provide you
63

64
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.790
the scalability, the load balancing, everything you will provide because it is going to create your
64

65
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.280
container in a cluster environment.
65

66
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.320
So that's all we'll see you in the next lecture.
