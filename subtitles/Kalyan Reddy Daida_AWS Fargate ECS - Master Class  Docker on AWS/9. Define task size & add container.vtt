00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.070
The next is task size.
1

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.350
The task size allows you to specify a fixed size for your tasks.
2

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.330
So basically in one task there can be one or more containers.
3

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:21.780
The task size is required for task using the Fargate launch type and is optional for the EC2 or external
4

5
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.710
launch type.
5

6
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.230
Container level memory settings are optional when task size is set.
6

7
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.030
The task size is not supported for the windows container.
7

8
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.260
So here you have to keep in mind that in one task there could be one or more containers.
8

9
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.710
So here you can choose the task memory.
9

10
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:56.130
Suppose I'm choosing 400 for my this task and for task CPU limit and suppose I'm going one virtual
10

11
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.950
CPU and then click on add containers.
11

12
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.630
So let me click on that one.
12

13
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.190
Now here you have to specify the detail about your container.
13

14
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.390
So what exactly you want to run as a container in your task?
14

15
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.440
So first you have to give the name I'm giving nginx a web server.
15

16
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.690
So that would be the name of my container.
16

17
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.380
And this time I'm taking this nginx latest.
17

18
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:38.580
So it is going to download the nginx image from the Docker hub and it will create your nginx web server.
18

19
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:47.360
And here I've taken the latest version of your nginx and memory limits.
19

20
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:56.630
So here we have 2 option the hard limit and the soft limit so you can choose both of them.
20

21
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.620
It is up to you.
21

22
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:06.770
So suppose I have chosen 350 and soft limit.
22

23
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.690
So whenever you are giving both hard limit and soft limit, the hard limit is always greater than the
23

24
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.680
soft limit.
24

25
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.370
So say for example, I have given 200.
25

26
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.900
So like this way you can define the limit.
26

27
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.490
So what is hard limit here?
27

28
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.940
Suppose I have given 350 MB memory for this task.
28

29
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:45.320
And suppose this container which is running and it is started consuming memory and if it is more than
29

30
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.870
350 MB, what will happen?
30

31
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.510
Your container would be terminated or stop.
31

32
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.580
So that's the hard limit.
32

33
00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.430
But for soft limit it is just like to reserve that memory for the task.
33

34
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.920
So here, if you want to get more detail about it, you can just click on this icon.
34

35
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.020
You will get more detail about this one.
35

36
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.670
And here the port mapping.
36

37
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.210
So as of now, the host port I am giving 80 and the container port I'm giving 80.
37

38
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:25.010
So the request first will go to the EC2 instance that is your host port 80 and then the request
38

39
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.400
will forward to the container on port number 80.
39

40
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.690
And here all other entries.
40

41
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.190
Let me go with the default and finally just click on ADD.
41

42
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.010
So here you can see this container definition has been added to by this task.
42

43
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:52.830
Suppose if you want to add more container to this task, you can add here we have an option and finally click
43

44
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.690
on the create.
44

45
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.920
So this way your task definition has been created.
45

46
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.810
So that's all we'll see you in the next lecture.
