00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.830
So in the previous lecture I had created a service, and in the service I have defined the task.
1

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.970
So let me click on View Service.
2

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:20.510
And here you can see 4 tasks are running and these are the number of tasks and details.
3

4
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.110
So this is my service.
4

5
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.690
So let me click on this cluster.
5

6
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.100
And this is a service.
6

7
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:37.550
And here you can see the desired task, which is showing 4 and running task is also 4 and under
7

8
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.210
task.
8

9
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.460
You will see 4 tasks are running and here you can see and ECS instances.
9

10
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.780
So 2 instances are running and coming back to my this PPT.
10

11
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:58.280
So 2 container of nginx web application is running on this instance and 2 container are running on another
11

12
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.000
instance.
12

13
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.430
And click on this target group and let me click on this target group.
13

14
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.470
So refresh it.
14

15
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.980
So here you can see it has created one target group and click on Load Balancer.
15

16
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:24.740
This is my load balancer and under this listener you can see that it has created one listener on port
16

17
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.660
number 80.
17

18
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:33.950
So if a request is coming to this application load balancer, if it is on 80 port, it is going to distribute
18

19
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.660
the traffic to the target group.
19

20
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.600
So what all the targets we have in this target group?
20

21
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.230
Let's see.
21

22
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.930
So let me select the target group.
22

23
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.230
And under this target, you can see it is providing you all the targets.
23

24
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:57.820
Now here you can see it has chosen randomly the ports 49153, 49154 and the same port for another instance
24

25
00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.350
as well.
25

26
00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.410
So coming back to this PPT.
26

27
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.510
So 2 ports it has taken for my host number 0 suppose this is my host number 0 and this is host
27

28
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.300
number 1.
28

29
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:17.140
So 2 port 49153 and 49154 has been mapped to these 2 containers and same port has been mapped for
29

30
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.100
another instance and container which is running on that instance.
30

31
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.580
And scroll down and you can see the status it is showing.
31

32
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.240
Healthy.
32

33
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.160
So why it is showing healthy?
33

34
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.280
Let me show you.
34

35
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.530
So coming back here and let me select any of my instance and click on this security group.
35

36
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.030
And this is my security group.
36

37
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.530
In the security group.
37

38
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.770
I have added all the required ports.
38

39
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.250
Now you can see 49154, 49 every port I have defined.
39

40
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.330
So what you can do?
40

41
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.520
Let me remove all these ports.
41

42
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.840
You can do one thing.
42

43
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.180
You can take all TCP IP for practice purpose.
43

44
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.080
You just take all TCP IP and here you just choose the security group which we have selected for the
44

45
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.190
application load balance.
45

46
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.570
So this is the security group we have given to the application load balancer.
46

47
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.990
So if you are not doing these changes in the security group, your instances, your targets, your targets
47

48
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.150
would be unhealthy, right?
48

49
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.590
So that's all for this lecture.
49

50
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.930
In the next lecture, I'm going to show you a few more important aspects of this ECS cluster.
