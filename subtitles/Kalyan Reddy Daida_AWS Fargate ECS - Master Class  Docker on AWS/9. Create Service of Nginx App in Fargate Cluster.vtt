Hi.
1

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.460
Let's continue.
2

3
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.700
So let me come back to my this cluster.
3

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.640
And here you can see 3 tasks are running and 1 service.
4

5
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:20.160
So let me click on my this cluster and then service and create service.
5

6
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.140
Launch type.
6

7
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.880
It's a Fargate only and operating system is Linux.
7

8
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.560
Task definition.
8

9
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.590
I'm going to choose this one and platform I'm going to choose this one cluster.
9

10
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:45.020
I want this service should be the part of this cluster service name I'm going to take Fargate.
10

11
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.610
nginx service.
11

12
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.040
Demo 1 or demo 5.
12

13
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.360
Maybe this name is already there.
13

14
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.230
That's why I have taken 5.
14

15
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.770
Number.
15

16
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.610
Number of tasks I want 2.
16

17
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.670
So 3 tasks are already running.
17

18
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.200
So 2 more tasks would be there.
18

19
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.640
So total task would be there.
19

20
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.140
5 okay and all default option.
20

21
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.760
Let me click on next and here you have to provide VPC.
21

22
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.760
This is my VPC and subnet.
22

23
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.190
Security group.
23

24
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.630
Save.
24

25
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.390
Next step next.
25

26
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.920
Create service.
26

27
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.310
View service.
27

28
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.680
So this is my service details.
28

29
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.630
And inside this service, we have 2 task.
29

30
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.400
Let me cross-check.
30

31
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.090
So here you can see 5 tasks out there because I have just clicked on the cluster.
31

32
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.720
Now let me click this service.
32

33
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.780
Inside this service, we have 2 tasks, and both the tasks are in running state.
33

34
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.960
So let me copy the IP.
34

35
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.760
And paste here.
35

36
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.570
Now you can see that my this service is running properly.
36

37
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.270
Suppose I'm going to stop by this VM.
37

38
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.460
Will it affect my this container?
38

39
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:51.880
Answer is no, because we have already created image and that image is in ECR repository.
39

40
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:59.200
And this task which we have created, it has taken the image from the AWS ECR.
40

41
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.610
Now coming back here, this is my cluster and you can see 5 task are running.
41

42
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.280
So let me select this task and stop it.
42

43
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.680
So manually, I have stopped 1 task of this service.
43

44
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.350
Now you can see that immediately.
44

45
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:35.330
It has created one more service because these tasks are managing by the service, because these tasks
45

46
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.190
are being managing by the service.
46

47
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.440
So that's all we'll see you in the next lecture.
