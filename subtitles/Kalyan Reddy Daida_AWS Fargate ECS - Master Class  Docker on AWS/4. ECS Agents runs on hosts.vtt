00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.730
In this lecture I'm going to discuss about ECS agent runs on host.
1

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.440
So there are 2 models that you can use to run your containers.
2

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.660
The first one is your Fargate launch type and the second one is your EC2 launch type.
3

4
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.790
So basically at the time of creation of your ECS cluster, you can choose any one of them.
4

5
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:32.640
Suppose you have chosen EC2 launch type and while creating your cluster you have given 3 instances.
5

6
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.260
So what will happen?
6

7
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.440
It is going to create 3 EC2 instances for your ECS cluster.
7

8
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:47.610
So here you can see in the figure we have EC2 instances which is going to manage your ECS cluster.
8

9
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.750
Now your cluster has been created with 3 EC2 instances.
9

10
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.040
The next step you are going to run the containers, so your container is going to run on your EC2
10

11
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.090
instances.
11

12
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.160
And here, while creating the cluster, I have to chosen EC2 launch type.
12

13
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.330
So what will happen?
13

14
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.720
The EC2 instances would be created and as a system admin you will have the access to those instances
14

15
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.120
to manage the server.
15

16
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.200
Now next is you are going to run the container.
16

17
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.940
So in first EC2 instance you can see few containers are running and like this way for second EC2 instance,
17

18
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.980
we have further new containers.
18

19
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.850
And also you can see on the third EC2 instance we have few containers.
19

20
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:42.570
Now the question is how your Amazon ECS is going to communicate with the EC2 instances which is created
20

21
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.520
while the creation of the cluster.
21

22
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.380
For that it requires one ECS agent which is installed by default on the EC2 instances.
22

23
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.860
If it is not installed, you can manually go to the EC2 instance and from there you can install it for
23

24
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.290
troubleshooting point of view.
24

25
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.370
You can log into those instances.
25

26
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.810
From there you can check whether this ECS agent service is running or not.
26

27
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.010
I will show you once.
27

28
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.440
I will do the troubleshooting.
28

29
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.150
Now here you can see suppose you want to create the container so you are going to tell all those things
29

30
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.900
to the Amazon ECS service like I want.
30

31
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.270
Few containers should be running on this.
31

32
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.500
EC2 instance.
32

33
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.040
I want to delete a few containers from this particular instances.
33

34
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.620
So how the AWS ECS service is going to communicate with the EC2 instances.
34

35
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.030
For that it requires the ECS agent which should be running on all the instances now coming to the next this
35

36
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.040
is your AWS fargate.
36

37
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.070
So basically while creating the cluster at that time, suppose you have chosen the AW.
37

38
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.030
S Fargate.
38

39
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:56.820
So basically this is a serverless pay as you go option and you can run your containers without needing
39

40
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:04.350
to manage your infrastructure so your cluster would be created and you just need to provide the task
40

41
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.870
size like how many resources you want to run your container.
41

42
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:20.340
So at the time of creation of your task or service, you can define and AWS is going to manage the infrastructure
42

43
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.480
as a system admin or as a application admin who is managing this ECS infrastructure.
43

44
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.690
You do not have the access to those instances.
44

45
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.530
Your AWS is going to manage the infrastructure for you.
45

46
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.470
So it is up to you whether you want to go with the EC2 launch type or fargate launch type.
46

47
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.170
So what are the benefits of ECS forget mode?
47

48
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:50.640
So here we have no infrastructure is required and second one is manage everything at the container
48

49
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.790
level, launch quickly, scale easily and resource based pricing.
49

50
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.200
So how do I know when to use Fargate or EC2 mode?
50

51
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.090
So it's completely depends upon the workload for EC2 hosted.
51

52
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:14.850
It is completely managed by the customer and for Fargate no management by customer and it's a cheaper
52

53
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:24.120
and it's a costlier for Fargate predicate long running task and  Fargate variable and short running
53

54
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.600
tasks.
54

55
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.400
So basically suppose you have chosen the EC2 hosted model.
55

56
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.010
So in that case, suppose there is an issue with the EC2 instance you are responsible for that.
56

57
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.310
Suppose you want to do patching on the instance.
57

58
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:45.000
So you have to log into those instances, you have to manage your instances, you have to update your
58

59
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.780
instances.
59

60
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.080
But if you have chosen the Fargate, then there is no management is required by the customer, but it
60

61
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.140
is a little bit costlier compare to the EC2 host.
61

62
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.360
So that's all we'll see you in the next lecture.
