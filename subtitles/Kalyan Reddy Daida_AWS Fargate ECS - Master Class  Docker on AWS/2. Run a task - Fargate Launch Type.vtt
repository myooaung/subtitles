1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.500
So let's continue.
1

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.830
So in the previous lecture, we had created a cluster and the type was Fargate cluster.
2

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.740
So in Fargate Cluster, the infrastructure at the back end is going to be managed by AWS team.
3

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.690
Now, in this lecture, I will show you how we can add the task to the cluster.
4

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.300
So this is my empty cluster.
5

6
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.140
And here you can see we do not have any service, we do not have any task.
6

7
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.370
And nothing is here.
7

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.140
We just created a cluster.
8

9
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.530
Now let me click on task and I'm going to create a task for this cluster.
9

10
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.440
So here we have an option run new task.
10

11
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.270
So let me click on that.
11

12
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.050
So basically with this way, you are going to align a task to the cluster.
12

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.190
But suppose if you want to create a new task, then you have to click on this option task definition
13

14
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.660
and here you can create a new task.
14

15
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.410
I will show you in the later lecture in detail how to create the task.
15

16
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:10.170
So let me first click on clusters and this is my newly created cluster and click on task.
16

17
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.510
And then click on run new task.
17

18
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.900
So this is my Fargate cluster.
18

19
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:27.490
So obviously the task launch type should be Fargate only and operating system I want it should be Linux
19

20
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.140
and here you can see there is already one task.
20

21
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.710
So at the time of creation of cluster, initially I had shown you how to create a cluster and with the
21

22
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.410
diagram I had shown you creation of the cluster.
22

23
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.050
So at that time it has created one task.
23

24
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.040
So no worries.
24

25
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.540
I will show you how to create the task.
25

26
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.400
So this time for testing purpose.
26

27
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:56.290
I'm just using the task which is already available on my this system and this is the revision number and
27

28
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.130
platform.
28

29
00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.870
So here we have 2 platforms.
29

30
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.800
So let me click on this one and this is the cluster.
30

31
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.170
So I want this task should be the part of which cluster I want should be the part of my this Fargate
31

32
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.830
demo cluster, number of tasks.
32

33
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.370
So how many task you want for this cluster?
33

34
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.390
Suppose you have mentioned 1 then only 1 task would be running.
34

35
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.140
Or in simple word we can say only 1 container would be running.
35

36
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.130
If you have mentioned 2, it means 2 containers would be running.
36

37
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:35.410
So I'm just choosing 1 only I will show you multiple task as well and cluster VPC.
37

38
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.380
So I'm choosing this one.
38

39
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.350
This is my VPC, which I had created in the previous lectures and subnet.
39

40
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.130
So I'm just choosing public subnet only.
40

41
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.270
But when you are doing, you can choose all the subnets.
41

42
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.240
And security group.
42

43
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.200
Let me go with the default one and or.
43

44
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.060
Let me choose this one, which I had created.
44

45
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.000
Save.
45

46
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.130
I'm not going with the advanced options, and then I'm just click on a run task.
46

47
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.050
So the task which I have chosen here is simply an nginx application.
47

48
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.310
So here you can see this task status is provisioning and it will take some time and you can see after
48

49
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.440
some time the status would be running.
49

50
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.720
So let me keep on refreshing it.
50

51
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.300
Now you can see the status of the task it is in Running State, so just click on the task.
51

52
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.220
And here we have this public IP.
52

53
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.720
Just copy and put it in the browser.
53

54
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.960
So here you can see this task is running.
54

55
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.530
So let me tell you one more time what exactly I have explained here.
55

56
00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.930
So this is my cluster.
56

57
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.600
And here you can see the running task is one.
57

58
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.820
As of now, we do not have any service which we have defined.
58

59
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.550
So let me click on my this cluster and the services.
59

60
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.200
No task is one.
60

61
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.060
And ECS instances.
61

62
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.070
So if I'll click here, you won't see any instances here.
62

63
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.930
Let me show you.
63

64
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.100
And where this task is running.
64

65
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.820
So obviously, it is running in some infrastructure which is being managed by the AWS.
65

66
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.010
So we need not to worry about where this task is running.
66

67
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:48.040
And also this task is a part of cluster and everything seem fine.
67

68
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.460
So what is the service here?
68

69
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.280
Service basically you can create a service and in the service you can define the tasks.
69

70
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:05.230
So once you will create a service and defining the task, then your service would be responsible for
70

71
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.500
managing the task.
71

72
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.400
Here, this task is running.
72

73
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:16.750
But suppose if this task has been stopped by N number of reason, then there is no service.
73

74
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.490
Who is monitoring this task?
74

75
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.250
So this task, if it is stop, then it will be continue in the stop state.
75

76
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.180
Let me show you.
76

77
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.390
Let me select this and stop.
77

78
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.970
Now you can see that there is no running task.
78

79
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.780
And if I'll refresh it, you won't see any new task is running.
79

80
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:46.990
But suppose if I would have created this task using this service, then the service would be responsible
80

81
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.490
for this task.
81

82
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:57.430
If I have manually stop this task, after some time, the service will recreate a new task and it will
82

83
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.840
be in provisioning state.
83

84
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.980
And after time and after some time it would be in running state.
84

85
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.500
So in the next lecture I'm going to create a task using this service.
85

86
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.300
So that's all we'll see you in the next lecture.
