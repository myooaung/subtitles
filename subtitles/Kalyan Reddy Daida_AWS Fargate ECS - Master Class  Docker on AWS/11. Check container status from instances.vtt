1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.000
So here you can see this is my cluster.
1

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.130
And let me click on my cluster.
2

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.900
And running task count.
3

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:20.610
So here you can see to see 2 EC2 task are running on my this cluster and click on the task and here you
4

5
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:30.540
can see one task it is showing and the task definition name you can see it is showing nginx-,
5

6
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.740
web server demo and which is in running state.
6

7
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:43.800
So how would you know that this task or this container is running on my this EC2 instances for that
7

8
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.610
just click on the ECS instances and scroll down.
8

9
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.210
It will show both of the instances.
9

10
00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.440
So this is my first instance and it is in active state and here you can see running task.
10

11
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.770
So one task is running on my one instance and another task is running on my another instance.
11

12
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:17.910
So let me go to the EC2 instance service and here you can see this is my first instance and what's
12

13
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.720
the IP?
13

14
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.550
So this is the IP.
14

15
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.710
So let me log into my this instance.
15

16
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.110
SSH -i.
16

17
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.240
And EC2-user.
17

18
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.640
And this is the IP.
18

19
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.940
So here you can see I have logged in to my this instance, which is running in the private subnet.
19

20
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.320
Now the command is Docker image ls.
20

21
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.440
So here you can see this.
21

22
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.220
nginx image has been downloaded to the system.
22

23
00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.660
And this is your ECS agent and docker container.
23

24
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.250
ls.
24

25
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.810
So here you can see my container is running on this instance.
25

26
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.670
So coming back here what's the IP of my another instance.
26

27
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.520
This is the IP.
27

28
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.600
Let me copy.
28

29
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.460
Come back here.
29

30
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.660
ssh.
30

31
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.000
And here I have to give this IP.
31

32
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:47.710
And I'm able to access my another instance and Docker container ls.
32

33
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.820
So here you can see this container is running on my another instance.
33

34
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.260
So 2 containers are running and both are running on different instances.
34

35
00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.120
So that's all we'll see you in the next lecture.
