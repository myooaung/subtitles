00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:12.310
So let's talk about taking great photographs great photographs right out of the gate can make a huge

2
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.560
difference.

3
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.440
Honestly I think the first two or three guests I got they came because I probably had good photographs

4
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.800
and much better for crafts than what you'd expect out of someone who just listed their space having

5
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.020
great photographs can make a huge difference in their trajectory when you first posted a listing.

6
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.120
The sooner you get bookings and the sooner you get reviews the sooner you're going to get up to a point

7
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.420
where you're charging the maximum you can for your property and everybody listening to this.

8
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.120
I know that that's what you want to write.

9
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.770
You want to get to the point where you're making the most money or you know you're hitting your rent

10
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.590
by taking the fewest guests or whatever gives you the best options.

11
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.440
If you get great photographs right out of the gate you can hit it with a running start.

12
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.570
So I boiled this down to four things that can dramatically make a difference in your photographs.

13
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.450
It's not going to get your photographs up to the point where they're as good as an Air B and B photograph

14
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:17.710
but it's good enough to have a strong launch and to get off on a good foot later you're going to sign

15
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.120
up for the free Airbnb photography and I include that as a link in the resource section of this lecture.

16
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.200
But before Airbnb can send you those photographers they need to make sure that you're serious and that

17
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.390
you have positive reviews.

18
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.920
You need to get to that point.

19
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.330
And the best way of doing that is by starting off strong with great photos.

20
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.990
Get your camera in hand and follow along.

21
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.290
Number one never take photographs in portrait.

22
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:53.320
Always take your photographs in landscape portrait if you're not familiar is when you take your camera

23
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.130
and you tilted vertically.

24
00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.840
It's where it kind of looks like a rectangle except the with is thinner than the height.

25
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.400
There's several reasons why you don't want to do this.

26
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.550
First of all IT landscape always looks better.

27
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.360
It looks grander and makes your space look all more all encompassing.

28
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.580
Also when people look at your space you want to make your photographs match the way that human beings

29
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.120
see is space.

30
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.800
We don't see in portrait we see in landscape we have these you know our peripheral vision putting a

31
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.570
portrait shot is just not realistic that somehow people look at spaces.

32
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.400
Another reason portrait photographs look strange because they have bars on the sides of them and that

33
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.520
typically makes the room feel more confined or more constrained than it really is.

34
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.910
And that's not something you want your photographs convey you want to convey openness and to convey

35
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.540
space.

36
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.620
You never want to convey closed and confined.

37
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.070
The other reason why you never want to take portrait photographs is probably the biggest one FPN Web

38
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.750
site is not made for putting in portrait photographs.

39
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.870
If you look at their Web site everything on there is landscape it's all wide angle.

40
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.320
Occasionally you see people put portrait photographs in there and it just looks awful because Aramean

41
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.160
we set it up such they want we want landscape photos.

42
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.300
That bar issue we were talking about previously.

43
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.320
It gets much much worse when you try to add a portrait photo on Airbnb.

44
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.630
They just seem like a sliver of an image.

45
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.620
So that just conveys that you never took the time to understand what photographs look best.

46
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.070
You never took the time to understand what photographs airbnb wants from you.

47
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.040
It just conveys unprofessionalism.

48
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.330
But more importantly it just looks bad.

49
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.830
Number two this is the focus of your photograph.

50
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.710
What I mean by focus it's a couple things.

51
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.750
When you're taking a photograph of your space you want to make sure that there is a focal point.

52
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.750
There's something that you're focusing on in each shot.

53
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.580
So if you're taking a picture of say your kitchen the focal point is the kitchen space it doesn't necessarily

54
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.910
have to be on one individual thing in the space you want to make sure that each photograph kind of encapsulates

55
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.450
one aspect of your apartment or your home.

56
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.460
If you're taking a picture of your bedroom you want it to be probably of the bed.

57
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.810
Right.

58
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.830
That's the main thing in the room when someone looks at the photograph.

59
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.130
They want to be able to focus on the bed.

60
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.850
That's the biggest point of a bedroom.

61
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.590
Now if you're looking at your living room maybe you want to focus on the couch or focus maybe even on

62
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.200
the space in between if you have multiple couches.

63
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.010
What you want to avoid is making a photograph that doesn't have a focal point.

64
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:41.490
I see a lot of people on Urban be putting up photographs and it'll be of in between section of their

65
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.650
space.

66
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.850
You can't tell what you're supposed to be focusing on is that the painting is the couch.

67
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.160
Is it the TV over there.

68
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.360
It's just kind of confusing in your eyes of a hard time adjusting to the photograph you're not sure

69
00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.650
what you're looking for so try not to waste photographs by taking something that isn't focused on something.

70
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.090
Now the second part of focus is just the clarity of the shot.

71
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.030
A lot of you if you have fidgety fingers you might notice that when you take photographs they might

72
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.500
come out blurry.

73
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.810
This is the way I suggest getting around this is when you take shots take a lot of shots so that when

74
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.200
you can go back and upload it on your computer you can see which ones came out right and which ones

75
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.780
didn't.

76
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.600
And you don't have to go back and try to recreate the shot all from scratch.

77
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.810
Another way of addressing this is you can get a tripod tripods are not extremely cheap but an extremely

78
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.960
expensive and if you have something setting around it could definitely help.

79
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:41.440
What I did is I just piled boxes on top of each other and I took a shot that way.

80
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.960
When you hold the camera you're going to want to try to take a shot from a vantage point that's similar

81
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.000
to the way you will look at the space.

82
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.820
Don't ever try to take the photographs down from like your belly button or your knees or over your head.

83
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.240
Somebody will take photographs like Birdseye views don't do that.

84
00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.780
Try to take it from where you would naturally see it if you're walking into the space.

85
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.780
That's what's going to create the connection to the guest when the guest shows up.

86
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.880
That's going to make them see the space and go off.

87
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.940
This is what I booked number three and this is huge.

88
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.220
It's the light.

89
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.900
Make sure that you are optimizing your shots for getting in as much natural and artificial light as

90
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.000
you can.

91
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.840
The best type of light is natural light.

92
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.590
If you don't have natural light or you have limited natural light you can augment it with artificial

93
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.200
light but try your best to get the best natural light you can.

94
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.820
Now the best way of doing this is actually just to plan plan on taking your photographs when you know

95
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.820
your place is going to have the most light and be the most lit up for me.

96
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.710
I couldn't do it at say noon because noon is when the sun is directly above my apartment but I also

97
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:54.590
couldn't do it at say 4:00 p.m. because it's coming at an angle and one sided apartment would it be

98
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.880
dark all the other side to be light and also when I'm taking photographs the Suns would be popping into

99
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.240
the windows and obscuring the shot.

100
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.090
So for me the best time was like 1:00 p.m..

101
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.300
And similarly on the other side of the apartment was like 11:00 a.m..

102
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.050
You know your space and you know your area.

103
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:16.370
So you should probably know roughly when it's going to be the most let obviously do not take photographs

104
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.110
at night and that doesn't particularly make sense.

105
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.070
Try to take photographs and there's the most natural light if you have curtains open them up.

106
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.890
I know that sounds ridiculous that some people would leave them close.

107
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.260
But if you go near being B you can find lots of people who do this they forget to open their curtains.

108
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.530
They're essentially just depriving their space of light.

109
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.490
Light is incredibly important to getting good photography.

110
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.190
The look on Airbnb.

111
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.900
You'll see that it looks like every photograph that they have that's been done professionally has tons

112
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.190
and tons of light.

113
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.690
That's what you're trying to go after light makes it such that the person can see everything in the

114
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.570
shot when it's darker.

115
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:56.030
They can't see everything they can't see the detail.

116
00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:01.610
If you don't have a ton of natural light you can augment this with artificial light the way that I was

117
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:07.190
doing this was if I was taking a picture of say a bedroom I would go and take a lamp from all of the

118
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:13.340
other rooms and put it in the bedroom and I turn that lamp on at a couple times when I was taking photos

119
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.530
of the hallway.

120
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:20.150
What I did was I took a bunch of lamps like the Standup Ikea lamps and I put them behind me and kind

121
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:25.370
of created this back like a fact and it gave the room a lot of light that otherwise naturally wouldn't

122
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.480
have gotten again.

123
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.630
Artificial lights not as great as natural light.

124
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.980
But the point is that you want as much light as possible.

125
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.360
And if you can't get the best kind of light then you can just settle for artificial.

126
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.530
Just try to get as much light as you can in the space.

127
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:47.130
One trick that will help you a lot in your search for trying to brightening up your space is that you

128
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.440
should always use your flash.

129
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:55.470
Now if you're using a DSL Lahr you might need to get a flash attachment to get the brightest photographs.

130
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.410
When you have R&amp;B and the photography come out and do it you'll notice that they have a flash bulb attached

131
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:05.540
their DSL are all include in the resource section what it is exactly that I'm talking about when I reference

132
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.350
the flash bulb.

133
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:13.410
If you use that what it does is it times the photo of your camera with the flash.

134
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:18.780
It shoots a blast of light into the room as you take the photograph and it makes the room look so much

135
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.330
more bright than it usually is.

136
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:26.060
Now if you're not using a DSL or say you're on an iPhone just tried turning on the flash.

137
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:31.320
In nine years in that time it's going to make it such that your space is much brighter than it would

138
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.120
be if you hadn't put on the flash.

139
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.540
Sometimes it can backfire.

140
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.660
And what it does is actually kind of washes out all the detail in your image.

141
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:43.800
But try using the flash first if that doesn't work then you can always roll it back and try taking without

142
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.870
the flash and settle for that using Flash attachments can make a huge difference.

143
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:54.600
If you guys want to go crazy with this there's actually some online kits you can use that are similar

144
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.430
to professional lighting equipment that you set up outside the range of your shots.

145
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:05.730
And they push really soft light into your room and it makes it kind of have a professional touch to

146
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:06.060
it.

147
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.460
That's only for you guys that really want to go crazy with this.

148
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:13.540
And I would only suggest buying those things if you have some kind of need for them for something else.

149
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:22.520
The last tip that is going to help you get great photography is to prep each station before you take

150
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.420
a photograph.

151
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:30.160
So prep each room prep each section of the counter prep anything and you taking a photograph of.

152
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.140
Now I say prep What does that mean.

153
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.010
One D-CT or the space.

154
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.640
Take all your personal belongings out of it too.

155
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:45.290
You want to clean the space the best you possibly can because these photos are going to be immortalized.

156
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:49.600
You want it to look the absolute tip top it can look.

157
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:56.510
So it's important that you not only clean but detail each area that you do and go in and make sure that

158
00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.930
every little bit you can is as good as you can.

159
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.840
You don't have to clean it this level of detail every time you clean your apartment.

160
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:10.070
But for the photographs you want to show it in its best form and then the last thing is that you want

161
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:16.580
to make sure that you put in items into the shot that you think will kind of accentuate the space and

162
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.760
make it look more polished.

163
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.550
Give you an example when I took a photograph of my kitchen.

164
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.820
I first noticed that there was nothing in the shot.

165
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.970
It's kind of drab.

166
00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:29.120
All the colors I was picking up where the countertop and the floors and the cabinets and I wanted to

167
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.340
bring some light into some more color into it.

168
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.800
So what I did is I went to the other rooms in my place and I grabbed some things and I put them in there

169
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.210
and I went to a store and I grab these really colorful jars and I put them in the shop because they

170
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.630
were really brought some bright reds and greens into the shot.

171
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.920
That's a great way of doing a go of mind other things and put them in there.

172
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:55.670
Try to set it up to make it look exactly like when they show up and try to make it look like everything

173
00:11:55.670 --> 00:12:02.260
they could possibly need is in the shot that's going to make it look much much nicer in my living room.

174
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.760
What I would do is I went and got fresh flowers.

175
00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.030
I cut them put them in vases and then put them in the shots.

176
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:11.310
I usually get flowers for my guests but not all the time.

177
00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.100
You don't have to get flowers for your guest.

178
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.180
It's a suggestion.

179
00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.290
It does help.

180
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:19.050
But for the photographs I wanted to look as nice as possible.

181
00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.630
And then it's up to you and you want to continue doing that.

182
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.720
I'd use two flower vases and honestly what I'm doing was cycling them throughout the rooms as I took

183
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.370
photos of each room.

184
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:30.350
Flowers Oh look fantastic.

185
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:36.260
That's one of those accents that you can add so when you do take your photography make sure that you

186
00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:41.990
go all out in terms of amenities in terms of extras trinkets anything you can kind of add into the shot

187
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.220
to give it some character or give it some flavor.

188
00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:50.510
Now in the next lecture I'm going to show you how you can quickly take these photographs throw them

189
00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.500
on your computer.

190
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:58.510
Use software that everybody has and really bring out the awesomeness of your photographs.

191
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.380
I'm going to show you the tricks that Airbnb uses in their photographs.

192
00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:07.820
I'm going to show you how you just at your home on your computer can take these photos and make them

193
00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.920
almost as good as the professional photography that Airbnb gives you.

194
00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.410
Now if you guys are at this point in the course and you're stuck because you don't have a camera skip

195
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:25.050
ahead and find the lecture in the section about how to get a free SLR camera.

196
00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:30.650
That's one of my favorite hacks and it can really help you out and if you live anywhere near a city

197
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:32.020
you can pull it off.

198
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:33.430
Like always.

199
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.890
Hey guys any other questions anything you want me to elaborate on.

Posted in the group discussion or private message me.

201
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.530

203
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.100
I'd love to throw those in here and augment them.

204
00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.290
I really want to kind of crowd source all of the best ideas that everybody's had.

205
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:57.800
These are the four that I know that are repeatable and if you follow each for You'll always come away

206
00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.780
with higher quality photography and it's going to put you at a really strong advantage right when you

207
00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:06.530
launch your property which is really really important.
