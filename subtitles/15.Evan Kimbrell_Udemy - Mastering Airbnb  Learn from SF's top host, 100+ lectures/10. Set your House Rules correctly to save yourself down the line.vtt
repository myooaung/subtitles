00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.770
So the next section of the listing that's worth discussing is the house rules section the house rules

2
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:16.070
section is where you list off anything that you want someone to know that they can or cannot do before

3
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.770
they even book they see it actually on the front page of the book.

4
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.520
This isn't something that they see afterwards.

5
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.990
There's a separate section where you list off information and more rules that get sent to the person

6
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.800
who books after they book.

7
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.370
But this isn't that section.

8
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:41.370
House rules is displayed prominently so no person who's interested in booking can essentially ignore

9
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.060
it.

10
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.270
There's not a ton to say about house rules.

11
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.560
They're pretty obvious.

12
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.970
My opinion is that you do not need to be too explicit.

13
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.970
There's a lot of things that are just assumed that you cannot do in someone else's space.

14
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.880
I think also it's worth noting that for the most part and I hosted over a hundred different groups now

15
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.550
I've never had an issue where someone was doing something that I explicitly said no.

16
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.770
For the most part they're on their best behavior.

17
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.130
They're not going to bring in too much trouble if you are particular about noise that might be the place

18
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.730
to list it.

19
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.560
Do you have if you're doing a shared space they might be more home rules or house rules if you work

20
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.790
in your space.

21
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.170
You might consider putting limitations on when are quiet times.

22
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.700
You know if you're running out multiple spaces too then you might want to say that.

23
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.960
Please be quiet after 10 p.m. or something of that sort.

24
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.160
Other than that there are pretty basic things you might think about including no guests is one way of

25
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.740
something that some people take have problems with.

26
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.420
They don't really want you to bring your friends back.

27
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.050
In most cases guests always ask beforehand whether or not they can have someone come and visit.

28
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.880
They always say up front or you know because of the context of why they're visiting they're coming to

29
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.400
visit their parents and their parents are going to come over.

30
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.780
So it's never really out of the blue and they're usually pretty good about it occasionally you get some

31
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.310
people who are a little I guess maybe more airheaded about it.

32
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.100
They fail to mention or their communication is a little bit more poor than other guests.

33
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.560
Smoking Sara mentioned that you don't need to list it because everybody knows you shouldn't smoke in

34
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.540
someone's house for the most part.

35
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.420
Yeah that is true.

36
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.060
I've never seen any listing that says you can smoke in their apartment.

37
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.350
It just wouldn't really make sense because if you smoked in your apartment and you went to illicit on

38
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.850
Airbnb you might have a problem because you know when you run a hotel it almost got to the point or

39
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.580
they don't ask smoking nonsmoking it's just nonsmoking now.

40
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.480
Cigarettes have a tendency to make this a musky kind of smell.

41
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.450
You can never really get rid of and if you have smokers coming they're not going to care.

42
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.600
But you know people who don't you know you're on the on you know the risk of offending them or them

43
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.800
finding problems with it.

44
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.050
That's also something that you might get used to because you have olfactory the sensation or you stop

45
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.640
noticing odors and then someone else will notice it and that's really not something that you can prepare

46
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.980
for.

47
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.260
So the only time I think you mentioned no smoking or you need to mention that you can always mention

48
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.640
it such like in the case of my listing I listed no smoking indoors but you can smoke outdoors.

49
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.760
We have a back patio.

50
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.230
I don't care if you smoke outdoors.

51
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.490
It doesn't really make a difference.

52
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.720
I don't care if you smoke out in front either because that's public space.

53
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.060
My best advice here is if it's an assumed no no you don't really need to list it.

54
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.560
If you are missing a space you're really concerned with party.

55
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.570
Like people come and party you can list that.

56
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.100
But it's also kind of in a lot of cases and in say my apartment it's really assumed you're paying that

57
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.770
much for a space.

58
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.560
The odds of you throwing parties are just it's not going to happen.

59
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.890
You don't even need to really list out like no events.

60
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.100
That's pretty obvious too.

61
00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:02.110
They would tell you beforehand if they had an event the one thing you do want to avoid with house rules

62
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.440
is listing too much.

63
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.840
In one case I saw one host who licit off 25 itemized things you cannot do everything else that Lessing

64
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.750
looked fine but after reading that I just said this person must be completely neurotic.

65
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.710
Some of these things are just like they're trying to control my behavior way too much.

66
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.660
Have any plans on breaking you know three quarters of them.

67
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.970
But it just didn't make sense why you need to list out some of these things.

68
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.790
I'm not planning on doing heroin in your bathroom you don't need to list no hard drugs that kind of

69
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.030
is assumed.

70
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.240
That's something that you want to generally avoid or you know just generally avoid making long lists

71
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.520
of listing every single possible thing.

72
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.120
The better way of preventing these infractions would be to be more picky about who you host.

73
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.980
Have some kind of basic criteria for who you're screening and you can always reject people who are looking

74
00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:57.480
to book.

75
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.900
You know people were inquiring if you get some kind of a negative feeling or negative vibe from them.

76
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.680
That is pretty much as simple as it gets.

77
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.080
If there is some essential things in there that you think are really important if your space doesn't

78
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.810
allow animals you can set say no animals.

79
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.790
That's very helpful because some people will not read it if you say it in the description or you list

80
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.040
it on the amenities.

81
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.800
Some people aren't going to cook them more but and unfold the amenities list and see that you said no

82
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.500
pets.

83
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.140
They'll just bring it.

84
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.440
It's very helpful to list out what your checkout time is at first.

85
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.360
I don't really expect you to have a set checkout time because you don't know what works.

86
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.570
And also at first you're not probably not going to back to back bookings so it's not particularly important

87
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.070
that you coordinate their check ins and check outs that closely.

88
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.240
But eventually it will help immensely if you you're running out your entire space and you're doing it

89
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:52.630
for say like a full month that people know in advance that they need to be out by 11:00 in by say two

90
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.210
and that gives you a window to clean.

91
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.110
You can specifically mention things like cleanliness thing or anything else you can think of.

92
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.680
My inclination is to list less and be pickier about who I pick.

93
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.480
Because if you list too much and you're trying to list out every single possible contingency situation

94
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.350
it actually can backfire and actually can make your listing look less appealing.

95
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.990
These are my questions.

96
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.450
Any exceptions you can think of.

97
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.860
Maybe there's something you on a list and you're not sure if it's over the top posted in the group discussion

98
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:23.730
we can talk about it.

99
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.020
Otherwise we'll see in the next lecture.
