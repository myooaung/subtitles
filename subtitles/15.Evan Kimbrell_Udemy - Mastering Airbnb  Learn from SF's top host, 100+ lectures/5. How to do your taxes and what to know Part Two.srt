1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:09,450
OK so what at what point can I actually deduct rent or mortgage if it's regularly and exclusively a

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,340
listing on your property.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:18,150
So for example if you have a three bedroom apartment and it's you have one bedroom that's exclusively

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:19,730
rented out.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,350
And then you could that can be considered tax deductible.

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,780
That doesn't mean that it has to be rented out the entire time but it always has to be listed on the

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,080
air.

8
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,030
Gotcha.

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:40,050
One one question I know that a lot of people have is if I have a property in a different state and I

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,280
live in another state like say I live in California I have a property in Florida.

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,720
Do you end up paying the income to Florida or do you end up paying it to California because there's

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,130
two different state tax rates yes.

13
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:58,290
So generally speaking we have to have multiple filings they don't we we file.

14
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:07,790
So you know if we are if we have a yes hosts who say unreasonable you may have to have an airy rejoicing

15
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,830
I realized how can I have no idea what to do about his tax situation.

16
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,550
And it was really all right something that was really startling and also depressing that Abbie there's

17
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:24,920
so many kind of separate taxes and opportunities that he could take since is this is just is my job

18
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,460
in corporate America.

19
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,320
Make sure that how are in his green shirt.

20
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,700
Never look back there was a slide that was in between us I know that it is.

21
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:40,560
But that's the bulk of our climb told I was 8 percent of the gains that we have.

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,980
I mean only because everything is pretty good really.

23
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,390
We have a lot more.

24
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,330
And what why does is he.

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:54,300
Or is securely through our going he let it out with him tomorrow.

26
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,790
So I think it's also.

27
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:05,310
And that's how in a in elections like stuck on various pitches.

28
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:11,780
So it's that business expenses you need to have the zeem the date the amount and the central business

29
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:17,160
characteristic of the expense and all that is clearly shown on each of the cards.

30
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:24,830
So even if you slide over the screen and you want to split the middle yes or no just slide over the

31
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,810
screen shot in if you can press play it.

32
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,080
The screen shot plays Yes.

33
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:38,970
How fancy.

34
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,850
So you know you can see how much your tax deductions are going to go.

35
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,530
One it was sure the economy and the other one is right now.

36
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:57,080
So you know this is a great way to make sure that we try to really exceptions where you don't know how

37
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,550
much income it is out on expenses.

38
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,490
You have some money saving opportunities.

39
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,930
So you know around tax time at around the estimated tax filings you know it's never a surprise for you.

40
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,350
OK.

41
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,550
So so just kind of briefly covered.

42
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,710
Tom I realize that no one was talking to third parties you know.

43
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:20,640
So you're still arguing that you are getting from it's 2015 what you mean.

44
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,090
So it's a one time when I was once asked.

45
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:35,280
So it's one tool that you made is that specific to you on an artist and Jataka forms of life for two

46
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,800
or independent coping with.

47
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:43,080
And many who are so quick little snippet to know.

48
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:48,360
All right so your job is to contact parity of these contacts him Derek.

49
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,330
Sharon you ought to be talking about it.

50
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:57,340
I don't even try to talk to her.

51
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,330
So I wanted to finish with a couple other questions.

52
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:09,930
The next one question I had was I know that some Airbnb hosts have multiple properties and they incorporate.

53
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,010
So what point in time do you want to incorporate and when you do it what do you want to do.

54
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,830
Like an LLC and ask for pacy Corp. Yeah.

55
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:26,300
I mean I'm definitely no lawyer so I'm I can just kind of get general advice on this but I mean personally

56
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:34,990
speaking from a tax perspective if you have a pass through L.L.C. that's pretty that's a lot less work

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,470
from my perspective as you see Corbier S-Corp where we're by if you're Secord press corps you know you

58
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:51,640
are you're finally in a love in 20 which are corporate Hearn's and 11:29 and loving to us.

59
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,060
And then at what point should you incorporate you know it's really a case by case study.

60
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:03,060
And I think it incorporation really helps if you if you have a lot of personal assets that you want

61
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,060
to kind of protect.

62
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:14,330
So so yeah I think you know if you if you see that you'd like to do air B and B for time and you can

63
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,260
you think you can grow and build a business from it.

64
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,150
That might be a good time to think about.

65
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,490
You either incorporate or getting the LLC.

66
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,360
So you don't think there's.

67
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,650
Yeah I didn't realize that but if you're a C corporate S-Corp you'd end up paying corporate income tax

68
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,030
right.

69
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:39,350
S-Corp has passed through taxation both Secord correct so Secord generally like few if you want to get

70
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,300
an outside investor.

71
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,950
You know you have 100 properties and you want to grow sequent might then be preferred but if you're

72
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:51,840
just you know a mom and pop and you have one airbreathing be a property and you're funneling a C corp

73
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,450
you're going to have to pay all corporate taxes.

74
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,530
You know personal income taxes going to a certain degree double double.

75
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:05,540
So theoretically an LLC or an S corp could protect an Airbnb hosts against the worst possible outcome.

76
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:11,450
I mean I know that some we have some kind of umbrella insurance from Airbnb But does the LLC help a

77
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,470
little bit more.

78
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:13,540
Yeah.

79
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:23,280
So anytime you get kind of incorporated or LCD it does provide you know it does provide liability protection.

80
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,390
But in all honesty I don't really know.

81
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:32,650
I am unfortunately not a lawyer so I can't really speculate on the degree and level of protection that

82
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,340
you would get.

83
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:39,830
But I do know that you know a lot of hosts who own their property and then maybe another property they

84
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,510
do seek to get LLC.

85
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:51,820
OK so one other question I had was about the depreciation of your property because airplane be any vacation

86
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:57,090
rental property depreciates faster than if it was just sitting there being used by yourself.

87
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,300
How do you handle that in terms of tax deductions.

88
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,560
So.

89
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:07,340
So one quick thing to note on depreciation is you can depreciate the house you cannot appreciate the

90
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,140
old man.

91
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,230
And you know depreciation generally only comes into play if you own your own home.

92
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,540
So if you're renting you wouldn't appreciate it.

93
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:24,710
So you know it is kind of a case by case study of so.

94
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:30,030
So yeah there's certainly no real blanket ansaphone depreciating your property.

95
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:30,520
I know.

96
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,840
So I know that some of the students in the course actually own their own home and they're running it

97
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,990
out.

98
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,800
But do you have any idea how you would even tackle that.

99
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,130
Like how would you figure out how much is depreciated.

100
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:41,580
Yes.

101
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:51,170
You want to look for it you know depreciating your home is a little bit more tax technical.

102
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:57,220
So to try not to confuse your audience you know it just really depends on how much you purchased your

103
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:57,780
home.

104
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,240
You know what's your basis.

105
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,740
What type of improvements did you make to the property.

106
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:09,520
You know and then what type of depreciation schedule you know your property goes on that there are certain

107
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,210
different types of depreciation schedules that you'd want to go to.

108
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,930
But in terms of that if you're in Irving be host and you think you are doing your taxes and you want

109
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,140
to depreciate.

110
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,630
That is absolutely a time to go talk to a professional.

111
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:28,050
I definitely would not recommend anyone try to depreciate their home without seeking professional guidance.

112
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,580
First Ok let's see.

113
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:39,130
One other question I had was about audit triggers so we've identified that if you have a mismatch when

114
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,360
you're ten ninety nine and what you claim on your taxes that's pretty much an automatic trigger.

115
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,510
What are other triggers that you're aware of.

116
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,010
Yeah.

117
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:54,550
So the other one that those really popular three years of operating is on schedule C.

118
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,690
So what triggered the IRS is that you're operating.

119
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:06,930
Is that your schedule C activity is a hobby is hobby income and it's not truly a business.

120
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:13,130
It's simply operating to make a loss which is what this low.

121
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,760
So you know generally speaking another audit triggers three years of operating losses on your schedules.

122
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,300
Have you run into Be House that have been running unprofitable properties for multiple years.

123
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,870
I'm not.

124
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:36,590
Yeah I have had a client that had a huge loss in their first year with us because they had to get everything

125
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,270
else.

126
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,170
Gotcha.

127
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,870
Are there any there.

128
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,420
Because Arabs can be is treated differently in every city.

129
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:50,290
I'm in San Francisco and we just tried to figure out this occupancy tax thing.

130
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,800
Now we have all these rules on how much you can run out for how much and things like that.

131
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,120
Does the rule for taxation different in.

132
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:04,640
Have you ever noticed any states that make it really hard to claim your Airbnb property or where they

133
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,260
have a central roles that you have to do everything differently.

134
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:13,540
Yeah I mean I think what we're seeing is just the local news properties are just really trying to catch

135
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,360
up to technology.

136
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,370
I think it's going to be a matter of time before me.

137
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:25,820
Most of us are paying more taxes and whether that's you know actually factored in the cost.

138
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:33,430
And after you know so say for example here you're renting your room for $100 they may add on the additional

139
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:38,010
taxes after after the fact.

140
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,820
But I think it's just taking the cities all time just to catch up though.

141
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,720
Are you aware of any places that you have to pay like hotel tax.

142
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:53,620
Yeah Assef is collecting it right now and I foresee that you know in the future deploying more cities

143
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,550
are going to start collecting it because you know they're not on tax revenue.

144
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,860
Well so NSF the way they do it is the host doesn't see that tax at all.

145
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:08,020
We just noticed that if someone goes to our booking page it automatically adds it as another line item

146
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,750
expense on their book.

147
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,590
Have you ever seen it go the opposite way where like the host is now or is responsible instead.

148
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,380
Will the host should be responsible for their occupancy tax just because it's not being collected on

149
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,450
your behalf does that mean that you have to you haven't paid.

150
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:34,170
And I have spoken to the host who have been paying the local city's occupancy tax.

151
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,880
So you know it just because it's all been blocked it is I mean you don't have to pay and I have talked

152
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,760
to hosts that have been responsible have been paying.

153
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,590
So you know it's important to stay up to date on that.

154
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,850
Gotcha.

155
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,790
Let me think.

156
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,700
No I don't think I have any other questions.

157
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:00,190
So if anybody has any specific questions they can post it in the group discussion or you can always

158
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,390
email Derek Derek at shared economy CPA dot com.

159
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,050
Did I get that right.

160
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,200

161

164

All right.

166
