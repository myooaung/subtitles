00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,380
So if you've gotten this far in the course and you've finally gotten your listing up congratulations.

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,420
If you haven't gotten your listing up it's no big deal maybe you're just peeking ahead to see what we're

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,660
going to cover next.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,630
Nevertheless if you have it up that's amazing.

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,230
Now you're probably getting excited about what's going to happen when are you going to start getting

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,290
your bookings.

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,250
When are you going to be your first guest.

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,600
This section we're going to start going over one of the strategies that you want to employ at the very

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,960
beginning when you actually take your listing live.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,900
What are things you should worry about and what are things that you really don't actually need to worry

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,090
about.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,950
I think though that one thing that I really want to get across to everybody who's listening and everybody

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,380
is just starting out is that the beginning is crucial.

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:55,560
I mean their first four or five guest they are really make it or break it.

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,910
If you have a bad experience with your first say two guests and they both leave bad reviews that could

16
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:08,410
be a deal breaker that could make it such that you cannot take any more bookings because why would anyone

17
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,090
book at a place that has only two reviews.

18
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,480
And both of them are negative.

19
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:19,880
So I want you guys to focus really hard on making sure that the first guests have the best experiences

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,800
possible.

21
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,390
I know that's kind of hard considering you're starting out but you apply a little bit more effort.

22
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,990
You can have a much better outcome.

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:37,850
Keep in mind once you are actually experienced with your B and B property once you've had say 50 60

24
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:43,330
gasa or even 20 or 30 guess you'll get to the point where this is very much ordinated.

25
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,720
You just know what to do.

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,800
You know what works.

27
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,600
You know how to get your apartments clean.

28
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,220
You know what your guests like you know how to deal with bad guests.

29
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,460
When I run out my space I put about maybe 10 minutes of thought into each guest.

30
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,350
Previously when I first started man I probably put a couple hours in each guest.

31
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,850
I want you guys to think about you know as you're taking this course and you come up with any ideas

32
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,400
of things you think will really help the guest have a good time.

33
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:16,170
I want you to try to pull out the stops for these first couple of guests in the next section after the

34
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,580
section are and currently we're going to talk about how you maximize the guest experience and I'm going

35
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,200
to walk you through how I make sure that every guest has a good experience.

36
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,760
And Sarah is going to chime in too with her tips and tricks.

37
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:34,650
We're also going to cover things that I know that anybody can do that will make your reviews considerably

38
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,970
better and make the guest experiences considerably better.

39
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:44,690
You don't really have much of an excuse to have a say like a bad experience right off the bat because

40
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,270
I'm giving you the warning right now.

41
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,560
Don't blow it.

42
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,260
Try extra hard.

43
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,530
Throw these first one or two or three.

44
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,280
And trust me it gets a lot easier after that.
