00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:10,750
Here's a tip that I think will make a big difference in how quickly you go from new property to property

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,080
that is taking lots of bookings and making lots of money.

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,950
I call it hawking your calendar.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,130
Basically what this means is pay more attention to your vacancies.

5
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,320
Something that a lot of people just don't put any thought into is a month's coming up.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,990
They've booked out eight days or nine days out of the 30 days and that's it.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,100
That is generally care about it.

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,520
They'll set on a Friday night and that's the weekend.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,840
NO ONE books throughout the weekend.

10
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:44,050
Well I mean hocking your calendar I mean you need to look and see these vacancies as a problem go to

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,190
your calendar and keep lowering the price until you get people to book it.

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,200
If you're in a big market this is something that's always the case.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,190
I mean I always use people that are looking at your property.

14
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,010
You can go to your panel and look at your page views to make sure you are in fact getting people looking

15
00:00:59,010 --> 00:00:59,990
at your page views.

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,260
We're not getting bookings.

17
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,880
Keep learning your price if it's a day out drop with the price and have dropped to a price that you

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,110
think is even just worth it for you because what's going to happen is you're going to get the last second

19
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:16,320
bidder and you're going to steal the launch and other people who didn't move their price down what you

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,120
can do from nesses if you keep doing that and you consistently lower your price as you come up to the

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,620
date because you really want to get those bookings.

22
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,020
Now are you noticed like no one's booking this month I need to lower the price.

23
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,700
You're going to get a lot more bookings and you're going to get a lot more fill rates.

24
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,890
And most importantly are getting a lot more reviews.

25
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,390
Building up that review base faster than other properties is crucial.

26
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,310
Once you have enough previews in kind of maximize your price but you have to understand that you will

27
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,560
be comparing yourself to other people in your space and they're also gaining reviews as quickly as you

28
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,180
are.

29
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,280
So focus on what tactics you can use to get more people in and out to get more views so that you can

30
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,340
beat them in the review game you can pick up more per month.

31
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,330
You might actually surpass them if you're coming from behind or in front of them you might put a cozy

32
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,520
lead if this is the case that you're not incredibly competitive about this or you're doing a shared

33
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,300
space.

34
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:14,760
I think you should consider doing in a shared space Niiler this out when you feel like it or when it's

35
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,690
convenient to you.

36
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,250
I still think that you should identify the dates that it's most convenient to you and try to maximize

37
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,670
that time try to make sure that you do get bookings and even if you know say you know this weekend's

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,510
perfect I'm out of town and I want to run out my place and you're not getting bookings.

39
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:35,100
Sometimes I suggest lowering your price down to cost literally exactly what it costs you to rent it

40
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,160
just because you have the chance of getting a good review from that.

41
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,350
And that review itself will pay its off over time.

42
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,390
You guys have any questions about how to do this.

43
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,280
You know it's pretty easy to just go to air BMB look at your calendar.

44
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,750
Make sure that you check up with it.

45
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,940
You have a smartphone you can use Airbnb app and you can kind of fiddle with it there.

46
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,350
This just requires a lot more time on it.

47
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,900
A lot of people say I don't want to run this where I have a lot of maintenance I would say that this

48
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,160
doesn't take a ton of time.

49
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,450
It's only about 10 minutes a day maybe even 20 minutes today personally something that I find fun.

50
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,420
And so I was doing it naturally when I first started out I was just fiddling with the prices all day

51
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,740
long because it was kind of fun.

52
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,690
It's like watching this light bright board just light up in front of me as I took more booking than

53
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,040
I was clearly doing something right.

54
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,370
And so you guys kind of get in in that same kind of zone that I did have a lot of fun with that.

55
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,600
But I also think it's worth considering if you're only doing this casually as well.
