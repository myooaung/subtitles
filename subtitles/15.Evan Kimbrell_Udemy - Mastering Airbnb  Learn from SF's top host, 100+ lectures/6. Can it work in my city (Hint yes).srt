1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,390
So I'm going to talk a little bit about the question that I think probably everyone up until this point

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,270
is thinking to themselves probably sitting in your chair or maybe you're in your living room and you're

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,010
looking at the area or the apartment that you're hoping to rent out yourself.

4
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,560
But it can't possibly be true.

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,480
And I could rent this out for a lot of money and I'll be honest that's what I thought at first too and

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,720
I think that's what a lot of air B and B hosts thinks of themselves.

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,960
There's no way that this is worth anything.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,410
Maybe it's unimpressive to you because you live there you're so used to it it's there's no novelty to

9
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,060
it kind of has that same attitude about your town to wherever you live.

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,940
It's not worth seeing or paying lots of money to live here and have the experience I have every day

11
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,900
and I'm going to tell you that's probably wrong.

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,460
I want to set expectations.

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,990
I want people to be realistic about whether or not they can loose their space.

14
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:01,350
And I'm going to separate out this lecture into two parts in the next section we'll talk about realistically

15
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,780
whether or not the space inside your home if you're running a side apartment or your full apartment

16
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:12,060
whether or not that is something that is up to snuff compared to what's available in this lecture I'm

17
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:20,780
going to talk more about whether or not you can qualify or how to qualify your city your location whether

18
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,350
or not that is something that's going to allow you to do this and take advantage of the benefits of

19
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,970
home sharing.

20
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,360
I think that it's too it's worth looking at this with a tinge of optimism.

21
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,090
When I first started renting out Airbnb it was quite new.

22
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,370
It's one of those things that's like a lot of the Silicon Valley crazy ideas that everyone says that

23
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,580
sounds strange.

24
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,160
And then 45 years later it's just a fact of life.

25
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,460
That's another option.

26
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,780
And the vast majority of people use it or have heard about it.

27
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,370
I think we're kind of in a situation where the majority of people whether or not they're tech savvy

28
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:01,720
or not whether or not they're in the millennial generation or not they've heard about it.

29
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,720
It's no longer an early adopter thing.

30
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,190
My parents use it.

31
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,920
Most people probably listening you know people who use it or have used it or maybe their parents have

32
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,690
used it.

33
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:17,160
It has bridged generations so it's becoming more and more of an option everywhere.

34
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,920
It's not just limited to the big cities anymore.

35
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,060
I'm going to be honest.

36
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,890
You have an advantage if you're in a big city.

37
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,640
And the reason you have an advantage in a big city is that hotels are in a higher density.

38
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,520
Prices have gone up more of an opportunity for you to offer your space out but it's the case now that

39
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,920
midsize cities and even small cities.

40
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,230
This is definitely something that's possible and I'm going to help you through a little bit about how

41
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:46,070
to think about this and when not to validate is it worth going through the effort of posting it.

42
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,760
I going to tell you right now most of the time it's worth it.

43
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,350
I think it's worth considering a little bit about what do you want out of this when you're hearing me

44
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,180
talk about my space you're hearing Sarah talking about her space.

45
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,740
What did you think to yourself do you think.

46
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,020
You know I own my home.

47
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:09,340
I'd love to rent out the side efficiency kind of room three times a week get an extra 300 bucks a month.

48
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,730
Or are you thinking oh that fantastic.

49
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,390
I'd love to travel for a month and just rented out.

50
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,780
I'm going to tell you a little bit whether or not those options are available to you depends on the

51
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,930
city because certain cities have more density.

52
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,720
They have more bookers coming in and looking at the city.

53
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,740
And so a more popular destination is going to have more bookers which means that Europe the possibility

54
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:37,080
of running out your space in the second scenario becomes more likely you are always going to have the

55
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,340
option of being able to rent it out sometimes to get some extra pocket money.

56
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,350
That's always going to be on the table to illustrate my point.

57
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:51,030
This is actually my hometown and two years ago I never would have thought that people use Air B and

58
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,560
B to go to my hometown.

59
00:03:52,650 --> 00:04:00,210
My hometown is only about eighty five thousand people it's a mid size small ish city it's not a New

60
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:00,960
York City.

61
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:07,830
It's not a city with a million people it's not a Denver Colorado with a 600000 population it's about

62
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,620
85000 and it's primarily a college town.

63
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:18,780
And what really shocked me is that in the last year has really picked up in this small city.

64
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,820
People are listening out there space and they're getting reviews what I'm interpreting from this is

65
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,650
that people are booking out.

66
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:31,380
People are looking to the space and saying hey the city is saying hey Air B and B is an option.

67
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,460
It's something that we can do.

68
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:39,900
We don't have to stay at hotels and Aramean be as competitive in the space so don't be dismayed if you

69
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,360
live in a small city do be dismayed if you live in a mid-sized city.

70
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,510
Whether or not you can fill out your apartment 100 percent.

71
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,950
I don't know.

72
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,480
Say Lawrence Kansas.

73
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:56,430
I don't know if that's the case that you can do that I think and this is my intuition saying is that

74
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:02,450
you might not be able to get a 100 percent fail rate but because rents are lower your going to be able

75
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:08,900
to make money on top of it because you'll notice that ere being B you still rent out roughly around

76
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,700
what a hotel would charge.

77
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,680
That's like a price of a hotel but you get so much more.

78
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:19,150
And that's how you get the most bookings and the best bookings in small towns mid-sized towns is the

79
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,540
possibility really anywhere.

80
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,890
And I don't think you should ever rule this out automatically in your head saying I don't live in a

81
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,400
city that wants to go to.

82
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,270
I don't think anyone wants to go to my hometown.

83
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:35,510
But this is a town that you could get a duplex for $250 a month and people are running out their homes

84
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,770
for $400 a night and they're getting booked.

85
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,100
Is this happening.

86
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,870
And it's not just a once a month kind of thing it's happening multiple times in a month.

87
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,360
People are making money.

88
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,700
I want you to consider where you live.

89
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,450
The first thing you want to think about is realistically whether or not this could happen.

90
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:57,500
Do you live in an area that has the right demographics for Air B and B.

91
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:04,190
Like I said before everyone uses Airbnb now but there's a higher density within certain age groups if

92
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,790
you live in a college town chances are people in that college have heard of it.

93
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,930
Kids are those people are going to come back to visit.

94
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,430
Chances are they have friends who are coming to visit.

95
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,070
So it's very possible that area be as popular and you have people searching your location on air B and

96
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,810
B if you have that demographic.

97
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:29,400
Another way of identifying some demand is what are the reasons why people come to your city.

98
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,140
Do you have conventions.

99
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,210
That's interesting if you have conventions chances are hotels are going to fill up and chance are those

100
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,800
people that come to the conventions travel enough to know what Air B and B is in my hometown.

101
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,120
It's a college town so we have big football games.

102
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,320
We have basketball games and those happen quite regularly throughout the year so we have people coming

103
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,700
to visit all the time.

104
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,620
Maybe you live in an area that has great hiking or great skiing snowboarding.

105
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,680
Obviously this is going to be popular then because anybody and everybody's going to try to undercut

106
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,420
the hotels.

107
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,510
They don't want to go and you know spend $500 a night to stay in a.

108
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,970
Like I said a sterilized lodge if they can stay in someone else's home.

109
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,840
It's twice as comfy and it's just an it's half as you know half the price.

110
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,200
So think about the reasons.

111
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,520
Like I said Why do people come to your area.

112
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,210
Is it a tourist destination.

113
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,530
If it's got tourism just in general maybe it's just domestic maybe it's international doesn't really

114
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:21,950
matter.

115
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:26,180
People are coming and spending money and they're staying places and they want to have a good experience

116
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,120
then as possible.

117
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,740
So I guess I'd never rule out Arab and be.

118
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:37,510
But if you want to know for sure concretely say I don't want to just put up my listing.

119
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,690
You know the time to do that and throw it up there and then realize no one's here yet on the head of

120
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,450
the curve.

121
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,440
You can out pretty easily go to air B and B W W W dog hair b and b dot com and right on the page you

122
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,150
can just search for the city.

123
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,930
Pick a date.

124
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,070
Pick the date way out in the future.

125
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,820
Pick it for next week because it might be the case that everything is booked if there are actual options.

126
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,980
See what's there.

127
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:06,190
By the time you listen this might have changed but right at the moment they show 8 listings at a time.

128
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,880
So you'll see 8 listings based on your search inquiry and then you go to the next page you go to the

129
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,270
next page.

130
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,840
There are more than 8 listings then it looks like people use Airbnb.

131
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,510
The supply wouldn't be there if the demand wasn't there.

132
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,800
That's typically a good sign if there's less than 8 listings.

133
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,940
Maybe it's not a great sign.

134
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,130
There are some exceptions.

135
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,570
Maybe there's only four listings.

136
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,590
Maybe you live in a really small place you live in a really really small place but there's still four

137
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,720
listings that could actually be a good sign meaning that there's plenty of demand.

138
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,520
Not a lot of supply and there are still people booking.

139
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,460
Someone clearly took the time to put it up and that's the case there's only four.

140
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,910
That also means there's a pretty good opportunity for you to beat out everybody else by doing a better

141
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,350
job beating them in the search rankings because maybe they asleep at the wheel.

142
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,580
So what I would say doing is take the top three that show up on your search inquiry.

143
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,210
Click on the listings.

144
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,210
Did they put a lot of effort into the photographs.

145
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,130
That's usually a good indication that they're getting demand.

146
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,040
But the best way of telling is just to look at the reviews.

147
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,710
Look right at them how they are views that they have to they have 30 they have 20 to 18 maybe they have

148
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,580
10.

149
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,670
Like I said everybody It takes a while for it to spread.

150
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,850
So maybe this is new.

151
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,600
Maybe it's only picked up in last six months so don't discount it.

152
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:28,780
They don't have 100 reviews my property has 80 something probably had a lot more if I press people and

153
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,400
leaving reviews but I don't.

154
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,840
So check that out.

155
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,740
Here's one of the things I think is most important being me at the moment and they might change us by

156
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,090
the time you are listening to this small disclaimer.

157
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,530
If you go to the reviews you can see when they were posted and so you can see what the frequency of

158
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,520
staes are.

159
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,890
So maybe the case you look at it you already have three reviews for November.

160
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,060
That's a good sign.

161
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,210
Typically use this as a rule of thumb.

162
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,130
One out of three people ever view small towns.

163
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,830
Maybe one out of two.

164
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:03,820
I think in smaller towns they're more likely to have you on an empty property where they met the owners

165
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:09,280
more likely in a city that kind of just end up in a bigger property or they kind of shuffle them through.

166
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,280
People are less likely to leave her view but take that in consideration.

167
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,870
So it's November and you see that there's three previews for November already.

168
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:23,260
If it's a big city you can assume that nine people very state which means that they have quite the DNC

169
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,510
quite the booking occupancy.

170
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:32,430
Now if it's kind of the case that you only have one November one in October in each month maybe see

171
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,090
just one or something like that that could just mean that maybe they have three bookings a month but

172
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,620
that doesn't necessarily mean that they're just all the time they're empty.

173
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,070
What a lot of things could be happening.

174
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:46,090
One it could be that factor the host just doesn't like to rent out their apartment that much or their

175
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:50,950
space that much they only like to do it every now and then maybe they have very restrictive parameters

176
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,070
on when you can book two.

177
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,530
It's one of those properties are not a lot of people review it.

178
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,410
Some places they are more popular for trans..

179
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,750
Guess people are just staying for one night and passing through.

180
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:02,460
Less likely.

181
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,520
Waiver view.

182
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,330
It could also be that maybe they took a break.

183
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,530
That's another thing to look for.

184
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:12,910
And you see a break where maybe you see a review in June and then the one before that was in January

185
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,800
might mean that posters took a break.

186
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,380
So it's really hard to weed out what their preferences are.

187
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,480
You look at my property you know some months I just didn't feel like running it out sometimes I didn't

188
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,130
feel like running up more than a week in a week pays my rent and then some months I kind of went crazy

189
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:32,500
it was like hey I want to make a side income from this so it's really hard to infer directly from just

190
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,220
looking at the reviews I can get a decent idea and always look at multiple listings.

191
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,710
Right.

192
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,230
That's why I say look at the top three the top three are going to be the most popular and have the most

193
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,090
reviews.

194
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:47,320
But if you can establish that they are in fact getting bookings that's a pretty good show of proof.

195
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,740
I mean it's they are getting people they're getting inquiries maybe it's not a downpour of inquiries

196
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,640
but they're clearly booking people and those people are enjoying this day.

197
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,990
That's a good sign.

198
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,680
You're in an area where not a lot of listings.

199
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,120
And more importantly not a lot of reviews maybe are ahead of the curve.

200
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,730
Maybe it's not something that you should do or maybe it's a case that you want to put it up but you

201
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,420
want to spend less time putting it up and a lot of cases too if you own your own home.

202
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,340
Then you have no fixed cost problem.

203
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,260
You don't pay rent.

204
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,310
You just own it.

205
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,540
You pay property taxes.

206
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,850
But those are less than your rent.

207
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:28,670
Obviously in that case maybe a booking every two months.

208
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,920
That's good for you.

209
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,830
That is just free money.

210
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,180
It's a good way of connecting and even networking or if you're the kind of case that all people do is

211
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,440
they run out their space and then they go and stay at someone else's house.

212
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,190
Well in that case then it's just again extra money.

213
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,320
Like I said this is the first portion I'm deciding whether or not it's worth living your space.

214
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,410
Like I said more often than not it's worth listing your space and it's getting increasingly so every

215
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,730
day everyday more and more people are doing this as being the blowing up.

216
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,650
It's worth looking into this.

217
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:06,440
And if you listen my lecture previously about the air Byard room Urana also worth checking them out.

218
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,640
Just see maybe maybe the RBO has a lot of listings where you are eBay me hasn't caught on.

219
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:20,140
That's a distinct possibility although it's kind of small so if you have five minutes get on and just

220
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,130
kind of dig around look at where you're thinking of listing it.

221
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,490
Look at what other people are doing how are they doing.

222
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,050
Most importantly how many reviews they have.

223
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,940
What's the density of the reviews and a quick bet.

224
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,890
Why don't you just look at the calendar.

225
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,090
Some people have asked me the reason to look at the calendar is like I said before you don't know what

226
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:45,570
the host preferences are in the calendar will look full even if the host just says I'm not hosting anyone

227
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,980
this month or maybe I don't want someone this weekend.

228
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:53,290
That doesn't mean that it's booked and you can't tell the difference so the most popular properties

229
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,300
might just not be open for bookings.

230
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,890
That's why we don't look at the calendar and don't usually typically say that's a good reference point.

231
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:04,420
One other quick thing to keep in mind and this is a quick calculation you run in your head when you're

232
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,560
looking at your space.

233
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,800
Look at what people are running for.

234
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:14,080
That's also a decent indication of roughly how popular demand is and Judah's quickly in your head just

235
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,100
think what does a one bedroom cost for rent.

236
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,040
What does a two bedroom cost for rent.

237
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,010
And then look at the prices.

238
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,950
Multiply that out by say 10 days 15 days.

239
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,660
If it's a big margin you can tell people are able to post a premium.

240
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:34,100
They're really doing well if that number is closer to what they pay every day say you know the average

241
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,300
one veterans a thousand dollars but they're on average running out for $40.

242
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:43,640
Now these are a day after and every single day to catch or to meet their rent and utilities.

243
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:49,280
So that means that maybe there's not enough demand to insure a premium.

244
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:53,180
This obviously doesn't concern you if you just want to take the edge off your rent or to make some extra

245
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:53,980
money.

246
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,590
But if you are trying to turn this into a full time business that's generally a negative sign.

247
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:04,950
Any questions again post them in the group discussion send me a private message I can help you out too

248
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,890
if you're not totally sure I am.

249
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,000
And I looked at the reviews and it's really hard to tell.

250
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,590
I don't know what's going on.

251
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,490
Sometimes it helps with an experienced eye to look at it.

252
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,170
In the next section we're going to talk a little bit more about qualifying your space determining whether

253
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:26,800
or not this sick good host opportunity and determining whether or not you want her out of your apartment

254
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,410
or you are there or not you want to run out just a space.

255
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,870
And realistically what to expect to get out of that.

256
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,350
And what's the requirement to do that.
