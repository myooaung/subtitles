00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.360
So let's talk about cleaning fees.

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.640
That's something else that when you're making a listing you're going to need to set.

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.660
And this is something that gets calculated into the total price.

4
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.070
When they book your listing when they go and they enter in their dates and they enter in the number

5
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.010
of guests it'll calculate a price and then after that subtotal to give them a break down and one of

6
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.230
the items is the cleaning fee that will be next to the air and beefy Wharf in San Francisco.

7
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.200
The occupancy tax the hotel tax they're going to see that and a lot of times people are new LV and B

8
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.030
see that and they think that's strange that that's separated out.

9
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.230
You know I personally in my opinion it seems also a bit weird too.

10
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.620
But for the most part when you tack on a fee after the fact it seems to you it has less of an impact

11
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.480
I guess.

12
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.780
Let's say it's easier for someone to say yes I'm interested in a space for $200 with a $50 cleaning

13
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.090
fee than a space for $250.

14
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.140
This is different than hotels in the sense that hotels don't typically charge you for the cleaning fee

15
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.770
it's just baked in or is air B and B separates it out.

16
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.200
You can debate the pros and cons of that but it kind of is the way it is.

17
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.690
How do you set the cleaning fee.

18
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.950
You know this kind of depends and I know a lot of people when they start off they are going to be inclined

19
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.450
to clean themselves.

20
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.320
They're saying oh it's a spare room and really Carol clean it myself if that's your attitude about it.

21
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.370
That's great.

22
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.310
I'm going to say that it's going to get old very quickly and it usually does.

23
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.900
When I first started out I said I'm going to clean my spare space every time myself because you know

24
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.730
I want to keep all the money and or I don't want to charge a cleaning fee.

25
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.550
Why would I do that.

26
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:47.180
You know how clean Do I need to get and what I realized over time was that the standard for cleanliness

27
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.700
is a bit exhausting.

28
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.100
And it's a lot more strict than you think since people are paying money to stay in your space.

29
00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.130
It is better to have someone else come clean it who is good at creating spaces in general.

30
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.120
So it does give me more detail oriented someone's going to have the supplies does you know does this

31
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.660
part time full time that's going to get you a better outcome.

32
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.020
And it's also going to make this entire experience more enjoyable for you because you're not going to

33
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.860
spend a lot of time cleaning rooms and the whole idea behind Air B and B is to make more income doing

34
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.960
something you love that doesn't take a ton of time renting out my space takes very little time.

35
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.610
In some cases I have it set up such that my apartment gets rented out someone comes clean that the next

36
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.060
person gets checked in and I don't even realize this happens.

37
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.440
The only difference is I see a bear and be sending me checks to my bank account or a direct deposit

38
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.640
start on my bank account and then you know maybe one out of three or four people actually have some

39
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.710
interaction with them.

40
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.400
That's when I'm running out my entire space I'm gone.

41
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.490
But you want to get to the point where you're automating more of it because it's just going to be too

42
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.940
much to deal with at first.

43
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.910
If you are cleaning your spare space you know you I think it takes 10 minutes to do it correctly it's

44
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.560
going to take 30 minutes because you're going to do a lot more than you thought you can start doing

45
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.290
detailing and not just general cleaning you're going end up doing a lot of empty loads of laundry that

46
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.010
are only half filled and you end up you know if you're being smart about it you don't have to clean

47
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.910
the kitchen and clean the bathroom every single time.

48
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.050
So it's a lot more to it than you think.

49
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.840
And I'd strongly suggest getting someone else to clean it how you now calculate cleaning fees.

50
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.280
It just depends on where you are.

51
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.440
San Francisco is a lot of services for this.

52
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.210
Airbnb has its own cleaning service that they partnered with some other firm.

53
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.450
Their cleaning fee is just it makes no sense.

54
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.430
My apartment it's technically a two bedroom two bath and I turned into a three bedroom.

55
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.790
They charge $90 for cleaning which you break that down and it's suits me one person for three hours.

56
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.520
I didn't realize that when we have a doctorate student cleaning my apartment.

57
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.740
But it's a service.

58
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.890
And you know you pay extra because they handle a lot more than what you could do on your own because

59
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.060
if I was scheduling someone myself I'd have to be evaluating how well they cleaned it and make sure

60
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.840
that they show up and make sure that they keep a key in all sorts of these issues.

61
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.690
If you want to use a service look into the service see what the price says.

62
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.170
In San Francisco you hide a lot of options you can use TaskRabbit dot com.

63
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.730
It's a service that's quite helpful and you can build a rapport with someone too.

64
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.320
And so maybe they give you a discount because you can do bulk and that's better for you because they

65
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.340
are going to be better at cleaning space and going to be faster at it or you know maybe have a nephew

66
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.170
or a cousin or something who needs all that extra cash and you can throw it their way.

67
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.440
Typically in areas that are cheaper where labor costs are cheaper you're cleaning fees are going to

68
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.780
be lower to clean a full apartment so it's a two bedroom two bath you're going to need a good two hours

69
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.870
three hours.

70
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.860
So kind of figure what the average per hour rate is or if you want to clean it yourself every single

71
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.190
time.

72
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.350
Go for it but calculate what's worth it for you to do this every single time.

73
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.190
I think you're going to burn out.

74
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.510
But at least compensate yourself.

75
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.650
When you first start listing it we'll talk about this later more in depth.

76
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.570
I usually suggest maybe waiving the cleaning fee or putting it very low because you really don't want

77
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.580
to create more and more barriers to people booking because at first year religious subsidizing the first

78
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.650
couple rentals or first 20 rentals so you can get the review base because the review is really going

79
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.620
to build your credibility in the market.

80
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.710
The one thing I would say not to do is don't try to profit off of the cleaning fee.

81
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.860
I think the people who are booking are being slammed with enough fees as it is that I don't think it's

82
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.190
worth trying to make a margin on it.

83
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.030
And also you're not going to be making a lot of money.

84
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.820
I mean it's say your average rentals three day rental you get one fee one time if you're not your space

85
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:50.700
for $200 cleaning fees $50 and three nights that's $600 in total rental and $50 and cleaning fee don't

86
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.890
try to make money off of it.

87
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.310
Try to honestly calculate out what you think it'll actually get the cost to do.

88
00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:03.480
But then I want you to make sure that you are figuring out the easiest most pain free way to get it

89
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.030
cleaned.

90
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.890
Well if you have a cleaner and a cleaner says you know it's $10 an hour.

91
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:14.600
Pay them 15 because you really want them to care and you want them to really try hard because one stray

92
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.420
hair can just ruin a guest experience or in a lot of cases a lot of Gesell just freak out about that

93
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.010
very small things can make the experience go south very quickly.

94
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:32.620
So make sure you have enough money in your budget per cleaning to do it correctly.

95
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.080
That's why I say figure out what the average labor cost is.

96
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.350
Say 30 percent 40 percent.

97
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.580
That's a decent way of doing it.

98
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.620
If you live in an area where the cleaning is very expensive I would say do the opposite which is subsidize

99
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:53.360
it a little bit with my listing rents out for $400 a night and it costs me $90 to clean it but I only

100
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.100
charge a cleaning fee of 60 and that's simply because when people come and they're paying this much

101
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.100
to stay they really don't want to get slammed with another $90.

102
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.760
It just looks out of place.

103
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.530
And that's my strategy.

104
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:12.680
But that's something you'll do later once you're more experienced and you have your properties price

105
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.990
but the highest it can be because you've had a lot of experience with it.

106
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.660
Because any questions let me know.

107
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.710
I mentioned a couple of services in here that are specific to San Francisco but they are open in other

108
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:25.510
cities.

109
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.040
If you live in a city that doesn't have a lot of these services that are very easy to use of mobile

110
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.130
apps you can order your cleanings from.

111
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.580
I would just look around.

112
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.970
Craigslist is always a great place to find cleaners and especially cleaning services cleaning services.

113
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:45.590
You will pay more but you're going to manage them less so it's worth considering there's a lot of people

114
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:45.980
out there.

115
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.720
If you've a personal relationship with someone a college student who needs extra money this is a great

116
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.020
thing for them especially if they know it's consistent and you can send them your schedule beforehand.

117
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.900
That's generally what I would look into.
