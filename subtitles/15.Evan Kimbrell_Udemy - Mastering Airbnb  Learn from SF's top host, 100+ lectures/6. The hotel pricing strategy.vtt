00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.770
Here's a bonus strategy that I thought would be worth outlining and I touched on it a tad bit in the

2
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:18.960
last lecture talking about pricing strategies one way that you can almost guarantee yourself bookings

3
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.200
is what I call the hotel strategy go and look at the hotel space around you.

4
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.480
And this is especially true in markets that don't have a lot of air be in because you can do the same

5
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.690
exact thing you did with Airbnb Yunior scoping out the area.

6
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.310
You can do that with Priceline.com Orbitz or Expedia.

7
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.180
They all do the map and they show the map of what it cost to say a hotel around you.

8
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.150
And then in general what the price range is don't look for hotels that have Olympic sized swimming pools

9
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.500
or offer large amenities sets.

10
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.160
Look for the standard what a holiday and goes for something in the middle like a Marriott or whatever.

11
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.370
You don't necessarily have to convert up to a Motel 6.

12
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.310
It makes more sense to look for something that's mid range.

13
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.210
This almost works without fail.

14
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.680
If you have a one bedroom or even a two bedroom look at the hotel price make the calculation in your

15
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.430
head and then just offer roughly the same or more and then list your price at the same or less.

16
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.230
Typically what happens is when people are coming in there's a large contingent of people and I got this

17
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.150
information base of speaking a lot of my guests that look for hotels first and when they don't like

18
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.020
the prices look for Airbnb.

19
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.840
Or they at least do both searches before they book on air BNP.

20
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.930
So if they're coming in and they're looking for a hotel they'll see the hotel and say it's a hundred

21
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:38.790
dollars a night.

22
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.530
And then they look at your space and it's slightly better.

23
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.640
And it's $80 a night that's kind of an automatic win unless they're fly by night.

24
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.110
Somebody just came in wanted just find a place to crash and leave because they are not typically great

25
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.120
for that.

26
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.510
We'll talk a little bit more about how you should probably use the instant book strategy in general

27
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.800
but the couples with this strategy that if you want to compare yourself to a hotel you probably want

28
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.220
to be doing instant book.

29
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.790
We'll talk about that book later if you don't know what that is.

30
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.550
Don't worry.

31
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:15.860
We're going to cover it Strategy number four would be a hotel offered they offer an undercut the hotel.

32
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.590
They get so many people coming to him.

33
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.960
Those people are very price sensitive and more likely than not if they're coming for more than a day

34
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.690
or two and they thought about this at least a week in advance they're going to look on both systems

35
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.360
that is very it more and more common nowadays.

36
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.170
And if you don't have a one bedroom and it doesn't make the immediate conversion to one bedroom cost

37
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.900
$150 I can offer mine at 135.

38
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.590
So you have a two bedroom.

39
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.200
Now think about a group of two people who don't want to stay in the same room or a group of four and

40
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.450
they don't obviously want to stay in the same room.

41
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.440
What are they going to pay.

42
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.270
They're going to double it.

43
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.460
They're going to pay $300 if it's 150 or 200 dollars if each one is a hundred.

44
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.810
So you a two bedroom so beat that second prize offer below 300 or below 200.

45
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.230
Try to make your property as obvious of a choice as possible.

46
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.930
And keep in mind that people use hotels as a baseline when they make these decisions.
