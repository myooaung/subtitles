1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,770
So let's talk a little bit about what is this going to take up for and to get up on air PNB and to start

2
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,410
making money on your space.

3
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,130
If you want to do this correctly it's going to take a little bit of time.

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,390
How much time am I talking about and it takes six months.

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,930
Now it's going to take you six months to take you a month now I no it's not going to you know month

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:30,430
in order to get your listing up in a way that is going to solicit inquiries and solicit bookings.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,120
The way I look at it is you know is it the same amount of time you'd spend on building an actual side

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,780
business.

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,100
No.

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,680
No way is it about the same amount of time you'd spend on lunch today.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,570
Now it's going to be more than that.

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,800
It depends largely on how big is your space.

13
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,750
Do you have a lot of areas that you need to do photographs of.

14
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:56,090
Photography is probably one of the biggest things what tools you have available do you already have

15
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,100
a DSL or camera on an iPhone.

16
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,400
What do you have.

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,160
Are you good at writing a description of your place.

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,410
Are you already familiar with there being be at all help because you're going to spend very much time

19
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:11,190
figuring out their Web site figuring out a set up the automatic text reminders and things like that.

20
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:16,820
I think it's important to set your expectations though the more time you're going to spend on this the

21
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,360
more likely that you're going to have a good start.

22
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,170
Let me tell you a little bit about what kind of false start looks like there is a distinct possibility

23
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,940
that if you do not spend enough time on this you just say oh I don't spend 30 minutes on I'm going to

24
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,700
take some photos of my iPhone throw it up put a paragraph.

25
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,780
Don't be surprised if no one asks about your space.

26
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:47,240
There is a concept that I like to call the minimum assumption of quality when you go to a hotel to a

27
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,910
chain or maybe you're going to a place that you've never heard of before.

28
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,650
Maybe it's a local chain.

29
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,810
There is a minimal assumption of quality because when you tack on the word hotel kind of how does the

30
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,650
assumption that in the worst case scenario it's still going to be this good.

31
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,220
Right.

32
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,790
So we're have a check in desk right.

33
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:08,810
So get out of bed Datchet minimum assumption of quality means that there's always going to be kind of

34
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,120
a minimum floor that you're going to pay for a hotel.

35
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:17,640
You always get the same basic bare necessities no matter what their B and B on the other hand is different.

36
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:22,230
They do not have a minimum assumption of quality.

37
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,760
How is this possible.

38
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,950
When they started out they were literally running out couches.

39
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:35,490
They were literally running out air beds air bed Air B and B that's kind of what the play on the name

40
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,120
as if you live in San Francisco you can actually go and rent the CEO and founder of couch and it cost

41
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,050
$40 a night.

42
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,220
That's how they started out.

43
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:50,700
They started out as this convention overflow Web site for people who just wanted a space to sleep and

44
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:58,640
people do run out futons they do run out air beds they do rent out just a spot on the floor.

45
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,670
Those are on Airbnb those don't make up the majority of listings by any means.

46
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,970
But people know that's the baggage you carry when you think of Air B and B and you go to their website.

47
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,990
So when I book a space I don't automatically assume that I'm going to be sleeping in my own room in

48
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:18,630
my own bed with my own things and that whether or not the person is going to be available to meet me

49
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,110
or I don't have any assumptions.

50
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,640
When you think about when you're listening your space there's a certain bar to get over.

51
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,540
Think about it from a hosting perspective.

52
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,850
It's kind of crazy right that you can rent out a space in your apartment.

53
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,200
We are in our living room for $180 a night.

54
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,900
That does seem crazy now you're stopping and thinking about and you're looking at that space you it's

55
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,030
even crazier is the fact you think so own pay that amount of money if you just took some iPhone photos

56
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,010
and put a paragraph description.

57
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,870
You need to do a little bit more than that because like I said there is a minimum assumption of quality

58
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,570
if you don't have good photos you don't have a good description.

59
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,850
You don't put a little bit of time into the stuff people are going to assume you're not you're not really

60
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,350
engage in this process they don't want someone who has one foot in the door on the other foot out the

61
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:04,600
door.

62
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,470
They don't want that they don't show up and not know what to expect.

63
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:13,590
There is a bar that you're going to have to jump over to get to your first booking and I really don't

64
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,860
want people spent 30 minutes doing this.

65
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,400
Put it up and say Hey Evan I didn't get any inquiries at all.

66
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,450
You need to do a little bit more than that.

67
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,940
You need to write a little bit more about your scription you do a little more thought.

68
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,260
Are you going to spend 40 hours on this.

69
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,000
No way.

70
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:34,620
And part of this course is that I'm going to show you everything that I did and everything I know so

71
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,500
that you can cut out 80 percent of the upfront costs and the upfront time and to getting your listing

72
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,730
up and starting to make money.

73
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,820
When I first listened MySpace I put a lot of time into it.

74
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,610
I looked at design magazines.

75
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,420
I looked at what all the people around me I looked all my competitors I studied the hotels and what

76
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,430
the offerings were and how they changed their prices and I looked at every single space and I tried

77
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,950
to design each space.

78
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,290
And I went and I refurnished my entire apartment and I did all sorts of things that were in retrospect

79
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,490
I think were probably over the top to get your first inquiry.

80
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:18,990
But I still implore you that you must put in a decent amount of effort in order to get your first inquiry.

81
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,840
It's realistic to think that you put less effort up front and then as you slowly improve yourself.

82
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,940
But here is the drawback.

83
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:32,760
The biggest drawback to doing that kind of incremental Lego every listing I get I'll try to all improve

84
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,650
it and then keep going.

85
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,500
The biggest drawback to that is when you first launch your listening is not going to look its best it's

86
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,950
going to be the first version of it.

87
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:48,120
You might have your first guest leave you a bad review if you did not take the time to think this through.

88
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:53,160
If you get a bad review and it's your first bad review that could be a game ender that could actually

89
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,500
be such a problem that when people are looking at this they're going to say hey I don't want a book

90
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,230
of his own even one review and it's negative.

91
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:06,180
I'm going to teach you on this course how to get around that how to deal with negative reviews how to

92
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:13,560
get good reviews and how to prevent people from saying things you don't want how to avoid that swamp.

93
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,390
I really want it to be something that you take want it to be a point of pride when you do finally hit

94
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,460
the listing button.

95
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:24,330
And when people do finally come in your space you are comfortable knowing that the quality is going

96
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,290
to be high enough.

97
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,870
Obviously How do you know if a call is high enough.

98
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,360
Taking this course will definitely help you.

99
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:37,510
And Sarah I'm going to walk you through what we have experienced and what we know as the minimum bar

100
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,720
to getting up here and starting to make money.

101
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,120
Think of the time and effort you put up front like an investment.

102
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,990
Think about how much this could potentially change the game for you.

103
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:53,330
How it can change your financial situation how it can open up a new way of connecting with your city

104
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,700
that you know you didn't think about before.

105
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,440
Consider what that's worth and then kind of take that into consideration when you then go and put some

106
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,770
effort into making your listing look good before you hit the button to make it public.

107
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:11,270
Like I said this is not going to be a colossal effort up front but I think it's unrealistic to think

108
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,100
that you getting that done in an hour.

109
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,850
I also think that you're going to have some cost up front but in the long run it's so negligible.

110
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:23,510
You know the way I think of it it was if I go and I purchased some extra things that might liven up

111
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,910
my apartment or make it look good in photographs.

112
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,350
How much are really spending maybe they spend 100 boxes and 150 bucks 200 bucks.

113
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,150
What does that in terms of a rental.

114
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,050
If that gets me an extra rental Well then I'm broke even.

115
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,370
And that's kind of the thing is that you will break even very quickly if you do decide to spend some

116
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,580
money up front but anyway.

117
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,730
Don't be afraid.

118
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't think it's going to take as much effort as you think but it should require some effort if you're

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,010
not doing anything when you're doing something wrong.

120
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,930
But anyway throughout the course we'll walk you through pretty much everything we know that will make

121
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,710
you more likely to be successful and make more money.

122
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,650
Any questions throw him in the group discussions and make a private message.

123
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,420
Can you help validating your space.

124
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,230
You don't have a better idea of saying no.

125
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,780
How long is this going to take me or can it.
