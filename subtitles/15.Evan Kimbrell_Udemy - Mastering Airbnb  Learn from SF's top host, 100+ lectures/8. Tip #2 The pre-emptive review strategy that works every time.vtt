00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.810
Hosting Tip Number 7 I call this the preemptive review.

2
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:20.290
Now what I mean by a preemptive review sometimes when you have a guest you will know intuitively that

3
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.200
they didn't enjoy their stay.

4
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.650
If that's the case and sometimes you just can't help it sometimes you just get prickly people.

5
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:34.630
I remember one time having someone who complained because I didn't have multiple blankets for them and

6
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.290
so I went and bought a brand new day for them and then they complained that the DO THEY which was on

7
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.690
top of another blanket didn't have a sheet for it so they wouldn't use it.

8
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.660
You run into people like that you can't help it if you know that's the case that they enjoy their stay.

9
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.560
That means they're very likely negative review.

10
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.390
In my experience you know 70 percent of these people don't end up doing anything that is kind of say

11
00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.830
it's behind me.

12
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.720
But there is a 30 percent of people who think that they're the advocates for humanity and they're saving

13
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.120
people from this horrendous experience beforehand and so they really want to put something on your wall.

14
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.780
Now the preemptive review.

15
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.580
What it is is and I previously mentioned this in the last tip is that you can jump the gun a little

16
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.180
bit knowing that they had a negative experience and as soon as they leave.

17
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:30.030
Doing two things One you message them and you say sorry if anything was negative.

18
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.690
I really hope you enjoyed your time.

19
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.690
It's too bad that you know if you ever came back I would totally correct this.

20
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.190
But then what you say is if there's anything that you think I can improve on let me know and just tell

21
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.480
me because I'm trying really hard but I don't know every single thing that could go wrong.

22
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.660
And so it's a learning process.

23
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.660
And then what you can do is then you can also give the review let them know you left them review.

24
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.670
If you listen the last tip we know that the review system in Arabic is different now.

25
00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.020
So the second part of that doesn't have as much weight as it used to be used to be the case if we just

26
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.330
leave them in glowingly positive review.

27
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.730
And I made it really hard for them to then turn around and give you a negative review much less inclined

28
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.350
to they just kind of feel that that in this case what you can do is you can message them and say that

29
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.840
well a lot of times if you have mature agast they will recognize that since the person is willing to

30
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.000
change and willing to improve the correct way of doing this would be actually to give them private feedback

31
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.740
and to not post it permanently and publicly.

32
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.600
And here's the thing.

33
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.080
As a lot of people they just will post it permanently and publicly and they're not mature or they're

34
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.280
not someone who looks at that and goes oh they're actually trying to improve and this doesn't make sense

35
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.470
because as soon as I post it though I've made changes so it's not actually a proper representation of

36
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.270
their property.

37
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.810
A lot of people just don't get that so that's one way of doing that.

38
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.470
And I think that'll reduce the rates of how many people will post negatively get probably caught on

39
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.720
your bad reviews and half.

40
00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.570
There is a small more vocal minority that you cannot really silence that way.

41
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:11.230
And so I would refer back to the bit I did on damage control because that lecture covers a lot more

42
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.030
what to do when you get the bad review because there is very much a process that you should go through.

43
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.000
So go back and listen to that lecture.

44
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.340
Now this I think is definitely something you should add to your tool kit.

45
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.080
It'll definitely reduce how many negative reviews you get or at least how many little anxious after

46
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.560
they leave.

47
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.730
Like are they going to give me a negative review kind of feelings.

48
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.860
You guys have any questions post it in the group discussion.

49
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.850
I might even put in the research sections like templates for what I responded and I can't even screen

50
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.320
shot some of the preemptive messages that I sent people that I thought it better reviews and we can

51
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.750
kind of see how they went.

52
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.960
Is that something you guys are interested but you've got to let me know I suppose in the group discussion.
