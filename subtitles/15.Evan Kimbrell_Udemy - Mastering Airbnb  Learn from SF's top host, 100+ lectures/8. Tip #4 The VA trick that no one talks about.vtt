00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.580
Hosting tip number 10 this is the virtual assistant trick.

2
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.790
This one's a little bit farther out there.

3
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.110
This might be something that you guys really want to just absolutely rock the experience is something

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.300
and play around with.

5
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.360
There are all of you to me courses that talk about virtual assistants and what you can do with them

6
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.980
and how cheap they are.

7
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.410
So it's something that I've had some experience with before in the past I've used them to compile any

8
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.570
type of basic data that I need or help you get through your email and you can get them that you know

9
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.930
research thing make make appointments all sorts of stuff like that.

10
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.220
Hopefully you have some kind of familiarity with this but you might think yourself how can I apply this

11
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.710
Air B and B there's a lot of ways playas to your hosting experience.

12
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.970
I'm only going to talk about one real quick.

13
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.590
What I did and I did this during the summer when I was out of the country and I knew that you know I

14
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.350
had over the course of the summer many 35 groups something like that.

15
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:05.050
So what I ended up doing was hiring a virtual assistant and all they did was compile some list of events

16
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.260
and then actual times when the person was checking and or during the reservation text their numbers

17
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.800
and say Here are some events and now that you can have them e-mail it you could have them text it and

18
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.130
it's so easy to find like what are 10 events this week going on in San Francisco.

19
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.410
Very easy to find 10 events so you can even narrow it down to two or three or four.

20
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.360
San Francisco is a big city there's always something going on and that's always something that's cool

21
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.850
that the guests you know they don't know what's happening.

22
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.660
They don't know that they might have come during like the Gay Pride Parade which is a big deal in San

23
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.900
Francisco or any of the goofier things we do like the beta breaker's marathon which is really popular

24
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.090
or you know America's Cup was going on.

25
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.430
There's a lot of stuff happening.

26
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.790
And any city is going to have stuff happening.

27
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.770
That was really really simple.

28
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.150
All I did was spend a couple hours just writing down what the events are for the month.

29
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.390
And I sent them the schedule and I sent on the phone numbers and I was done and I told them text them

30
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.350
three or four.

31
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.730
And here's the text you send them.

32
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:14.110
And I was literally at I mean the entire thing probably cost me $40 a month it just wasn't much at all

33
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.660
and it's really just a nice little feature on top of it.

34
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.170
I had no control of the process at all.

35
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.500
I just told them you know go and look for events.

36
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.890
Here's a web site you can find it.

37
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.420
I was using like Thrillist puts a lot of events and event bright will make a.

38
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.150
They have a feed that shows all of the popular events happening in San Francisco.

39
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.950
You can totally get into this you can tailor a chair your guests need like you can tell what their interests

40
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.780
are and tailor it that way or you just pick the top two or three whether or not people even went to

41
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.200
them.

42
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.050
Does it really matter.

43
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.370
Had some people come back and say you know we went to this event.

44
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.760
Thanks for giving us the heads up on it.

45
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.750
It's just a nice little thing you can do.

46
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.890
There's tons of things I think you could do with virtual assistance around host experience and maintenance

47
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.720
and ordering the right supplies.

48
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.830
We'll leave it up to you guys and you guys can come up with some better ideas how to handle this.

49
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.520
But that's one way that I used it.

50
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.290
If you're not familiar and you can use oDesk dotcom or freelancer dotcom you don't need someone who

51
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.870
is in the United States to do this.

52
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.590
I just knew someone in India they worked out perfectly fine.

53
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.700
Honestly this whole process took me maybe maybe an hour and I did this in May.

54
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.720
And you know it's still going now.

55
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.130
You guys have any questions you have any ideas for it.

56
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.930
You know I mean you go any more in depth on it.

57
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.760
Just let me know.

58
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.570
But it's something you should play around with virtual.
