00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.730
Tip number three I call this the cheap nothing left.

2
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.460
This is something that I experimented with through my hosting experience and it's one of my favorite

3
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.440
Airbnb hacks.

4
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.980
Now when is the cheap nothing gift when you have agast they're paying you to stay in your place if you

5
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.560
want to make sure that they have a good time.

6
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.740
One of the things you can do is you can buy them a gift a gift feels very personal.

7
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.420
It feels as if all of a sudden it's not a hotel it's a relationship that I'm having with my host.

8
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.890
It kind of almost reverses the dynamic between the host and the guest and it's almost like people forget

9
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.000
who's paying who I used to joke about how I can buy a gift for one of my guests give it to them.

10
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.910
And it's almost as if now I'm paying them to stay or something like that.

11
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.540
You know that's how they feel they feel like oh wow what a privilege.

12
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.160
Now why don't I call it the cheap nothing.

13
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.720
Because the point is the intention if you give them a gift that is enough in and of itself to make them

14
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.370
feel like this is a great stay you really don't need to spend a lot of money on the gift.

15
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:24.380
So what I would do is I would give a bottle of wine and glasses to my guests the wine.

16
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.310
I would always pick the same wine I'd buy in bulk.

17
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.630
So if I knew before the month was starting I knew that I had nine guests I'd buy nine bottles of wine.

18
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.210
When you buy them in bulk they get significantly cheaper.

19
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.050
You can buy them at Costco.

20
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.440
I suggest you buy something that you like or has some kind of regional connection because that's going

21
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.150
to make it more personal because you can write a note next to it or explain to them this is why I bought

22
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.300
it.

23
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.820
Not just I just bought a random bottle of wine wine that I picked as one of my favorites it's a Zinfandel.

24
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.900
I mean I live in San Francisco and we live right next to Napa Valley and the Zen I got was from Lodi

25
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.750
Valley load of Olives outside of Napa Valley one of the great things about that as I can say oh this

26
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.090
comes from Lodi.

27
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.160
You've never heard of it.

28
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.850
Well that's because I'm a local.

29
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.510
I know what's better than Napa Valley.

30
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.060
LODI valleys the cheap wine.

31
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.070
So that makes it sound like oh they found a secret.

32
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.390
You know wow if I lived anywhere else so no you got me some expensive large vineyard.

33
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.350
But this person lives here and knows the ins and outs of it.

34
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.390
That's not necessarily true it's just it is a good wine you can also get very very good wine in Napa.

35
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.420
I picked wine as my cheap nothing gift because previously I'd mentioned this in the course.

36
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.850
It's kind of an experience smoother if they have bumps in the road throughout their stay.

37
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.290
When you do give them a gift it makes them feel a lot better.

38
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.580
But also wine people are always going to have a good time if they're drunk especially if you have couples

39
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.460
like so if you have a honeymoon or you have an old couple coming in they drink wine and all of a sudden

40
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.440
they're just having a fantastic time especially great if they have the case where you might have guessed

41
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.070
who you are kind of wondering if they're going to give you a negative review.

42
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.710
Maybe they're a little prickly.

43
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.510
Watch their guards come down if you give them a bottle of wine.

44
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.930
And if you're worried about you know what happens if I give them the wine they don't drink it while

45
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.620
you still get the bonus of the gift.

46
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.490
Then you get the bottle of wine back and you give it to the next guest.

47
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.530
And then also what I usually would do is I would I bought what's called a Houdini.

48
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.610
Now add this and the reference it is the easiest way I've ever encountered to open a bottle of wine.

49
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.140
There's really no struggle with it at all.

50
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.070
It's just that when you clamp around the neck and you press the button down you press the button up

51
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.790
and it's open.

52
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.090
And so what I would do and I give the gift to them as I put that right next to it with two wine glasses

53
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.370
so I'm trying to make this as frictionless as possible if they're ever setting in the room or setting

54
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.680
in the apartment and they have five minutes someone's probably going to play with the Houdini open it

55
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.680
and drink it.

56
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:46.550
And that's what I want.

57
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.110
I want them to have a good time.

58
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.660
And so I think consuming the bottle of wine is a good time also big plus they always drink like half

59
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.190
the wine and so when I would come in the next day as long as they corked it then I got to drink the

60
00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.450
wine.

61
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.370
It was almost like free wine with that.

62
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.450
I call it the cheap nothing because that bottle you don't end up being like I said previously I rent

63
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.330
out my apartment for $400 a night.

64
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.630
What's a bottle of wine like $8 and you buy it and bowl so you can get the cheaper stuff.

65
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.920
But again like what's there answering a $20 bottle of wine and a $10 bottle of wine go with the one

66
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.470
you thinks in it.

67
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:21.520
You know I have a story with another example what I would also like to do and this is something that

68
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.140
I would do in a case that maybe at a group that didn't want a wine bottle.

69
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.700
Maybe you have a group of people who are in their early 20s or something.

70
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.910
I'll have next to Garofoli square.

71
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:39.030
I used to walk down and they would give away free chocolate squares and at the entrance you walk in

72
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.510
and they have your choice of chocolate squares and the people who are handing them out they don't care.

73
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.890
They work from 9 to 5 for a flat wage.

74
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.550
So I just walk in circles and collect several of them.

75
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.780
And that's always great because they would leave the apartment and then they come back put the chocolates

76
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.180
on the pillow and that's nice because it has a flavor of San Francisco as a place.

77
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.610
You know Gerontius Square is in San Francisco.

78
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.530
So they feel like hey this is a very personal gift it's it's connected to San Francisco it's not like

79
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.770
I got them you know Hershey's bar or something.

80
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.040
It was free because I can just walk in circles and collect samples cheap nothing left that is a fantastic

81
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.920
way to make your guests happy.

82
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.370
And many times and my hosting experience it has saved the rental.

83
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.050
I just know it's going to be bad.

84
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.300
And how many things have gone wrong and it just sometimes just happens and so I try to save it by giving

85
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.900
gifts.

86
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.570
Worst case scenario it makes them think twice about giving you a bad review.

87
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.180
But it's something I definitely think you should consider doing the more thoughtful things you do like

88
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.490
that the more likely the gas is going to be happy.

89
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.050
Give a positive review.

90
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.340
You don't have to spend tons of time you know researching your gas and thinking about what they like.

91
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.730
Chances are they like chocolate.

92
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.000
Chances are they like wine.

93
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.720
Most human beings do.

94
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.850
So pick something that almost everybody likes and just make a system.

95
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.790
Buy in bulk beforehand.

96
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.350
Know when they're coming and know you know where you always set it up and you know and again maybe it

97
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.180
feels a little and personal but the same time they end up having a great experience.

98
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.670
You know what I used to do is write notes next to the bottle.

99
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.790
And I do handwritten notes and I'd write the same thing over and over and over again.

100
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.830
So I had a whole month's worth bready maybe changing details based on what the guests are.

101
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.250
But it's this is something you can just bang out very quickly.

102
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.040
Makes a huge difference in the reviews you get.

103
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.820
You guys have any other questions you have any ideas or experiences if you guys have tried this out

104
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.880
posted in the group discussion and we can kind of try to nitpick it.
