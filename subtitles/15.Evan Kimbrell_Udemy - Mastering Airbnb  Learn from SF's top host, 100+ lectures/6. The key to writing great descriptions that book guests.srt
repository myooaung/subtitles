1
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:13,470
Let's talk about the description portion of your listing I don't want you to look at this section and

2
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,900
get overwhelmed.

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,770
I think a lot of times people when they're making their listings look at other people's properties and

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:28,390
see that they have listings that are well-thought out and long really don't worry about that one.

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,940
They're very easy to write and to in my opinion they are the third most important thing on your listing

6
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,060
and there aren't that many things on your listing to begin with.

7
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,770
Number one thing for someone who's booking are your photos followed by reviews.

8
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:43,730
Don't sweat it.

9
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,820
It's not particularly hard.

10
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,430
You know this is something that I don't think should take longer than 15 minutes 20 minutes.

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,540
It's also something that you can write kind of in a modular sense meaning that you can write one paragraph.

12
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,530
Use that as your description and come back when you thought of something to add and then add another

13
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,660
paragraph and then another and another until you have something that is somewhat comprehensive.

14
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,040
Don't shy away from writing a long description.

15
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,760
The longer really the better.

16
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,630
I mean they don't really put any limit on how much information you can put.

17
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:20,550
So this is your time to explain why your space is good why it's great and why everyone should come so

18
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,730
we should really take this opportunity to be enthusiastic about your space.

19
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,800
Don't be matter of factual.

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,160
Don't just say you know this is what it is is what it is.

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,420
Period.

22
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,950
Also you know I typically say shy away from being outright negative in your descriptions.

23
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:44,000
That seems obvious but I think what I'm talking about more so are situations where you know they write

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,570
a paragraph and the second paragraph they start talking about the things you can't do.

25
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,730
You can't use the kitchen.

26
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,420
Please don't smoke things like that it seems odd when the second paragraph you've already run out of

27
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,180
nice things to say about your space.

28
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,820
The best advice I can give you from when you're writing your description and this is what I did was

29
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,800
copy other people.

30
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,630
It's as simple as that.

31
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,660
You know you don't even have to do this with other properties in your area.

32
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,490
You can do it from other cities or other state pick popular properties you think have done a good job

33
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,530
description and use their format.

34
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,690
You can quite literally copy and paste their description and then just use it as a template.

35
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,850
First sentence it appears that they open up with a kind of a zingy one liner that tries to bring out

36
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:31,670
something interesting about the city itself and not the space so they try to cram in as many adjectives.

37
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:39,370
It's a cozy comfortable and quaint room and it's in this place with warm and fuzzy adjectives.

38
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,300
People do a very good job of this making their descriptions see what they do see what they mention and

39
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,830
then convert it for what you're doing.

40
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:51,980
So you know if someone says I live five minutes from this place or five minutes from this place you

41
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,750
can do the same exact thing in the same exact format just say you're five minutes from something that

42
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,620
you were actually five minutes from doing all these you just copy and paste that wouldn't work but just

43
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,960
generally look at the format that they use and say that's how I used it.

44
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,650
I first tried to write it and I just kind of clueless and then I started looking into other people were

45
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,570
doing it and I just found someone I said I like how they do it.

46
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,860
And there's another section on here I talk a little bit about how you should try to create a rambling

47
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,780
text in the sense that you'll keep running with the hand.

48
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,600
Here's another thing and here's another thing and here's another thing in terms of your bullet points

49
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,030
for why you should be interested in this space.

50
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:35,690
More on that later so I brought up my description from MySpace and what we can do is we can actually

51
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:43,000
just go through this and I can read it out loud and tell you kind of what I was thinking and why I kind

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,420
of wrote it that way.

53
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,030
Air B and B has changed recently so they change it now.

54
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:54,140
So you're actually putting smaller descriptions in some headers so they have a header called like the

55
00:03:54,140 --> 00:04:01,150
space and they'll have a header guest access interaction with guests over a view that's another section.

56
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,270
It used to just be you just had a big block attacks but you have to understand that the way that comes

57
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,680
out now it's the same way.

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,980
You can literally write the same block of text you just know that there are always going to display

59
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,930
in the same order.

60
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,180
So like the space is always going to be the first thing that shows with the exception of the overview

61
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,580
which shows at the top of the listening to the overview is not going to let you display more than two

62
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:23,990
sentences or three sentences that keep that short and you also don't even necessarily have to do the

63
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,890
overview.

64
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,690
If you see on my listing this is actually because I haven't updated it since they changed their interface.

65
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,170
I don't actually plan on updating that overview.

66
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,570
Maybe in the future I will you're looking at my description.

67
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,040
It starts off and says Come stay in are huge.

68
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,550
And I put in parentheses there 200 square feet apartment right by the waterfront.

69
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,440
Come stay in our huge I mean come stay it's welcoming it's a persons are getting it.

70
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,770
It's pulling out to them it's like literally kind of talking to them.

71
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,960
That's a strategy that I like to use like I'm talking directly the person who's reading this.

72
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,330
It also sounds kind of professional at least in a sense that you would hear a hotel say that I put huge

73
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,060
because that is a key differentiator of my space.

74
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,830
It's much larger than other places spaces and I put in square feet terms and this is something that's

75
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,790
virtually meaningless because no one else is going to display their square feet.

76
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,180
Partially that's because in San Francisco everyone's apartments are so small.

77
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,250
No one's going to say Come check out my space 300 square feet.

78
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,000
When you hear 300 You probably think it's like a prison cell.

79
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,870
Who in their head knows exactly what that looks like.

80
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,200
But it does sound large and I'm not being dishonest or disingenuous.

81
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,760
It is actually large.

82
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,720
And I say it right by the waterfront.

83
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,340
That is a big thing about my apartment we are right by the waterfront you can literally walk to it.

84
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:42,980
When people think of San Francisco they do actually think about waterfront scenes and that's something

85
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:48,110
that I was kind of harping on and that's just kind of like an attention grabber when I say like copying

86
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,670
other people you could copy this and say come stay at our.

87
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,350
And you just fell out.

88
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,230
Come stay at my cozy apartment in the mountain whatever it is.

89
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,050
You're not going to have to hire someone to go.

90
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,370
Right.

91
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,850
This is this is something you can honestly type out very very quickly as it's devoid of typos.

92
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,570
The grammar I'm sure is wrong in my listing and it's something that people really don't care.

93
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,570
It's about readability.

94
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,350
It says right next to all the great tourist hotspots.

95
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,890
Comma the apartment is ideal for seeing the city.

96
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,760
That's what I was kind of angling my apartment after I wanted it to sound like English at first tourist

97
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,460
because tourists are typically the ones who are going to accept me acceptable a larger premium.

98
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,580
You know I said the apartment is ideal for seeing the city.

99
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,570
That's something that people are very worried about especially in tourist cities.

100
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:37,760
They want to make sure that they don't make a mistake getting an apartment that's near one thing but

101
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,230
far away from the other 10 things that they want to do and a lot of people are pressed for time.

102
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,860
And so it's very important to them that they you know when they want to stay somewhere they want to

103
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:52,250
be close to it and be like within walking distance so they don't have to spend a lot of time in transit.

104
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,650
And I put two feet from our doorstep you can see Alcatraz in plain view.

105
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,720
That's true.

106
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,780
I mean that's just something that some people can't really compete with that actually is a very cool

107
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,550
feature of my apartment.

108
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,410
And five steps away you can hop on the iconic Hyde Powell cable car.

109
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,020
That is true we are right next to the cable car that runs past our apartment.

110
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,000
Another very big point.

111
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,870
Those are two things that I think are very unique and I think it would help you know if you can think

112
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,060
of at least two things that are unique in your space.

113
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,170
You can add those.

114
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,150
And then I said within five minutes walk to some of the most popular and photogenic spots in San Francisco

115
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,990
what I'd done is I went to Google Maps and I knew roughly what top five things people want to do.

116
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,070
And if you don't know good at Trip Advisor type in your city and I'll give you the top five things or

117
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:38,390
Lonely Planet dot com those I'll tell you the top five things you want to do.

118
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:44,000
And then you can you know typed those into Google Maps plus your address and I'll give you a walking

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,140
calculation.

120
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,150
The walking calculation is always slow.

121
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:53,410
So in some cases I used my walking speed which is much faster but it's not double by any means.

122
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,300
In actuality if someone's new to your city it's in to take them much much longer because they can be

123
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,250
wandering especially if they're tourists sightseeing and then I list all the things that I'm with in

124
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,090
five minutes too.

125
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,600
That's just something that gets in their head it says you know I'm literally right next to all these

126
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,980
things and a lot of times people don't even know what these are.

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,220
When I say I like Pier 39 Beach Street guardedly square Lombard Street Fort Mason and North Beach if

128
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,020
they've done their homework they know what those are if they haven't or maybe they've done limited research

129
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,920
and know what a couple of the things are but the point is I listened to everything that I could possibly

130
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,750
think of that 20th in five minutes and that's something that the city can say oh you know if all else

131
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,320
fails we can do these five things because they're very very close.

132
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,730
This is one sentence that I thought was interesting but why pay $300 a night at a hotel when you can

133
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:40,080
rent our entire three bed three bath for the same price.

134
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,470
Earlier we talked about pricing strategies.

135
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:49,050
I was mentioning that one of the strategies you can do is find the price for a hotel and make sure that

136
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,340
you're under it.

137
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,800
My apartment is under the pricing for a hotel or a comparable space that would house the same amount

138
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,690
of people.

139
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,560
So that's a very good point a lot of people are coming Air B and B and this is something I suggest you

140
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,620
put in your description you can kind of dissuade people from doing hotels.

141
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,980
You can say this is why we're better than a hotel.

142
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,970
Don't be afraid to compare yourself because that is the default option and it's going be a long time

143
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,610
before Airbnb becomes the default option.

144
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,490
And so that was a pretty easy calculation.

145
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,390
You can actually stay down the street and you're going to pay $3 a night for one hotel room that fits

146
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,410
two people.

147
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,900
Our apartment is roughly the same price.

148
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:30,180
And the next thing I put was walk score the Walk Score is a Web site you can go to it's just walk score

149
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,170
dotcom all added in the extras for the course.

150
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:38,730
You can find in the resources section what it does is it calculates how close you are to things like

151
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,240
coffee things like groceries points of interest bars things like that.

152
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,270
So some people have an walkable space as some people have very high walk scores.

153
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:52,140
So this is kind of a loophole in the sense that every single intersection in San Francisco is going

154
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,370
have a walk score or 90 because it's a very compact urban environment.

155
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,830
Everywhere you are you are close to the necessities that walk score can centers on they're taking it

156
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,450
in you know creating this calculation to determine how walkable your spaces.

157
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,490
And 91 in relativity to San Francisco that's actually kind of low.

158
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,460
But again that's kind of the thing is like if the host showing off their walk score that probably means

159
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,850
that walk score is good even if that means nothing to you.

160
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:23,260
This is something that you know I suggest updating when I had just started listing this.

161
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,860
I said we're only one point five blocks from the wharf and less than five minutes walk from Marina Green

162
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,650
Fort Mason Crissy Field and there is an event called America's Cup.

163
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,920
And now something that was actually very very close to our space and so I put a little paragraph saying

164
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,320
this is a great spot for events because a lot of people were looking for that.

165
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:45,700
If you are listing a space and you think you're going to be capitalizing on events a lot of times this

166
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,920
is what happens if you're missing a space and say Austin Texas you're going to be making a large amount

167
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,720
of money in a short period of time during South by Southwest and then the rest of the time you're really

168
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,830
making a very modest amount of money.

169
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:05,930
So it's very important that in some of these cases you put a description saying that this place is pre-qualified

170
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,980
for this event.

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,150
I've already decided this is great for an event.

172
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,260
I don't think it's a great idea to put that is the first thing unless you really think that's the only

173
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,460
thing people are looking for.

174
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,510
I thought it was good in the second sentence because even if people aren't interested in the event they

175
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,490
can see oh this is something that's close to a very popular event.

176
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:31,240
And then the next paragraph is actually the bulk of my description and honestly I just pick three adjectives

177
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,320
that I thought fit the space.

178
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,940
Take that three that I think fit the best I said Sunny spacious and warm which is true it is sunny it

179
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,850
is spacious and because of the sunniness it's warm.

180
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,380
And I said you have the entire space all yourself.

181
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:50,170
It's classically San Francisco in the building was built a little over 100 years ago after the great

182
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,280
quake.

183
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,210
Always take if you have the opportunity insert some local cultural reference.

184
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,940
If you don't have this then don't worry about it.

185
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,620
Then you would.

186
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,700
You'd heart more in like the convenience of your spot or the amenities or spot if you do have a home

187
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,170
that is quite cool and does have some quirkiness and some uniqueness to it.

188
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:13,750
Definitely mention these things say something about the architecture or say something about make a connection

189
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,950
to the history of the area.

190
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,960
And that's great boutique hotels.

191
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:26,800
They command a premium over say regular hotels or hip boutique hotels and a lot of times hip boutique

192
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:33,400
hotels are places that have a connection to the history of the area they're in they're in nice buildings

193
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:39,010
they're in historic buildings they're in apartments that are quirky and different and only a way that

194
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,740
your area could kind of essentially wait if you have a loft in Brooklyn.

195
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,430
There's a Brooklyn style to that loft that's something that you would want to talk about in the rest

196
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:48,640
of it.

197
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,950
I just kind of focused on anything I could think of.

198
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,340
You know I think it's helpful to go in your head and make a quick one through five.

199
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,570
What are the top five reasons you should stay at your apartment and make sure you get all five of those

200
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,920
in there and then pass that you're really just covering all the bases making sure that you don't leave

201
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,250
anything out where someone might notice oh something's missing and that might be a problem.

202
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,940
So they spend their time asking you about it as opposed to just booking.

203
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,940
And I just talked about how his newly renovated.

204
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,830
I talk about how large the living room is.

205
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,480
I talk about how close we are.

206
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,040
How you guys can't read the screen.

207
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:27,650
Make sure that you can actually grab the in the resources section I have this description up then just

208
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:33,740
kind of went into a sentence where I just listed out all of the things that were nice like back patio

209
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:38,990
custom cabinetry and you furnish new refrigerators central heating huge windows things like that so

210
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,110
you should know your space pretty well you should know what the positives not the negatives are.

211
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,480
You don't list the negatives.

212
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,140
The only time you list something is negatives if it's something that would create a problem if they

213
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,780
didn't know before they came.

214
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:56,050
We purchase a monthly parking spot for our guests so I Blissett that is a big thing.

215
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,970
And that's something that I'll talk about later.

216
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,060
You'll see it in one of the tip sections.

217
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,100
Discuss how that's actually an effective strategy in some cases and it's something you should definitely

218
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,010
evaluate.

219
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,500
And I said you know I know I try to qualify how important that is by saying how expensive the parking

220
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,300
is otherwise.

221
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,750
You know this says $400 a night but also and getting free parking which otherwise would have been $40

222
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,430
a night.

223
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,180
And then I just did this little quick thing that I found helpful I took all of the main things that

224
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,270
people would be consider would be interested in buses.

225
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,680
People were interested in mass transit.

226
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,920
People are interested in points of interest.

227
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,840
People are interested in like dry cleaners where they're going to go to walgreens.

228
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:35,100
What are things that are open late where they can get their groceries.

229
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:39,790
What are the things that are very quintessentially San Francisco where is a gym things like that.

230
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,120
And I kind of just listed them out in terms of walking distance and I just made a list and just said

231
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,500
two blocks to this two blocks about five minutes to ten minutes of that eight minutes of that.

232
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,640
And I listed them in descending order.

233
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,420
The entire idea behind that was just so that I could list this.

234
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,520
Look at this and see.

235
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,770
It just gives the impression that everything is close to me.

236
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,990
Look at all of the things I can do.

237
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,360
They don't know what's missing obviously but it just it's some token.

238
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,080
I taken the time to think about all of the things that you could have and you could be close to and

239
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,760
even things like mentioned like I'm next to U.P.S. and then I made a quick bet saying hotels hotels

240
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,110
across the street charge at least blank you know if you live in an area that has really expensive hotels

241
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,640
feel here to steal that little bit.

242
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,420
That's always a fun one.

243
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,160
You can always take the average cost of a hotel Mexi or the highest cost you've seen.

244
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,850
And say they can charge this much.

245
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,310
What that means is hey look I'm getting a great deal versus a hotel but also it says that this area

246
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,090
is nice enough to warrant a hotel that expensive.

247
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,730
The rest of this you can read through on your own.

248
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:43,250
And if you have any questions you can ask about it in the group discussion.

249
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,800
I'm just going over what does everything we have you know what's our kitchen have invented and mentalists

250
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,350
list everything that's in the kitchen.

251
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,870
Here are the things I can help you with.

252
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,450
That's one thing people really like that he say how helpful you can be to them.

253
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,880
And I was just saying like I can help you with basic like tours and things like that.

254
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,600
And even if you don't know how to do these things you can learn them in five minutes and sometimes you

255
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,200
have to learn it.

256
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,060
Your guest will tell you how they did it and you just have to remember that.

257
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,920
So I just try to think about every single reason why someone would be coming to this space and try to

258
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,380
get a little bit in there for them talked about who will turn the areas to eat food and talking about

259
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,760
like we're flexible and Chacun that that is something we are usually flexible on.

260
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,810
That's that's great.

261
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,860
Let's go over what are bad descriptions and what are things that you shouldn't do.

262
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:29,680
You'd be surprised how often people have bad descriptions.

263
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,390
And when I say bad 90 percent of time when a bad description is It is a description that just kind of

264
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,780
conveys that it didn't put any effort into it.

265
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:42,460
You know if you have two sentences and a paragraph it just does not come off well it doesn't make me

266
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,900
think the put any time into my day it makes it feel like it's going to be awkward when I do come and

267
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,690
stay.

268
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,640
And it just makes it feel like you're not really putting a lot of time and there's kind of a revert

269
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,620
back to that initial problem people have with Airbnb which is I'm I'm paying to stay in someone else's

270
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,850
space.

271
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:03,240
And if they're really not taking this seriously it's very hard for you to take it seriously.

272
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:08,470
Here's a description I just found in my area better him in a five bedroom house with living room and

273
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:12,250
kitchen all recent college grads semi-private room.

274
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:19,090
Capital P separated from adjacent bedroom doorway and curtain and then great place to crash in the heart

275
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,240
of Nob Hill explanation point.

276
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:21,910
That was it.

277
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:26,740
That was literally all they said for their listening and they want to charge $80 a night.

278
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,800
That probably took him maybe 30 seconds to write.

279
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,500
It's very matter of fact earlier I don't write.

280
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,140
Matter of fact don't just say this is what it is.

281
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,910
Try to make it sound appealing say you'll enjoy yourself in this.

282
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,640
Come stay with us.

283
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:48,190
There's many different ways that you can kind of spin this to make it sound positive inviting all recent

284
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,420
college grads.

285
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,470
That's going to kind of eliminate probably 75 percent of the people are going to come and stay.

286
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,610
25 percent of people say oh great.

287
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,940
That's my demographic.

288
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,700
And the other 75 percent of those who say no I don't want that.

289
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:06,630
Also you're charging $80 a night semi-private room that is just sounds incredibly weird.

290
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,710
What is semi private.

291
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,540
I mean like there's someone else in your room.

292
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:14,440
But don't worry there's a screen in front of him and that it says separated from adjacent bedroom a

293
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,490
doorway and curtain.

294
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:22,420
It just seems a bit odd especially the doorway Plus a curtain that says great place to crash in the

295
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,010
heart of Nob Hill Nob Hill is a proper noun.

296
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,400
He didn't capitalize it.

297
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,960
You know that's the only thing he said that was positive.

298
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:36,720
Like I said before try to be grammatically correct to take away obvious typos were not all grammar freaks

299
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,530
but it really does help if you don't have glaring problems.

300
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,340
Not necessarily that it comes off.

301
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,230
It doesn't say anything negative about you it just says that you didn't put time into it.

302
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,050
Do a proofread don't spend a ton of time proofreading but do read it over at least once.

303
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,700
It would help a lot if you guys post in the group discussion about anything that you kind of ran into

304
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,600
or things that you thought were really helpful to add any other sections.

305
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,720
I mean my description I wrote very quickly and I added more later and added more later and I'd come

306
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,790
in every couple months and add little bits or take out little bits so don't expect it to be perfect

307
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,740
right off the bat.

308
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:16,150
Have someone read your description and see if they can think of anything that you didn't think of.

309
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,700
That's great about your space.
