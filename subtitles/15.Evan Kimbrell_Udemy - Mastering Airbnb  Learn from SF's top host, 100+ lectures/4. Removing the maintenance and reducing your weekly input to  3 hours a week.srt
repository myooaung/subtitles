1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:11,460
One of the things that I think is crucial to enjoying this process and thus getting good at this process

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,430
is your ability to remove the maintenance involved with your B and B property.

3
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,480
I mean it's I don't mean specifically how many times you call a plumber to maintain your toilet.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:29,310
I mean the maintenance in terms of say 30 guests or 30 different bookings booked in the next say five

5
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,830
months whatever.

6
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,820
How much time do you spend on each one.

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,540
Are you spending several hours a day.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:41,160
Are you spending only a couple of minutes a day or only spending maybe an hour each week on your guest

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,010
what's going to happen when you get to a point where you're removing a lot of the maintenance involved

10
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,250
with your guests.

11
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,610
It's going to become a much sweeter deal.

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,660
They're also going to have a lot more free time to think of ways to improve your listing.

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,710
And you're kind of kind of have a lot of access time and you need to be able to invest that in the property.

14
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:07,190
Because a lot of times what happens is you might be doing a share rental and at first you are just sitting

15
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,410
way too much time yourself.

16
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,650
You're doing the cleanings you're doing the check ins and checking in with them repeatedly you're running

17
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,270
and getting the gifts and the small things we talked about before and you're spending a lot of time

18
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:22,970
with the guests you might be kind of winded when it comes to check in the next guest and you're thinking

19
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,610
about how I'm going to improve on something or maybe something's broken.

20
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,990
How do I replace it.

21
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:32,210
So what I suggest overtime is you start to remove yourself from the process.

22
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,760
I talked previously about getting a cleaner.

23
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,260
I say this I absolutely get a cleaner get someone you trust as well.

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,660
If you get a cleaner who's smart about this knows that you need has some kind of idea of what you're

25
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,290
doing.

26
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,660
You can use that person and you can expand the sphere of responsibilities.

27
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,110
First thing is they're doing cleaning and then you can start getting the extra things like running to

28
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,620
get flowers running to putting together your gift basket.

29
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,360
You can even have them do check ins you can have them do check ins later and check in with the guest.

30
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,360
You could have them be are kind of on call person.

31
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:12,350
The more you identify someone else who can do these menial tasks for you and you can make kind of a

32
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:16,880
win win situation with them the better this experience is going to be for you then you're going to be

33
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,130
a lot happier about it.

34
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,860
So first off getting a cleaner.

35
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,370
It's absolutely crucial.

36
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,700
I think that's something that even if you want to be invested in this and you really want to take a

37
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,340
lot of time with each guest that's still something that's worth doing.

38
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,340
I think the cleaning is the most monotonous part second.

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,580
Think about whether or not you want your guests to self check.

40
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:42,750
The second biggest time suck in this process is the check in process that's a process where you are

41
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,850
talking Airgas showing them the area and making sure they have everything you need and then leaving.

42
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,250
In the case that you're running out your entire apartment if you're doing a space leaving to go to your

43
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,950
room also creates a lot of disruptions that your day has to wait for them because very frequently to

44
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,410
say they're at a certain time and they don't actually end up showing up to a later time.

45
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,360
It might only take 30 minutes.

46
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,850
Check the men but you might also be spending two hours in waiting for them.

47
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,770
And that's not very uncommon.

48
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,650
Think about letting themselves self-check in.

49
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,840
This is something that I started using after about month three.

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,500
I think what I found out that a lot of people wanted to check themselves in.

51
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,570
It's a little bit weirder when you have a shared space.

52
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,790
You can let them self check in and then you can meet them later.

53
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:28,740
It's still a little awkward at first and sometimes people have think it's a little too personal which

54
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,310
is fine.

55
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,540
And when I do have to do this say I'm going out and I'm not going to be there and they check and I'm

56
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,220
perfectly fine with that.

57
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,250
I put a key under the mat and I put little sticky notes all throughout the room showing them what is

58
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,000
what.

59
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,810
That's Minick gotten a kick out of a lot of gas a lot of them really like that.

60
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,910
It's like that little personal touch when they have a self-guided walk through.

61
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,890
So it doesn't feel as robotic when I run out my entire apartment.

62
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,000
I just copy and paste the same thing to them saying here all the rules here's how you get here here's

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,910
how you find parking Here's how you find the key.

64
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,210
And then everything goes wrong.

65
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,510
Then I actually message them.

66
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,150
That's something you should consider doing.

67
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,320
I mean if you're running out your entire apartment and you've gotten the space to the point where there's

68
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,450
no major amenities that are completely missing and there's nothing in the experience that's just not

69
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,500
ready or not there consider doing that.

70
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,140
A lot of gas like the fact that they can just check themselves in.

71
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,780
They like the extra privacy of that and they're perfectly capable of doing it.

72
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,740
Some of them are not perfectly capable of doing it but they'll figure out eventually as long as you're

73
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,090
available they need anything.

74
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,740
Third point use the copy and paste that I talked about earlier.

75
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,730
You don't need to handwrite every single message to every single guest and every single instruction

76
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,370
guide to every single person.

77
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:47,670
Use a guidebook in your space when you have people book with you use a pre-written explanation of where

78
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,790
everything is.

79
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,100
That will save you an enormous amount of time enormous headaches because if you're doing this manually

80
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,690
every time you get to remind them of you know how it is you turn on the heat this is where you find

81
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,700
the extra blankets put the towels used the laundry is.

82
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,220
You're going to forget things over time.

83
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,040
And so you're going to have problems where people keep asking you where things are or they keep bugging

84
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,640
you about things that are missing or things that you forgot to mention.

85
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:18,160
It's much easier to just write one master list and use that as a template to keep copying to people.

86
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:24,280
The last thing I'm going to say is you know you can even go as far as getting someone to run your check

87
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,210
ins for you.

88
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,720
And also do things like maintenance if you have someone who lives in the area and they're more than

89
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,720
willing to help you out or they're you know in Sarah's case she was using her parents ideas my friends

90
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,430
and sometimes I've hired people and I just pay them.

91
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:44,090
You know if they live down the street and they are someone who's presentable who you trust to do basic

92
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,670
tasks like this then consider doing that.

93
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:51,110
I mean it's not going to break the bank by any means but it's also nicer because then you can have that

94
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,310
person run over.

95
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,250
In the case of they need anything they get locked up the apartment and a person can run over.

96
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,050
Also brings up another point.

97
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,990
It's very helpful if you have someone designated as your key runner meaning you have a spare key to

98
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,710
your house.

99
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,960
Guess I'm Kedia House but also someone in the city has a key to your house.

100
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,190
Several times I put a key under a mat.

101
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,170
It disappears.

102
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,880
Someone in our neighbors accidentally took it once one time.

103
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,300
People kept stepping on the mat and it fell off the side of the patio.

104
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,250
These things happen.

105
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:26,930
And so if you have a backup plan and someone who's relatively available that's going to save you because

106
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,600
if you don't it's a very very bad situation.

107
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,320
So you want to avoid these types of things because these take the mental strain.

108
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,240
Less headaches means you get a lot more fun with this.

109
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,150
That's going to make it such that whatever you do end up making from this it's going to feel a lot sweeter.
