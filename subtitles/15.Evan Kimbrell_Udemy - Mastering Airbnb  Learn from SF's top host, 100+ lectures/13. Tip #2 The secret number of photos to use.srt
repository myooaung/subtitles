00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:10,280
Here's another big tip that I think will really help your listing.

2
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,380
I've never seen any host actually take advantage of this.

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,990
This pertains to photos.

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:22,660
Earlier we talked about how you know it's a good photo and how you going to angle your photographs what

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,820
you're going for or where you want in the photo.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,210
Now here's the question.

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,850
How many photos do you put.

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:34,900
That's something that there's really no guidance on early meaning to say more photos or better.

9
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,440
I'm going to take that a step further.

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,590
Put as many photographs as you can on my listing.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,010
I have 80 photographs actually I think it's over.

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:44,800
Something like that.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,910
It's an insane amount because they don't limit how many photographs you have.

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,060
There is no downside to putting a ton of photographs.

15
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:59,590
No one's going to look at your listing and say oh there's too much information about this listing when

16
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,290
someone's going to pay a lot of money and go into someone else's space.

17
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,970
There's going to be some apprehension there's going to be some feeling that you know they're feeling

18
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,130
a little bit timid about it.

19
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,360
It is someone else's space.

20
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,300
Maybe they're new to this.

21
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,990
I mean the majority of the people who book with me are new to Air B and B.

22
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,820
One way you can dissuade that kind of anxiety is by putting as much information as you can photographs.

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,180
You can't fake that.

24
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,670
People have a healthy amount of skepticism when it comes to descriptions and reviews but photographs

25
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,200
it's what you see is what you get.

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,970
So put as many photographs as you can.

27
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:37,200
Don't make it redundant in the sense that as you spin in a room you take one photo every 10 degrees

28
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,350
air B and B and they take their photographs and they come out there.

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,530
They're only gonna give you so many photographs and then it's up to you to take your own photographs

30
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,780
kind of fill in the middle.

31
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,500
And I generally suggest doing as many as you can.

32
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,050
There is a limit to how many photographs you can take inside the house before it does get redundant.

33
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:58,260
One of my favorite things to do and this is really worked in my listening really worked in other hosts

34
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:04,890
that have suggested this too is take photos of places outside of your apartment not of your apartment

35
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,660
places the person can go.

36
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,540
Literally just take an afternoon grab your camera and go walk to the spaces that are nearby.

37
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,100
It's one thing to say you live next to a 24 hour grocery store.

38
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,920
But another thing is to take a photograph of it.

39
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,210
It's not going to take a lot of this space away from the other photos at all because your analysis at

40
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:30,110
the end of the gallery of photos the first say 25 photos are of your apartment or many apartments so

41
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,500
small so it's only 10 photographs.

42
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,100
Then you're going to start listing other things things that are on the periphery.

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,200
I take a picture of a dry cleaner across the street took a picture of the Walgreens that's across the

44
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:47,920
street and I use the subtitle to explain what this is where it is and why this is useful Walgreens.

45
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,100
This is a block and a half away.

46
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:57,060
It's open late and you can get anything you need like SIM cards like prepaid phones medicine it's a

47
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,210
pharmacy travel kits anything you could possibly need.

48
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,090
And listen out just generally what would be useful to a guest if you went to a Walgreens.

49
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,190
Seems kind of obvious right.

50
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,220
But it's on there.

51
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,870
And then I put all sorts of other things I took photos of bars that were near my apartment not even

52
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,550
particularly interesting ones.

53
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,660
I just wanted people to know visually that there are places they can go to get food and get a drink

54
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,540
and their clothes and I took photos of the points of interest that are closest to me and I've said in

55
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,220
relation to where they are how far away this is and then I just put a statement about enjoy the breeze

56
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,500
at Crissy beach or watch the kite surfers at the Presidio.

57
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,150
You might think that this is not necessary.

58
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,440
And of course it's not necessary but it is something that's very nice.

59
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,700
One of the things that I identified with people who were looking to book is that they would constantly

60
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,690
ask questions about.

61
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,270
Is it near a grocery store or is it near a gym is it near a dry cleaning place.

62
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,790
Or how close am I to this point of interest.

63
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:01,810
And so you can listen on your scription but the chances are that most people don't read the entire description.

64
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,910
People are going to miss that.

65
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,820
But I think a large portion of people who are bucking finish looking through all of your photos and

66
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,770
sense I have the opportunity to put as many photos as I want.

67
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,700
I will put every single thing you could possibly do in my area whether or not you want to put every

68
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,260
single thing that might be an exaggeration and I've never really tested.

69
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,060
I have the same positive response from 50 photos or 80 photos.

70
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:31,320
But it's my belief that it cannot possibly can be construed as a negative unless you're taking photos

71
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,150
of say a shady area.

72
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,700
People do shy away from areas that look bad.

73
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,350
So I wouldn't take photos of you know if there's a boarded up house right next to your house don't take

74
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,930
a photo of the Boarded up House stress some common sense when it comes to keeping the integrity of your

75
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,830
photographs intact.

76
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,880
Last thought I think is think about this from a competitive standpoint.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,190
Let's say someone's looking at your property and they're looking at someone else's property that other

78
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,580
property is closer to the main points of interest and your city things that people actually want to

79
00:04:59,580 --> 00:04:59,870
go to.

80
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,270
But you included photographs of them in your listing as if there are very close to you.

81
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,810
Not saying they aren't very close but maybe they're not as close as say another listing you're going

82
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,490
to get the booking and you're going to get the assumption that you're closer to it because you've listed

83
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:20,830
on your listing you want to be proactive about this and it's a great way of showing everything you could

84
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,120
possibly need is close so close that I've taken photographs of the neighborhood.

85
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,680
And these things that you want to see.
