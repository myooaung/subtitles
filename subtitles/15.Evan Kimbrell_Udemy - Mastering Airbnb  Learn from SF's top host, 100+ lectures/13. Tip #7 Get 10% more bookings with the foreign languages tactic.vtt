00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.520
Knew another way to stand out from the pack do you speak a foreign language.

2
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.650
A lot of hosts just completely skip over this.

3
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.320
They are bilingual in Spanish.

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.250
They speak French.

5
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.210
They speak Chinese but they just don't think oh my language skills aren't good enough or they just think

6
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.920
that what does it matter right.

7
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.140
It actually does matter.

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.090
There being be people search through their system in other languages.

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.440
For instance Japanese consumers can search through urban b dot Jaypee and that's only in Japanese.

10
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.820
So if you speak another language wow what you can do is you can list on your property that you speak

11
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.060
that other language.

12
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.240
Now don't be shy if you speak a functional amount of the language you can list that as long as you can

13
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.270
explain to them your property how to get around what they need to know which I think is what you consider

14
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.310
conversational.

15
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.700
You don't necessarily have to be fluent.

16
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.380
You don't have to have a conversation about politics with them but you do need to be able to explain

17
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.960
anything that they would need and be able to handle any type of emergency they might have conversational

18
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.210
is perfectly fine if you're functional.

19
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.960
I'd say you probably are fine as well.

20
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.430
What you can do is you can list out the speaker of the language and then all of a sudden you can open

21
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.500
yourself up to those other markets.

22
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.270
And this is the most effective way I've seen it on your descriptions list your first listing in English

23
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.420
and then list a second listing in the secondary language.

24
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.320
If you're too lazy to translate it you can just hire someone online to translate it.

25
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.340
You know you can do it for 20 bucks and I can just put a translation of it.

26
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.140
But what will happen is whenever someone's looking and maybe they speak English and they're coming to

27
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.400
America but they don't speak great English.

28
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.430
If they see something that's in their native language they're going to be you know three times as likely

29
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.470
to book with that person.

30
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.770
In my experience the vast majority of my bookings come from people who do not speak English as a first

31
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.980
language tourist are my biggest market.

32
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.510
Germany France Spain.

33
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.360
Those are huge.

34
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.310
The secondary's were mainly like England Australia and Chinese consumers are kind of on the rise too.

35
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.000
Spanish is quite helpful to a lot of times you'll get people from Central America South America.

36
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.740
So he's speaking on language use that to your advantage list listed on your description list separate

37
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.480
descriptions in separate languages.

38
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.670
You will book people who don't speak English at all or they speak a little bit of English but they're

39
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.170
not comfortable in it.

40
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.650
This is something that will bring in easily another 20 percent of your bookings.
