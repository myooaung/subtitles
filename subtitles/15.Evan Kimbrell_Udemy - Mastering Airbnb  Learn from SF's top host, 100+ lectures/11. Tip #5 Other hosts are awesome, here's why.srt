1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:12,250
Tip number five I call this the other hosts I should have probably called this the others.

2
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:19,870
So when you do become a B and B host there's actually some privileges that come along with this.

3
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,470
And a lot of hoes don't use these privileges.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,270
What do I mean by that.

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,840
Hosts on air B and B often travel and when they travel they use Air B and B.

6
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,770
So there's no immediate connection to that right.

7
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,570
What does it matter if a host travels.

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,150
There just a host right.

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,150
Not really.

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:43,490
Actually when you travel there's a little bit of a red carpet effect when a host message is another

11
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,130
host.

12
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,420
And once you are a host and this point in the course hopefully or harvest what you can do is when you

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,240
do go and travel you can tell other hosts that you are actually a hotel or your host.

14
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,000
Now why is this important.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,490
Earlier we talked about your begetting strategy and how the biggest determinant and you raising your

16
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,850
price is going to be how many reviews you have and how positive your reviews are.

17
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:11,650
What's kind of your track record what's your rating when other host travel this is kind of a hack.

18
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,330
It's I would always make sure if you have an option between hosting another host or hosting someone

19
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,950
else pick the host.

20
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,560
Why.

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,160
Because hosts have done this before.

22
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,890
They know the ins and outs of it.

23
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,970
Not only are they to give you fantastic tips.

24
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,480
They're in a really especially if their experience they can really kind of mentor you through it.

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,780
They also get fantastic reviews.

26
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,830
You know when you have a normal cast and something goes wrong they can very easily attribute that to

27
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,080
you know oh you know the host is incompetent.

28
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,510
I need to tell everyone about it.

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,010
You always run the risk of that happening with a host.

30
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,720
They know how much they hate that they've had that happen to them.

31
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,390
They're much more forgiving.

32
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,910
And what they'll do is actually give you candid feedback about what you're doing right what you're doing

33
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,020
wrong and then they'll give you a good review.

34
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,540
And also what they understand is they have reviews on their wall.

35
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,010
They know what are good reviews and what are bad reviews.

36
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,450
On average they usually end up giving you great reviews.

37
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:10,130
I always whenever I see a host coming in saying I always make sure that I kind of nicely clear the schedule

38
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,540
but I make sure that I can get them in and I make sure that I'm really accommodating to them because

39
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,020
I know you know this is hosting on easy mode right.

40
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,480
Because they've hosted what cleanliness is.

41
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,120
They know what state they should return the apartment and they know how to not get in your hair not

42
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,950
the pain.

43
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,600
They understand that life sometimes gets in the way and you can't meet them for check and they're the

44
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,000
easiest people in the world House because they've been through this and that's why I say always try

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,760
to host them.

46
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,910
Fantastic for your wall your review wall it's great for getting advice.

47
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,290
And also it's probably the easiest rental you can now on the flipside when you're traveling make sure

48
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,490
that you use this as well.

49
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:54,650
Tell people you're a house because they will reciprocate and this is kind of an informal understanding

50
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,910
that hosts always kind of go out of their way to say OK when I see this person wants to stay.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,660
I know this is going to be super easy.

52
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,440
I should give them extra accommodations to be with them.

53
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,510
I don't need to buy them.

54
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:10,610
You know the bottle of wine or to pull out the stops because they know what to expect and they can regulate

55
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,120
their own experience.

56
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,240
And in many cases I've gotten rentals other places that were listed that were not listed because I said

57
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,260
I was a host.

58
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,600
I've gotten cleaning fees that were listed before removed because what I just said was Hey I'm a host

59
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,040
I can clean up after myself.

60
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,780
Not going to be there that long.

61
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,660
I did a cleaning for my apartment so I know exactly how to turn it to.

62
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,980
That's always been no problem.

63
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,160
They've been more than willing to take up the cleaning fee and you know if you only staying for two

64
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,140
nights I can actually be a big deal if you're staying around $100 a night and the cleaning the is $60

65
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,630
you going to pay a $6 more than reasonable to ask that question.

66
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,870
So if you have the opportunity to host another host Make sure you actually do that especially at the

67
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,650
very beginning because that could really kind of help you out because previously we talked about how

68
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,720
those first five reviews are absolutely crucial.
