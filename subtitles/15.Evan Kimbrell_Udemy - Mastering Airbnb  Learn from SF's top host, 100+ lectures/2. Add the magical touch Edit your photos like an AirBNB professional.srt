1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,140
All right.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,630
Welcome back.

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,980
So in this lecture I'm going to show you how you can quickly add some enhancements to your photos and

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:15,730
try your best to imitate that kind of pop effect that Airbnb photos have.

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:22,270
Now keep in mind when you do editing you're going to be limited by whatever you took the photographs

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:22,810
with.

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,690
Right.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:31,810
When you take you know a photograph with an iPhone or even with your own DSL are the source image is

9
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,500
going to be the biggest constraint on how good your image looks.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,060
However you can use editing programs to make them sometimes look better than they should.

11
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:46,670
If you go on Airbnb I'd look at some of their top properties and then look at their spaces.

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,950
You'll notice that they're all very very bright images sometimes they almost looks surreal.

13
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:58,750
MVB really has gotten this down to a science where they know exactly how to edit images to make them

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,310
really scream you know high quality rent my space.

15
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:09,820
So I'm going to show you a very quick hack to take photos you've taken yourself and try to improve them

16
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,960
as much as you can.

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,060
Keep in mind you're going to get 100 percent of urban bees photos but this is just a stopgap until you

18
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,710
can get the free photography.

19
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:24,100
If you're not in an area that has free photography I think it's just a matter of kind of waiting for

20
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,630
Irving and me to come out with free photography or follow some of the other tips and tricks in this

21
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:34,690
course where I can try to help you cheaply take the best photographs you can somebody give me an example

22
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,490
I used a DSL are to take this photograph.

23
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,710
This is my kitchen.

24
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:47,860
And as you can tell I clearly didn't plan out a lot of things correctly.

25
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,410
You can tell that there is a background foreground problem.

26
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,490
So we have a certain level of brightness here.

27
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:59,680
But then in the background we can tell that the sun is much brighter and it creates this weird kind

28
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,280
of effect in the back.

29
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,550
You can tell that because of the angle is having to take the shot some of the chairs aren't even illuminated

30
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,120
You can see over here.

31
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:13,870
This is basically what you'd expect if you took it off of a camera with a flash attachment.

32
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,450
These are this is you know as a source files a raw file is pretty good.

33
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:25,120
Don't really I would expect you off of your own equipment with no photography skills to get something

34
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,150
better than this.

35
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,960
I really have no photography skills is something I had to learn as I went.

36
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,450
But so now what I can do with this photo to kind of give it the air be and be a fact it's actually quite

37
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,430
simple.

38
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:45,400
Hopefully you guys on a Mac if you're on a PC I can definitely put some resources in the the addendum

39
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,910
to this course where I can explain to you how you do this with a PC but for Mac users it is super simple.

40
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,940
You're going to use I photo now I photo is free.

41
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,790
It comes with your software or because of their operating system you're using a Mac.

42
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:07,510
If you can't find it on your computer you might have to download it just go to the App Store search

43
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,290
for a photo.

44
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,400
It's always free.

45
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,110
They're constantly updating it and depending on what package you're on if you're on like Yosemite for

46
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:21,640
instance you might not actually have it on your system so quick and easy facts just search for I photo

47
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,190
in the Mac store.

48
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,170
You can download it very quickly.

49
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,900
When you do open it up it looks pretty much like any photo editor you've ever seen.

50
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,960
It holds all your photos even like will separate them by faces and whatever.

51
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,470
But that's our interest.

52
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:45,220
So to get started all you want to do is go up to file and you can go to import to library and then from

53
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:53,080
import to library you're just going to pick the folder that you use to put all of your camera photos

54
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,390
in.

55
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,950
I'm hitting the spinning wheel of death right now because this computer is a little bit slow but as

56
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,700
you can see here I have set up an image to give you guys an example.

57
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,810
I already have an imported.

58
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:11,090
But if you didn't have any port it you would look at it at airport and it's in a shop right here.

59
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,250
You just double click it open it up.

60
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:13,750
OK.

61
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,180
So that is the photo that we were previously looking at.

62
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,880
We can see that there's some kind of problems with it.

63
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:25,810
You know if you're using an Arab and be photographed you would notice that this area would probably

64
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,690
be a little bit lighter.

65
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,130
Some of the other areas might have a little bit more definition.

66
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,160
I can show you very quickly.

67
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:42,630
Here's an example of what air and B came across when they did mindspace you know.

68
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,030
So that's a photo they took of my kitchen.

69
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,450
You noticed that from the different street this photo and the other photo.

70
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,480
Look at my cabinets.

71
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,870
There's so much more yellow ish.

72
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,420
You also notice that back here there's a little more contrast.

73
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,660
First of all this is because they took this with a wide angle lens.

74
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,820
They also took it with a flash pointed forward.

75
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,730
When I took my photos I use the flash bulb pointing backwards.

76
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,870
My mistake.

77
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,340
So those are certain things I cannot overcome but I can do some certain things to kind of give this

78
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,450
veneer effect that air being done.

79
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,830
So all you want to do is go to Edit

80
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,110
and it's going to pop up a little side pain on the side.

81
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,140
OK go first it's actually an open up on quick fixes on quick fixes.

82
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,290
You have all of these quick fixes don't honestly touch these.

83
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,240
They're really for people who want to go through hundreds of photos at once and you just want to click

84
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,060
something really quickly and go through effects again.

85
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,080
I don't touch it.

86
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,540
It's not worth it.

87
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,240
So you want to go to adjust and adjust.

88
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,390
You have multiple settings.

89
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,630
One is levels levels.

90
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,680
If you toggle it from the left to the right this little middle indicator what is going to do is it's

91
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,960
going to shift the color spectrum of your image.

92
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,820
Same with these kind of ins.

93
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,720
If I pull this in it's going to actually limit my color spectrum.

94
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,190
And so all of a sudden you might see for instance some color leaving the photo because it's cutting

95
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,090
off the color spectrum so get rid of reds.

96
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,610
Now the Reds are going to pull that guy out.

97
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,320
Exposure exposure.

98
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,850
It just simulates how much exposure your camera had.

99
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,960
It really just ends up being kind of simulates having more light in the room.

100
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:27,720
Contrast contrast is the detail you'll notice in individual lines.

101
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:34,180
Saturation is one that and it uses quite a bit and makes the image look richer like the colors have

102
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,560
much more full body to them.

103
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:42,080
And then there's all sorts of these other kind of secondary ways you can modify it.

104
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:48,530
But the easiest way to do this honestly is to toggle three different things expose or contrast saturation

105
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:55,090
levels between the four of these you can usually try to get something that's very similar to air in

106
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,060
these photos.

107
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,710
Now there is no set way of doing this.

108
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,370
It really just depends on what photograph you have.

109
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,940
Typically I've noticed though so for instance in this I want to imitate the way that they made my panels

110
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,120
more yellow.

111
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:15,530
All I have to do is just take this and move it ever so slightly to the left and just You'll notice you

112
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,770
have the orange in my panels kind of went away.

113
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,210
It turned a little bit more yellow.

114
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,380
They we're clearly getting somewhere exposure.

115
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:29,080
This one typically what I would say is give it a little bit of a nudge.

116
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,090
In this case I'm not going to give it a nudge because I already have these areas that look like they're

117
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,440
overexposed.

118
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,320
And so you'll notice if I add more exposure somehow it makes it brighter.

119
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,360
But you're also having a problem where this chair is almost about to disappear.

120
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:50,860
So we can do is we can kind of settle for maybe a little bit of extra exposure.

121
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,050
Again this is a problem right here that I'm never going to get rid of.

122
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,360
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,930
Contrast the noise and add a little bit of contrast don't go crazy with this.

124
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,640
What happens when I pull it all the way.

125
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,170
Wow.

126
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,410
What in the world.

127
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,500
So you don't want that.

128
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,690
It's going to over contrast images and it ends up changing the colors because it's trying to create

129
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,010
a lot of artificial contrasts.

130
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:19,250
I just like to give it just a wee little nudge say like five that's good enough saturation.

131
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,490
Again you're just going to have to play this one.

132
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,670
Kind of picture the picture if you give it a little bit of a nudge.

133
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:32,540
And it's not going make a huge difference but typically M.B.A. photos are oversaturated.

134
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:38,300
So now if I was doing a photograph that was not as bright as this I might give a little bit more of

135
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,680
a saturation down here are secondary controls.

136
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,800
You can kind of mess with these.

137
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,060
Personally I like to throw highlights all the way up as you can see.

138
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,130
Now it kind of starts to get a little bit of an Arab feel.

139
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,380
Let's try to roll it back just a little bit.

140
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:01,880
Sharpness is when you don't even really particularly notice depending on what you've done and the other

141
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,710
adjustments up here and also down here temperature.

142
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,140
You can sometimes change it whichever way you want to make it feel if you want to make the image cooler

143
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:17,470
just throw it down a little bit see how that looks kind of like it's in the middle of winter.

144
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:23,520
I wouldn't do this because when it does of doing as makes the window light look blue which I don't want

145
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,850
that.

146
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,490
So let's go back to zero.

147
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,840
So all I did here was I gave it a little bit of exposure.

148
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:40,220
I changed the levels to highlight orange over yellow over orange.

149
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,760
And I just screwed a little bit with the highlights and the contrast.

150
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,080
Don't go crazy with these up here.

151
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,700
If you go crazy I can kind of ruin your photograph but this.

152
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,780
See what I've done now here.

153
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:58,750
It's really all I've done is kind of I call it adding the MSDE to the photo because all you're doing

154
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,730
is adding a little bit of flavor.

155
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,090
And as you can see a pullback.

156
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,670
The other one.

157
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,750
So now some of you might have an opinion thinking that this image looks better but that's not the point.

158
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,700
The point is to make the photograph look like something you'd see on air B and B.

159
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:19,780
So if you don't like the fact that Airbnb oversaturate over contrast their images that's not really

160
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,260
the point.

161
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,570
The point is to make it look as similar to the rest of the Web site as possible because they have set

162
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,360
their own kind of design standard.

163
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,460
Personally I think the it looks quite a bit better.

164
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:35,620
This looks like something that I could throw up Arabic in the logo up here and it look like something

165
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,300
that Airbnb did.

166
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,410
I think that when you guys do this don't spend a ton of time honestly you could sit here for days and

167
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,060
days and days.

168
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,800
I'll make it simple for you.

169
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:51,520
Try to modify your levels to get a warmer color than you use to add some exposure if you don't have

170
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,870
a lot of light in your shot.

171
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,190
Always add contrasts and always add a little bit of saturation.

172
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:03,190
Other things you can toggle with you can toggle with your definition and your highlights which honestly

173
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:09,730
to me I'm not an expert in the difference in contrast and definition but I see as I toggle definition

174
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,750
now you can start to see these drawers stick out a little bit more which is exactly what I want.

175
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,870
So I'm happy with this image.

176
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,680
It's got a little bit the air B and B veneer.

177
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,120
I've talked about this made a huge difference.

178
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:26,170
When I was posting my listings I took my amateur shots did a little amateur modification with a software

179
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,040
that's free that everybody has.

180
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,860
I spent honestly maybe 30 seconds at Image.

181
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,810
Not a big deal.

182
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:36,940
All I know is you need to go up an exposure up and contrast up and saturation levels just a little bit.

183
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,710
Don't get too carried away with it and voila.

184
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,270
There you go.

185
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,360
Now you have an image that looks like it's Air B and B quality.

186
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,920
You post that people will think it's an Air B and B photo and you'll start getting a lot of bookings

187
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,350
which is where we want to be.

188
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,500
Thanks for listening.
