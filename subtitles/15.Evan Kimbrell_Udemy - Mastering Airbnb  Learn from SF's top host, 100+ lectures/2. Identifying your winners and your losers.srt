1
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:10,970
One thing that definitely separates great hosts from average host is great hosts.

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:16,670
Over time learn how to maximize what they have going for them and minimize their weaknesses.

3
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:23,030
I mean this in your listing you will list out things that you have great hosts will recognize the things

4
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,710
that they're missing.

5
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:29,600
Adam I also recognize that things that they undervalued personally that other people really enjoyed.

6
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,420
For instance if you do have parking you might think that what does it matter if I parking but people

7
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,720
might really enjoy that.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,070
So you should learn to maximize that.

9
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,680
How would you maximize your parking.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,670
Maybe you'll put a description of it in your listing.

11
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,940
Maybe you'll put it higher up to the tops of people see it more.

12
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:46,400
Neither would it.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,780
I and put it in your title.

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,970
Maybe I'll put a photograph of the parking spot and then put it in your photo reel.

15
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,070
These are all legitimate ways of maximizing something you have positive going for you.

16
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,260
I have cable cars running by my apartment.

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,390
I thought that would have been incredibly annoying because they're very loud and when they go down the

18
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,010
hill at night they rattle because the guys who are running the cable cars back to the start point.

19
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,750
They just turn off the brakes and they just like write it down eat them.

20
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,380
Like yelling sometimes.

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,020
Actually I found out was people really enjoy that.

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,500
They think it's so quintessentially San Francisco.

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,970
They think it's really cool to look out the window to see these things going by.

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,170
It's like they're transported back in time.

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,190
I didn't realize that and after my first couple of gusts I realized this is actually a positive and

26
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:37,370
the rumble at first is kind of jarring but the second time you have it it's actually more relaxing.

27
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,450
It's different for someone who lives there try to assess what it is.

28
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,720
If that's the case something that you think is a negative that other things are a positive and just

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,880
see if it's something that you are jaded by because you live there and try to maximize those things

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,280
that your guests have highlighted for you and then minimizing your weaknesses these are things that

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,050
every guest every host should know are things that aren't fantastically great.

32
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,940
Maybe you don't have a ton of space.

33
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,280
How would you minimize that.

34
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,170
Well you focus on how you take your photographs.

35
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,060
You try to fill your room with things that would make your space look larger.

36
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,570
There are certain colors that make spaces look larger.

37
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,310
You might have to reflect in your price.

38
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,290
You adapt to it.

39
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,860
When I was earning out my living room I didn't have doors attached to it to help minimize my weaknesses

40
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,940
as well we end up doing was installing a curtain rod and putting a curtain over.

41
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,940
And then I put a photograph of the curtain covering it.

42
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,330
People can see there's a hole in the wall and they're like oh there's no door.

43
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:42,140
I tried to minimize that problem by just putting a curtain over showing that in the photographs.

44
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,250
That's a way that you can minimize your weaknesses.

45
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,160
Every property has a weakness.

46
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,180
These are the things you can't necessarily completely overcome.

47
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:56,200
But if you recognize them and try to at least say like it's not something that you want to necessarily

48
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,370
list in your listing or you can think of a better way of phrasing it letting people know about it.

49
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,010
It's all about the presentation.

50
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,470
You obviously don't want to go out of your way to say you know I live in a party area.

51
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,510
Typically people will know that what you might want to invest in say anything that might help you with

52
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,300
soundproofing things like that.

53
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,990
Basic additions this is something you will recognize on listings.

54
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:26,290
I think it's where it's most prominent but you won't identify the things that people really like and

55
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,730
you want to maximize your exposure to those you want to make sure everybody knows about those beforehand

56
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,100
and you want to figure out the things that you think actually kind of crush you or put you in a disadvantage

57
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,570
and you want to make sure that you kind of de-emphasize those things.

58
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,650
You guys have any questions or you want more specific examples to Sabino poster in the group discussion.
