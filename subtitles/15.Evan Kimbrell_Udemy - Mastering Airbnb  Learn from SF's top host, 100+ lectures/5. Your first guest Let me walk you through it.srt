1
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:11,580
So it sounds like you have your first guest coming to hopefully you don't have any that pre-game anxiety

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:18,510
kind of I'm going to use this lecture as a tool to give you a little bit of a talking through so that

3
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,090
you don't explode in a ball of stress about your first gasp because you think that you know what am

4
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,170
I going to do this is so awkward and I'm thinking I'm going to hockey through a little bit how.

5
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,290
My first guest I want to show you that it's completely normal when you have your first guest.

6
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,570
What are you going to be doing.

7
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,140
You have communicated with him.

8
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,900
You know when they're showing up if you don't know when they're showing up you should probably know

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,170
when they're showing up.

10
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,710
Do you have the property ready.

11
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:44,080
OK.

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,860
If you don't and it's going overlap with when they check in make sure you message him as early as possible.

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,570
You can say Do you mind checking in later.

14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,330
Or you can even say Do you mind dropping off your bags doing something else like clean.

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,770
There's actually very acceptable things to ask especially if they're coming in during the day because

16
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,870
chances are they might want to drop off their stuff and go somewhere you live near a coffee shop.

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,330
You can always say hey I'm going to the coffee shop I'll get you a coffee.

18
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,520
Things like that.

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,880
If it is ready don't worry about it.

20
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,820
It's very simple.

21
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,710
They're going to come to your apartment or your place.

22
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,280
You're going to meet them assuming you're checking them in.

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,610
I would suggest checking in you're the first people you have.

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,490
Sending them a message saying how to check themselves are not usually fantastic key handoffs are a little

25
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,490
bit tricky unless you have some a system for that.

26
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,390
So I'd say check them in for the first ones.

27
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,560
I've met them and introduced myself what do I do now.

28
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,130
Simple.

29
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,590
You show them their space first thing off.

30
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,760
Take them right to their space show you want to drop their stuff and then you're going to spend time

31
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,220
showing them your place.

32
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,470
Show them how to work the heat work the air conditioner.

33
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,000
Show them where they go to the bathroom.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,290
Is it a low flow toilet.

35
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,150
You can show them how to use that.

36
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,440
Show them the kitchen and show them where all the amenities are possibly interested in or gauge your

37
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,390
guest as well.

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,020
They look like they're not interested in something skip over it.

39
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,690
Make sure that you show them everything you can honestly since your first gas you're going to forget

40
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,740
to mention a lot of things.

41
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,650
Don't worry about it you don't need to memorize a script.

42
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,820
You can tell them you're my first guest.

43
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,950
They will forgive you and make sure that they communicate with you if they need anything.

44
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,850
That's the most important thing I'm going to say.

45
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,710
But your first guest even if you forget to show them an entire room of your place.

46
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,130
Just ask and give them your cell phone number that the community they text you call you if you need

47
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,020
anything.

48
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:30,250
Also I think it's always a good idea that after they check in maybe the next day maybe even 12 hours

49
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,390
later you just send them a quick text message saying Hey is there anything else you need.

50
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,090
Very simple like that.

51
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,600
A lot of times they'll think to themselves oh man i wish i had a blowdryer but I don't want to ask because

52
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
it's so minor.

53
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:46,420
Once you ask them that will ask you that's going to give them a much better experience.

54
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,480
This whole process is not particularly weird after you know your first three or four ghast you're kind

55
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:58,060
of start memorizing the speech that you give them and you're going to start inserting canned humor and

56
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,230
you're going to start noticing where people tend to snooze off at and where people seem to wake up and

57
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,460
you're going to get a general idea of how long this process should take.

58
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,990
I've done check ins that take five minutes I've done check ins that took an hour.

59
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,080
The reason why it takes an hour is because it took 20 minutes showing them the myspace and I spent 40

60
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,550
minutes talking to them make sure that you enjoy this process.

61
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,300
Sarah talked about how it's important that you like people the more you like people the more you're

62
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,180
going to get out of this.

63
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,460
You don't necessarily have to be a gushing huge extrovert gregarious kind of people person to get anything

64
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:35,290
out of this but it does help if you're at least somewhat interested in meeting new people even if it's

65
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,950
for a short period of time.

66
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,050
Your Enthusiasm will rub off on them.

67
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,500
Sometimes it's really helpful because you have guests who reciprocate and they show that they're really

68
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,080
happy and excited and that kind of cool will rub off on you.

69
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,670
Make sure you don't stress about it.

70
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,590
Make sure that you show them everything in your space so that they are acquainted.

71
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,220
Make sure you have their contact information.

72
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,830
I usually don't like to say like when checkout is.

73
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,630
You can always text them that later or even you know send them an email or something like that.

74
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:10,060
My first guest when I first got his booking he was coming in for the night news coming in late and he's

75
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:16,390
only saying one night he booked because he ended up staying in San Francisco an extra night and he was

76
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,320
going to stay at a hotel and he saw the prices of the hotels and the like that's crazy.

77
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,750
So he booked with me.

78
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,620
Never use air B and B before.

79
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,180
Ended up being a really cool guy.

80
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,630
Really interesting.

81
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:33,070
We had a fun time talking I mean I only spent maybe 30 45 minutes with them but I did enough spending

82
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:38,140
way more time than I usually was and I was way too anxious about it and I forgot everything that I was

83
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,730
supposed to tell him.

84
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:44,350
I totally forgot to tell him how to use the dishwasher and then use basic things that he would need

85
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,360
or where the parking spot was and things like that so don't worry about it you're always have these

86
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,110
problems and if you're worried about not being able to connect with someone who's coming from another

87
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,600
country just really just don't worry about it.

88
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,920
You don't need to brush up on your Japanese for your first Japanese gas.

89
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,350
It's not something that's a big deal.

90
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,270
Irving these community is much stronger than the group of people usually see at hotels.

91
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,240
Certainly at the beginning your price is going to be lower.

92
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:13,750
You going to have people that are much more relaxed so take a deep breath have fun with it and make

93
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,580
sure that you create a way that they can relay feedback to you and if they need something because you're

94
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,870
going to forget they can contact you easily.
