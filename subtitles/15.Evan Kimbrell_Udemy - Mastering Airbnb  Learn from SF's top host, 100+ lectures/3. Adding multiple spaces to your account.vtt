00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.660
Guys.

2
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:06.890
Happy Friday.

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.700
Hey so I had a question from one of the students.

4
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:16.660
It was about how do you list multiple listings that are all in the same space or share space in some

5
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.720
way.

6
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:25.000
Now I'll admit the way that you do this in Air B and B is not very intuitive at all the way if you were

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.880
to ask Airbnb if you were to contact them they would tell you that you have to do it through a work

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.880
around.

9
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.240
And I had to kind of figured this out when I did it but it's not particularly difficult.

10
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.020
You just when you do it I'll show you.

11
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.070
You kind of think there must be something else to this but actually no there's not.

12
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.100
So the reason why a lot of people want to read out multiple listings within your same space it's just

13
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.510
the option of flexibility.

14
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.030
When I'm in my apartment I like to run outside rooms when I'm outside of my apartment.

15
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.340
I like to rent out the full apartment.

16
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.060
It's a little bit tricky having to manage the two calendars between the two but it's totally worth it

17
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.230
for me.

18
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.020
I have a lot of extra space in my space so it makes a lot of sense for me because I'll enjoy hosting

19
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.670
and I also again have a lot of space.

20
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.570
So for me it almost feels like a waste when I'm here.

21
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.490
I have this big massive living room that I've turned into a bedroom.

22
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.850
It seems like a waste if someone's not staying there so I'm perfectly fine hosting when I do that.

23
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.270
That's why I manage two different listings.

24
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.550
I'll show you real quickly how the way I have it set up.

25
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.180
I apologize my internet is being slow today.

26
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.850
Blame it on Comcast.

27
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.870
So here I have it set up that I have this is my full apartment.

28
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.690
This is my living room that I converted into a bedroom and this is actually my bedroom itself.

29
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.320
Now the reason why I listed these two is because I have a three bedroom and depending on what broomed

30
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.880
someone wants I can just switch.

31
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.910
So if I'm in this bedroom and they rent this one I can stay here and if I'm if they want to rent this

32
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.200
one I can switch this on.

33
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.890
The benefit though for listening both of these is that there are two different price points because

34
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.830
each one room's nicer than the other.

35
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.030
This one I list it.

36
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.220
I think it's at 180 and this is something like 110.

37
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.890
And so a lot of times what will happen is people ask to stay here and they will ask for a discount.

38
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.450
And so I just tell them to go down here and that's worked out really well for me because for me I'd

39
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.780
much rather have someone staying here then have it empty because the price point was too high.

40
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.040
And typically this one is cheaper so the type of people who stay here are like couples who are trying

41
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.240
to save money.

42
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.400
And here it's more like couples who are a lot of times they get Honeymooners.

43
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.000
A lot of times get people who family vacations and things like that.

44
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.490
So if you have multiple spaces within your space think about doing that.

45
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.460
Think about trying to use different prices to capture whatever type of price group someone you want.

46
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.900
Because a lot of times you'll have a weekend and you only have one inquiry for it.

47
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.460
And also you know if you have two listings are going to get twice the inquiries and twice as much exposure

48
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.390
so I get a lot more fill.

49
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.340
Just sometimes it's a lot less money but I'm happy with it anyway so the way that I would list another

50
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.490
listing so let's pretend like I'm going to list my closet.

51
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.830
All they have to do is just go up to list my space and I'm just going to fill it out like I would list

52
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.060
any other listing.

53
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.010
I would say it's an apartment.

54
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.580
I'd say it's a private room.

55
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.960
So this is my closet I will say only one person fits it.

56
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:27.750
Fill up my city

57
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.780
the only difference here is that you're going to have to adjust some of the amenities.

58
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.380
And when you write your description you can copy and paste your description but make sure the first

59
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.870
paragraph describes to them why this is different than the rest of your property.

60
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.960
Make sure you're not saying in your private room description that it's a full apartment.

61
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.930
Make sure to proofread it.

62
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.380
Change that to change that out early and be always tries to set you up with this where you want to set

63
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.590
your calendar.

64
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.540
You can say it's always available sometimes available one time available.

65
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.260
Keep in mind again if you have multiple listings you're gonna have to hawk your calendar to make sure

66
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.230
you don't double Bookout spaces.

67
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.580
This has happened to me way too many times and it is such a pain because I end up having to cancel on

68
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.290
someone which is brutal.

69
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:26.770
So the way that you do this photos now if you follow the course and you took photographs with your iPhone

70
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.050
or with the DSL or whatever you were able to get your hands on what you would do is you just add photos

71
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.750
like photos for anything else.

72
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.210
Now you're just going to reorder the photos.

73
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.260
So if I you know I have all the photos from my apartment I would upload all of those.

74
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.810
Maybe I'd remove a couple if those are not relevant to the space I'm now renting.

75
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.140
But I just reorder it.

76
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.550
So I would upload all of the photos and then I would take the photos from the bedroom I'm renting and

77
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.170
put those predominantly and I'd make that the thumbnail personally that's what I like to do.

78
00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.120
You don't have to necessarily change a thumbnail but I like everyone to know this is the space you're

79
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.380
staying in.

80
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.170
Now if you used Airbnb photography and you're an established enough host to get that through this is

81
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.510
actually how you look it up and I put this in the resources a couple of times the way that you would

82
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.130
get these photographs because Air B and B controls these photographs.

83
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.990
When someone comes out to your space takes the photos they upload it on their end.

84
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.760
You don't ever touch those photographs.

85
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.600
And that's how they verify that they're true and accurate what you want to do is when you get Airbnb

86
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.000
photography the way that it works is someone messages you and they act like a guest it looks like I

87
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.300
guess it shows up in your inbox and that person then schedules will see you when they're going to come

88
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.340
and take photographs.

89
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.920
Now if you want to make another listing what you have to do is go through and dig through all of your

90
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.720
messages find that person and message them and say hey I made a new listing Can you upload it to the

91
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.600
separate section if you can't find their name then just message Airbnb and say hey these are the photographs

92
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.200
I need in my other listing.

93
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.080
It takes a couple of days but that's kind of the only way you can do it.

94
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.420
They have to manually do it on the back end.

95
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.210
Yes so that's how you would deal with verified photos if you have your own photos that it doesn't really

96
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.530
matter.

97
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.790
You can just upload them directly.

98
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:19.220
One question that I know a lot of people ask is OK so what if I have a four bedroom and I want to rent

99
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.040
out two bedrooms in the four bedroom and then I have someone who wants to run out two spaces within

100
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.520
my space.

101
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.810
It sounds obscure but this actually happens all the time since I have a three bedroom.

102
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.680
I've had people coming in and three people and they don't want to stay in one space so they want to

103
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.950
rent two spaces but they don't want the entire space because they can't because I'm here.

104
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:45.470
So what you have to do in that case is you have to give them what's called a special offer and a special

105
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.420
offer.

106
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.810
It's an option when you get message buy from them.

107
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:58.460
You can send them a special offer a discounted offer but you can also increase the price on their special

108
00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.240
offer.

109
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.740
And so you have to end up doing is.

110
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:07.010
So say someone says hey one or two rooms they'll ask you about one room air B and B will calculate the

111
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.220
rate for that room.

112
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:14.390
You message them with a special offer and you increase the rate to a company so accommodates both spaces

113
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.590
and then you tell them that's what that's for.

114
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.340
And so here's an example.

115
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:25.490
This is a conversation from an old old booking I had this person wanted.

116
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.510
They're renting the living room.

117
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.690
Let's pretend that they wanted to rent both spaces.

118
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:35.630
So what I can do is you have this option where you can ask them for more information.

119
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.420
You can say it's unavailable or you can allow them to book.

120
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.870
Well you could say is send Bob a special offer.

121
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:47.000
I'd obviously pick the room he said and then I would just up the price and this price is already inflated

122
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.200
because I just did this but so it was originally 380.

123
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:54.330
So I was up at whatever it ends up being 680 or something like that.

124
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.840
And then I'd say in the message.

125
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.720
This includes both spaces.

126
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:05.300
And then immediately what I would do is I would go over to my other listing and I would turn it off.

127
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.160
And you need to do that immediately because if you forget to do that you say I to do that in a couple

128
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.760
of hours.

129
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.700
What can happen is someone can actually swoop in and try to book the other space and then you again

130
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.740
have a double booking.

131
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.800
And that's a hard decision.

132
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.000
That's all you need to be careful when you do instant book.

133
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:25.960
And that's why I would suggest you use instant book once your you have some experience with this.

134
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:32.830
The only other thing that I think is worth pointing out is that when you list your space you will need

135
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.890
to update your amenities depending on what you're offering them.

136
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.520
So in my case I have a two bed or two bathroom apartment.

137
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.760
If you're getting the full bath or the full apartment you have access to two bathrooms.

138
00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:47.680
Now if you're renting one room I don't give you access to two bathrooms.

139
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.660
You only have access to one bathroom.

140
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.860
So I would need to change that.

141
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.280
No I would not select to select one.

142
00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.180
And then I have to be honest about the bed too.

143
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:58.890
Say one.

144
00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.220
And then I'd have to pick what it actually is by causes.

145
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.800
Let's say it's in Arabic.

146
00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:08.770
Also within minutes this might be the case that for instance if you had a shared room but you like didn't

147
00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.340
want to give them the kitchen you need to uncheck kitchen.

148
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:16.130
So this is not a question of what does your space have.

149
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:19.900
It's a question of what's available in the space to the guest.

150
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.990
So you want to check all of these and then tell them hey they can't use the heating the kitchen and

151
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.190
the Internet.

152
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:28.470
You need to toggle these off and on depending on what you're comfortable sharing with them and it's

153
00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:33.070
all the time that if you're doing a small space within your space you might not offer all of the same

154
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:38.640
amenities to the people that you would if they were in of the entire space.

155
00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:40.000
I think that about covers it.

156
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.880
So if you guys have any other questions just post in the group discussion and I'll get back to you.

157
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.870
Otherwise enjoy your weekend guys.
