1
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:11,290
Want to talk a little bit about one of the metrics in Air B and B that's often overlooked.

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,900
It's the response rate percentage.

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,340
Now when you look at Air B and B host you'll notice that they're the bottom they're listing it says

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,660
response rate.

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,070
And typically if the person's trying should be 100 percent.

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,840
He also notice that with hosts that have multiple properties and have been doing this for an extended

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,420
period of time it's actually not that abnormal to see them have some ridiculous number like 98 percent

8
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,730
or 99 percent.

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:44,080
So what that is when someone messages you air is just going to record every single time you respond

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,970
to them.

11
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,790
Now that sounds ridiculously simple but it's actually a little bit more complicated than that.

12
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:55,120
Now when I first hosted an Arab being B I thought that this was gonna be kind of a no brainer.

13
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,300
So in messages me Of course I'm going to respond.

14
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,210
That's not a big deal.

15
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,100
I was I was concerned with the response time like how long would take me to get to my phone respond

16
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,410
you know for instance a phone message of me at night.

17
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:10,510
I was a little concerned about that but I did not realize though is that when you're pop when your property

18
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,520
gets popular you can actually run into trouble with this.

19
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:21,070
A lot of times I will get you know I'll go three days without a booking and query and then on one day

20
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:27,760
I'll get eight sometimes three at a time and I'll explain later why that is why the air being Bea system

21
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,740
does that.

22
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:34,090
But that can happen you can just have an avalanche of inquiries and sometimes it just slipped your mind

23
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,620
that you don't you didn't respond.

24
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,990
Every single person now I almost had a little bit of a crisis with this and this is kind of a word of

25
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:41,620
warning.

26
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:47,170
When I originally started hosting you know I had one hundred percent up until three months and then

27
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:54,130
I had someone message me and it was a scam and that scam person messages me I read it and I didn't think

28
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,530
I had to respond.

29
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,890
So I did not respond.

30
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:05,110
And what ended up happening was that actually tanked my response rate and I CAD to go back find it in

31
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:10,780
my list of things and then respond to Air B and B and thankfully urban we hadn't removed this person's

32
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,690
account so that I could respond to it.

33
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,460
So I got back up to 100 percent ranked on your response time.

34
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,800
And so obviously it's very very important that you get 100 percent anything below 100 percent is just

35
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,110
not good when you look at other hosts and they're below 100 percent that say you know you have opportunities

36
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,720
and you know the person's not trying the best.

37
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,860
This should be a lay up.

38
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:40,430
You should always always respond personally the way I like to do it is even if I'm busy I like to send

39
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:46,670
a message to every single person who sends sends me a message and it's a very basic thing just saying

40
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,770
hey let me respond later.

41
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,660
So at least I know and worst case scenario I've responded to every single person.

42
00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:00,080
So don't let this happen to you what happened to me if you get someone a sentence that sends you a message

43
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,910
you don't you're not taking it seriously at all.

44
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:06,800
Maybe it's a gas trying to book and you have no interest in what they're trying to book.

45
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,430
Maybe they're trying to ask for a massive discount or maybe it's someone who's just trying to advertise

46
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,310
something always respond.

47
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:18,410
Don't make the mistake I did even type Hi H I and send that to them.

48
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,340
That's how you get your hundred percent don't ever ignore your messages completely.

49
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,530
That's the worst thing you could do.

50
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,770
And I know if you're hosting a lot of people a lot of properties it could happen.

51
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:36,050
So the next lecture I'm going to talk about the other part of this which is the response timing and

52
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:42,980
how you can set up some basic strategies so you can minimize your response timing and how you can do

53
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,860
that once you become a popular property.
