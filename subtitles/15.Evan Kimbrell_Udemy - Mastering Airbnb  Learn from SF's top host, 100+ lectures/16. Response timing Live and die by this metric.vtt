00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.920
Pay so let's talk a little bit about the response timing.

2
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.650
Now this is different than the response rate or member response rate was how often you respond to guests

3
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.960
when they're asking to book.

4
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.840
Obviously you think that's obvious but sometimes it's not.

5
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.810
Now response timing is the other metric that says how quickly someone responds.

6
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.370
Now if you look at a host host metric the kind of metric panel at the bottom of their listing you see

7
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.300
that it's only going to rate them in a couple dimensions.

8
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.910
It's only going to say if they respond under an hour in about an hour and I think after that it's another

9
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.220
tier system or it says in a few hours in a day in a few days and a week in a month something like that.

10
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.040
Now obviously there's a massive difference between responding under an hour and in a few hours and you

11
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.550
don't want to be in the second category.

12
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.780
Someone who responds in a few hours is going to get fewer bookings.

13
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:09.140
People are going to ask to put your property less surprisingly because if they look at it they say OK

14
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.230
I'm looking at two properties.

15
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.690
Keep this in mind almost every one is looking at multiple properties.

16
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.160
So they're going to make a mental comparison between the two.

17
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.130
If someone's looking for a property they're probably looking at two or three maybe they've narrowed

18
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.190
it down to two.

19
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.780
They look.

20
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.870
They see one person responds under an hour and they look and they see the other person and only responds

21
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.600
within a couple hours.

22
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.900
Obviously the person they're probably going to send messages to both.

23
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.040
But there's a good chance that they're going to send a message to the person responds within an hour.

24
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.820
And then if that person cannot host them then respond to the second person.

25
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.960
No it's just logical if you know someone's gonna respond in 30 minutes and another person responds usually

26
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.680
in two hours.

27
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.490
You don't need to message both of them.

28
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.270
You only really need to message the person who responds in 30 minutes.

29
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.010
Then see what they say and then move on.

30
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.250
Unless of course you like the other property better.

31
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.480
Regardless it's an advantage that you have if you respond quickly.

32
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.890
People see that people are more likely to ask you questions are more likely to actually send you inquiries.

33
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.590
Now if they know if someone looks at your property they know you respond very quickly.

34
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.220
Much much more likely to ask you a question about the property.

35
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.730
If I saw someone who only responded a couple of days and I had a question about the property why would

36
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.610
I ask them that question.

37
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.840
Now if I you know by the time they respond I already have a booking somewhere else.

38
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.210
So you have to kind of understand that dynamic between people seeing your page and booking based on

39
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.430
how responsive they think you are.

40
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.660
So the way that this works from you as the host It's actually pretty simple.

41
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.550
As soon as someone messages you the clock starts.

42
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.940
So if someone messages you at 2:00 o'clock Aramean B is going to record how long it takes you to send

43
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.990
back a message.

44
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.170
Now they're not rating what message you send back.

45
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.100
Anything you respond counts as a message and the clock stops.

46
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.700
So you're going to try to absolutely try to get every response within an hour.

47
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.480
But remember it's an average right.

48
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:13.630
So if you have someone you and you just miss their message and you're spot on for hours maybe you're

49
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.350
asleep you can offset this by getting a lot of messages where you respond in 10 15 20 minutes.

50
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.750
So don't worry about it if you miss one you just have to make it up over the average.

51
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.250
The key to this though is that you want to stop the clock as quickly as possible.

52
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.630
Had mentioned this previously in the last section but the way I suggest you actually do this is you

53
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.850
actually just respond a template response every single time.

54
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.060
Because a lot of times something will happen to send you a message.

55
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.170
It will be long.

56
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.970
You are going to look at it you see a long as you say OK I haven't read this in 30 minutes.

57
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.400
Thirty minutes becomes 45 minutes 45 minutes becomes an hour an hour becomes two hours.

58
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.900
By the time you get to it you sit there and you think about it for 10 15 minutes and you're over the

59
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.950
hour limit that we want to shoot for.

60
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.650
So what I always say you should do is you should immediately respond.

61
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.020
The same thing what I always say is let me get back to you.

62
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.930
I'll respond later or something like If it's a long response say hey let me read this in a second.

63
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:15.350
Sorry.

64
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.160
Just busy or something like that.

65
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.040
And what will happen is if you do that it stops the clock.

66
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.540
You get a high average but it also lets the other person know that hey I'm here I've already acknowledged

67
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.680
your message you don't need to go and message the other people.

68
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.310
Now don't go crazy with this once you've actually said it to them and you stop the clock.

69
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.010
Remember you want to get their bookings or try to respond in a decent amount of time.

70
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.640
Don't try to do it tomorrow but you do.

71
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.580
You've essentially bought yourself some leeway now.

72
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.100
Air B and B Like I said before it ranks everyone's response time in tears.

73
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.670
But they actually record this even below.

74
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:56.280
So if it says under an hour they actually rank you based on whether or not you respond in 10 minutes

75
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.330
20 minutes 30 minutes 40 minutes.

76
00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.610
They just don't display that.

77
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.290
And the reason why they don't display that is because they don't want it's unrealistic to think that

78
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:11.110
we should be competing over who responds in 30 minutes 20 minutes and 10 minutes because you know a

79
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.450
lot of people for instance get most of their bookings while they're asleep that's the case with me.

80
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:23.710
I get a lot of my bookings from Europeans or people in China Japan pretty much they're booking when

81
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.990
I'm asleep so it's unrealistic to think that I'm going to be able to respond within an hour every single

82
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.280
time.

83
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.660
It's not just that if I respond within an hour I'm good.

84
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.450
It's more that if you respond to the faster you respond the better you get extra search points.

85
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:47.920
If you're even an even faster responder The number one best way of gaming this metric is one always

86
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.380
having a template that you respond to people regardless.

87
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:56.400
And then you come back to them and to set up your mobile phone onto this.

88
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.690
Now if you don't have a smartphone it doesn't actually it doesn't really matter because what happens

89
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.400
is when you get an inquiry as being busy to send you two things actually it's three things.

90
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.260
There's three things one's an e-mail e-mail notification saying hey you have an inquiry too.

91
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.510
It's going to have a push notification for Air B and B app and then three it's going to send you a text

92
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.270
message.

93
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:23.290
Now if you don't have a smartphone you don't have the app if you're not near a computer or you don't

94
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.990
have e-mail on your phone and not constantly checking your e-mail don't conflict checking on you know

95
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.850
my phone.

96
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.600
You're not going to see that one very quickly very easily you can miss that.

97
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.850
But a text message you're always going to see.

98
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.210
So that's what I like to use because that's my failsafe.

99
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.680
I'm always going to get a text message and that text message is it's never going to give you the entire

100
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.550
message it's always going to give you a couple of sentences and get cut off.

101
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.020
But it doesn't matter because a lot of people don't realize this.

102
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.410
You can respond to that text message.

103
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.840
So everybody is going to send you a text message it's going to say this guest says this.

104
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.810
Remember now.

105
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.620
Just type in your template response and text it back.

106
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.700
It's a text back.

107
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.980
The whole system is going to handle it for you.

108
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:08.230
That's the foolproof way of doing this as long as you can get cell service you should be good and you

109
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.730
don't even need a smartphone.

110
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.650
Always use the text message feature.

111
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.990
And I'd even go so far as to having have a message saved in somewhere else in your phone or you can

112
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.130
just copy and paste it again if you don't have a smartphone then just remember say hey let me get back

113
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.780
to us in just a second.

114
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.310
And then you can go and get to your computer or get to another someone or someone else's smartphone

115
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.880
and actually respond is the gist of this metric.

116
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:36.610
It's really important because people book more if you respond faster.

117
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:42.700
There are too many times that I've gotten bookings when the group could have easily fit in another proper

118
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.710
property better picture but I'm tied to my phone so I always respond.

119
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:53.380
If there's one thing I get across from this one be tied to your phone or be tied to some device where

120
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:58.420
you can get the inquiries just so you can respond and don't worry you're not going to be in the middle

121
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:04.030
of dinner getting a text message and saying hey hold on let me write this long extended prose about

122
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.460
whether or not you can stay with me.

123
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:11.800
Just text back a template that's the best way of stopping the clock and getting the response rate down

124
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.670
to something that's really going to help you in your search ranking.
