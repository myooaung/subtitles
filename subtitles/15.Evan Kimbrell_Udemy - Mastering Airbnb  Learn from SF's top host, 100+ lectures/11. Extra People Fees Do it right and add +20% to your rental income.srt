1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:11,220
You've probably noticed also on the listing of your property there is the option to add an additional

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,100
charge for extra people.

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,750
Somebody you might have just cost right or this didn't mean anything to you.

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,530
Some of you might have noticed and thought to yourself why is that.

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:26,150
How do I justify to people and charge more for more people of this renting the same space.

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,240
Initially I had the same reaction when you're running a space they kind of figured you're renting the

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:30,660
space.

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,640
What does it matter if I out another person and used to bother in hotels too and they would do it if

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,690
I rent a room for one person and his two beds costs X.

10
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,390
Now if I have two people in the same room it cost more.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,750
I never understood that it sounded like they were just charging more because they could and the case

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,800
of arean be it's partially I think helpful to charge more.

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,920
And I think partially it's still a little bit strange for the most part people accept it.

14
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,450
It's not something we're going to get a lot of kickback for.

15
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,900
People aren't particularly used to it though so don't be surprised when you notice that they're sending

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,530
you the calculations wrong because they didn't factor in the extra costs.

17
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,940
One of the reasons why people don't particularly notice this on Arab PNB is that it's almost automatically

18
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,810
calculated into the first price they see.

19
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,840
They don't ever really see the base price for your apartment unless they are searching for a one person

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,860
stay at a base price then they add people and show them incrementally the price going up when you had

21
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,180
Air B and B it ask you how many guests you have very rarely use one say one gas and forget and say Oh

22
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,630
actually it's seven guests.

23
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,830
Most of the time they just think that that is the price.

24
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:48,030
So I wouldn't particularly worry about that coming off as you know disingenuous.

25
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,790
But I want to help people understand a little bit why if you do get kickback on this you can rationalize

26
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,510
it.

27
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,630
And in my experience what more guests means more utilities especially in the case of a shared apartment

28
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,240
means more flushing of the toilet.

29
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,300
It means more likely to leave the lights on it means you know now you have two people arguing over whether

30
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:13,230
it's hot or cold in the apartment and messing with the thermostat you know it means more consumption

31
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,950
of breakfast goods when you're in a shared space it means that you have to share space with more people.

32
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,250
And that's just something that you feel like you should be compensated for.

33
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:28,000
It's not a huge fee for an additional person and it very rarely is the case that people say oh an extra

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,610
$100 per person is usually an extra 20 bucks and you definitely make money off of that.

35
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,930
I wouldn't say that the extra flushing of the toilets and the breakfast foods end up being an extra

36
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,810
20 bucks per night it is kind of an excuse to add an incremental cost and it makes sense to me because

37
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,540
I typically feel more comfortable for instance if I'm running up my apartment to for people versus nine

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,770
nine people.

39
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,900
It's more chances for things to get scratched up.

40
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,840
It's more traffic in and out we have hardwood floors that has the potential of creating more problems

41
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,280
it's winds up being more of a cleaning job too.

42
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,260
So when you go and get a cleaner and if you're lucky enough to be in San Francisco they have a cleaning

43
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,220
service through FBN be they end up cleaning more and they end up spending more in cleaning supplies

44
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,680
that you have to reimburse them for.

45
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,450
And so it's not negligible it's these are things that you might not have thought about.

46
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,080
But there are definitely things that happen and there is a difference between having four people in

47
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,890
a room versus one person in the room from the host perspective say you're doing a shared room.

48
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,950
It's more noise.

49
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:32,250
It's generally harder to manage larger groups of people than smaller groups more likely to have miscommunications.

50
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,510
It's all of these things you kind of factor in and that's how you come up with this extra person cause

51
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,540
and you might find that it's not the case that you are bothered by it.

52
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:47,460
Typically what I do is I say there's only additional costs once you go past the max capacity.

53
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:53,880
So I would say like for my apartment regularly five people sounds normal for six people and above that

54
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,390
then you're actually creating some strain I think and that's why we charge extra.

55
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:04,230
Typically I would suggest starting out that you start out with no incremental cost but put a cap and

56
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,750
really do think about your cap.

57
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,770
How many people you can fit in your space.

58
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,780
At first it's going to help people balk when they notice that with my three people I can fit in.

59
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,370
And then as you start getting a review base then you can start charging more and then you can start

60
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,770
getting more and more comfortable and then it'll start working like a well-oiled machine as you start

61
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,630
bringing in the gas and you start you know really going to getting experienced with this.

62
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,950
It all gets easier.

63
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,170
But also in general I think opening yourself to large groups and using this extra person fee.

64
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,350
It's a great way of bringing in extra money.

65
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,070
It really is something that can add an extra couple of thousand per month if you're doing a full time

66
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,960
rental or even if you're you know doing a shared space or an all and you charge extra.

67
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,060
It can make a considerable difference.
