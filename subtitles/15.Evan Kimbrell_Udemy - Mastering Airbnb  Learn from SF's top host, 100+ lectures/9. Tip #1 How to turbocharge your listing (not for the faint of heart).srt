1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:11,300
Let's talk about how you can turbocharge your listing this is something that I did not realize at first

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:18,740
when I listed my property on air B and B but over time I realized there's actually something to how

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:24,970
many booking inquiries you get and how many bookings you get in relationship to each other.

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,630
Now what I mean when you go into Arabic and b you go to your Administration panel it's going to show

5
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,850
you how many booking inquiries you have.

6
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,660
It's also going to show you how many bookings you have and they're going to compare them right next

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,850
to each other so you can see maybe you got 10 inquiries per booking maybe you got two inquiries per

8
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:41,860
one booking.

9
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:47,520
In my experience and this is something that Irving has never admitted but guys feel free to test around

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,280
with this.

11
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,100
This is something that I've noticed repeatedly and I've noticed and I've talked to other hosts who have

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,750
noticed a swell.

13
00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:00,710
The more often you book off of each booking inquiry the more likely Air B and B is going to feed you

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,370
more page views.

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,730
So now if you think about it when you search on air B and B and you see the listings what goes into

16
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,950
the search listings.

17
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,440
A lot of it is reviews.

18
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,510
A lot of it is the popularity of the listing.

19
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:20,000
A lot of it is how many people have Wish listed your listing how many people have favored it.

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,460
And those are things that you would think that they use in the search results.

21
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:28,340
But there's one key ingredient that I've noticed that actually is almost bigger than those three things

22
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:35,330
so that is just how many bookings you are taking at first a lot of people are really careful about who

23
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:40,070
they take into their apartment and they might be really picky and so they you know they get three inquiries

24
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,330
they only take one that might actually be a detriment to you.

25
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,890
And I know you're just trying to be careful at first but if you want a turbocharger listing and get

26
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:54,620
a ton of bookings I suggest you actually do the opposite and it's actually difficult.

27
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,300
You really have to put a little bit more thought into how you list your listing what are the possible

28
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,730
problems with hosting a wider variety of types of guests.

29
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:09,800
It's really something that I only suggest people try to do this if they are really comfortable with

30
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:16,410
hosting people and they're really dedicated towards making a lot of money on air being be what you want

31
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,260
to do is you just want to make sure that you book as many people as possible.

32
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,860
You want to make sure that if you get an inquiry you try to fit them in.

33
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,510
And if you absolutely can't make sure it's because you have another booking for that time.

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,570
If Airbnb sees that every person they send to you is more likely to end up booking and who is more likely

35
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,700
to make them money.

36
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,780
They're going to send you a lot more page views they're going to push you up in the search ranks if

37
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:49,740
you want to stay a golden property on air B and B make sure that you do everything you can to book each

38
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,870
inquiry you get.

39
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,950
Try not to be too picky when someone says something you don't like if someone asks you a question can

40
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:01,440
you been some of your rules except us try to say yes if they say can we have a special discount on the

41
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,310
price.

42
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,430
Try to work with them within reason.

43
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,890
You don't necessarily have to give them everything they're asking for.

44
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,250
But I always suggest give them something even if it's very small.

45
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,140
They'll feel like they're getting a deal they're going to want a book with you.

46
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,900
The point is if you really really want to do this or you rent it out 100 percent the time or you really

47
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,150
want to maximize how many people you get try to book every person that you get.

48
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,550
Obviously this is impossible because a lot of people you just cannot book but Air B and B is going to

49
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,000
take that into consideration.

50
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,270
You're going to have a higher booking percentage per booking inquiry and that's going to kind of shoot

51
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:41,280
you up to search results and that's how you get into types of situations where you put up your listing

52
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,500
you've booked out Christmas before the other five properties in your area have even booked out Thanksgiving.
