1
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,880
As promised are now going to talk about your pricing strategy and your position strategy.

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:17,610
Now this is all based on the apartments around you and I want you to keep in mind this is kind of all

3
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,050
in theory because we haven't yet listed your apartment.

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,960
This is something that you're going to do and it's part of the section called laying the groundwork

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,790
or laying the foundation because it's something you need to decide before you go out there and you start

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,570
actually taking bookings and you start actually taking photos and listing your space out.

7
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,100
We've looked at all the properties around you.

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,000
So now we have a good idea of what we're dealing with what we're competing against.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,060
And previously I had mentioned that you should take a comparable property something that's physically

10
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,860
close to you.

11
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:51,850
We're going to take that.

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,040
We're going to expand on that.

13
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:59,710
And this is going to be the anchor point to make our beginning pricing strategy take the property that's

14
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:06,190
the closest to you and I mean the closest to you and a combination of things physical area it does need

15
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,320
to be close to you because location is probably one of the largest determinants of what you can charge

16
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,030
in our popular property is going to be.

17
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:21,790
But also look for places that similar amenities or similar offerings or even a look to their space.

18
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,590
A lot of times you might not even have something to compare yourself against and if that's the case

19
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,880
and I'll talk about that later at the end of this lecture what you should do if you can't really find

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,980
a space that looks like your space.

21
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:37,660
I'm operating on the assumption right now that you can find on that some more similar the two things

22
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,770
I want you to pick your order to call it the doppelganger.

23
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,750
You're going to look for some on that just property that looks exactly like you what's your doppelganger.

24
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,760
The two big things that you want to look for are location and the better room setup.

25
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,650
Those are the two biggest things that are going to term in your price if you are on you know in one

26
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:02,530
area and you're on one street it doesn't necessarily have to be a property on the same street but hopefully

27
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,160
it's near you and not so far away from you that it's a completely different product offering.

28
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,100
It's not something that has a large driving distance between the two.

29
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:16,510
It should be as close to you as possible and in secondary It needs to have a similar bedroom set up

30
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:22,870
you should not compare a three bedroom to a one bedroom a one bedroom compared to a one bedroom.

31
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,310
You know if you really can't find something maybe you compared to a studio or something like that or

32
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,920
maybe you can discount it a little bit and your hand gets a little bit harder when you do that.

33
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:37,150
We'll talk about that again later if you have a two bedroom find a two bedroom hopefully it's near you

34
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,280
pass that.

35
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,210
Everything else is kind of gravy it be nice if they had similar amenities in the sense that maybe you

36
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,580
have a backyard they have a backyard you have parking.

37
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,750
They have parking.

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,130
You know what do they offer TV to they have a TV you don't really need to get that much granularity

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:51,860
into it.

40
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,060
But the better the fit the accurate this process will be.

41
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,650
Do you have your doppelganger.

42
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,100
Maybe you're going to try to do this after the lecture maybe you're doing it as I speak.

43
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,180
Find that one that you think is close enough.

44
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,490
And now everyone's going to post in the group discussion saying hey is this close enough for my ganger.

45
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,530
Chances are it probably is.

46
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,540
I mean you have a good judge of what's similar especially if you did the previous lectures and you actually

47
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,440
went through and looked at everything around you.

48
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,000
You get a pretty good idea of what's available to compare yourself against.

49
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:28,970
I'm going to outline three strategies that I know are effective at starting out.

50
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:34,580
They're all based off of this anchor property this doppelganger property.

51
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,940
You're not necessarily competing head to head with this property but for the practical reasons of determining

52
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,210
what you can charge or what you will charge.

53
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,780
That's the best tool you can possible use.

54
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,260
I think also that if anyone at this point is wondering yes that's nice it's all relative to someone

55
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:52,570
else.

56
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,900
But what can I actually get from my property.

57
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,180
Find that one anchor property and look at the prices that they're charging.

58
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,520
Look at what they've actually looked at and congratulations that is the absolute minimum that you can

59
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,930
charge for your property.

60
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,900
They're looking out for $150 a night.

61
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,230
You could book out for $150 a night.

62
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,230
The book it out every single day of the month that's forty five hundred dollars.

63
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,050
There was a booking it out for $500 a night.

64
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,420
Wow.

65
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,510
That's a lot of money.

66
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,030
That probably means you could also book it out for $500 a night if you're identical to them.

67
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,140
You might have some price competition but.

68
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,340
Five hundred dollars a night that's $15000 a month.

69
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,810
That's a lot of money.

70
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,570
Don't pat yourself on the back.

71
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:28,890
Yes.

72
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,720
What you want to do though is again look at that property.

73
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,090
And here's strategy number one take your doppelganger.

74
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,610
Look at what they are charging.

75
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,140
Look what they are offering.

76
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,690
And you can do this on a Scratchie.

77
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,220
And maybe I'll add this in the resources section of this course.

78
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,480
You want to look at what they offer what they charge.

79
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:58,140
Now strategy one is to design your space to offer the exact same thing as them but you're going to charge

80
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,160
less.

81
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,030
When I see the exact same thing what are you going to think oh there's a lot of things that I can't

82
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,040
do.

83
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,830
You know I don't have a rooftop bar.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,710
I don't have a swimming pool.

85
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,690
Things like that.

86
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,240
Obviously those two you cannot change.

87
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,020
You would be surprised how much you can close the gap in terms of amenities parking you can find parking

88
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,160
TV.

89
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,830
You can purchase a TV.

90
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,280
These are things that are not completely out of the question for what you can do.

91
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,960
You know even if it's the case that they have laundry and you use a laundromat Why don't you include

92
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,560
a $5 stipend or why don't you just put change on the counter for every gas so they can go to the laundromat

93
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,170
that's closing the gap you want to get as close to them as possible and then you want to offer less.

94
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:45,390
Why does this make sense and makes sense because when someone searches they see these two properties

95
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,510
you want to edge them out for that kind of mindshare.

96
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,970
They'll see you and chances are if they're a savvy consumer and most of them bookers are pretty savvy

97
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,490
they've used this before.

98
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,460
Or maybe they haven't used it before but it's fairly obvious they're going to look at that too and they're

99
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,430
going to do their due diligence because they're spending lots of money to stay at your place.

100
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,920
They're going to look at two of these properties and go oh OK they're virtually the same thing but this

101
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,540
one's significantly cheaper.

102
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,750
That's obviously a value deal right there.

103
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,610
That's a great deal for them.

104
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,810
They're going to think not only are they going to be happy that they feel like they've saved money they're

105
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,700
also going to be happy because they feel like they got the same experience or you know the best experience

106
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,660
they could without absolutely breaking the bank that's going to make them more enthusiastic about your

107
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:35,470
listing to if someone was running out a studio apartment for $100 a night and it was a studio apartment

108
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,220
had everything you would assume would be in a studio apartment then someone else left to right next

109
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:45,160
to it and they list it for $75 or $50 you're going to feel pretty smart that you booked it and that's

110
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,700
going to be reflected in your listing are going to say this is a great deal you're going to get higher

111
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:54,680
ratings and your value strategy number two obviously is very similar.

112
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,750
You want to take your doppelganger and you want to offer more than them but charge the same price.

113
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,440
It's just jockeying you put them in the loser position and don't think of it like oh that's a never

114
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,220
ending spiral if I lower my prices lower their prices lower price.

115
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:15,980
It's just not the case it's not that competitive the market reactions or the reactions in the host community

116
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,310
are not that fast.

117
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:23,770
Maybe they might if you have a really active host which is you know a lot of them are very active but

118
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,490
they're not constantly trolling the other properties to see how they're going to edge everyone out.

119
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,050
It's typically something they do at the beginning to see that at least I have an idea of where I'm going

120
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,760
to be and to be honest most hosts actually don't even do this.

121
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:41,030
But it's not something that you know if you lower $20 they're going to find the next day that they lower

122
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,020
those thing $20.

123
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,960
It's just rarely the case.

124
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:49,520
So what you could do and this is obviously limited to what you have available is you can go and try

125
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,240
to beat out their property fine with their listing and offer more.

126
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,260
And it might be the case that your doppelganger is one of those properties that just doesn't offer a

127
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,850
lot.

128
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,570
They didn't take a lot of time to add small things.

129
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,630
And later we're going to talk about going to the actual listing and what are small things you can add

130
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:11,120
to make yourself better and there's a laundry list of things you can do take little money little effort

131
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,860
and sometimes no money no effort that can edge out your competition.

132
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,980
And these are just things that most the host just don't do.

133
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,820
And that's why I'm very confident in Air B and B is a platform that you can make a lot of money off

134
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:29,690
of because there's a lot of money being passed around and the vast majority of hosts just do not put

135
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:36,160
any thought into how to position their apartment how to beat out the other people what to offer.

136
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,310
What are things that their guests would need.

137
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,820
It's not a mystery what your guests need and we'll go over that later.

138
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,160
But there are very small things you can do.

139
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,370
We're talking general strategies right now.

140
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,790
Later we'll get into the nitty gritty of how do you actually beat them out.

141
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,050
If you have a doppelganger that is like I said maybe short on the amenities list or maybe you already

142
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,520
matched them maybe already have the same thing they have you go out and just add something.

143
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,370
Get a parking spot or ask your neighbor his parking spot or maybe you know offer a better experience

144
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,200
maybe you can decorate your space a little bit better.

145
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,690
Maybe you can offer better tips for what to do in the area.

146
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,710
Better host support.

147
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,550
That's a huge difference too and that's something that you can make obvious on the front page of your

148
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,250
listing.

149
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:27,890
It the take away one thing from this lecture other than the actual identifiable strategies that I know

150
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,450
work and it worked for me and I've worked for other hosts.

151
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:35,470
If there's one concept you can take away from this it's all about product your apartment.

152
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,570
The space that you create between you and other hosts Now you're going to get a lot of space between

153
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:49,430
you and the other host not necessarily if someone's listening an apartment a two bedroom for $200 and

154
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:54,970
the next two bedroom is something that is listed for $400.

155
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,600
And the last isn't that much different maybe their fixtures are nicer maybe their area areas slightly

156
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,540
nicer.

157
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,150
There's a big area between $200 and $400 that's huge.

158
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,070
So what you want to do is you want to own the most space.

159
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,020
It's like the price is right.

160
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,540
Does anyone watch the prices right.

161
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,790
I'm sure you guys have.

162
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:21,560
Now if I bid $5 and the next person bids $12 What's an effective pricing strategy chances are it's probably

163
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:28,010
in the middle so you're going to want to bid 5 0 1 or you want to bid eleven ninety nine because that's

164
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:34,870
going to own the most space if he thought it was over that price and you do 12 to 1 or four ninety nine.

165
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,120
You don't want to say six.

166
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:43,100
Why do you not want to say six because then if the price is 5:49 the person who bid the low bid it's

167
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,690
going to win out against you and there's no point in you bidding in the middle like that.

168
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:54,170
Similarly you know if you say it's smack dab right in the center at eight fifty What ends up happening

169
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,930
is you just lower the space you can command.

170
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:01,100
That's a little bit abstract but it seems like basic pricing logic.

171
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,050
Let's go back to that scenario saying if you a $200 apartment and a $400 apartment you want to bid your

172
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,710
thing at say you know make it better than the lower auction but and comparable to the higher option

173
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,580
in terms of amenities and what you offer.

174
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:20,630
But go and listed it to 25 or to 10 something like that really you're going to eat the lunch for the

175
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,790
person who's listening in at $400 and you're going to get all these people to look at the other place

176
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:29,320
that's $200 and say oh for an extra 25 bucks I can get a much better apartment.

177
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,670
It's all about owning that space.

178
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,900
And it's something that you do revaluations with every like year or six months because new properties

179
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,760
get listed typically in the case of Airbnb because these are not professionals listing their property

180
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,670
as many properties will get delisted as get listed.

181
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,700
So like in MySpace every time I kind of go in there I'll notice that two new people have entered but

182
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,870
also three people have left or maybe three have entered and two have left.

183
00:11:53,870 --> 00:12:00,530
It's worth checking this every six months or whenever a year I want you guys to know that throughout

184
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,130
this course we're going to teaching you how to be a rock star kind of host.

185
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:11,390
And that is going to be your unfair advantage against everyone else if you match someone at $200 you

186
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,410
just Samuelsohn the exact same thing.

187
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,990
If you follow the tips and the rest of this course you'll be better than them.

188
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:23,180
I can guarantee that unless you have the case where you just have that one host who is insane about

189
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,310
this who runs a bed and breakfast on the side and brings all sorts of expertise to this that you couldn't

190
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,930
match.

191
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,930
And here in that case you're going to give them a run for their money again.

192
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,750
Also it's Air B and B everyone ends up winning because they're going to book that property and then

193
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,380
you're available and chances are you're going to get bookings as well.

194
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,830
It's not a zero sum game.

195
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:43,940
Everyone kind of wins everyone gets money it's just a question of who gets the lion's share of the bookings.

196
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,120
Like I said you have an unfair advantage.

197
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,650
So operate with that in mind that you're going to beat out pretty much everyone else because you're

198
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:56,780
going to do the small stuff and you got to focus on the low effort high reward tactics that were going

199
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,430
to go over in the rest of the course.

200
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,710
There's one other strategy that I think is effective but it really is dependent on your market.

201
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,890
It's the strategy of offering what's not available.

202
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:15,370
And I mean that in the case of if you're in a developing market say or hometown or something like that

203
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,800
and some people have discovered and there's definitely bookings but not mature yet it might be the case

204
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,190
that certain things are just not offered.

205
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:29,830
And so like for instance if you have a two bedroom apartment and no one is offering a private room that's

206
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:34,220
cheap you might have an opportunity there and maybe you should try to offer that.

207
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:38,290
Maybe it's the case that there are no three bedroom apartments.

208
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,140
You know maybe have a limitation in the sense you only a two bedroom apartment.

209
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:46,150
But again we're going to go over this later there's a tap on later in the course to talk about air bed

210
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:52,090
strategies and how you can actually turn a two bedroom into a three bedroom or at least kind of ostensibly

211
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,410
at least get the bookings for that obviously gets reflected in your price.

212
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,270
But it's a strategy you can use.

213
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:02,200
So stick around to the course because there's just going to be a lot of big tips around that and other

214
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,760
tips kind of around how you can make your space and twisted into something that you didn't think it

215
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,250
was you originally had.

216
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:15,730
The strategy that I wanted to outline that I think is replicable and applicable in most markets most

217
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:21,640
situations is the strategy of just identifying what's missing in your area.

218
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,620
It's not as simple as it sounds.

219
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,610
You really have to spend a little bit more time.

220
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,840
Previously we're just getting a feel for your area.

221
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,690
Might spend a little bit more time there if nothing immediately jumped out to you.

222
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,840
You might want to go back and look again what's on offer.

223
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,720
Money on a write it out today.

224
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,440
This area has got two bedrooms it's got a wide range of pricing on two bedrooms got three bedrooms got

225
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,570
one bedrooms.

226
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,550
This strategy kind of predicates itself on is that there is something missing in your area.

227
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,340
There are multiple types of people booking on Airbnb and it's very hard that every single area hits

228
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,720
every single possible configuration of a guest type in a guest group.

229
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,330
Our space we really had no one who could haul 10 people.

230
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:17,640
We really had no one who could fit six or seven in a professional hire in space.

231
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:23,390
I say professional in the sense that it can actually compete with the hotel with regards to amenities

232
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,320
and the quality of the apartment.

233
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:31,730
So just look for things that are missing and then try to angle your apartment around offering or filling

234
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,920
that void.

235
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:38,060
New Markets are some huge voids I mean someone coming to town for a business trip or they're a traveler

236
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,850
and they just want somewhere that's easy to check into easy to get around.

237
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,740
Not necessarily a tourist.

238
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,620
Maybe that's something that you want to offer.

239
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,480
Or maybe it's the case.

240
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,070
You know your area doesn't really having that thing that's suitable to families one needs.

241
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:59,030
I've noticed that people don't offer parking as often and so you can't make the assumption that every

242
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:03,420
single Airbnb guest is going to be flying in and not going need to park.

243
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:07,010
Groups typically are going be more likely to drive in.

244
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,630
And also couples they drive in and maybe that people just have neglected and maybe that's something

245
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,820
you can capitalize on.

246
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:19,670
I think it's the case that you can always find a space that is available that's not being met.

247
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,000
It just depends on your market.

248
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,160
San Francisco pretty much everything's been met.

249
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,660
There's some smaller kind of nuance spots that I can try to angle for.

250
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:32,150
But you have to have a belief that that spot is not being served has a lot of demand.

251
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,870
Otherwise you're going to be angling your apartment towards a very very specific type of group.

252
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,850
And while you might have broad appeal you might be losing to the other apartments that try to kind of

253
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,150
cast their net more widely.

254
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,350
Like promise before we can discuss a little bit about if you can't find a doppelganger where you can't

255
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:59,260
find an apartment that looks like you what you can do in this case and this is one thing I generally

256
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:05,140
suggest doing is grab a hotel in the area and see what they're charging and figure out roughly what

257
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,700
they're offering that's the standard.

258
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:12,430
You know there's a way of doing this also as you can look at an Air B and B that's around you that might

259
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,200
be slightly different.

260
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,520
And you can use some deductive logic to figure out roughly where you are in comparison so if you're

261
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:24,310
comparing say a one bedroom to a two bedroom if you have a two bedroom you can typically charge 75 percent

262
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:28,960
more at least 50 percent more and then if you go from a two bedroom two or three bedroom it's it's more

263
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,920
like 50 percent more anywhere as low as 30 percent more the premium even charge per extra bedroom tapers

264
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,190
off very quickly.

265
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,650
But that's something you take into consideration if you're comparing yourself and your two bedroom to

266
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:49,870
a one bedroom deduct 75 percent of or you can add 75 percent to the price of the studio to roughly reflect

267
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:57,580
what the two bedroom would be if there's a two bedroom that's listed for two hundred dollars and you're

268
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:03,280
a one bedroom in your listing you can make a pretty good deduction that you could list this thing.

269
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:10,180
So as a reduction of 50 percent would be a hundred and a reduction of 75 percent would put you at $50.

270
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:14,620
That's a general range that you're going to be occupying if you're a really nice space.

271
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,830
The other place isn't particularly nice.

272
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:24,100
You can probably edge up closer to 200 but you're not going to eclipse the two bedroom that is offering

273
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:29,440
200 and you have a one bedroom you're just not going to go over two hundred and go and leapfrog them

274
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:36,670
unless you somehow magically added a bedroom or in the case that that host just implodes and they take

275
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:42,280
that thing off the market or they just have a host of no pun intended of errors.

276
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,010
They just have tons of reviews that are negative and they're not responding to it.

277
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:50,080
That's enough to kill that property and you can kind of prompt them in that case.

278
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,970
Those are two ways of looking at it.

279
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,850
I'm going to add a bonus section on here a quick tip about another strategy that you can use and I touch

280
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,790
on a slightly about hotels.

281
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,740
So look for that tip later.

282
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,130
So again if you guys have any questions posted in the group discussion again if you want to go over

283
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:10,650
anything or anything you want me to put an elaboration of section on let me know.

284
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,130
Send me a private message.

285
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,020
The next section I'm going to go over a little bit more of how you can actually drill down against other
