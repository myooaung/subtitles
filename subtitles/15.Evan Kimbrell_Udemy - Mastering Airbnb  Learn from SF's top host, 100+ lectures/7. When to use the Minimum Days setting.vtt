Let's talk a little bit about the setting on your air B and B listing page that's for minimum days.

2
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.840
Basically all Aramean be is asking you is that you want to set a limit to how many days someone needs

3
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.880
to stay before they can book.

4
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.380
Most commonly I see people look for a minimum of two days or say minimum of four days.

5
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.000
If you're looking to rent and not have to deal with a lot of check ins and check outs that is something

6
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.310
that you can consider.

7
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.430
I've met other hosts who list their properties with minimums of say like seven days because in their

8
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.070
experience they found that if you want to stay for seven days the likelihood of getting a positive review

9
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.980
is better but also it makes sense for them at that point.

10
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.820
It's like finding almost a long term tenant except it's limited to we can get a lot more money so a

11
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.850
lot of times they will rent one week of a spare room and that's enough to pay let's say half the rent

12
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.980
or depending on how much they charge me the entirety of the rent.

13
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.210
So we're talking about starting off what you need to be thinking about is what's going to get me off

14
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.320
to the best beginnings scenario with minimum days.

15
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.320
All I'm going to say is at the beginning please consider setting it at one day.

16
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.430
Don't set a minimum day.

17
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.570
The reason why is because at the very beginning we want to get reviews and reviews are going to be crucial

18
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.730
going forward.

19
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.140
And so that you can move up this search ranking on air B and B.

20
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.470
And now if you set your minimum to one a lot of times what will happen is you'll get people who want

21
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.950
to stay for one night.

22
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.040
It sounds like a lot of effort like how to clean the you know say a space or your apartment.

23
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.810
Have them come in and then leave after one night but you have to think of at it from a review standpoint.

24
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.560
That's one person one night with the possibility of getting a positive review if you have a lot of people

25
00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.910
coming in coming out.

26
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.810
Yes you might burn out or you know spend a lot of energy cleaning and flipping.

27
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.840
But you can build up a review very quickly and that's what we're most concerned about at the beginning.

28
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.470
I also think that it's the case that if you set a minimum too early you can preclude yourself from getting

29
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.170
a lot of bookings and then towards the future after a couple of months then you can start getting pickier

30
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.800
then you can start setting higher minimums.

31
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.010
If you want to.

32
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.880
In my experience once you do have a property that has kind of a wall of social proof and you've had

33
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.350
a lot of people come in and out typically setting a minimum is helpful.

34
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.960
But I personally I set it usually two days and you know it just depending sometimes I don't even set

35
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.100
it.

36
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.690
If you're someone who's running out your entire apartment it's really counterproductive to set a minimum

37
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.390
day's a requirement because say I'm running out in June what I'll end up happening is I'll have say

38
00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.090
eight or nine rentals and they're all typically two to three to four nights and I'll have these in-between

39
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.000
nights where it's rented Monday Tuesday Wednesday for one group and the second group comes on Friday

40
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.170
Saturday Sunday.

41
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.480
That one day that you're missing in terms of my apartment that's $400.

42
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:20.340
So it's very hard to get the entire fill rate that I ideally would like takeaway is I think that you

43
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.090
should not set a minimum at the beginning.

44
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.250
If you do.

45
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.800
Just be aware that you're really limiting how many inquiries are getting and it's going to take longer

46
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.140
for you to develop a review base.

47
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.870
You guys have any questions you want to know if there's any exceptions to this.

48
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.870
Just let me know posts in the group section or send me a private message.
