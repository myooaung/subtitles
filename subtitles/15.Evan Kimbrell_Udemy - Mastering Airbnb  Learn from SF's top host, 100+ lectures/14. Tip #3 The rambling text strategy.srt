00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,360
Another tip I call it the rambling taxed.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,510
What does the rambling text I'm talking about.

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,200
The description on your listing.

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:20,600
You'll notice this that typically if you write a good listing it's going to be below the fold at least

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,690
in the new design of European be it more to see the rest of it.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,540
You don't realize though is that I don't believe that they actually have a character limit on the description.

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,870
And if they do it's something that's a very very high.

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:40,180
If any of you have ever read any of those sales the kind of letters were they you know they just keep

9
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:46,900
going on and on pitching their product in their pages and pages of this long train of thought explaining

10
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,800
you want this product for what it's going to do for you.

11
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,680
How that's going to fix everything for you.

12
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:56,950
There's something to that and not that you should read something gimmicky or sales.

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:06,080
The reason they make those e-mails or those sales pitches so long is because once it hooks someone and

14
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,510
they're interested they will read it to the end and the longer they read the more and more inclined

15
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,880
they are to purchase the product.

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,320
In this case you can use that strategy as well.

17
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,210
No limit to how much you can write.

18
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,880
So you might as well just write as much as you can.

19
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,870
When I did my listing I wrote out every single thing I could think of that could be an additional point.

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,980
And I just wrote them all.

21
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,840
I didn't have to think about what to drop.

22
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,390
What's not important what's more important I just listed it all.

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,670
I mean I literally went in and said I did the walking distances to every single place of interest that's

24
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,970
from my apartment Nejad on Google Maps that took up a lot of space.

25
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:48,760
You know I listed out every single feature and amenity and I list it out even though it's already listed

26
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,290
on the airplane listing and it's even less so these sorts of things about San Francisco and the events

27
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:57,770
that are coming up and what you can see from our apartment.

28
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,670
And I think that's one of the contributing factors to my success was that the more you write the more

29
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:08,950
information you give the more comfortable guests going to feel booking and feel free to ramble on and

30
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,340
on.

31
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,920
I mean if they don't read it they don't read it.

32
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,260
But there's nothing wrong with more information.

33
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:20,500
And I think that guests can discern from listening that has great photographs but not a lot of tax description

34
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,310
meaning that the host isn't really putting a lot of effort into describing it.

35
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,080
So if you put a lot it gives off the impression and this is the trend more hosts are now writing more

36
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,080
on their description.

37
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,380
It gives the impression that you are one of those top 10 percent of hosts or top 10 percent property

38
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,050
because they can tell you're putting a lot of effort into it.

39
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,310
In reality you can write this rambling text all in 10 minutes.

40
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,010
If you have something you think is additional That could be something that they could be interested

41
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,220
in list it out put it on your list and keep going don't worry about the length.

42
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,880
No one's going to dock you for that.
