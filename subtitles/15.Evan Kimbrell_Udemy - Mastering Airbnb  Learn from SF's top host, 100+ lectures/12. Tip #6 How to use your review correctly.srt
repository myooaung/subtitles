00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,590
Hosting Tip Number Six It's called the review.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,810
When I say in their review hopefully you guys recognize that there's a two way system for use in our

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,960
BNP.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,880
You're going to see the reviews that people view but similarly you can leave reviews for other people

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,630
who stay at your apartment or your home.

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,910
And so what ends up happening people who frequently use Air B and B will actually have a review base

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,960
and some of them actually thought their profiles with information and photographs so you can see them

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,310
before they come.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:42,720
Really the temp I'm going to give you on this one is that the review you leave the other guest is completely

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,750
worthless.

11
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:49,410
A lot of times guests will give you a capricious kind of mean spirited review and it's completely unfounded

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,720
and they usually make a joke or sponsored You know like a rebuttal to that saying Oh well I can also

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,250
leave them for review and that's somehow a deterrent from them leaving you a negative review.

14
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,790
It's simply not a let me explain to you why this is the case if you let your property area be has to

15
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,400
verify your property before it actually gets listed.

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,580
They list out what your address is.

17
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,970
So if you get a negative review and you get several negative reviews people will stop saying in your

18
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,800
place and you can't then and go and delete your listing and try to start all over again and starting

19
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,500
another listing because it won't get approved by our BNP.

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,220
Now on the flip side or the guest that's not the case if a guest wants to stay at your apartment only

21
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:34,380
verification they do is automatic and it's I.D. verification and only just goes off of a photo of their

22
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,410
face and it doesn't it's not going to match their name or anything.

23
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,670
So if they get a negative review and they notice that it's stopping them from getting a rent again in

24
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,360
Arabic and B they'll just delete their account and recreate it.

25
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,460
I have seen that several times I've had people who come in a group of three and they use one person's

26
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,840
air being a profile and then when I actually know them a little bit it's because the other person and

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,670
the negative are few.

28
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,710
So they just use the other person's.

29
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,120
It's very easy to get around this one previously and this is very new.

30
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,250
The review system we have now is very new.

31
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,460
Previously what would happen is a gas would stay.

32
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,730
And then as soon as they leave they can leave review and you can leave review and there's a period for

33
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,630
which that if they don't leave review their ability to do that expires.

34
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,180
And then if they deliver a view they can added it up to a certain point of time a or b and b responded

35
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,980
to a lot of feedback on this negative feedback from the house saying well this doesn't really make any

36
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,740
sense because I can't give them a honest legitimate review because I'm afraid of them having reprisals

37
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,620
against my property which is much more important than their guest account.

38
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,220
So what they did is now have a new system.

39
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,260
It's like a silent feedback system where you don't get to see their review till you give them a review

40
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,910
or you don't get to see their review until you wait a certain amount of time then it goes public.

41
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:54,060
So that house helped a little bit in the sense that just can't see that you said something nasty so

42
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,400
they can respond and say something nasty back to you.

43
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,390
But they can still edit the review so it doesn't really fix that problem.

44
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,380
They could after the review period see that you actually said something negative about them then go

45
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,170
back and edit their review.

46
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,750
And I've seen that happen why tip here is that don't worry about your view.

47
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,560
Don't worry what it's going to mean for the other person reviewing you if you want a good review and

48
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,920
I want to make sure you have a good review.

49
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,860
Contact them directly.

50
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,320
Make sure that when they leave you say something to them.

51
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,730
You know you say hope you have a great fly.

52
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,800
Really enjoyed having you whatever.

53
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,750
It's something that is going to make them understand that it's a little bit more personal than not going

54
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,710
to be going to be less inclined to give you a negative review.

55
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,030
You leaving them or view and saying something positive about them.

56
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,050
It used to be the case that that would often warrant them in return saying something nice but now it's

57
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,280
not the case because they don't get to see your review and tell Dave posts that there's And they're

58
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,990
very unlikely to go back and edit it add more nice things.

59
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,350
It's just not really the case that it really matters what you say.

60
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,100
Everybody's feedback system is constantly changing that the moment it's not.

61
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,550
And they know that it's kind of broken and that's how they're taking steps to improve it.

62
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,830
It has improved.

63
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,130
It's not perfect.

64
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:12,200
The one thing I would say about your review and if you do just have time to add reviews at the end and

65
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,350
this is something I've noticed a lot of posts that we started doing was since we knew that guests would

66
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,910
just delete their account or use a different account or just not use their BND as much if we gave them

67
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:29,300
blatantly negative reviews started using subtler ways of indicating that the person was crazy or the

68
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,070
person was not worth having in your home.

69
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,920
And so oftentimes you'll find someone who has something like that on their profile.

70
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,000
They have a sentence that says the guest was interesting.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,140
Period.

72
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:47,720
Now if you are aghast reading that doesn't mean anything to you but me as a host meaning that that means

73
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,450
he's probably bat shit crazy.

74
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,890
So look for those subtle cues that is something that for the last two years I just noticed that we would

75
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,040
do that.

76
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,710
Sarah I mentioned previously that you might hear something like saying oh he's eccentric.

77
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:06,350
If it's not obviously positive that it's actually probably negative because these reviews are actually

78
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,330
worthless.

79
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,950
There's no point really in doing them unless you just want to feel good about yourself.

80
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:17,180
It's nice as a host being you'll see that they have reviews but this is the point we're looking for

81
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:23,030
other hosts to put subtle cues on it saying maybe if you have other options you should go with the other

82
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,360
option.

83
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,700
The eyes of any questions just post in the group discussion will get to them.
