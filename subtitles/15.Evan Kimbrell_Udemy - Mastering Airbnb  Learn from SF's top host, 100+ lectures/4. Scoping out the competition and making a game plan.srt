1
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,750
Now that we've established what it is that you want to list and whether or not you can list we need

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,200
to take a little bit of time to do some background research.

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,130
I call this laying the foundation.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,010
I don't think it's going to take a large amount of time on your part maybe an hour or maybe two hours

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,290
depending on how into it you get.

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,530
But you need to do is start looking at your area on air PNB.

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,290
Typically the way you would do this is you just go to or B and B search for your area.

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,200
You can search specifically for the area.

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,100
My apartment was in an area called Fisherman's Wharf.

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,410
You can search for Fisherman's Wharf San Francisco and then set some dates in the future but not too

11
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,430
far in the future.

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:50,070
And then look at kind of what populates the another way of doing this is you can just search for City

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,810
and then drag the map towards the area and maybe the area and doesn't have a specific name.

14
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:00,380
You are not in a big enough city that has a neighborhood title for it.

15
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,750
Or you can search for the specifically the area.

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,620
The downside of searching specifically for the area is that sometimes the search engine doesn't specifically

17
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,110
pick up on certain listings.

18
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,710
So sometimes there are areas that are technically Fisherman's Wharf but it doesn't pick up on them Air

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,230
B and B also has a centric understanding of what constitutes each neighborhood.

20
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,580
Sometimes as a local you can look at this and say no it's not right that should extend up at least three

21
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,690
more blocks.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,490
But first what you want to do is you look at the space here and now we're not going to do anything in

23
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,380
this lecture in the sense that we're not going to be working towards anything on your list.

24
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,390
We're not going to be building out a listing yet.

25
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,970
This is just so you can get a better mental idea of what you need to compete and what you need to be

26
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,450
successful on air B and B.

27
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:50,570
Now that you've searched for your area pick a very average let's say pick one person for two nights.

28
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,050
And the reason I'm saying one person is because of the search for one person.

29
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,660
Anyone who can accommodate up to one person.

30
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,400
So that's all the way up to eight people 10 people.

31
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,490
Everyone will show up.

32
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:05,640
Really what you're trying to do is you're trying to fish out every single listing that's available in

33
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,970
that area and you don't want to preclude any of the larger listings by search terms that are too narrow.

34
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:17,400
Because we're going to build a complete kind of profile around this to figure out what exactly should

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,570
your angle be in the next couple years and then talk about how do you take all of this information.

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,620
How do you turn it into a strategy immediately just start browsing the spaces around your area.

37
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,990
Personally I like to pick the first property that's the absolute closest to my property.

38
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,150
This is a generally a good idea to see kind of what an anchor point is going to give you an idea of

39
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,910
what people are running it out for and what other people think about your specific area within your

40
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,570
neighborhood specifically.

41
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,920
Like I said we're in Fisherman's Wharf now.

42
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,240
There's a big difference whether or not you are located on Larkin Street or you are located on Hyde

43
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,860
Street.

44
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,190
These are two parallel streets that are right next to each other.

45
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,490
What's the big difference.

46
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,930
Highstreet has a cable car line on it.

47
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,890
That's a big plus for tourists that's a big plus for anybody who's never been to the city before and

48
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,040
once to get the quintessential San Francisco experience.

49
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,960
Now if you're on Larkin Street which is literally a block away I mean it is a one minute walk.

50
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,680
You don't actually have this.

51
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,300
That street feels like there's not as much attention on it is a big difference.

52
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,530
But in terms of distance it's actually very small.

53
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:26,970
Now that's why saying look at a property that's close to you and ideally look for a property that's

54
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,840
going to be similar to what you're listing listing a private room.

55
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,660
Let's look for a private room that's physically close to you.

56
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,160
If you're missing a full apartment look for one that's physically close to you.

57
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,760
But then look for one that offers kind of similar amenities maybe of a two bedroom look for a two bedroom

58
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,140
that's closest to you.

59
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,880
This is going to give you a good idea of what is the production quality of the other listings around

60
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,090
you.

61
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,500
What's their popularity and what's the host quality.

62
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,940
Now what do I say about production value.

63
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,460
Look at the listings.

64
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,200
How nice are the photographs.

65
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,420
How many amenities do they offer.

66
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,690
How well-thought out are the actual images.

67
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,340
How long is the description.

68
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,810
How long are the reviews.

69
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,260
That's always something that's worth looking at.

70
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,910
Long reviews mean that the hosts are putting a lot of time into the guest.

71
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,430
Shorter reviews typically means that it's a situation where they probably don't have interaction with

72
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,140
the guests they hand off the keys and they just kind of go.

73
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,180
Typically someone who has very little interaction a host will give a shorter view.

74
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,450
They'll just say great area great space.

75
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,250
I prefer it if the dishwasher worked.

76
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,090
If you have an actual relationship with the gas and people are actually putting effort into it you'll

77
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,450
see those in the reviews very quickly back to production quality.

78
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,350
Take a look at some of the properties around you.

79
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,990
Look at their amenities list.

80
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,880
Are we talking about areas that are clearly college students listing out their separate space or listing

81
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,570
up their apartment while they're gone.

82
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,040
You can tell that there's clutter in the photographs.

83
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,370
You can tell that it was taken on an iPhone they didn't actually take the time to get the Airbnb photos.

84
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,810
Take all of this mentally into account.

85
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:03,890
Are we talking about apartments that have hot tubs and roof deck or are we talking about spaces that

86
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:09,080
don't actually have anything they don't even offer laundry it's clean laundry across the street.

87
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,750
They're not going to offer a linen service.

88
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,980
They're not going to offer a stocked fridge.

89
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,130
It's really just you get what you get.

90
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,970
Production quality just take a gander FBN me has a kind of skews this a little bit in the sense that

91
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,320
when you look at their page they have put a lot of thought into their page design.

92
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:31,070
They are well known for having some of the best industry leading design in terms of tech companies and

93
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,850
Web site.

94
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,190
They do a very good job of making everything look good.

95
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,820
So take that out of your judgment and look at the listing itself.

96
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,290
Let's look at the description.

97
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,860
Does it go below the fold.

98
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,870
What I mean by that is you have to click the More button the More button that means the person really

99
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,100
put some description into it.

100
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,510
They're really planning on this being rented out anything that's shorter than a bold will typically

101
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,740
mean that someone threw this up as an experiment or something that they're just not particularly putting

102
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,560
a lot of thought into.

103
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,490
Now that's only one dimension that you can use to look at the properties in your space.

104
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,800
The next dimension that I had mentioned was popularity.

105
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:11,690
You're going to use some of the skill set I introduced earlier in the course where you can go and take

106
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:18,550
a look at each property look at their reviews look at their calendar to figure out how popular are they.

107
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:24,160
You remember from earlier in the course of an essay in general you want to shy away from the calendar.

108
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:31,430
But in this case I think it's a decent tool to use to figure out what bookings look like how what is

109
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:37,010
a fill rate look like the gold standard for telling whether or not something as popular as the review

110
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,510
you want to look at the properties you want to look at the reviews and you want to look at the density

111
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,960
of the reviews.

112
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,870
Did they get the real reviews this month.

113
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,910
That is typically a very good sign.

114
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,430
That could mean that they are booking a lot.

115
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,250
That could mean that they're booking not so much.

116
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:57,740
You can't always tell what the ratio of guests that stay to guests that stay and leave reviews are in

117
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,750
most cases it's going to be two to one or three to one depending if you host them.

118
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,940
They're typically going to leave or of you more often.

119
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,480
So you do not host them then they're going to leave review less often.

120
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:14,000
But again the quality of your listing will often necessitate more reviews if you really have a cool

121
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,580
quirky kind of space.

122
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,530
People are going to review that a lot more.

123
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:22,310
And when we're talking about popularity which was the second kind of item that I listened out you want

124
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:29,780
to focus on let's restrict this analysis towards the top say five to 10 listings depending on how much

125
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,670
demand is for your area.

126
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:38,500
And also when I say area you don't have an area title it's the area that you squirrelled your map over.

127
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,880
And what listings show up because it'll it'll create a custom search showing what the top listings for

128
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,200
that space are.

129
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,630
So if you do not have an area title then we're just talking about whatever shows up in your search listing

130
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,670
for your parameters for the space that you're viewing because you know your space better than anyone

131
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,040
else.

132
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,090
That's probably your area.

133
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,350
So now you have your area and you have the top search listings for that area.

134
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:09,770
You've essentially isolated out the listings that have hosts that are probably more engaged in the general

135
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,540
population on air B and B the population of hosts.

136
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:18,200
You see people who actually have a track record of hosting typically on Airbnb you'll notice that there

137
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:26,090
might be five to ten power listings in each area and then you have a trailing end users who try it every

138
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,550
now and then or never really got into AD.

139
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,580
Are they listed in an abandoned.

140
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,530
So you really want to take that second portion those people that are casual users are not particularly

141
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,560
into it out of the equation.

142
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,010
Look at the top five to 10.

143
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,170
So you have your five you have your 10.

144
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,670
Maybe it's three maybe it's even just two that you notice are pretty active.

145
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,190
Take a look at the reviews again.

146
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,830
We use the skills from before how do you determine the general popularity of a listing or just do that

147
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,910
now for that five to 10.

148
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:03,230
If you have a lot of properties with a lot or abuse and a lot of high density of reviews meaning that

149
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,750
you have lots of people booking within the same month and leaving reviews Typically this is a good sign.

150
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,730
Maybe you're in a hot spot hotspots are good hotspots can command a premium.

151
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,870
Now if you're not in a hot spot it doesn't necessarily mean anything.

152
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,310
You can always lower your prices or you can always find some angle that someone else can't capitalize

153
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:19,690
on.

154
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:25,070
They live in an area that's not as central but say you have more space you can use that as your angle

155
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,120
to capitalize on it.

156
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,140
Sure people will come and they want to be in the central area but they might give that up if you have

157
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,840
free parking or they might give that up if you have extra space because they're in an extra large group.

158
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,090
Maybe they have a kid they won't have an extra room for their kid but they want to pay extra for that.

159
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,020
There's always an angle for it.

160
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:47,140
Take a general look at what your popularity looks like for this spot if it's abysmal.

161
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,950
No one's getting any reviews.

162
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,320
That doesn't necessarily mean anything but that's generally negative indication.

163
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:57,270
Maybe you lower your expectations for how often you book when you look at the calendars.

164
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:02,330
And before I said not to do this but you can do this because you're doing it a holistic approach you're

165
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:06,020
looking at multiple listings look at their calendars let's say next month.

166
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:14,810
And here's a general rule of thumb in my market and we were a top 10 percent Airbnb hosts we would typically

167
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:21,440
book out about two months in advance and then a month before if you'll get the month forward generally

168
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,720
popular listings we'll book out farther in advance so that's why you want to look at the next month.

169
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,130
And then the next month thing just get a general idea of how quickly the bookings taper off.

170
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,570
I'm recording this in November.

171
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,670
If you look at the let's say a week they are and now how many of them are full this week.

172
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,490
How many of them are full next week how many of them are full the week after that.

173
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,270
Now look at the next month for all of them.

174
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,460
Is it spotty.

175
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:51,600
And what I mean spotty are the majority of the spots the dates taken and you just have kind of a hodgepodge

176
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,290
of like two days here three days here.

177
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,680
That generally means this is a good area and it could mean that it's a good host.

178
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,400
That's generally a good indication of the least demand.

179
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,870
And if it's a case that let's say next month that only the weekends are booked out or something like

180
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,460
that that might actually mean that the person turned off the weekends.

181
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:13,180
But if everybody's doing it that might mean that your spot typically gets more on weekends.

182
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,660
We're going to talk a little bit more about pricing strategies in the future lectures and we can go

183
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,140
over.

184
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,660
How do you adjust your prices for things like weekends or things like weekdays.

185
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:25,870
There's typically more demand for week ends so you can always raise your price on weekends.

186
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,840
Again here five to 10 you're looking at the calendars.

187
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,710
What does anything stick out to you.

188
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,560
Is it that they're all booked really far into advance.

189
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,310
You know these are some really hot properties in a hot area.

190
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,590
It could mean that it's an area that they turn off their listings a lot.

191
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,460
Generally all five to 10 are doing that.

192
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,950
That wouldn't mean that centricity of the hosts.

193
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,450
It means that there's a pattern going on.

194
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:56,170
Look at the holidays look at typically the most popular time to run a house or rented Airbnb is going

195
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:02,660
to be December 24 25 and 26 and then the secondary most popular I've seen as New Year's Eve New Year's

196
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:07,590
Eve in that little like three day period covering that those are really really popular times.

197
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,610
That's what a lot of people are vacationing.

198
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,990
Thanksgiving is also popular but a lot of people go home for that.

199
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,520
So they're not exactly renting.

200
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,600
Look at those.

201
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,160
That's generally a good indication if those are booked out.

202
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,950
That means that this is a good spot that typically people are doing something right and that means that

203
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,970
you're entering a space where there's plenty of money going around because if they're already booked

204
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:33,610
out and is make a judgment call if it's two months before Christmas and every single one of the top

205
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,930
listings or rent it out for Christmas that means that this is a good area.

206
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,140
And there's also excess demand.

207
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,990
Surely there's going to be booking for Christmas a month before or even two weeks before so surely someone

208
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,560
is looking for that and you might be able to capitalize on the price by doing that by being able to

209
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,990
raise it because you're the last place that's available now.

210
00:12:54,010 --> 00:13:00,130
The last metric I want you to use when you're taking a kind of a gander around your space is host quality

211
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,200
house quality.

212
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,620
I base this off of a couple of things.

213
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:11,680
One the actual review quality that's a big one to look at the host metrics and on every air B and B

214
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:18,120
listing you're going to see metric saying what's the response rate what is the host's average time for

215
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:18,970
response.

216
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,200
Those are typically things you want to look at look at their profile even sometimes you can get a kind

217
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,970
of idea if they put a lot of time into their profile is their profile picture grainy Graney someone

218
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:33,520
has a actually a quality professional photograph that typically means they are more invested in it.

219
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:39,670
But really those are the kind of the only two I consistently gauge and I'm looking at things like host

220
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,200
quality.

221
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:45,880
Now later we're going to talk about what you can do to capitalize on good host or bad host in your area.

222
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,630
But right now we're just trying to get an idea of what the host quality looks like around you.

223
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:56,860
Some cities you know a lot of college students are listening out to their host called these lower or

224
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:02,530
it's the case that it's newer and newer means people aren't putting their full effort forward putting

225
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,090
their full weight into this so the quality is going to be lower.

226
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:10,110
But the number one thing I want to look at when I'm determining HOUSECALL is look at the reviews the

227
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:14,410
length of review will typically mean a better host but it doesn't really it doesn't necessarily mean

228
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:19,000
anything you need to read them don't read years and years of them but read the last couple of months

229
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,160
and see what the general kind of ebb and flow is.

230
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,980
Typically I like to do some digging and actually go back six months and see what the negative reviews

231
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,330
were.

232
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,140
Long reviews don't necessarily mean positive but you have to read them to tell sometimes you can have

233
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:37,080
a raving negative review and they just go on and on about everything wrong with it.

234
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,550
Here's another thing to look at when a do you get that raving long the review does the host respond.

235
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,750
Hosts are able to post a public response to reviews.

236
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,310
It is always the case that you should do this especially if it's negative.

237
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,600
It's actually a good idea to post when you know positive ones just saying something like Thanks for

238
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,170
staying and then insert some personal detail about the person.

239
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,110
You'll be surprised how few of people capitalize on that.

240
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:06,140
Even more so you'd be surprised how many people don't even respond to negative reviews.

241
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,150
They're not responding to negative reviews they're not taking this very seriously.

242
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,080
They're not particularly professional about this.

243
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:17,350
That generally means that there is a space between good hosts and bad hosts and it might be the case

244
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,960
that this host is bad but if they're still getting bookings that's generally a good sign bad quality

245
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:30,160
steel getting bookings that means there's space it's ripe for a new entrant a new property the space

246
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,660
to be capitalized on.

247
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:37,630
If you look at reviews this is one thing I like to look for look for consistent themes in the review

248
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,160
there's something about their place that can't change.

249
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:44,980
And what you'll notice is even the positive reviews they'll mention something like that in our property

250
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:50,980
when we are doing it private review we inverted a large room into a bedroom and rented that space out

251
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,320
of that space since it was a living room.

252
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,580
It didn't have a door.

253
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:00,310
And so even in our positive reviews you know I was getting all these postings saying there's no door.

254
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,480
Everything else is fantastic.

255
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,870
Now when you're looking at other properties are going to look for things like that you're going to look

256
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,920
for these themes.

257
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:12,520
Use this as a general judge of quality but not take a quick gander at the hosting metrics look at general

258
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,740
those five to 10 properties in your space.

259
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,510
Are they all 100 percent response right.

260
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:19,260
That's typically what you want to see if anything's below 100 percent.

261
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,810
That means that the host screwed up.

262
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:25,040
This standard is 100 percent you should have 100 percent period.

263
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:29,020
Anyone who's taken this even remotely serious will have a 100 percent response rate because they know

264
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,770
that arean be judges you based on your sponsor.

265
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,050
The other thing is the response speed.

266
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,280
You don't necessarily have to be within an hour.

267
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,890
It's not going to be detrimental if you respond within two or three on average that if you have some

268
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:45,120
that says within a day you know that they're getting booking inquiries and they're just getting killed.

269
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,940
That means that people are booking and they're just or they're looking to book and they're just abandoning

270
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,520
the page because they don't respond within a couple of days.

271
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:55,260
Those original things you want to look at so to kind of bring this full circle.

272
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,260
You want to look at the popularity of your area.

273
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:03,410
Does it look like there is a lot of booking a lot of action going on.

274
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,910
It look like a lot of people are making a good site and come out of this area.

275
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,480
You want to look at the hosts.

276
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,580
Do you have a lot of low quality hosts in your area.

277
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:19,430
If that's the case its popularity is a little bit harder to determine because that host will shew away.

278
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:23,680
But you know potential money and potential booking inquiries.

279
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:29,710
Maybe it's the case that air space has really good professional or semiprofessional people who really

280
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,980
put a lot of effort into this.

281
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:37,570
And I think the other thing is the minute lists are you in an area that's going to put you at a disadvantage

282
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,740
in terms of amenities like I said are hot tubs and rooftop bars and you don't.

283
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,850
That's not something you can change a does anybody at parking and you don't have parking.

284
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,220
That's something that's worth looking at.

285
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:53,640
So look at all the three day Saints this is kind of a mental exercise it's just check out this space

286
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,970
see what it looks like.

287
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,440
You'll get ideas and you'll see what other people are doing.

288
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,800
You know I can do that with my space.

289
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:05,420
It'll give you a general idea what you're kind of entering and lay the foundation for how you're going

290
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:10,390
to be successful at listing your air B and B because now you know what you're competing against.

291
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,960
Now you know what bar you have to jump over if you want to be in that top five top three in the search

292
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,700
listings and you get the most bookings.

293
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:21,990
I know we covered a lot of content in this lecture and I'd love to elaborate more on it if you guys

294
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,110
want me to take any little nugget in here and do a deeper dive.

295
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,700
I'm more than willing to do that.

296
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,290
A lot of these subjects could warrant an entirely separate lecture.

297
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,130
But yeah any questions post them the group discussion.

298
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,450
Send me a private message.

299
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,450
More than willing to help out in the next lecture.

300
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:46,080
We're going to go a little bit deeper into this how do we do our pricing strategy our listing strategy

301
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,260
with regards to what other people are offering what's their pricing.

302
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,200
We call it the product position because you know I'm a business person I considered a product.

303
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,070
It's your apartment so it's apartment positioning.
