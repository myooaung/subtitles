00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:10.760
Welcome to the news section and this is the last section that I think that you'll need to cover so you

2
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.970
can go from.

3
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.740
How do you as being be too.

4
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:20.540
I haven't B and to finally I'm rocking this as being the thing and the last section we gave you a lot

5
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.960
of tips about how you can maximize the guest experience good guest experiences and get good reviews

6
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.190
you might even get lucking It featured on air B and B that's going to really make it move you a long

7
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.710
way if you use all the tips that I mentioned.

8
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.630
I guarantee you're going to have some great guest experiences unless something's wrong with your apartment.

9
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.260
Now this section we're talking a little bit about how you can just go up and beyond how you have a listing

10
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.500
now what are things that you can do that are really going to separate you from the pack.

11
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.580
How are you going to get to that number one listing.

12
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.090
How are you going to get to the point where you really can maximize the benefit of the service.

13
00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:03.050
The number one thing that I think you need to do is you need to improve and experiment and separate

14
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.730
out those two but the people who are really good at FBN be the ones who just look at them and everybody's

15
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.890
having a great time and they're making tons of money and booked out for the next six months.

16
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.180
Those are the people that constantly improve and they constantly experiment improve.

17
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.660
We talked previously about what happens when you get a bad review.

18
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.780
How do you maximize the guest experience as a whole.

19
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.440
Now the best way of improving your service is actually to let your guest identify what can be improved.

20
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.060
Now it's pretty easy over time through your conversations through your messages and often sometimes

21
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.950
your review is there are going to suggest things that could be better.

22
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.800
Things I did not like or things they really did like use that feedback it's absolutely crucial.

23
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.630
When I first started listing I had probably half the amenities that I ended with after a while so many

24
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.940
people kept saying things like you know I wish there was parking or parking so hard outside.

25
00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.650
I went and got a parking spot.

26
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.890
All of a sudden no one ever asked about that ever again because I loved it.

27
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.870
There was no problems of parking any more.

28
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.110
I didn't hear these headaches stories.

29
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.300
How many people did I have say that it's hard to find the bathroom at night.

30
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.680
So I put nightlights and I put a little desk by the table really kind of basic things if they say something

31
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.620
is uncomfortable maybe a mattress is uncomfortable maybe you want to swap it out again.

32
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.510
Your neighbors are allowed.

33
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.960
Have a conversation with your neighbors.

34
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.200
These are all things that you can steadily improve on and you don't even necessarily have to sit down

35
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.530
and think what is wrong with my apartment How can I prove it.

36
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.300
Your guest will tell you.

37
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:40.220
And if there are things that they really like keep doing it and try to improve on it so improve is relatively

38
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.640
easy.

39
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.100
I don't think that you have to be a master of being a you know the perfect concierge and the perfect

40
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.930
host and the perfect cleaner.

41
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.880
You'll find out very quickly what works and what doesn't work and constantly incorporate new things

42
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.210
into your space.

43
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.490
Put in new amenities put in new things to be excited about and then what you want to do is you want

44
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.000
to tweak your listing when this happens.

45
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.500
Go back to your listing add the new things you've added.

46
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.060
You know if there's an event coming up what you can do is maybe you can buy some book tickets for it

47
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.650
and give it to your guests for free.

48
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.350
Put that in the listing.

49
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.550
These are things that can really really work because a lot of times people come here listing.

50
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.440
They just see some copy pasted description that doesn't seem very fresh to them.

51
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.590
If you added something in there that's been updated a couple of weeks ago.

52
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.710
That's fantastic.

53
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.540
That's another rule that people and you'd have me will also say is that you want to put new things updates

54
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.130
you want to say that you keep adding things that's it makes people go oh people are actually paying

55
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.010
attention to this.

56
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.200
Number two is an experiment experimentation is crucial to this.

57
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.300
Now when I talked about what you want to set for your title when you set your description what photos

58
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.960
to use.

59
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.950
Those are not rules that are set in stone.

60
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.090
Those are just like a guideline that I've kind of identified that will help you at least have a positive

61
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.380
impression on your listing but you want to experiment and not only to experiment with de-listing but

62
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.340
experiment with the actual guest experience itself.

63
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.150
Try being extra friendly to your gas being extra reserved.

64
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.020
You know every time you check them in or maybe you don't check them and try something different.

65
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.040
See how it works.

66
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.300
This is how you identify things that are better and things that are worse and this is how you have a

67
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.030
compass for how well am I doing.

68
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.450
It doesn't require a lot of thought.

69
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.130
Also it just requires that every time you do spend that 10 15 minutes a day on your air B and B that

70
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.400
you try something else on your.

71
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.910
Try something different try taking in your title of your property and try dropping a word and swapping

72
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:33.750
with something else.

73
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.580
See how people respond to that.

74
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.440
Try different title names.

75
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.580
Tried putting in what your bedroom configuration is and then tried dropping that.

76
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.450
Maybe you have an event.

77
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.090
Put something up in your title mentioning the event.

78
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.540
See how that works.

79
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.080
If you're not sure if you are best for tourist or bus or business people try testing out both try making

80
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.380
a title that works for business people at one that works for tourists.

81
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.540
Same thing with your description.

82
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.750
Add new things and drop them out see what people respond to your messages too.

83
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.010
I would say you don't need to experiment with being rude.

84
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.940
It doesn't make sense but you can also try experimenting things like giving them your personal contact

85
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.620
information or giving them discounts no matter what.

86
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.840
I've seen that work pretty well just say so when messages are you asking you about it.

87
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.260
Give them a trivial discount give them a $50 discount if they book it today.

88
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:28.060
These are things that are going to get you into the top 10 percent of hosts and out of that clause II.

89
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.310
This is worth it.

90
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.020
But I'm not having a bonanza.

91
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.300
I'm not getting paid you know 10k a month to travel that little zone and you can kind of get stuck in

92
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.180
try other things out.

93
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.100
The more effort you put into this the more it's going to show.

94
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.180
Guests can see that.
