1
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:12,270
So I got a question from one of the students which was how do I take everything that you've taught in

2
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:18,360
this course and make it so my Arab can be kind of runs itself and I can leave the country or go off

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,270
the grid.

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:26,480
I wanted to explain this and specifically make a lecture for this since it was a question that was asked.

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:33,330
But also I kind of realized now that if you take the entire course you might not realize what parts

6
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:38,670
of these need to be stuck together in order to be able to leave the country and kind of run it like

7
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,500
I have.

8
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:45,450
So I've done this as traveling through multiple countries one of them actually I traveled through Cuba

9
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,050
which has virtually no internet access.

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,350
Whenever you do use the Internet you have to wait in line to use it and then it's ridiculously expensive.

11
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,010
And I was in Cuba for a month so it is very very doable.

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,420
Is what I'm trying to say.

13
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,930
What you have to do though is you need to focus on number one.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,380
You need to identify all of the moving parts in your apartment.

15
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,320
So typically I would never suggest that someone try to do this right off the bat.

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:21,330
I would suggest you do this after you've had a couple for apartment rentals or at least a couple spare

17
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:27,330
room rentals because when you do that you're going to realize what are the things that can go wrong

18
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,850
and what exactly changes from one listing to another.

19
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,930
We can use my apartment as an example in my apartment.

20
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,810
What are the moving parts.

21
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,630
One of the keys.

22
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,940
So in order to get a guest and they need to have keys to get in and out.

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,250
And then they need to get those keys to the next guests.

24
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,290
So that's something that needs to switch over to.

25
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:56,570
I have a key card to get into the garage for the parking space that I offer to my guests so that key

26
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:01,420
card also needs to find its way somewhere where the next guests can find it.

27
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:10,020
3 I have a cleaner and they need to be able to get in before the next guests coming in and they need

28
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,980
to clean it pretty extensively so that it's ready for the next guest.

29
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,460
They also need to do laundry too.

30
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,510
So that's also kind of a something that I have to consider.

31
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:29,240
So when my cleaner comes after the previous guests they need to have a certain amount of time so they

32
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,550
can do laundry each time.

33
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,620
And so I need to know roughly that there should probably be say a three hour break in between last gasp.

34
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,110
Next guest orientation is another big one.

35
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,580
The next guests need to know how to get in how to get out.

36
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,450
They need to know how to use everything in the apartment and they need to know generally any kind of

37
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,160
rules about the apartment.

38
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,540
You know for things.

39
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:00,790
Those are the moving parts in my apartment in your place they're probably going to be very very similar.

40
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,990
You might have one extra thing.

41
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,400
But really it's just the keys.

42
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,200
For me it's the parking spot.

43
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,690
It's getting all the information to the gas so they can acquaint themselves and then it's getting a

44
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,440
cleaner in and out with a sufficient amount of time to clean everything and do laundry.

45
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:25,760
Just take a moment and think to yourself what would you roughly need to swap over.

46
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,750
There might be something extra kind of doubt.

47
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,840
It's usually just kind of the basics OK.

48
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:39,560
So the way that you would automate this now such that you can be out of the country away from cell signals

49
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,490
away from checking your email constantly is number one.

50
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,310
You need to have a rapport with your cleaner.

51
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:53,210
And so I previously had talked about the importance of picking a cleaner that's for the long term because

52
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:58,430
someone who's there for the long term is going to you know not only know where everything should be

53
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,130
in the apartment.

54
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,560
They're also going to know what's potentially missing.

55
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,890
They're going to need to know what's potentially broken.

56
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:09,230
And they're also going to need to know roughly what the standard of cleanliness is that you expect for

57
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,310
each guest.

58
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:16,550
Now if you keep bringing in new cleaners every single time you have to hire them them and then have

59
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,530
them clean and then see whether or not they did a good job.

60
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:26,750
So I would not suggest leaving the country and running this fully on autopilot until you have a rapport

61
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,520
with the cleaner.

62
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,620
If you guys have someone who lives in town and they or somebody who needs extra money and they can clean

63
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,110
your apartment you know they're diligent you know that they're responsible.

64
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,100
It's very easy then because you can just trust that person to know to come clean what you do is you

65
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,120
just send them your cleaning schedule beforehand.

66
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,420
And that's very easy because you're arean busy schedules right there you can even just screenshot your

67
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:57,130
schedule send it to them and they'll just know they need to clean on the 11th the 15th the 18th and

68
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,200
the 22nd you'll just kind of have a routine going down.

69
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,110
So that's number one.

70
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:09,530
Number two is you need to find a way of automating the key swap the way that I did this was I actually

71
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,190
just put the key and the map and it's not.

72
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,850
I mean that's not a particularly great way of doing it because things can actually go wrong.

73
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,780
But under the mat someone can step on the mat not realize it kick it out.

74
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,860
I've had several guests pick up the man that can't find it because it stuck to the mat.

75
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,500
It's not a good way of doing it.

76
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,370
So I would suggest doing one of many different things.

77
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,590
One you could have your cleaner have sets of keys.

78
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:39,580
And so what can happen is when your guests leave your cleaner can come use their key to get in and out

79
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,490
but then leave an extra key and collect the original key.

80
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,600
That's one way of doing it too.

81
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,160
You can use a lock box a lock box is really really simple.

82
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,270
Just stick it somewhere near your apartment and just give the code to your guests.

83
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,230
Obviously some apartments are not going to allow you to do that so this might not be an option so try

84
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,160
any other ones.

85
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,310
Another one you can do is there are a lot of these like fancy locks now where you can like wave the

86
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,360
phone at it use Bluetooth to connect and get in.

87
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,030
I did.

88
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:17,430
I mean at a lecture later on a Kickstarter that has made a very very interesting lock system called

89
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,650
the lock a Tron.

90
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:25,040
But right now if you go on Amazon and you look for wireless locks this is a kind of a little intense

91
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,860
in terms of how much an investment they are.

92
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,220
They're expensive but they are also very very useful.

93
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,320
They're locks that you install on your door and then people can get in through a variety of different

94
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,700
techniques.

95
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,700
They can just the door can be unlocked at certain times.

96
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,060
They can use their phone and they can use text messages et cetera.

97
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:50,030
Another way you can do this and this is popular in big urban cities is if you live near a corner store

98
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,870
or live near a coffee shop you can actually have them hold on to your keys.

99
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,220
In San Francisco there's a service that actually sets you up with coffee shops where they hold your

100
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,120
keys.

101
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,920
And that's actually I think that's pretty cool billing problem is what happens if your guests arrive

102
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,410
super late so they don't really I don't think they think about that a lot of times.

103
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,560
But the point is you need to figure out a way that's foolproof to get the keys to your guests each time.

104
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,310
And it's really not that complicated.

105
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:21,800
Lockboxes work really well if you have one cleaner You can also just have them hold on to your key.

106
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,330
I use a service called Handey be called handy book and they just have a key.

107
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:30,870
So worst case scenario they just put their extra key for the next guest.

108
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:37,640
So number three what you need to do is you really need to go back and read the section on copy pasta

109
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,140
trick.

110
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,740
And the reason why is because this saves you so much time.

111
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,810
You don't want to have to be able to check your e-mail write them a personalized e-mail every single

112
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,510
time they check in and check out.

113
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:53,570
And now I would suggest taking this one step farther.

114
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,670
Listen to the lecture on using the V.A. trick.

115
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,850
That's one way you can fully automate this if you don't even want to check your e-mail period.

116
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:09,140
Use a virtual assistant to automate a lot of the messaging kind of process what you do is you would

117
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,550
hire a virtual assistant.

118
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,280
You'd pay them you know a dollar or $2 or whatever and every time they send a message and you'd allow

119
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:22,220
them to log on to your airbourne B and you would give them the template emails and so they have to do

120
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,290
is pop in the person's name and they just pop in the message and send it to them and you could tell

121
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:31,640
them for instance you know 48 hours before the guest arrives.

122
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,980
I want you to send them this long block of text that welcomes the Apart welcomes them to the apartment

123
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,020
tells them how to check in tells them how to do everything in the apartment how they can manage the

124
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,200
heat what they can use in the refrigerator etc. etc..

125
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:51,800
And then what you can do is you can also tell them to post and I called the outro message which is the

126
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,910
day before they leave.

127
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,490
Send them a message saying you know thanks for staying.

128
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:01,600
I really hope you enjoyed your stay this say you know can you please leave the key under the mat when

129
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,700
you leave or can you put the parking pass on the table.

130
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,540
This way you can manage the way that they exit.

131
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,220
Now you don't have to do this with the V.A. if you are going to be a fraud or just out of town and you

132
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,100
know you're going to be free like infrequently checking your e-mail.

133
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:23,200
Let's say you're checking it once a day you can still do this so you yourself would just copy and paste

134
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,790
a template.

135
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,770
Introducing them to the space within some given time range.

136
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:34,690
And then you can send the exiting copy and paste any time during their stay just so they know roughly

137
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,840
what's the protocol for checking out.

138
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,650
OK so the fourth thing that you need to do and this one is really really mandatory so I have to stress

139
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:48,450
this is you need to start enforcing check in and check out times.

140
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,500
Originally when I started my listing I had flexible check and a checkout.

141
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:59,580
Now if you listen to my sections on you know minimum days on pricing strategies you can kind of get

142
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,260
the idea that at first you need to be as flexible as possible because you don't want to try to capture

143
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,040
as many bookings as possible.

144
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:12,450
But when you go abroad and you want to leave this on auto pilot I'm assuming that you have at least

145
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:18,270
four or five reviews and so you can you can do this you already have a steady stream of inquiries coming

146
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:24,840
in you're going to do is you're going to set your check in check out times and you're going to pick

147
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:32,130
something that gives you enough time to have a cleaner come in clean the space and turn it over to the

148
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,410
next guest.

149
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,130
So to give you an example I use 11 and 3.

150
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:46,710
So what I say is every guest needs to check out at 11 a.m. every guest cannot check in till after 3:00

151
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:52,800
p.m. That gives me a roughly four hours in-between so that the cleaner can come in and clean the cleaner.

152
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,440
Typically will take three hours with the extra hour gives me a little bit of a break.

153
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:03,700
Now those two numbers you can modify those you can set it to whatever you need maybe have a small space.

154
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,200
You can have them check out later and then check in earlier.

155
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,070
Doesn't really matter.

156
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,690
Just don't get excessive about it.

157
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,640
Right.

158
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,970
A lot of people are coming to your city and they want to drop off their stuff or they want to check

159
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:20,100
in because they've been traveling for a long time so don't get excessive with their check in times or

160
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,000
their check out times.

161
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:29,720
The reason that you want to set up rigid guidelines for this is because one of the biggest headaches

162
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:36,880
of managing an entire property listing is getting people out and getting the next people in.

163
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:44,140
Originally when I was doing this flexible flexible times I would have people check out super late.

164
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,330
And I even have sometimes guests checking in all the previous guests were checking out.

165
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,930
So you don't want to have to deal with that.

166
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,100
It's just an unnecessary level of management.

167
00:11:54,950 --> 00:12:00,770
Again assuming you're traveling abroad you're probably got you're listening to a point where it's on

168
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:07,700
a decent footing so you should be fine it's going to deter anyone if you set checkout times.

169
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,340
And I think actually that's more of the norm.

170
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:15,260
I think if you look on air being be the vast majority of them have at least a check in or check out

171
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:21,080
time for main things that you need to do to get this onto into autopilot.

172
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,920
There are two other things that you can do that I think are more or less optional.

173
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:32,180
But I would strongly suggest doing them one thing is adding a guidebook and there's an upcoming lecture

174
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:39,020
about the guidebook and how helpful it can be towards helping people kind of integrate themselves into

175
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,490
your space.

176
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:49,220
The essence of what it is is that you make a little book or just laminated piece of paper or really

177
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:54,260
anything that you can put in your apartment so that when guests arrive they have just as little book

178
00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:00,870
of information about pretty much what they should do in any type of scenario should it come up.

179
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:08,150
Now if you have that that reduces the management by honestly 60 percent so many times that I've had

180
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:13,910
questions from guests or guests call me or guest have to you know use my attention for something it's

181
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,320
because of something in the apartment that they don't know how to use.

182
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,960
And they weren't properly explained.

183
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:26,390
Now this guidebook goes a little bit farther than your just the copy paste message are you going to

184
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,310
send to them every time they check in.

185
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,760
Because you don't want that to go on for pages and pages and pages.

186
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,630
The guidebook is where you can really put as much detail as you want.

187
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:40,670
Everything about this space everything about the area popular restaurants things to do how to buy tickets

188
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:47,570
for events etc. etc. If you have that they'll use the guide book and they'll kind of self-service themselves.

189
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,020
Thing again this is completely optional.

190
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:57,360
But I would strongly suggest having it is just having a fallback person have someone in your town or

191
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,860
your city that you know that can help you in a pinch because even if you automate every single thing

192
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,350
occasionally.

193
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:11,520
You know one in a hundred something might happen that you could need someone in in law who's actually

194
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,640
local and in the city to help with.

195
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:20,690
So things like lockouts you know even if you do have a system where you give them the keys and they

196
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:25,800
hold on the keys you can't really help it if the guests leave the apartment and accidentally lock themselves

197
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,790
out.

198
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,230
Another thing might be noise complaints if you have neighbors or someone else in your apartment you

199
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,420
could get a complaint so you need to have like a point of contact.

200
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:41,250
There's a lot of different things that could happen and it's helpful to have someone there who can in

201
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:47,700
a pinch get something for a guest deliver keys or help make connections that you can't make because

202
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,650
you're not on the ground.

203
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,670
Again that's completely optional.

204
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,220
I strongly suggest doing it.
