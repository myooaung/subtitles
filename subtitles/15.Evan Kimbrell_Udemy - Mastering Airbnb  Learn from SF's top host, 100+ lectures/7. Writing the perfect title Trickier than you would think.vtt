00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.160
Let's talk a little bit about how you choose a title for your listing when you're making your title

2
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.920
don't really stress over it too much.

3
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.110
It's not something that in my experience I've noticed is crucial to a positive listing if you go on

4
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.920
air B and B and you look at some of the listings on there and you'll notice that there's a pretty wide

5
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.730
range of styles lengths descriptions that people are using in their titles.

6
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:38.340
And you also notice that across the spectrum it seems as though popular listings can use any variety

7
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.580
of strategies when making their title.

8
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.880
I'm going to give you some tips that have at least worked for me and worked in the host that I've seen

9
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.350
first off.

10
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.080
Think of the top two to three main selling points for your listing and I say 2:58 simply because there

11
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.240
is a limit to how many words you can use in the title.

12
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.120
You might not be able to fit all three.

13
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.730
If it's the case that one of the words is longer or you want to put in say your area title that's longer

14
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:14.520
to write out your top two to three try to fit at least two of those in your listing whether it's your

15
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.650
location like your area is one of the top three parts of your listing or maybe it's really spacious.

16
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.520
Maybe it's the case that it's close to everything.

17
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.680
Maybe it's a case that's close to mass transportation.

18
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.190
Maybe it's the case that it's a good value purchase kind of identify what your angle is what you think

19
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.210
the main reasons people are going to be staying at your place are when you actually go and push relisting

20
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.250
live you're going to get some real time feedback and what you'll notice is that you say you launched

21
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.090
the title and you're going to focus on certain aspects of your listings so you think that having laundry

22
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.900
in the buildings big C put at the end of your listing with laundry.

23
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.930
Very quickly I'll find out whether or not people actually respond to that.

24
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.270
And if you notice over the course of a month or so that no one's mentioning laundry or they're not mentioning

25
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.590
in the reviews they're not saying anything to you verbally that this is a big deal.

26
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.490
Then I think you should consider taking it out.

27
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.750
The flip side of that is you will hear what people care about and the amenities that you have that resonate

28
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.660
with the people booking your place.

29
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.280
Those are going to be kind of brought to the forefront.

30
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.880
You will notice these things over time.

31
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.450
On my listing it's Fisherman's Wharf three bedroom two bath parking.

32
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.820
So I said Fisherman's Wharf because that's a big tourist thing.

33
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.230
And so people who are tourists are coming are going to recognize that.

34
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.890
And again it's like I'm pre-qualifying my space for people who want to come see this area.

35
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.750
The other one was parking because in my experience that was something that was very rarely offered in

36
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.690
other apartments and it was something that a lot of people were specifically looking for they might

37
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.490
be looking at two comparable properties.

38
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.590
And if one of them has parking and the other one doesn't.

39
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.040
They're probably going to go with the owners parking especially if they're coming with a car or the

40
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.480
case they're coming with two cars because garage fees can add up if you're going to have to pay for

41
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.450
an overnight garage or are you going have to deal with the car every single day.

42
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.290
That actually kind of takes away from the fun of the vacation.

43
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.880
I decided to put the bedroom configuration in my space and this is something I suggest doing but it's

44
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.340
not necessarily perfect for everybody.

45
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.000
Personally when I'm looking on air B and B I'm looking for a space.

46
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.990
I get kind of annoyed with the fact that a lot of people just don't list how big the space is and so

47
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.880
I have to go in and look at it and look in the details to see if it's a two bedroom a one bedroom or

48
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.640
you know a 1.5 or something where they've converted a space.

49
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.750
What causes this problem is that you know when you search she'll say I have three agast.

50
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.410
And so it's going to find all the people that say they can fit three guests and well a three bedroom

51
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.030
can fit three gas a two bedroom can fit three guest and a lot of people list their one bedroom is being

52
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.390
fit three guests because they're assuming that you know one person's going to stay in the living room

53
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.980
and they might have a spare couch.

54
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.170
In my experience listening out the actual space is a good thing.

55
00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.930
Three bedrooms are rarer.

56
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.010
So that's why I wanted to list out three bedroom because I was kind of going for people who wanted to

57
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.090
be in groups.

58
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.260
Also when I wrote the title my listing price was low.

59
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.070
And so I kind of wanted to create that disconnect where they see three bedroom two bath but it's actually

60
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.010
quite cheap it's priced at something you'd see more of like a two bedroom two bath.

61
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.490
So that's kind of the angle that I went with and I originally had started off with a title that highlighted

62
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.550
location with regards to the ocean.

63
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.300
So I said spacious apartment near the ocean.

64
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.960
In my experience those two things that I was testing for size and near the ocean kind of ended up being

65
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.170
just not ideal.

66
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.570
And what I found to be better was I can say a fisherman's wharf because that grabs the tourists kind

67
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.270
of attention but also do you know anything about Fisherman's Wharf.

68
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.630
You know it's by the ocean so I don't need to say by the ocean I can be more specific.

69
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:57.380
And then similarly spacious Well I can just say three bedroom two bath and that kind of conveys spaciousness

70
00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.790
at least it's large.

71
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.900
And then in the photographs they can see the spaciousness.

72
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.670
I personally would say that stay away from listings that are too short and not specific enough in the

73
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.730
case of Sarah's apartment.

74
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.880
She used designers home close to everything.

75
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.780
This might be the exception because she used a very short description but she got her two big points

76
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.260
away.

77
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.270
One it's a designer's home so you know that it's it's very well-kept It's very pretty and there's a

78
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.930
lot of thought that goes into the interior you know the quality is high and another thing is close to

79
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:28.620
everything.

80
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.980
Well a lot of people are coming to Dublin and they don't know what is close to everything.

81
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.740
If it says close to everything that fixes that anxiety for them in general I would say that you want

82
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:46.700
to focus on conveying either quality or location and in some cases you can list specific things about

83
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.550
it.

84
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.860
Let's say that you want to focus on the quality of your apartment so for quality you're going to focus

85
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.740
on listing off the adjectives of your space that would convey quality she said designers space that

86
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.120
conveys quality.

87
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.900
I went for location so I said Fisherman's Wharf.

88
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.390
If I had to go quality then I would say something like spaciousness or I would say brand new or something

89
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.610
like that because we have brand new fixtures.

90
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.680
That was the weaker case for my apartment in the sense that it's harder for me to say that my apartment

91
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.380
is super high quality because it's not necessarily high quality compared to some of the designer apartments

92
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.230
around us.

93
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:27.830
There are other places that have much nicer fixtures and much nicer decorations so I decided against

94
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.790
that and focus more on location and then size.

95
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.600
So that would be how you kind of focus on quality maybe you want to say that it's cozy.

96
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.860
Or maybe you want to say that it's well-appointed or something of that sort.

97
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.050
And if you want to focus on location then you'd focus more on the things like close to mass transit

98
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.710
in the heart of the city is a very popular description.

99
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.570
I would suggest just going on Aramean me and getting a decent idea of what other people list and you

100
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.590
can kind of see what you think works.

101
00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.790
You know you think might not work in my experience it doesn't particularly matter.

102
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.420
But I want to stress the fact that you should be testing this always.

103
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.270
You know every month or so try fiddling with it and see if it makes a difference.

104
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.720
See if he finally come to something that you're comfortable with.

105
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:17.460
You can test out different ideas very quickly and you can also test out different features of your apartment

106
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.590
if you do go and look on Airbnb and get some ideas for things that you have in your apartment that you

107
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.330
can test out of a hot tub.

108
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.070
Try listening out there you have a hot tub.

109
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.410
If you have views try listening out that you have views views or something that gets quite popular an

110
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.540
Air B and B a lot of people will pay extra.

111
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.620
You have a good view from the apartment.

112
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.660
If you're right next to some mass transit and you really are very close to it that's something you can

113
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.730
try testing out see if that's something that's important to people.

114
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:50.190
I think that after your first month or two you'll start identifying why people are renting your space.

115
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.980
You can kind of figure out if it's the case that people are using it for specific use.

116
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.160
When I say specific use I mean maybe like people are using it for business conventions a close to convention

117
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.730
you have a very convenient space or are they using it for tourism.

118
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:09.160
Are they using it for some kind of events or maybe meetings or its proximity to something.

119
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:14.620
What can you think of what's the pattern kind of here and then you can kind of do is try to hone in

120
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.210
kind of on that group and I think that will help you considerably.

121
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.280
You guys have any questions post them in the group discussion and I'll try to get to them.

122
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.690
I want to kind of stress that when you make your title this is more art than science at least in my

123
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:35.090
experience because good hosts and good properties can make up for bad titles.

124
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:39.200
And it's very hard to discern you know how many of the people coming into your property are because

125
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.740
of a good title when you're coming in because the rest of the listing is really good.

126
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:49.550
And in my experience I've seen people who had multiple properties with nonsensical names that I would

127
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:55.370
never expect to be popular yet they run their properties very well so I don't believe that the title

128
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:59.060
has a huge bit to do with how many people come here listing.

129
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.630
If you go and search their BND you'll notice that what's the first thing you notice when you search

130
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.130
it's the photograph.

131
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:08.720
The photograph is 90 percent of what you notice and then you might read the listing and then you might

132
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:14.330
read the whole subtext under it so you know you want to test out different titles you want to gauge

133
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.100
it that way.

134
00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.410
And eventually I'll come to one that you're kind of happy with.
