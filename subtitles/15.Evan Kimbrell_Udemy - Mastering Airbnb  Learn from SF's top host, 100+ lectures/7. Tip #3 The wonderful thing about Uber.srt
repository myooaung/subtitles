00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:13,930
Tip Number nine I call this one uber I'm So I mean by this this is something that only applies if you

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:14,890
live in a big city.

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,110
Sorry if you're in a little city you should probably just tune out.

4
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:25,700
This applies if you've ever heard of these ride sharing services like lift an Uber and sidecar San Francisco.

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:31,620
Everybody uses them if you're in Chicago or New York or Boston or Atlanta or you know Miami then you

6
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:39,130
all have it smaller mid-size cities sometimes have typically it's going to be in cities that are at

7
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,180
least half a million while you can do.

8
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:48,310
And I love telling this one because I use the services you have to share code in your uber account and

9
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,450
your left account.

10
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:55,530
Typically the way that these work is they say you give 20 bucks to someone else and you get 20 bucks.

11
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,530
And that's how you get new people on the system.

12
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:03,980
Well what I used to do is I always message people and say Here are the options for getting to our apartment.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,310
And then in my listing I made it the obvious choice that they take Oubre.

14
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:15,840
So I would say as one you can take the mass transit it costs this much and it takes this long to.

15
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:20,440
You can rent a taxi and it cost this much amount of money which is an insane amount of money.

16
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:26,830
Or you can take an Uber and then take the price and deduct the $20 from it and I go you can do it this

17
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:31,780
way 80 percent of the time that people would just say whoa let me use that one instead because it makes

18
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,910
sense right.

19
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,660
From San Francisco International Airport to my apartment taxis and it costs you about 75 bucks an Uber

20
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,870
is going to cost you 40 bucks.

21
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:46,370
Mass transit is cheap but it takes longer if you multiply like four people.

22
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,600
Do you actually end up spending 25 30 bucks anyway.

23
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,460
So it actually ends up being more expensive than nuber.

24
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,240
And then with the coupon.

25
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,750
Depends if they're doing $10 or $20 or whatever it would end up being 20 bucks right.

26
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,520
And it makes so much sense and then I get 20 bucks so every time I have a guest coming in they use this

27
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,590
I get this like four or five times a month.

28
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:10,370
So I get like an extra $100 and tribal credit so it was actually kind of a win win.

29
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,820
It makes sense right because you want to get them there cheaply.

30
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,410
They feel great because you got them there cheaply you found a loophole for getting them there.

31
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,430
And then if they didn't actually use that or didn't do that what I would end up doing is I'd typically

32
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,970
just write my share code on the wall because previously we talked to the white board.

33
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,490
I would write down the wall and say You guys need to go anywhere there's this new crazy service it's

34
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,910
very San Francisco.

35
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,550
Insert this into your smartphone and you get to take a free trip so maybe you'll even get an uber you'd

36
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,280
really get two free trips in San Francisco which is awesome.

37
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,990
So a lot of people take you up on that and then it just kind of feeds back to you.

38
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,990
But it's one of those ones it's like you benefit they benefit it's just a win when.
