00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.770
You can use geo restriction, also known as geo blocking,

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.930
to prevent users in specific geographic locations from accessing content

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.310
that you're distributing through a CloudFront distribution.

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.620
To use geo restriction,

5
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.410
you have two options. Use the CloudFront geo restriction feature. Use this

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.190
option to restrict access to all of the files that are associated with the

7
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.560
distribution and to restrict access at the country level.

8
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.190
Or use a third‑party geolocation service.

9
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.110
Use this option to restrict access to a subset of the files that

10
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.860
are associated with the distribution or to restrict access at a

11
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.270
finer granularity than the country level.

12
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.520
When a user requests your content,

13
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.350
CloudFront typically serves the requested content

14
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.450
regardless of where the user is located.

15
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.350
If you need to prevent users in specific countries from accessing your content,

16
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.200
you can use the CloudFront geo restriction feature to do one of the following.

17
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.990
Allow your users to access your content only if they're in one of the

18
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.690
countries on a whitelist of approved countries,

19
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.980
Maybe you would like only viewers from the US to be able to view your content.

20
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.190
Then you could whitelist the United States only, which would prevent viewers

21
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.880
accessing your content if requesting from outside of the country or prevent

22
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.260
your users from accessing your content if they're in one of the countries on

23
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.050
a blacklist of banned countries.

24
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.310
For example,

25
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.320
if a request comes in from a country where for GDPR reasons

26
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.800
you're not able to comply with local laws,

27
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.560
you could use CloudFront geo restriction to block the request.

28
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.750
Here's how geo restrictions work.

29
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.490
Suppose you have a website which generally caters to viewers from the

30
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.180
US, but is accessible by visitors around the world. With GDPR, you

31
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.920
either have to rush to provide a privacy and consent model for the

32
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.650
tracking mechanisms that you already enabled on your site immediately to

33
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.835
become compliant for visitors from the EEA, or take your time and enable

34
00:02:04.835 --> 00:02:05.945
everything correctly,

35
00:02:05.945 --> 00:02:09.235
but in the meantime block the countries which fall under

36
00:02:09.235 --> 00:02:12.105
GDPR regulations to avoid a violation.

37
00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:14.105
So let's go with the latter.

38
00:02:14.105 --> 00:02:18.105
Let's geo restrict countries which are a part of the EEA.

39
00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:22.215
So a user in Denmark requests your content.

40
00:02:22.215 --> 00:02:27.215
DNS routes the request to the CloudFront edge location in Copenhagen, Denmark.

41
00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:32.835
The edge location in Copenhagen looks up your distribution and determines

42
00:02:32.835 --> 00:02:36.145
that a user in Denmark is not allowed to view your content.

43
00:02:36.145 --> 00:02:42.305
CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 Forbidden to the user.

44
00:02:42.305 --> 00:02:46.445
Yet everyone else who was in a country which is not a member of

45
00:02:46.445 --> 00:02:49.335
the EEA will be able to view your content.

46
00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:53.785
You can optionally configure CloudFront to return a

47
00:02:53.785 --> 00:02:55.705
custom error message to the user,

48
00:02:55.705 --> 00:03:00.205
and you can specify how long you want CloudFront to cache the error response.

49
00:03:00.205 --> 00:03:04.025
Remember, the default value is 5 minutes.

50
00:03:04.025 --> 00:03:08.615
Geo restrictions apply to the entire web distribution.

51
00:03:08.615 --> 00:03:14.035
If you need to apply one restriction to part of your content and a different

52
00:03:14.035 --> 00:03:18.005
restriction or no restriction to another part of your content,

53
00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:21.985
you must either create separate CloudFront distributions or

54
00:03:21.985 --> 00:03:24.305
use a third‑party geo location service.

55
00:03:24.305 --> 00:03:29.095
Let's enable this GDPR CloudFront geo restriction on our

56
00:03:29.095 --> 00:03:32.705
distribution by following these steps. From within the CloudFront

57
00:03:32.705 --> 00:03:35.885
console, open the distribution that you want to apply geo

58
00:03:35.885 --> 00:03:39.605
restriction to. Choose the Restrictions tab.

59
00:03:39.605 --> 00:03:47.975
Choose Edit. For Enable Geo‑Restriction, choose Yes. For Restriction

60
00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:51.705
Type, we're going to choose Blacklist to block access to certain

61
00:03:51.705 --> 00:03:57.585
countries. For Countries, select the EEA countries that we want a

62
00:03:57.585 --> 00:04:02.615
blacklist, then choose Add. Once we're done,

63
00:04:02.615 --> 00:04:09.143
choose Yes, Edit. If you remember from the last video, CloudFront errors can be

64
00:04:09.143 --> 00:04:14.353
kind of ugly, so we will be setting a custom error message for when a user from

65
00:04:14.353 --> 00:04:16.773
a blacklisted country tries to access content.

66
00:04:16.773 --> 00:04:21.713
Now that our CloudFront distribution is deployed, from

67
00:04:21.713 --> 00:04:24.573
the US, we can access this content.

68
00:04:24.573 --> 00:04:27.703
But as you can see, in Denmark,

69
00:04:27.703 --> 00:04:34.953
a 403 is returned. Adding a custom error response to 403, we now have a friendly

70
00:04:34.953 --> 00:04:39.753
message saying that due to GDPR, we're unable to display our content of viewers

71
00:04:39.753 --> 00:05:16.000
within the EEA. Perfect. We have successfully restricted access to our content based on CloudFront geo restrictions.
