00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:03.292
So let's bring everything together.

2
00:00:03.292 --> 00:00:04.829
If you remember in earlier videos,

3
00:00:04.829 --> 00:00:09.238
we discussed the benefits of adding CloudFront in front of our content.

4
00:00:09.238 --> 00:00:13.777
Those benefits were speeding up the delivery of our content,

5
00:00:13.777 --> 00:00:16.584
reduce hosting and bandwidth costs,

6
00:00:16.584 --> 00:00:20.451
improve availability and add redundancy to our content,

7
00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:24.002
as well as securing our content.

8
00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:25.803
We have discussed the benefits of a CDN,

9
00:00:25.803 --> 00:00:26.567
in general,

10
00:00:26.567 --> 00:00:30.893
and then we mapped how Amazon CloudFront can meet and/or exceed

11
00:00:30.893 --> 00:00:35.209
some of those general benefits of a typical CDN.

12
00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:38.079
We have built a distribution network,

13
00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.105
performed exercises which showed us how to measure the performance

14
00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:44.698
of existing web content and how to compare our new content

15
00:00:44.698 --> 00:00:47.680
delivery network against those benchmarks.

16
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.743
This showed us how much we can speed up the delivery of our web content.

17
00:00:52.743 --> 00:00:54.978
We've iterated over this distribution network,

18
00:00:54.978 --> 00:00:58.160
thus improving and enhancing delivery, maintenance,

19
00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.618
and operations.

20
00:00:59.618 --> 00:01:03.100
This has allowed us to reduce our bandwidth costs and it

21
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.746
improved the resiliency of our content.

22
00:01:05.746 --> 00:01:10.387
The nature of how a CDN works has added the redundancy.

23
00:01:10.387 --> 00:01:12.556
Through CloudFront, we've been able to add certificates,

24
00:01:12.556 --> 00:01:16.641
update cipher sets, restrict access to only approved methods,

25
00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:19.293
and even set proper headers on our content,

26
00:01:19.293 --> 00:01:23.361
which has helped us secure our content even further.

27
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:25.560
I hope these lessons have helped you in getting started with

28
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.201
improving your hosted content and that you can achieve even more

29
00:01:29.201 --> 00:01:32.573
benefits from implementing CloudFront yourself.

30
00:01:32.573 --> 00:01:34.279
I want to thank you for participating in my course,

31
00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:37.563
and I would love your feedback to know if and/or how I

32
00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:40.363
helped or where I can improve the course.

33
00:01:40.363 --> 00:01:44.362
If this course has provided any benefit to your own web delivery,

34
00:01:44.362 --> 00:01:46.464
I'd love to hear about it.

35
00:01:46.464 --> 00:01:50.581
Please send me a tweet @adyrcz letting me know what

36
00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:52.769
you've deployed using CloudFront.

37
00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:57.220
As always, you can find more information at my website,

38
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.870

39
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:10.000
Thank you again for watching Delivering Content on AWS with Amazon CloudFront here, at Pluralsight.
