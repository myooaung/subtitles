00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,724
In order to understand the benefits of using AWS CloudFront,

2
00:00:02,724 --> 00:00:06,435
let's step back and touch on a few basic concepts like the role

3
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:10,845
of a web server and what a CDN actually does.

4
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:11,932
When serving web content,

5
00:00:11,932 --> 00:00:17,894
there needs to be a source or an origin where your content actually resides.

6
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:20,772
This could be a physical or virtual server running a web

7
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:22,970
server application like Apache or NGINX.

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,259
Static content can also reside in cloud objects

9
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:31,316
stored solutions like Amazon's S3, Azure's blobs,

10
00:00:31,316 --> 00:00:35,460
or digital ocean spaces just to name a few.

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,826
These origins contain the content you are serving,

12
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:41,398
as well as they are able to provide an endpoint which can

13
00:00:41,398 --> 00:00:45,084
receive and respond to a browser's request.

14
00:00:45,084 --> 00:00:47,643
We won't go into too much detail of how web server's

15
00:00:47,643 --> 00:00:49,698
work other than what we've just stated.

16
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:52,217
Pluralsight has other courses on how web server technologies

17
00:00:52,217 --> 00:00:56,730
work which you can view to learn more.

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,412
Okay, so we now have a general understanding of the role of the origin server.

19
00:01:02,412 --> 00:01:03,118
This is great,

20
00:01:03,118 --> 00:01:07,608
but what happens when more than just a few people want to view your content?

21
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:09,027
Add more servers?

22
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:13,310
Sure, but that only resolves the local bottlenecks.

23
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,591
What happens when requests come from all around the globe?

24
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:20,702
No matter how much capacity you add to your cluster,

25
00:01:20,702 --> 00:01:23,600
the request times from around the world will be

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,584
dependent on the distance travelled.

27
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:26,801
Well,

28
00:01:26,801 --> 00:01:33,846
let's say you're making a request from LA to a server that is located in Berlin.

29
00:01:33,846 --> 00:01:35,969
Now follow with me.

30
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:42,694
The TCP/IP handshake creates three instances of approximately 250 ms each.

31
00:01:42,694 --> 00:01:47,656
So we're already looking at approximately 750 ms before

32
00:01:47,656 --> 00:01:51,239
your computer sends the HTTP request,

33
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:56,813
which taking approximately 250 ms to reach the server and

34
00:01:56,813 --> 00:02:00,857
another approximately 250 ms to respond back with the web

35
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:03,376
page and a 200 status code,

36
00:02:03,376 --> 00:02:10,466
this adds another 500 ms so we're currently at 1 and a quarter seconds.

37
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:14,455
Now if this page has maybe 5 additional assets that need

38
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:16,963
to load like JavaScript or CSS images,

39
00:02:16,963 --> 00:02:21,677
we need to add those times for those requests and for

40
00:02:21,677 --> 00:02:23,161
them to respond asynchronously,

41
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:32,289
this could possibly add an additional 1500 to 1700 extra milliseconds.

42
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:36,363
So it's perfectly normal to see a web server set up regardless of the

43
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:39,654
horizontal scaling serving content to request from the other side of the

44
00:02:39,654 --> 00:02:44,105
world taking the best part of 3 to 4 seconds to load and that's if

45
00:02:44,105 --> 00:02:47,103
everything goes exactly as expected.

46
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:52,484
This can be a costly overhead when response times have a financial impact.

47
00:02:52,484 --> 00:02:56,404
CDN stands for content distributed network,

48
00:02:56,404 --> 00:02:59,933
which refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which will

49
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:05,039
work together to provide fast delivery of internet content.

50
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,115
CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for

51
00:03:08,115 --> 00:03:11,514
loading internet content including HTML pages,

52
00:03:11,514 --> 00:03:15,687
JavaScript files, Style Sheets, images, and videos.

53
00:03:15,687 --> 00:03:19,615
There are many popular CDN services which continue to grow in popularity,

54
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:22,701
and today, the majority of web traffic is served through them,

55
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:25,973
including traffic for major sites like Facebook,

56
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:29,929
Netflix, Reddit, YouTube, and Twitter.

57
00:03:29,929 --> 00:03:35,899
CDNs work by reducing the distance between your origin and your target audience.

58
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:39,263
Like stated a moment ago, your origin web servers,

59
00:03:39,263 --> 00:03:44,236
regardless of their scaling capabilities are a single location serving content.

60
00:03:44,236 --> 00:03:49,012
The further you move away from the server, the longer your request will take.

61
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:51,958
The CDN replicates the setup in multiple regions around the

62
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,699
globe reducing the distance a request and transfer has to

63
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:58,393
travel to and from your end users.

64
00:03:58,393 --> 00:04:02,643
Think of it as a remote cache of your static objects that a visitor can

65
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:06,251
reach rather than having to go all the way to the origin.

66
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:07,473
So at its core,

67
00:04:07,473 --> 00:04:10,760
a CDN is a network of servers linked together with the

68
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,652
goal of delivering content as quickly, cheaply,

69
00:04:14,652 --> 00:04:17,883
reliably, and securely as possible.

70
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,915
I think it's important to consider this when you decide

71
00:04:19,915 --> 00:04:22,074
that you might want to use a CDN.

72
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:26,261
These reasons will provide motivation for the rest of this course.

73
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:29,972
The key items from this lesson, and which we'll expand on in the next videos,

74
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:34,082
are that CDNs are geographically distributed networks,

75
00:04:34,082 --> 00:04:36,694
they cache static content,

76
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:47,000
they reduce the distance between visitors and the origin, and they reduce your response time.
