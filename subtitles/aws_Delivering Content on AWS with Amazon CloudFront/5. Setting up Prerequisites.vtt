00:00:01.957 --> 00:00:02.568
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.568 --> 00:00:06.990
I know that the last video was a lot of information introducing CDNs and

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.746
understanding how CloudFront can optimize our content delivery.

4
00:00:10.746 --> 00:00:14.116
Let's take a moment to make sure all the required tools are set up,

5
00:00:14.116 --> 00:00:16.264
that way we are ready to learn how to configure and

6
00:00:16.264 --> 00:00:18.393
optimize CloudFront to fit our needs.

7
00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:23.211
In order to do anything with AWS, you have to have an AWS account.

8
00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:25.439
If you already have one, that is great.

9
00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.707
You're one step ahead.

10
00:00:27.707 --> 00:00:32.764
In addition to creating an account, we're going to add a new IAM user.

11
00:00:32.764 --> 00:00:37.247
This way, you aren't using the root account to build and configure anything.

12
00:00:37.247 --> 00:00:40.915
We need to configure the AWS CLI because there are many features available to

13
00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:44.873
the CLI that are easier and faster than using the AWS console.

14
00:00:44.873 --> 00:00:48.423
Once we have our account ready and key is generated,

15
00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:54.048
we will install the CLI and configure it so it's ready to access your account.

16
00:00:54.048 --> 00:00:57.619
Signing up with Amazon Web Service is a fairly simple process.

17
00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:00.763
Let's just walk through it quickly so there's no confusion.

18
00:01:00.763 --> 00:01:05.331
Please open your browser and navigate to the URL on the screen.

19
00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:12.911
Aws.amazon .com is the main Landing Page for any and all things AWS.

20
00:01:12.911 --> 00:01:14.337
If you look up in the top right of the page,

21
00:01:14.337 --> 00:01:17.960
go ahead and click that big orange button.

22
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.340
This takes you to the first page of the signup form.

23
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.046
Enter an email, password,

24
00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:24.469
and the name of the account you want to create and this

25
00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.001
information will be used for your root account.

26
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:29.461
Once you have everything filled out,

27
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:33.852
click Continue and continue onto the next page.

28
00:01:33.852 --> 00:01:35.336
Since this information is for the root account,

29
00:01:35.336 --> 00:01:39.289
you should use the main contact for AWS if you're within a larger organization,

30
00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.897
otherwise, if this is a personal account,

31
00:01:41.897 --> 00:01:44.834
you should use your own details.

32
00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:48.092
On the next page, a credit card is required to sign up.

33
00:01:48.092 --> 00:01:48.817
Now remember,

34
00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:53.142
AWS is using a pay-as-you-go model so you won't be charged for anything

35
00:01:53.142 --> 00:01:56.986
until you begin to run services within your account.

36
00:01:56.986 --> 00:02:00.171
AWS needs to verify you by sending a text message to the

37
00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:02.574
phone number you provided a moment ago.

38
00:02:02.574 --> 00:02:05.093
Complete the captcha and click Send SMS.

39
00:02:05.093 --> 00:02:08.789
You will receive a text message within a few minutes with a four-digit code.

40
00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.755
Once you receive the code, enter it here and click Verify code,

41
00:02:13.755 --> 00:02:17.146
and if all goes well, you should see this green checkmark.

42
00:02:17.146 --> 00:02:21.322
During signup, they give you the option to add a support contract to your plan.

43
00:02:21.322 --> 00:02:27.450
We don't need that for this course, so go ahead and choose the free plan.

44
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.449
And there we go.

45
00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.882
If you're seeing this screen, you are all set.

46
00:02:31.882 --> 00:02:36.350
Go ahead and click the orange Sign in button in the top right of the page.

47
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.185
Use the email and password that was entered on the

48
00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:43.229
very first page of the sign-up flow, then click Next to sign in.

49
00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.686
Woohoo!

50
00:02:43.686 --> 00:02:47.055
You now have access to your new AWS account.

51
00:02:47.055 --> 00:02:53.271
Congratulations and welcome to the AWS management console.

52
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:54.505
Now that you've logged in for the first time,

53
00:02:54.505 --> 00:02:58.833
it's worth repeating that you are logged in as the root account.

54
00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:01.228
Security best practices dictate that you should take

55
00:03:01.228 --> 00:03:02.772
steps to harden your root account,

56
00:03:02.772 --> 00:03:06.942
as well as create a new admin user under IAM and then put

57
00:03:06.942 --> 00:03:09.563
the root account's credentials somewhere safe and only use

58
00:03:09.563 --> 00:03:12.867
it in break-glass situations.

59
00:03:12.867 --> 00:03:15.844
Let's go ahead and add a new user.

60
00:03:15.844 --> 00:03:19.102
Since you're on the main page, in the Find Services search field,

61
00:03:19.102 --> 00:03:25.800
enter the letters IAM and click the Option or press Enter.

62
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.835
The Identity and Access Management service is where you manage users,

63
00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:32.837
roles, and permission policies.

64
00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:36.233
Please take notice of the security status notifications.

65
00:03:36.233 --> 00:03:39.584
This is highlighting the state of general tasks that this account must

66
00:03:39.584 --> 00:03:43.549
implement to apply security best practices and they are the first things

67
00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.873
you should complete when setting up a new account.

68
00:03:46.873 --> 00:03:49.285
I'm not going to go through these steps in this course,

69
00:03:49.285 --> 00:03:53.312
but please remember, this is very important when setting up your own accounts.

70
00:03:53.312 --> 00:03:56.928
Let's move forward and create a new user.

71
00:03:56.928 --> 00:04:02.457
Under IAM Resources or in the sidebar, you should find Users.

72
00:04:02.457 --> 00:04:05.867
Click this link, which will bring you to an empty Users section,

73
00:04:05.867 --> 00:04:10.835
click the Add user button at the top, enter a username,

74
00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:19.381
then choose both Programmatic access and AWS Management Console access types.

75
00:04:19.381 --> 00:04:22.032
You will see two new options appear.

76
00:04:22.032 --> 00:04:24.718
Leave Autogenerated password checked,

77
00:04:24.718 --> 00:04:28.762
but uncheck Require password reset as you are the one who is setting up this

78
00:04:28.762 --> 00:04:32.606
account and you will be the one who is using it to access AWS.

79
00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:35.935
If you were generating this user for another person,

80
00:04:35.935 --> 00:04:38.436
then you should probably leave it checked.

81
00:04:38.436 --> 00:04:40.198
That you, you only know the temporary password,

82
00:04:40.198 --> 00:04:45.333
which they will use to set up their own password upon their first log in.

83
00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:49.591
Click the Next Permissions button at the bottom of the screen to proceed.

84
00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:50.827
If this is a brand-new account,

85
00:04:50.827 --> 00:04:53.445
then you won't have any options to pick from other

86
00:04:53.445 --> 00:04:55.886
than the default baked in policies.

87
00:04:55.886 --> 00:04:58.822
Let's choose the attach existing policies directly option,

88
00:04:58.822 --> 00:05:01.909
and then from the following list of policies,

89
00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:05.916
check the AdministratorAccess checkbox.

90
00:05:05.916 --> 00:05:07.654
We're going to use this for the sake of this demo,

91
00:05:07.654 --> 00:05:11.424
but this is a very broad and full permissions policy.

92
00:05:11.424 --> 00:05:14.429
Please follow some of the AWS security related courses here,

93
00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:15.149
on Pluralsight,

94
00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:18.659
to create a more fine-grained policy which you should

95
00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:21.388
use if this was a real-world scenario.

96
00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:24.800
Since this is a course on CloudFront and not access management,

97
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.235
we're going to proceed.

98
00:05:27.235 --> 00:05:31.384
Tags are a great feature for organizing your inventory inside of AWS.

99
00:05:31.384 --> 00:05:34.660
For right now, let's skip this, but if this were real world,

100
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.622
I would set them and I highly recommend you use them within your own account.

101
00:05:39.622 --> 00:05:39.942
Okay,

102
00:05:39.942 --> 00:05:43.266
let's do one quick review to make sure everything is

103
00:05:43.266 --> 00:05:46.875
configured properly before we create this user.

104
00:05:46.875 --> 00:05:52.036
Yeah, everything looks good so go ahead and click Create User at the bottom.

105
00:05:52.036 --> 00:05:52.967
Very nice.

106
00:05:52.967 --> 00:05:56.691
You just set up your first IAM user.

107
00:05:56.691 --> 00:05:58.346
This is a very important window.

108
00:05:58.346 --> 00:06:02.413
Here, you have all of your user's credentials.

109
00:06:02.413 --> 00:06:06.880
Please click the Download .csv button to download a file with your credentials.

110
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.568
You can choose to reveal the values on screen and copy/paste them.

111
00:06:10.568 --> 00:06:12.798
Just remember, once you leave this screen,

112
00:06:12.798 --> 00:06:17.298
you cannot retrieve these values and you will have to recreate them.

113
00:06:17.298 --> 00:06:19.658
Once you're confident you have these credentials saved somewhere,

114
00:06:19.658 --> 00:06:21.275
go ahead and click Close,

115
00:06:21.275 --> 00:06:26.182
and now you can see that you have your first user in the user list.

116
00:06:26.182 --> 00:06:29.857
Now that we have our AWS account and a brand-new IAM user,

117
00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:35.568
all we have left to do is to configure the AWS CLI.

118
00:06:35.568 --> 00:06:37.850
The nice thing about AWS is that you can manage

119
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.879
your services many different ways, through the console,

120
00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:42.063
through the terminal,

121
00:06:42.063 --> 00:06:45.242
or other configuration management tools like CloudFormation,

122
00:06:45.242 --> 00:06:47.685
Terraform, or Ansible.

123
00:06:47.685 --> 00:06:50.473
Since everything in AWS is really just an API call,

124
00:06:50.473 --> 00:06:53.534
using the console or terminal will give you the ability

125
00:06:53.534 --> 00:06:55.394
to perform any of the same tasks.

126
00:06:55.394 --> 00:06:57.657
Using the terminal can improve some steps,

127
00:06:57.657 --> 00:07:02.589
as well as giving you a way to automate or script repeatable processes.

128
00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.374
You may use any method listed previously,

129
00:07:04.374 --> 00:07:09.498
but I recommend you learn at the minimum the console and the terminal.

130
00:07:09.498 --> 00:07:11.753
Please open your terminal.

131
00:07:11.753 --> 00:07:16.602
I will be performing this on a Mac, but these steps work on any operating system.

132
00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:19.167
Python is available for all major operating systems,

133
00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:22.025
whether Windows, Mac, or Linux.

134
00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:25.812
Regardless of OS, you should have Python installed on your system.

135
00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:29.754
If not, please install Python version 3.

136
00:07:29.754 --> 00:07:31.880
In order to check if you have Python installed,

137
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:39.831
you can run python --version or python3 --version.

138
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:43.404
If you have Python, check to make sure you have pip installed as well.

139
00:07:43.404 --> 00:07:46.127
Once we're sure that we have Python 3 and pip installed,

140
00:07:46.127 --> 00:07:49.008
we can install the AWS CLI.

141
00:07:49.008 --> 00:08:00.853
Please use the following command to install.

142
00:08:00.853 --> 00:08:05.391
Alright, now that that's completed, please run the command,

143
00:08:05.391 --> 00:08:09.808
aws, to verify that the installation was a success.

144
00:08:09.808 --> 00:08:12.985
The last thing we need to do is configure the AWS CLI to hold the

145
00:08:12.985 --> 00:08:16.061
credentials of the user we created earlier.

146
00:08:16.061 --> 00:08:22.156
Run aws configure to add the users keys,

147
00:08:22.156 --> 00:08:28.957
add the access key, then add your secret key.

148
00:08:28.957 --> 00:08:31.029
You can pick the region you'll be operating from.

149
00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:36.025
I'm in the EU, so I'm choosing eu-west-1 and then pick your output format,

150
00:08:36.025 --> 00:08:38.467
I like to leave it at default.

151
00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:40.449
Okay, so we're all configured.

152
00:08:40.449 --> 00:08:43.469
We should be able to run a basic command to verify we are

153
00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:45.369
connecting to our account properly.

154
00:08:45.369 --> 00:08:48.737
How about something like listing our S3 buckets.

155
00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:50.830
We don't have any S3 buckets right now, but that's okay.

156
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:57.222
As long as we don't get an error back, we have connected properly.

157
00:08:57.222 --> 00:08:59.961
No error, no problem.

158
00:08:59.961 --> 00:09:06.000
Alright. You are all ready to begin building your own CloudFront environments.
