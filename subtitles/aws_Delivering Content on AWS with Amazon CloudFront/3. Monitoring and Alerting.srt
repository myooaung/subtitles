1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,940
Log files give us a lot of useful data to work with when an issue occurs,

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,118
but you also need a mechanism to notify you or your operations team

3
00:00:09,118 --> 00:00:12,797
whenever there is a potential issue as it happens.

4
00:00:12,797 --> 00:00:16,323
To deliver alarm notifications, we'll use Amazon SNS,

5
00:00:16,323 --> 00:00:19,787
a fully-managed pub sub messaging service.

6
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:22,111
Since CloudFront is already integrated with CloudWatch,

7
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:24,637
it's already publishing metrics in us-east-1.

8
00:00:24,637 --> 00:00:30,044
This means we'll need to set up our SNS topic in the same region.

9
00:00:30,044 --> 00:00:31,964
Just to keep on topic with CloudFront monitoring,

10
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:37,013
I've already set up and subscribed my email address to an SNS topic.

11
00:00:37,013 --> 00:00:38,810
If you'd like more guidance on setting up SNS,

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:44,083
please search in the Pluralsight catalog for topics on implementing SNS.

13
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,674
You can also choose to send notifications to other destinations,

14
00:00:46,674 --> 00:00:51,692
such as custom monitoring systems or services like PagerDuty.

15
00:00:51,692 --> 00:00:54,433
Now we'll need to configure alarms using CloudWatch.

16
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:57,148
CloudWatch is a monitoring and management service that provides you

17
00:00:57,148 --> 00:01:00,407
with data and actionable insights to monitor your applications and

18
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:04,132
respond to system-wide performance changes.

19
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:07,753
CloudWatch currently provides the following metrics at no additional cost and

20
00:01:07,753 --> 00:01:10,713
these metrics don't count against your CloudWatch limits.

21
00:01:10,713 --> 00:01:15,847
These are requests, BytesDownloaded, BytesUploaded,

22
00:01:15,847 --> 00:01:22,124
400ErrorRates, 500ErrorRates, and TotalErrorRates.

23
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,078
When viewing metrics,

24
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:26,661
you can specify a time interval of as little as 1 minute

25
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:31,650
for time periods in the previous 2 weeks.

26
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,532
Head over to the CloudFront service console,

27
00:01:33,532 --> 00:01:37,297
in the left side Navigation pane, click Monitoring,

28
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:44,737
then choose a distribution, then click View distribution metrics above it.

29
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:49,411
On this page, you have a dashboard with metrics already charted for you.

30
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:53,051
Let's take a look at a few of these metrics.

31
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:59,101
Requests, this shows you the total incoming requests within a 5-minute window.

32
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:02,816
Data transfer is the average bytes uploaded and

33
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:05,540
downloaded within a 5-minute window.

34
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,383
And error rate is handling a little bit of math to crunch the numbers and

35
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:13,736
display a percentage of all the errors verse all incoming requests for

36
00:02:13,736 --> 00:02:17,109
the distribution within a 5-minute window.

37
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:17,661
If you prefer,

38
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:20,492
you can add these to a CloudWatch dashboard so you can view

39
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:24,141
these metrics from within CloudWatch.

40
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:25,797
Let's build an alarm.

41
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:31,194
Why don't we set an alarm for 500ErrorRate metric.

42
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:37,030
Let's jump into the CloudWatch console within the us-east-1 region,

43
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,394
that's North Virginia.

44
00:02:39,394 --> 00:02:46,551
On the left side, click Alarms, click on Create alarm,

45
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:52,118
click Select metric, then go to CloudFront,

46
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:53,526
Per-Distribution Metrics,

47
00:02:53,526 --> 00:03:00,046
scroll until you find 500ErrorRate for your CloudFront distribution Id,

48
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:06,361
and then check the box, and click Select metric at the bottom.

49
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:09,555
Scroll down a little, in the period field,

50
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:16,091
choose 1 minute, scroll a little further and we'll set our condition.

51
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:21,780
Let's set the alarm to trigger whenever 500ErrorRate is greater than .1 %.

52
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,785
You should adjust the value to be whatever is appropriate for

53
00:03:24,785 --> 00:03:30,728
your distribution and your application, and click Next.

54
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:33,867
Under Notification, choose Alarm.

55
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:36,130
Then since I've already created my SNS topic,

56
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,343
I'll choose select an existing SNS topic,

57
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:42,886
then select the SNS topic called PS_Alerts,

58
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:45,582
but you could use whatever topic you have.

59
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:48,911
Scroll to the bottom and click Next.

60
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:55,091
Give the alarm a name, click Next, and review your settings,

61
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:59,571
and when you're satisfied, click Create Alarm.

62
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:00,983
Now you should see your alarm.

63
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:04,735
At first, you'll see insufficient data is the state,

64
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:08,030
that'll quickly change to OK.

65
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,038
From this point on,

66
00:04:09,038 --> 00:04:14,549
if the rate of 500 errors goes over .1 % of its current baseline,

67
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:16,455
CloudFront will email me.

68
00:04:16,455 --> 00:04:19,207
Setting alarms should be repeated for each one of the

69
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:20,617
available metrics that are currently available,

70
00:04:20,617 --> 00:04:24,264
but for the sake of this lesson, we'll skip over that for now.

71
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,140
In the next video,

72
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:31,000
we'll take what we've built here and put it to use to help us troubleshoot as an issue occurs.
