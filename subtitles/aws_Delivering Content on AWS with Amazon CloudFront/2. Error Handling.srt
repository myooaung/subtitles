1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,710
If the objects that you're serving through CloudFront

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,400
are unavailable for some reason,

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,300
your web server typically returns an HTTP status

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,810
code to CloudFront. For example, if a viewer specifies an invalid URL,

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,490
your web server returns a 404 status code to CloudFront.

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,650
CloudFront returns the status code to the requester.

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,470
The browser displays a brief and sparsely formatted default message similar to

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:34,650
this. But you can display a custom error message instead.

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,790
You also have several options for managing how

10
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,750
CloudFront responds when there is an error.

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,110
To specify options for custom error messages,

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,050
you need to configure your CloudFront distribution under the Error Pages tab.

13
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,800
If you'd rather display a customer error message instead of the default message,

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,640
for example,

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,390
a page that uses the same formatting as the rest of your website, you

16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,400
can have CloudFront return to the viewer an object,

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,850
such as an HTML file that contains your custom error message.

18
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,130
For example,

19
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,250
the following is a customized error message handled and served by CloudFront.

20
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:17,680
You can specify a different object for each supported HTTP status code,

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,970
or you can use the same object for all of the supported status codes.

22
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:27,050
You can also choose to specify objects for some status codes and not for others.

23
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,300
The objects that you're serving through CloudFront can be

24
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,450
unavailable for a variety of reasons.

25
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,020
These fall into two broad categories.

26
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,610
Client errors indicate a problem with the request.

27
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,280
For example,

28
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,290
an object with a specified name isn't available or the user doesn't have the

29
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,130
permissions required to get an object in your S3 bucket.

30
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,650
When a client error occurs,

31
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,520
the origin returns an HTTP status code in the 400 range to CloudFront.

32
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,070
Server errors indicate a problem with the origin.

33
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,140
For example,

34
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,070
the HTTP server is busy or unavailable. When a server error occurs,

35
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,710
either your origin server returns and HTTP status code in the 500

36
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,760
range to CloudFront or CloudFront doesn't get a response from your

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,840
origin for a certain period of time and assumes a 504 status code due

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,170
to a gateway timeout.

39
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:29,510
The HTTP status codes for which CloudFront can return a custom error page

40
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:39,180
include the following: 400 Bad Request, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 405

41
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:48,500
Method Not Allowed, 414 URI Too Long, and 416 Range Not Satisfiable. And

42
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:55,610
for server errors, 500 Internal Server Error, 501 Not Implemented, 502

43
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:04,310
Bad Gateway, 503 Service Unavailable, and 504 Gateway Timeout. I have

44
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,440
added a custom error page for when 404 status codes are returned for my

45
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,030
origin.

46
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,130
As you can see,

47
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,850
I have an S3 bucket for storing error pages. In this bucket, I have

48
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,130
saved the custom 404 error template as 404.html.

49
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,620
This document is styled to look like the rest of my website.

50
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,130
It is recommended you keep your error templates in a

51
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,850
separate origin like an S3 bucket. That way, if there is

52
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,540
an issue with your other origins,

53
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:38,020
custom error messages can continue to be served. If you click the blue

54
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,000
Create Custom Error Response button when on the Error Pages tab of the

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,560
CloudFront service, you'll see the following options: HTTP Error Code.

56
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,550
We'll choose 404 as our error code. Error codes default to using a TTL

57
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,730
of 300 seconds, but you can override them when creating your custom errors.

58
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:02,950
We'll leave 300 seconds, or 5 minutes. Customize Error Response.

59
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,750
Once we click Yes, you'll see two new fields appear.

60
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:14,150
Response Path will add the path to our 404.html document from our S3 origin.

61
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,470
And since we're actually loading a real HTML document,

62
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,770
we can send a 200 response code.

63
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,840
You can choose to respond with any of the supported response codes.

64
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,750
Then we'll click Create.

65
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,450
You should now see your custom error response configured here.

66
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,470
Since my custom error template is in a different

67
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,490
location from my default origin,

68
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:43,240
I will need to add a new origin and a new behavior to to connect

69
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,030
CloudFront to my S3 bucket. Once that is completed and once my

70
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,580
Distribution Status returns to Deployed,

71
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,880
then I can test my site to see how it will return a 404 error.

72
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:03,190
If I use something like www.dyrcz.me/fileshouldntexist.html,

73
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:09,000
which is an HTML file which does not exist on any of my origins, so my

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,220
origins should return a 404, and CloudFront should return my custom 404

75
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,870
page and respond with a 200 status code.

76
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,500
Now we have proper error handling when it comes to a 404 response.

77
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:31,000
You can now replicate this process for any additional custom error responses that you'd like to implement.
