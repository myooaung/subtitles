00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.560
The final skill that we're going to learn before we build our currency converter app at the end of the

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.380
section it has had images to our app so images are obviously a cool way of making your app more attractive

3
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.950
and interesting to the user and they're pretty easy to add in Android studio.

4
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:24.450
So first off we're going to need some images to add so I'm going to jump over to Google images and just

5
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.380
search for some images of.

6
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.100
Why not.

7
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.160
I think I'll go for them Clipper cats.

8
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.660
And those first two looked great.

9
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.220
So of course if you're working with an app you're going to actually use in publication then you need

10
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.790
to be very careful of the copyright status of the images that you are using.

11
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.640
But if you're just playing with an app for practice then downloading an image from Google Images just

12
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.190
to test things is perfectly fine.

13
00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.760
So I control click or right click on Windows and save image as and I'm going to save it on the desktop

14
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.250
or just call it Cat.

15
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.040
Now notice this image is actually pretty big.

16
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.330
It's a pretty big image.

17
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.240
So I might have to resize it before I put it in my app.

18
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.820
So this one is 4000 by 5000 which is very big.

19
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.990
This one's 500 by 500 or so which is actually perfectly fine.

20
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.920
So I'll save that one.

21
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.210
We'll see why we're having two images in a moment.

22
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.880
So cool that Kattie

23
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.000
and then to do the resizing on Mac.

24
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.810
It's very simple.

25
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.780
I'm just going to double click on the image I want cats.

26
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.550
There we go.

27
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.670
And then tools are just size.

28
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:59.680
And then I'll change that to 400 pixels in width will make it much smaller.

29
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.430
And less likely to cause any speed problems.

30
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.530
Within the app and then I'll just save it and move on.

31
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:15.830
If you're on Windows you'll need to either just download a smaller image or use some kind of image conversion

32
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:24.410
program to change the image size and then to import the images just find them and then on Windows you

33
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.490
can just drag them into the drawable folder.

34
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.040
They're within the resources folder but on a Mac for some reason you need to copy them to the clipboard

35
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:44.420
so command C and then go over to the folder and then command V to paste them in and then just click

36
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.310
OK and then they will be imported into our project.

37
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.070
Excellent.

38
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.150
So how do we actually make them appear.

39
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.560
Well back over to activity main

40
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.230
and here I'll actually get rid of the three items that we've got so far.

41
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.420
And I'll bring in an image view

42
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:25.200
and I'm going to make it aligned to the top left and then we'll make it fill parent both in terms of

43
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.100
width and height.

44
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.790
There we go.

45
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:41.490
And then we scroll all the way down to SIRC which is short for source and then we're going to select

46
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.740
one of our images.

47
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:55.300
Click on the button with the three dots and then go over to the drawable section on the left and there

48
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.880
they were

49
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.980
and there's two options.

50
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.130
OK for the first cat

51
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.040
and that he or she is.

52
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.770
And then I'd like to see that in action.

53
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:22.160
But before I do I will need to remove the carried in main activity because that now refers to user interface

54
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.090
elements that are no longer there.

55
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.500
So we try to run it as it was then we get an error.

56
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.970
So let's just check make sure our cat appears as we'd like and there we go.

57
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.570
So your cat is displayed beautifully there.

58
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.460
So now you might be wondering why we have this second cat image.

59
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.030
That's because I'm going to get you another challenge and this challenge will require you to do a little

60
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.870
bit of googling to work out the solution to the challenge.

61
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.380
Googling is maybe 80 percent of the job of the average developer.

62
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.430
A very important skill to learn and you're going to get your first taste of it right now.

63
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:06.080
So what we're going to do is add a button to our app and what we want to do is when we press that button

64
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:13.340
the image should change from the first cat image to the second cat image.

65
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.030
Simple as that.

66
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.670
So obviously setting up the button to run some code should be second nature now but updating an image

67
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.780
with code is something you haven't done before so you'll need to do a quick bit of googling to work

68
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.090
out how to do that.

69
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.330
That's the time to pause the video and give it a shot.

70
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.050
Best of luck.

71
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:39.720
All right.

72
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.360
Here we go then.

73
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.760
I hope you manage to do that.

74
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.960
I'm going to start by adding the button then.

75
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:53.790
So I'm just going to drag it over on top of the image view.

76
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.060
And

77
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.170
I'll change it to new cat

78
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.360
and then I'll just set the on click

79
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.400
again.

80
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.280
I'll call it a new cat

81
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.830
and then will write the code for the new cat method.

82
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.350
So again public void because it's not returning anything.

83
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:37.970
You can't and this is coming from a view.

84
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.150
So we'll have that in there.

85
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.880
Now one quick tip before we get into changing the cat's image is that when you're setting up something

86
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.930
like this especially if you're going to add some code that your you haven't used before that you're

87
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:55.140
not that confident about it just set up a quick test

88
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.000
to make sure that everything is connected up as you'd want it to be

89
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:12.920
and then run your app with that code before you do anything too complicated regarding code that you're

90
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.910
not familiar with.

91
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:24.270
So while that's running I'm just going to jump over back to Chrome and do a google search.

92
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.710
So what is it that I want to do.

93
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.290
I want to update an image with current.

94
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:36.890
So let's try that update image with code and then we need to specify the platform that we're working

95
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:37.390
on.

96
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.170
Usually Android is enough.

97
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.980
Sometimes I put Java in there as well just to be clear.

98
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.720
But usually Android is enough.

99
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:56.370
So there we go how to update or change images of image view dynamically in Android.

100
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.920
That looks pretty perfect.

101
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.570
You'll notice that in fact all of the top four results there are on stack overflow.

102
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.880
If you haven't used stack overlay before you'll definitely come across it.

103
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:15.020
It's a fantastic site where anyone can ask and answer primarily programming questions but it's actually

104
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.770
extended to all sorts of other topics now as well.

105
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.460
So if you have a question that you really can't find the answer to.

106
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:25.830
You can actually just post it on stack overflow but make sure you've Googled it very carefully first.

107
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:37.350
OK so this looks like the answer to our question looks like we're creating an image view just like we

108
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:44.720
created an edit text in the previous video using fine view by id and then this is the key there.

109
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.130
Set image resource.

110
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:50.600
And then it looks like we find the results from the durable folder.

111
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.850
Perfect.

112
00:08:52.910 --> 00:09:00.010
So I would always look through code fairly carefully to make sure that you understand what it's doing

113
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:01.780
before you use it.

114
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.250
Don't just use code blindly

115
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:08.780
but let's have a quick look.

116
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.690
So does our new cap pattern work.

117
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.630
I've got an info search in there.

118
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:15.310
There we go.

119
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:15.770
OK.

120
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.410
So everything is connected OK.

121
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:26.990
The vantage of doing that is if your image code didn't work for any reason then it's hard to know whether

122
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.990
you just made a mistake in the set up or whether your code is wrong.

123
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:36.830
So now at least we know that if there's a problem it will be a problem with the code.

124
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.710
So I've pasted that in there.

125
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:46.040
Now obviously we need to update a few things so we got our image we need to find a view by ID.

126
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:52.340
So we'll need to give our image an ID.

127
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:56.870
It is a double click on the image.

128
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.440
I'll call it cat image view.

129
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:10.880
And we'll update all the usages of that within the app.

130
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:20.480
And then over in main activity we should be able to find it in our dog ID dog cat image view.

131
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.380
There it is.

132
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:27.030
And then we just want to take our image and set an image resource.

133
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:37.160
So we put it in drawable so we should be able to find our drawable dog cat to select it correctly.

134
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.300
There it is.

135
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.120
So you see that was predicted.

136
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.700
We don't need the extension.

137
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:48.640
It only stores the actual file name.

138
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.080
There we go.

139
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.830
So I hope you manage to do that bit of googling it when you get to the stage where you can comfortably

140
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.810
Google something that you don't know how to do.

141
00:10:54.990 --> 00:11:01.500
It's really useful because you can essentially build any IP like just by working out the missing bits

142
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:08.190
of your knowledge and filling them in by looking on stack overflow or just Google.

143
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.490
So let's have a look.

144
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:17.460
We should now find that when we tap the button it updates the image to the second cat and there we go

145
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:25.620
one quick final thing before we move on to our challenge is that with images it's worth knowing that

146
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:30.290
there are different ways to display them within the image view.

147
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:38.210
And you'll find that here in properties near the bottom where it says scale type.

148
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:47.590
And so for example fits X Y will stretch it right to the edge of the container.

149
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:57.970
Fit start will keep it in proportion and align it to the top of the container for its sends it will

150
00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.580
keep it in proportion and align it in the center of the container.

151
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:07.990
That's probably the one you're most commonly going to need fit and will obviously keep it at the end.

152
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:18.130
Center has it full resolution and then send it send center Krup does something pretty similar and then

153
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:24.260
center inside is just keeping it centered within the image itself.

154
00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:29.220
So probably fit center or center inside is going to be the one that you want.

155
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.160
For most of your images.

156
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:32.810
Wonderful.

157
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.860
So now we've covered images we know everything that we need for our currency converter app.

158
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.120
So let's go and build that in the next video.
