00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.730
Now that we've got our log in and sign up code working properly and very nicely with the keyboard as

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.430
well we're going to see how to display the user list for our users so that they can choose people to

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.450
view their Instagram feeds.

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.190
So I'm just going to sign up as a new user

5
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:28.870
and this will then redirect me to the user list which will populate with all the users on our app in

6
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.260
alphabetical order.

7
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.520
And there they are.

8
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.950
So that's all there is to it.

9
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.310
I think you can pretty much do this one yourself.

10
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.490
Do you see where you'll need to read direct to the new activity when the user signs up when they log

11
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.810
in.

12
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.750
And also if they start the app and they're already logged in.

13
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.250
Other than that it's just a matter of creating an array list populating it with details from a past

14
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.290
query and then displaying that on the list.

15
00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.150
You know just the past queries will be a query of past users this time which is very slightly different

16
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.000
to a query of past objects.

17
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.520
But it's so similar that I'm sure you can figure it out.

18
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.060
So best of luck as well.

19
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.470
All right.

20
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.400
Here we are them.

21
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.850
I'm going to start by bringing in a new activity

22
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.170
from the gallery and I want an empty activity for my user list.

23
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.180
Now call this user list activity

24
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.760
and then drag in my list the

25
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.320
there you go.

26
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.420
Give it an ID of user list view.

27
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:12.980
And then before we set that up I'm going to set up our intent to jump to the user list activity and

28
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.550
I'm going to do that in a separate method because we're going to call it from a number of different

29
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.450
places.

30
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.690
So I will set up public FOID share user list

31
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.900
and we need intend for this.

32
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.030
So intent

33
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:44.670
which is going to be a new intent using the application context and we want to jump to use a list activity

34
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:52.780
dot class and then we don't need to send any details.

35
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.010
We just want to start the activity

36
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.910
and we want to do that in three places.

37
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.510
So the first is when the user is successfully signed in which is where

38
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.130
the second is where the user has just logged in that's here.

39
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:25.810
And the third is if the user is already logged in when they open up the app so we know how to check

40
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.200
for that.

41
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:40.970
We look for if past user thought get current user is not know then we'll show the user list.

42
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.400
All right so now when we run the app we should find that because we're locked in a ready we jumped straight

43
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.560
to the user list activity

44
00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.430
Well that's compiling I will write ok to set up the user.

45
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.040
So let's

46
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.180
create a list we could use a list.

47
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.310
She's going to be a list view from fine view by ID.

48
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.290
ID dot

49
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.500
use a list you.

50
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.450
And then as usual I'll set it up with just a basic list before

51
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.010
we actually synchronize with our Passover.

52
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.700
So we'll have a list of user names.

53
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.340
It's going to be a new list and then we'll just add

54
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.040
a simple test one for now then we're going to need an array adapter

55
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:15.190
which is going to be a new array adapter and then we use this as the context Android to lay out a simple

56
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.080
list item one as they lay out templates and then use the names

57
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.830
as they list.

58
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:33.340
And then we just take our user list fee and set the adapter

59
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.420
array adapter.

60
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.390
All right let's have a quick test.

61
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.370
We should literally see the words test appear at the top of our list view.

62
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:51.210
After everything has been processed and there we go.

63
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.240
So our view is now working fine.

64
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.430
Let's change our code to actually populate it from our list of users.

65
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.160
Now this is the bit that's very slightly different to what we've done before.

66
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.380
So previously we had a past query using past objects.

67
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:18.620
This time we're going to be using a pass use a query which works in exactly the same way we just returning

68
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.880
past users rather than parse objects.

69
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:35.410
So a quick query and this time instead of a pass object query it's past user don't get query and then

70
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:42.580
the one restriction that we're going to have is that we don't want to return the current user to display

71
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.720
on the list.

72
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:52.600
So that's at I where and we want not equal to.

73
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:53.680
So there we go.

74
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.040
Not equal to.

75
00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:05.970
And we want the username to be not equal to the current users username so that's past user to get current

76
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:11.400
user to get username.

77
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:23.660
I'm also going to put them in alphabetical order so I dot at ascending order by username.

78
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.730
So that's optional if you want to have that.

79
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:39.730
But I think it makes sense then we run our query so as before find in background with a new kind Colback

80
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.670
and you can see that just as before it returns a list of objects.

81
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.910
But this time they pass uses rather than pass objects.

82
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:59.170
So let's do a check to see first of if there's no error.

83
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:12.010
And for now if there is we'll just print a stack trace or log an error and if there isn't more check

84
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:18.210
to see if there are any objects any uses returned objects.

85
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:23.000
Our size is greater than zero.

86
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:28.220
Then we want to loop three objects.

87
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:36.790
So we're looking for past user and I'll call it user in objects

88
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:46.520
and we want to add them to our usernames array list.

89
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.720
So we need to define that first

90
00:08:51.820 --> 00:09:03.520
so I'll define that up there and get rid of the test and then we can use user names don't add and then

91
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.310
we want to add the user name.

92
00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:14.300
So that's just user get username simple as that.

93
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:15.510
And then

94
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:26.880
let's take our definitions of the list view and the array adapter we them up there.

95
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:33.020
And then at this point not quite at that point we want to do it when

96
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:48.840
the process is completed and we do just need to Reclast that as a final list view so that we can access

97
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.770
it from there.

98
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:56.900
And similarly with array adapter.

99
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.000
All right.

100
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:04.560
So let's have a look if we jump back over to Firefox for a moment we can see we should have quite a

101
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.810
few different uses for my various tests.

102
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.620
So those are the ones that shared.

103
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:17.210
With any luck appear in our list for now and there we go.

104
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:22.680
You can see all government nice alphabetical order and by process of elimination I must currently be

105
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.950
logged in as Robert 2 3 4.

106
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:27.840
And there we go.

107
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:34.800
So I'm going to make a very quick change to some of our user names just to make it slightly more friendly.

108
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:56.010
So I'm going to change a T Kersten SDF t told me we're up to Ralphy and we'll have an extra Michael

109
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.350
in there as well.

110
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.630
And then rub two three four.

111
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.520
I'll just make Rob.

112
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.170
All right.

113
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.240
So now we're all set up and ready to go.

114
00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.660
We have our user list up and running.

115
00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:17.140
So our next stage is going to be viewing user's photos and that of course we'll find out today in the

116
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:17.960
next video.
