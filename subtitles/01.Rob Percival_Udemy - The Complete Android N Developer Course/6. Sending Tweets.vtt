WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.150
Now that we have our user list up and running and we can see which uses our current user is following

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.100
to add the functionality to actually send a tweet.

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.650
Now we could do this on a separate activity but it's a pretty simple function.

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.760
So I'm just going to do it by an alert dialog.

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.310
So we're going to need a new menu and we're going to have an option in that menu to send a tweet.

6
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.460
And with that we're out a log out function as well.

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.650
So let's add in a new menu.

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.860
You'll have to add the menu directory into the resources folder.

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:40.060
If you don't have one already and then file new menu resos file and we'll call this the tweak menu.

10
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.760
There we go.

11
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.570
And then we'll add the two options.

12
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:57.760
So I have an item with an ID of a tweet and a title of

13
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:18.390
and then underneath will have an item with an ID of logout and a title of logo that we get.

14
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:28.590
And then back to our main activity and we'll add the necessary menu items.

15
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.150
We'll start with all create options menu.

16
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.390
And this is why we created how many you inflata

17
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:52.380
choose a new menu inflator and then we take you in place of way inflate and the menu layout that we

18
00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.780
want to use is our menu tweak menu and we want to use the menu that's just been inflated.

19
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:10.930
I the main menu when I forgot to add a context of this for the main activity or main to activity.

20
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.410
And then on options items selected

21
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:34.630
and we'll just use a quick if statement to see if item get item ID is equal to a id dot tweet

22
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:46.550
then we need to do our tweet code which I'll write anybody else if I don't get to my day is equal to

23
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.640
out or ID dot log out

24
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.390
then we'll create a new intent

25
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:12.800
which will be a new intent in the application context jumping to the main activity doc class.

26
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.810
And then we'll start the activity to run the intent.

27
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:30.590
And of course don't forget to actually log out.

28
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.480
So for the tweet as I mentioned we're going to use an alert dialog.

29
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.540
So if you're a member it's been a while since we've used these but we use lot dialog builder.

30
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.310
Or call it build up.

31
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.820
And this is going to be a new alert dialog.

32
00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:07.600
Builder using this as the context then we use builder and set the title that we send a tweet

33
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.060
and then we're going to create an edit text that we can put into our dialogue.

34
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.900
So this is going to be where the user will type the content of their tweet.

35
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.290
So I'll call it tweet

36
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.270
content edit text.

37
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.630
It's going to be I knew edit text with context of this

38
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:45.940
and then we'll set the view of the builder to be the edit text.

39
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.550
There we go.

40
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.090
So the contents of the alert dialog will now be just that edit text.

41
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.750
But of course we'll also need our OK and Cancel buttons.

42
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:14.840
So will set the positive button which will be sent and we need a new dialog interface on listener.

43
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:28.910
And for now I'll just log the contents of the tweet to make sure we're getting those right to that tweet

44
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.880
content edit text don't get text.

45
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:47.350
Not to string.

46
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.970
And then we'll add the negative button set negative button.

47
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.150
And this is going to have the text Kenzo

48
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:07.900
And again we'll have an don't click listener which would just cancel the dialog so dialogue interface

49
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.260
dot cancel.

50
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.040
And then finally we'll show

51
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.640
our dialogue.

52
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.700
All right.

53
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.590
So let's have a quick look.

54
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:30.350
Obviously if this is a working the final thing that we need to do is actually send this via our pass

55
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:35.750
server rather than just display it in the logs.

56
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.250
And here we go.

57
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.560
So we're following two and Ralphy as before.

58
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.200
And now we're going to click in the menu and tweaked and then we've got our dialog.

59
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.830
Send a tweet

60
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.810
say hi there and then send and you can say it did indeed.

61
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.910
Get displayed in the logs.

62
00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:04.640
And just to check if we can so that just closes it down and doesn't do anything great.

63
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.240
So now what we need to do is send that via pass.

64
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.880
So it's just going to be a past object.

65
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:15.650
Call it a tweet.

66
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:24.000
And this is going to be a new parse subject with a class of tweet so pretty straightforward this class

67
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.300
we're just going to need the user name and the tweet content.

68
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:35.320
So tweet dot put and then use a name that's going to be the current user.

69
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.750
So parse user get current user get username

70
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:43.730
and similarly

71
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:56.790
the tweet itself will be tweaked content edit text get text dot to strain

72
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:06.280
and then we take our tweet and we save in the background with a new save callback

73
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.470
and then we'll just do a quick check to make sure it's no

74
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:17.880
and if that's the case we'll toast

75
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.400
tweet sent successfully

76
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.980
and very quickly if it's not

77
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:36.960
we'll send a text saying tweet failed.

78
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.800
Please try again later.

79
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.070
All right.

80
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.600
And that should do it.

81
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.250
So let's give it a try.

82
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.790
And here we go.

83
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.290
So let's send a tweet again in the original.

84
00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.540
Hi there.

85
00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.390
And it looks like it's been sent successfully.

86
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:10.860
Superbe let's just go over and refresh our past dashboard again we'll need a full screen full page refresh

87
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.940
here and there we go.

88
00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:21.250
There's out tweets and you can see we've got there and we've got the user name of Rob superb.

89
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.970
So that's as far as we wanted to get with this video.

90
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:31.260
We now have the ability to follow unfollow people and send a tweet of course sending a tweet is not

91
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.200
much good unless anyone else can actually read it.

92
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.960
So our final video is going to be putting this together and allowing users to see a list of all the

93
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:45.890
tweets that the people that they're following have said will do that in the next video.
