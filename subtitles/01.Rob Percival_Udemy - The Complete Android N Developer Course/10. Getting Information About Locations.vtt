00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.460
Just before we make our hiker's watch there is one technique that we're going to need that we haven't

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.850
covered yet and that is working out a user's address from their location.

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.460
This is known as reverse geocoding geocoding itself being the process of going from an address to a

4
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.840
pair of coordinates.

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.810
And we're going the other way.

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.620
So we're going to be reverse geocoding here.

7
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.150
It's pretty easy today and I'm going to set it up just here in the on location changed of our location

8
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.570
listener.

9
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.770
So we're going to create a geocoder which we'll call geocoder.

10
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:49.080
And this is going to be a new geocoder and we need a context so we can use the application context for

11
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:59.370
this because we're doing it in the context of the application and then we need a locale which is a format

12
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.790
for the address.

13
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.760
So if we talk locality you can say we've got a range of different options that we can take then.

14
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.780
So as addresses take different formats in different parts of the world in different parts of the world

15
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:24.610
we can choose which one we want or we can just use get default to use the locale of the user which is

16
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.360
usually what we're going to want to do.

17
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.090
And now we're going to create a list and this is going to be a list of addresses.

18
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:48.990
We want the Android location address that and also put the list class and Ah-Q this list addresses.

19
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:59.880
And we're going to get the addresses from our geocoder and again to get them from a location so we can

20
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.750
use any location we like here.

21
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.110
But we want to use the user's current location.

22
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:16.920
So we're going to use location don't get latitude and location don't get long edgy.

23
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.140
And then we need to specify how many results we want.

24
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.310
You can see this is a list.

25
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.470
So it may well be the case that this returns more than one address.

26
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.200
Usually we are only interested in one of the addresses so we'll just go for one and you can see we've

27
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.200
still got an error here.

28
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.360
That's because there's a chance that this will fail so we'll surrounded by try and catch just in case

29
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.540
if there are no addresses or if this isn't a valid latitude longitude for example and this will fail.

30
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.170
So that's what our try and catch is for.

31
00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.590
So then we'll do a check to see if we've got something back.

32
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:09.570
So I will check for list addresses not being No.

33
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.650
And also taking that we've actually got a value.

34
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.390
So we'll look for addresses dot sites and check that that is greater than zero or

35
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.350
so we need to do this check first because if left addresses is no then trying to find the size of it

36
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.180
it will give us an error.

37
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.890
So we're checking first that it's not now and then that we have a value returned in it.

38
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:47.220
And then if we do we'll just lock that to the Lokes

39
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.210
or call it place info and then just take a quick look.

40
00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.280
So this is list addresses and then we want to get the first item in the array which will be the only

41
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.190
item in the array because we specified that we only wanted one address returned.

42
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.400
So we'll get zero.

43
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:16.190
And then if we have a low key you can see it knows what type it is say right there all the different

44
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.390
addressed bits and pieces that we could use if we wanted.

45
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.650
For now I'll just put the whole thing to a string and we'll take a look and see what it looks like.

46
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.840
OK.

47
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.690
So it's as simple as that.

48
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:39.510
While that's running I'll just find a location.

49
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:49.710
So I want to put in a latitude and longitude that will actually give me an address so I'll just look

50
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.740
for a place in London and they began.

51
00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:02.340
In fact I've got a pair of coordinates right there so we'll use those.

52
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.910
I'm sure that they will give me a valid address

53
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.330
can say over to our

54
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:18.670
emulates the

55
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.450
put these in and they should restart.

56
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.990
There we go.

57
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.330
And then we'll click send.

58
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.050
That should take us to London on the map.

59
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.840
As well as

60
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.930
showing us the address in the logs.

61
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.700
And there we go.

62
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:49.890
So now just about in London and let's have a look in Andheri studio Lokes.

63
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.590
There we go.

64
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.760
So we've got all that address info.

65
00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.770
Right.

66
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.130
So let's just change the location slightly.

67
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.690
So if we change the latitude 52 you for example just to see another address

68
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.360
and there we go.

69
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.610
So now I've got a quick challenge for you to extend this.

70
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:24.720
Can you take the information from the address and display it in the app as a toast in a nice address

71
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.490
format.

72
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:32.390
Street number street name town county or state if possible postcode zip code and then country.

73
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:44.570
So all the information that we would put on a standard address over at.

74
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:45.370
All right.

75
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.820
How would you manage that.

76
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:56.620
I'm just going to change the latitudes once more to give us as clear as possible an idea of how the

77
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.390
address is returned.

78
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:05.230
So here you can see we've got the address lines that we can use and we've also got the feature which

79
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.950
is essentially the number on the road.

80
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.300
And then we've got the admin area submarine sub admin area.

81
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.340
Those are now pretty much all of the addresses we've looked at so far so I'm more or less going to ignore

82
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.200
those.

83
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:26.140
And we've got a locality or town the thoroughfare which is the road name and then postal code or zip

84
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.390
code and then Country Code country name.

85
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.050
So let's see if we can create a string containing all of those

86
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:47.550
as we saw before we can use list addresses get there and then

87
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:55.000
we can use get to get any of these features.

88
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.880
So is dancing with the number.

89
00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:58.970
The vote number.

90
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:08.970
You'll notice that the thoroughfare is the name and the road number is actually the sub thoroughfare.

91
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:19.570
So I will start with that and we'll create a string for our address which will initially be an empty

92
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:24.310
string and then I'm going to check to see if

93
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.590
my sub theraphy is not.

94
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.810
No.

95
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.350
Then we'll add it to the string.

96
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:47.420
So address plus equals and then I'll just copy and paste that

97
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:55.190
and then we'll want a space at the end of that.

98
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.950
So that will take address and append the sub thoroughfare to it.

99
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:10.860
We want to do the same thing for the thoroughfare itself.

100
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.180
Down there somewhere.

101
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.820
So I would check to make sure that that's not now.

102
00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.960
Otherwise we could have problems if we try and add it to our address

103
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.740
and we go

104
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.150
and then we'll put

105
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.870
a coma and the space at the end of that.

106
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.620
And now I think you get the idea so I'll copy and paste that.

107
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.940
This time we won't the town so the locality

108
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:02.440
we go.

109
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:14.600
And again we'll have a comma and a space at the end of that one and then we'll gets the postal code

110
00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:16.860
again.

111
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.510
If there is one

112
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.710
and finally get the country

113
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:34.230
and I'll use the country name slightly friendlier than the code.

114
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:41.510
And this time we don't need a comma at the end.

115
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:42.190
All right.

116
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:54.160
So let's now just create outpost using create a new text and we'll use the address string and they will

117
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.380
show it.

118
00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:58.160
All right.

119
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:07.140
So let's see that in action we now should get the address and the log still but more usefully will have

120
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.530
a text showing us the address or at least we will.

121
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:16.120
When I put on my SMB Carol and saying Here we go.

122
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.180
So let's take a look.

123
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:32.050
Change at fifty seven point ninety send that and there's outsized superb.

124
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:40.910
So I hope you manage that and especially bonus marks a few checks that each item within the address

125
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:46.190
was not now before you added it to the address string.

126
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.480
Great.

127
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.330
So now we can do reverse geocoding without Android apps.

128
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.540
It's time to build our hiker's watch.
