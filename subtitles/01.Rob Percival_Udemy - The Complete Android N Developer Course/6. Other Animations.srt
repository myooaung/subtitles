1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,850
The animate method that we used in the previous video is not only good for fades but we can use pretty

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,500
much any type of animation with it.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,370
So in this video we're going to just look at a few different types and we're going to start with translations.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:23,620
So I'm going see just comment out the lines to do with Homer.

5
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:31,790
We haven't actually seen comments officially before but they're very useful ways to entertain your code

6
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,870
to show what your code is doing and that will say quite useful for getting rid of lines of code that

7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,720
you don't necessarily want to delete because you might want to use them later but you're not interested

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,760
in them right now and to create a comment.

9
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:49,760
We just use a double slash like that which is the same as pretty much every programming language out

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,390
there.

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,110
And that comment out the line following the double slash.

12
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:01,400
So let's say we wanted to move part of the screen so from his initial central position just drop him

13
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,660
off the screen using an animation.

14
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:12,500
Well obviously we don't want to fade him out anymore so we'll remove the alpha and then if you put a

15
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:20,290
y here you can see we've got a bunch of different transformations that we can use on y.

16
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,810
Now why is the vertical axis so from top to bottom of the screen.

17
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:32,810
And what we're particularly interested in here is translation y by so translation if you may remember

18
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,820
from your math studies is a movement essentially.

19
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:44,360
So we do it just moving it around the screen and then if we want to move it by a certain number of pixels

20
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,500
then we put those number of pixels in.

21
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:52,190
So if we want to move of the screen probably something like a thousand pixels is going to do a good

22
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,440
job.

23
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,120
Now as I said before we should clarify that this is a.

24
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,970
Even though it's a bit like an integer.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,280
So we just put it half on the end just to be very clear that this is a flight.

26
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:09,820
So now instead of fighting it out this is going to translate him down the screen which will essentially

27
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,360
move him off the bottom of the screen.

28
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,630
Let's take a look.

29
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,290
So there is give him a tap and off he goes.

30
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,340
So two seconds off the bottom of the screen.

31
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,080
Fabulous.

32
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,520
So very quick challenge for you.

33
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:32,740
Can you make it so that instead of translating off the bottom of the screen he translates off the left

34
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,540
of the screen.

35
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,480
So off to the left not at the bottom.

36
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:44,250
Good luck.

37
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,260
Did you manage that.

38
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,590
There were two aspects to it.

39
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,620
One of them was the fairly straightforward instead of translation.

40
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:55,400
Why we changed the method name to translation X by

41
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:04,360
get rid of the bits we don't need but we may have anticipated or you may have realized when you run

42
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,770
your app that this is going to move it off to the right.

43
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,070
And I asked to move off to the left.

44
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:15,050
So we just change that to a minus and then a minus moves it to the left or up.

45
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,750
If you're doing a vertical translation.

46
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:23,800
So let's just check make sure that works that should animate Bart off to the left of the screen this

47
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,170
time

48
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,560
again.

49
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,170
So there is an tap on him and he goes to the left.

50
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,350
Brilliant So that's translations moving left right up and down.

51
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:44,030
Another useful thing to do with translations is move an object on to the screen.

52
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,370
When it's initially off the screen so maybe you want to have an object that slides in from the left

53
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,520
or from the top or something like that.

54
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:59,120
The way I would do that would be to initially take your object and move it off screen so we could do

55
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:08,060
that using an animation remember our own create method down here is what happens when the app itself

56
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,370
is actually run.

57
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:17,750
So if I copy that down and copy the image be set up as well.

58
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:24,170
So if I ran this code we'd find that as soon as the app was run but would be animated off the screen

59
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,210
with this generation.

60
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,430
However that's not really exactly what we want.

61
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,560
We don't want an animation to put him on the screen.

62
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,330
We want him to be invisible to the user at the very start.

63
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,810
So what we can do is instead of animating

64
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:51,610
we just use set translation X and that is basically the same as an animation but with a zero animation

65
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,020
times it happens instantly rather than gradually.

66
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:04,090
So if we want to set him of the screen to the left we might use minus 1000 and then have to clarify

67
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,170
that this is a float.

68
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:13,480
And then of course we want to change the animation so that it's 1000 f move him back to the right and

69
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,820
onto the screen.

70
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,410
One issue with the APIs we've got at the moment is that it's not actually going to work because we can't

71
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,990
tap on Bart when he's off the screen.

72
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:31,820
So what I'm going to do is just bring in Houma just a little bit to allow us to tap on him.

73
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,340
So we'll change the

74
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,470
way the alpha T.

75
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:47,440
No point to just so that we can see him there is just about and then we'll change the unclick

76
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,250
to that fate was the name of our method.

77
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,260
So now we can click on either Bart or Homer.

78
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,750
And this time when we run the app Bart will not be there.

79
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,750
Even though he's there in our design view AAP will be initially empty.

80
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:15,460
Oh no it won't be empty it will have faded Homer in there will be say just faded home but not bought.

81
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,210
So there we go.

82
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:21,610
And then if we tap on Homer and Bart animates in fabulous.

83
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,800
Of course you don't need a faded home to get the animation in.

84
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,230
You could have a button or just have it happen automatically however you want to trigger the animation

85
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,600
but that's how you animate something in from off the edge of the screen.

86
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,610
Let's look at some different types of animation.

87
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,500
So let's take rotations for example.

88
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,100
Now I want to get rid of this taking about off the screen.

89
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,130
I'm just going to show you another type of comment.

90
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:58,030
While I do that we can comment blocks of code using slash and then stop and then and comment using start

91
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,210
and then slash.

92
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:05,030
So again very standard almost all programming languages use something very similar to that and that

93
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,760
just allows you to block off the whole of the code in between those two lines.

94
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,870
Rather than doing it line by line.

95
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,390
OK so let's try a rotation

96
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,730
again.

97
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,830
We can just change that and rotation there.

98
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:31,100
So there it is and then all we need to put in the parentheses is the angle that we want to rotate.

99
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,760
So this is in degrees so a 360 would be a full rotation.

100
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:44,010
So let's try a 180 degrees and we'll put an F on again because this is a float so this should be a rotation

101
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:50,300
that turns him upside down because we're rotating half of a full circle in two seconds.

102
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:59,330
Let's take a look.

103
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:06,760
In fact just While that's lading I'll get rid of Homer for future apps because we don't need him now.

104
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,460
The parts on the screen let's take a look.

105
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,510
So there we go.

106
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,610
Lovely.

107
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,300
Just as you as you'd want a nice rotation.

108
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,870
You can experiment with that if you up.

109
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,340
The number of degrees substantially.

110
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,420
Then you can get any kind of spinning around as have a quick look of that.

111
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,320
It's quite good fun so that'll be a lot of circles.

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,170
In two seconds.

113
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:39,680
Then we shouldn't have Heimer any more visible at least here we go.

114
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,590
Hey good fun.

115
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,160
All right.

116
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:42,810
Lovely.

117
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,210
So there's our rotations.

118
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:49,780
The last type of transformation that we're going to look at is shrinking and growing so making something

119
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,070
bigger and smaller.

120
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,150
We do that using scale.

121
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:02,910
So we've got scale x and scale y so let's say we want to shrink him down to half his size.

122
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:14,770
So we'll go for scale x to nought point five and again f and we going to want to scale Y as well.

123
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:19,080
So let's put that M scale Y and 0.5 F..

124
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:24,190
And this also shows you how you can combine a number of different transformations very easily so we

125
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:31,000
could put an alpha in there to change the opacity of rotational value and we can put whatever we like

126
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,520
it and you can combine all those into just a single transformation.

127
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,110
So let's just have a quick look at that.

128
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,960
We should find that Bart animates.

129
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,310
You might want to think about what happens to Bart's position.

130
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,980
Is he going to remain in the center of the screen.

131
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,750
Is he going to move off to one corner.

132
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,260
If you can anticipate what he's going to do.

133
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,500
We go he does indeed remain at the center.

134
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,940
So the center point of the image is maintained.

135
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,320
So that's all the transformations we're going to look at.

136
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:12,780
I'm going to give you a very simple challenge to practice these and that simply is to create an animation

137
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:20,710
using three of the different transformation types that we've seen which results in Bart ending up full

138
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:27,390
screen and positioned as he was initially so he can be as creative as you like go for whatever type

139
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,360
of transformations you want but it has to be at least three.

140
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,510
And Bart has to end up in his original position.

141
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,170
Durford

142
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:42,880
All right.

143
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,100
Hope you had fun with that one.

144
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:58,420
So I'm going to start off by bringing back my code to move around the beginning and I'm going to give

145
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,270
him two translations to start with translation of x.

146
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,070
So off to the left of the screen and that's off to the top of the screen as well.

147
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,850
And then I'm going to bring him in and spin him at the same time.

148
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,070
So let's get rid of those.

149
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:28,280
So my two translations are going to be just put translation ex-spy and I want a thousand f that and

150
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,340
translation y by and a thousand deaths there too.

151
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,830
And finally I want to do the spin.

152
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:48,090
So that's rotation by and then we'll do 3600 degrees which will see him rotating 10 times in that two

153
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:53,130
seconds and you can see it's not that easy to see what's going on here when you've got these really

154
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,040
long lines.

155
00:11:54,180 --> 00:12:02,590
So it's possible to break them into several different lines just by adding line breaks.

156
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,560
And that just makes the code look a lot nicer when you've got these long lines with lots of different

157
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,530
methods in there.

158
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,690
So I'd recommend doing that to keep your code nice and readable.

159
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,510
Now of course has Bart is offscreen.

160
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,200
We're going to need Homer again.

161
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,170
To have something to tap on so I'll give him his Alpher.

162
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,740
No point to just that he's there.

163
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,870
For us to make bot do his spinning and moving.

164
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,150
Great so let's have a look.

165
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,710
That should do what we want.

166
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:49,140
So when it runs we should just see him because Bart's been moved off screen and then when we tap him

167
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,160
that boss should come spinning into the area.

168
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,050
There comes.

169
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,240
Fabulous fantastic.

170
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:04,110
So I hope you manage to come up with something even more exciting than my transformation that we're

171
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:10,980
now going to use our considerable animation skills to make a really quite complicated app a game version

172
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,250
of Kinect for which if you haven't played before.

173
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:19,100
I'll explain the rules in the next one and we're going to make it on our phone screen.

174
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:19,920
So there.
