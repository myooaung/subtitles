1
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.420
All right now you've got android studio installed and set up.

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.270
We're going to dive right in and create our first Android project.

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.790
Once we've done that we'll take a few minutes to familiarize ourselves with the android studio interface

4
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:21.460
and we'll run our project on an Android phone simulator right here in our computer as well.

5
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.480
So lots to cover.

6
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.450
Let's get started.

7
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.700
When you launch Android studio you'll see a menu much like this which is pretty straightforward.

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.940
We're going to be selecting the top option.

9
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.200
Start a new Android studio project So click that one and then you'll see a page like this with just

10
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.380
a few settings for your new project or app.

11
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.820
So I'm going to call the application demo app.

12
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.180
I suggest you do the same if you've not used Android you gave before your company domain will probably

13
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.810
be blank or you may have a suggested one in there.

14
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.890
So I've got Rob Percival dog example dot com here.

15
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.690
It really doesn't matter too much what your company domain is at this point.

16
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.770
I would recommend going for either your name or your company name if you've got one dot com and the

17
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.680
only real importance of the company domain here is that the package name will be created from that company

18
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.410
domain.

19
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.590
So you can say it's created the package name as Colma dot Roper's of 0.10 or app.

20
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.130
So it's just the company domain in reverse.

21
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.800
And then the application name with any spaces or capitals or strange characters removed the package

22
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.940
name is used.

23
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.610
If you're submitting your app to Google Play the unique way of referencing your app so has to be completely

24
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.320
unique but you can change it at any time so if you do discover that someone else has already used a

25
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.150
package name that you've created you can change it later on.

26
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.380
So don't worry too much about this.

27
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.090
And then finally we've got the project location.

28
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.620
You can say it's put the app for me in the default location Android studio projects.

29
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.720
I'm just going to leave it there.

30
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.840
But if you want to change it then you can put it in any folder you like just by clicking the 3.10.

31
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.680
OK.

32
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.050
So far so good.

33
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.620
Click next.

34
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:14.490
Now we have a fairly big decision to make the minimum SDK that our app will support and you can see

35
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:21.120
we've got all the various options right up to Android 7 there and we can choose any one of those.

36
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:30.080
But if you choose Android 7 then your app will only be able to be run on phones running Android 7 which

37
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.350
is as you can see at the time of recording.

38
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.750
Not that many.

39
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.840
You will however be able to use all specific features for Android 7.

40
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:47.060
So my advice are we're making basic projects is to stick with the default API 15 ice cream sandwich

41
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.940
which will run on ninety seven point four percent of devices and will likely include the vast majority

42
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.980
of features that you'll need for your app.

43
00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.040
So choose this one by default and we'll just switch to different versions of the API as and when we're

44
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.760
using specific features.

45
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.190
Feel free to use a different version if you want.

46
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.090
Down here we can choose to support other Android platforms.

47
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.750
We'll be looking at where later on but we won't be looking at TV auto or glass in this course so let's

48
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.150
click next to continue.

49
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.640
And now we're given the option to add an activity to our app now an activity an Android is essentially

50
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.230
a screen and you can see there are several different activities that we can add if we want to.

51
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.430
So we've got a basic activity there with just a back button menu and a plus.

52
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.340
And then we've got an empty activity which is selected by default and then some various other ones which

53
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.100
will be looking at later on in the course which are all fairly self-explanatory.

54
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:53.330
We'll start with the empty activity so select that one and click next and then we can if we want to

55
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.240
customize the name of that activity.

56
00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.890
But the default name main activity is one that you'll see over and over again when developing for Android.

57
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.270
So we'll leave that as the default OK.

58
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.980
Finally we got through all of the settings so just click Finish and it'll take a few moments.

59
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.480
But Android will then create your project.

60
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.530
And here we go.

61
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.990
You'll be presented with a tip of the day if you haven't already turned it off.

62
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.690
Feel free to leave those on there are often quite useful but I'll just switch that off and close that

63
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.510
window and this then is the main Andrew's studio window and this is where we'll be working with the

64
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:37.110
majority of this course looks pretty empty at the moment so let's bring in our project by clicking number

65
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.880
one project at the top left there.

66
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.310
So here you can see we've got two options to choose from.

67
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.600
The first is our app and you can see by the little folder symbol that this is the selection of folders

68
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.750
and files that make up our app.

69
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.610
The second is graded scripts.

70
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.520
How grateful is an open source build tool which essentially is what Android studio uses to build your

71
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.830
app from these folders and files.

72
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.580
If we want to we can add in some scripts to do some custom work in the build process.

73
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.880
We'll be doing that later on in the course but we don't need to do anything with graded scripts right

74
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.500
now.

75
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.930
For now though we'll look into the app folder by clicking the triangle and you can see we've got 3 folders

76
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:19.990
within that.

77
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:26.790
So the first is manifests and in the manifest file we've got a single file which is Android manifest

78
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.220
on SML if we have a quick look at that.

79
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.280
We don't need to worry too much about the code.

80
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.970
All we need at this point is to know that the Android manifest contains some basic details about OB

81
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.290
such as the icon label.

82
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:47.070
So the app name then the app name etc. we'll be editing this later on but for now we'll just leave it

83
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:54.080
as the default at the bottom that we've got our rez folder short for resources.

84
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.820
And this is where we'll be putting things like icons images that we'll use in our app or music that

85
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.590
OP needs.

86
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:07.220
Finally then the middle fold at Java is where the real meat of our app lies.

87
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:14.850
And specifically we're going to ignore the two test folders for the moment and in that first folder

88
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.790
where Percival that demo app will click on main activity.

89
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.090
And this is the main file where code for our app is run.

90
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.070
So this is your first taste of Java and it looks quite scary.

91
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.490
But don't worry it'll be second nature in just a few years time we'll have a quick summary of what's

92
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.290
going on here.

93
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:39.690
Essentially we're defining the package which is just the calm run Percival that there are app then if

94
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:46.710
we click on the 3.10 you can see we're importing two classes or essentially bundles of code that will

95
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.130
allow app to work.

96
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.950
We'll be importing many more classes later on the course but for now we've just got the default to the

97
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:58.730
first is app compact activity compatible for compatibility.

98
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.560
And essentially this makes sure that our app is backwardly compatible with as many older versions of

99
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.010
Android as possible.

100
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.250
And then we've just got the operating system bundle which allows us to work with the Android operating

101
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:11.950
system.

102
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:18.570
And then finally here we're creating a class called main activity which will allow us to work with the

103
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.540
activity that we created to remember the screen will display to users.

104
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.870
Now I'm not going to go into this code in more detail right now but we will be covering it extensively

105
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:28.380
later on.

106
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.720
So don't worry about that.

107
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:39.510
For now though we're going to get back to rez and look in the layout folder and you should see activity

108
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.680
underscore main dot SML doubleclick on maps.

109
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.590
And this is where we'll see what our app actually looks like.

110
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.190
And there it is.

111
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:56.760
It looks slightly horrendously complicated but again don't worry we'll break it down in no time at all.

112
00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:04.410
So this SML file is what defines the layout and the look of our activity or the screen that we present

113
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.490
to users.

114
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:11.280
So obviously in the middle we've got our phone and we get a preview of what our app looks like on the

115
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.210
left hand side of this window.

116
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:18.580
We've got various user interface elements that we can drag into our app so we've got some layouts.

117
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:24.510
You get a guide from the little icon as to what they might do and we'll be looking at all of these layouts

118
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:30.440
later on in the course and then we've got what are known as widgets so things like text views to allow

119
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:36.010
display text buttons radio buttons checkboxes switches.

120
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.000
You get the idea Perkis bars.

121
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:48.360
Then underneath that we've got text fields which we can use to get the user to enter some information.

122
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:55.590
We've got containers for things like lists or videos and then we've got various data and time features.

123
00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:05.360
So a date picker and a clock and then we've got some advanced user interface elements like zoom controls

124
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:13.460
we'll be looking at some of these later on and some custom widgets as well if we want to build a completely

125
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.630
customized user interface.

126
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.440
So we'll be looking at those in more detail later on.

127
00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:26.620
For now let's just run on and look at this top here so we can quite easily switch to different devices.

128
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:32.090
So if I wanted to have a more tablet size device I could switch to a Nexus 10 and this would give me

129
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:38.900
a preview of what my app would look like on a tablet and I could also switch to portray it in landscape

130
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.660
mode very easily.

131
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:51.730
I can even change the app theme write them you can see there's many different themes to choose from.

132
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:56.430
I'm going to leave it as the default for now I can switch activities if I want to.

133
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.580
The moment I've got the one so I'll just leave it as that.

134
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:08.360
If we've introduced translations then we can edit those using the world symbol and we can also change

135
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.470
the version of Android that we're previewing with as well.

136
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:18.920
So there's a lot we can do just from the screen and then we've got some zoom options we can refresh

137
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:25.060
and there's some more settings hidden behind the cogwheel there as well.

138
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:31.190
Now we're almost done with our preview just need to look at the component tree up here on the top right.

139
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:37.220
This is a way of looking at all the different elements that make up your activity or your screen for

140
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:37.800
the user.

141
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.460
So at the top level we've got the device screen itself and then within that we've got a relative lay

142
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:47.690
out which essentially means that everything is laid out relative to what's around it.

143
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:53.630
So if I was to add a second text textfield beneath the tiny hello world one then it would be displayed

144
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.460
relative to the first one.

145
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.160
We'll see how that works in more detail in the next video.

146
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:07.540
But our final user interface element that is the text view itself which if I zoom in you know if you

147
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.110
can see says hello world.

148
00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:15.220
And finally then at the bottom we've got properties which will vary depending on what element you've

149
00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:22.960
got selected at any given time and has a huge range of properties that we can use to customize each

150
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.350
individual element.

151
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:29.710
Again we'll look at those in much more detail when we look at the specific user interface element types

152
00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:30.790
in the section.

153
00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:32.210
But that's essentially it.

154
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.680
We've met the two main files that we're going to be working with.

155
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:43.540
That is the main activity the SML file which controls the layout and the main activity java file which

156
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.030
controls what the app actually does.

157
00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:50.730
Later on we'll also be looking at editing the manifest and the grateful scripts.

158
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:56.040
But for now those two files are really the ones you should be concentrating on her rights.

159
00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.710
So our final thing then for this video is to actually see our demo app in action.

160
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:07.060
And we do that by clicking the green play button at the top there.

161
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:14.290
And this will allow us to run our app either on an emulator within our computer or on a android device

162
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.710
attached to our computer by your ISP.

163
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.340
So we're going to go for the emulator here and I haven't set up any yet so I'm going to click Create

164
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:29.850
new emulator and now you can choose between a huge range of different devices that service the phones

165
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.700
we can use tablets from when TV devices as well.

166
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:40.450
I'm going to go for the Nexus S simply because the resolution works out well for my screen but you can

167
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:41.960
choose any one of these devices.

168
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.190
It really doesn't matter.

169
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.090
Then click next.

170
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.840
And then we can choose which version of Android device will run.

171
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:54.330
You can see we've got a range of options here from ginger bread to marshmallow.

172
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.430
You'll notice that some of them have got an underscore Sixty-Four the end.

173
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.320
This is because there are 64 bit.

174
00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.780
None of our projects particularly use 64 bit architecture.

175
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.880
So it doesn't matter which one you choose.

176
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:10.000
But I would recommend choosing one with Google API is built in.

177
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.740
This will make things like integrating Google Maps and Google Play.

178
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.590
Much more straightforward.

179
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:21.760
Unfortunately at the time of recording this video there isn't a version of nugget with Google API is

180
00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:22.730
built in.

181
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:26.950
So I'm going to stick with the recommended option of API level 22.

182
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:30.450
And again we'll switch to a different version ASM when we need to.

183
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.570
But you can choose whichever version you like.

184
00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:40.060
I would recommend one with Google API is and then will click next and you can change again the device

185
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.750
name the Android version and the scale.

186
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:49.990
The full orientation you can bring in some hardware optimization on the emulated performance if you

187
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.510
want but I'd leave that as automatic.

188
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:58.490
The device frame is just that little bit of a phone like what we saw earlier on in the app preview.

189
00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.770
I think that looks quite nice.

190
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:00.820
So I'm going to leave it there.

191
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.970
But you can disable it if you want to.

192
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.180
OK.

193
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:13.950
Then click Finish and that will then create your DVD or Android virtual device and I would select use

194
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.770
the same selection for future launches.

195
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:21.170
Just makes it a little bit quicker and saves you having to select it every time and then click OK.

196
00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:27.940
And this will then launch your avi and run your app within it.

197
00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:32.830
It will probably take about half a minute or so depending on your machine.

198
00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:38.920
One advantage of Android studio 2 over the previous version is that the emulators do run a lot faster

199
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:44.150
and are here's my device is currently launching.

200
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.420
You can see we've got a nice set of options down the right.

201
00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.610
Here we can change the orientation

202
00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:59.310
we can take a screen shot we can change the volume and we compress the full Android buttons there as

203
00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:10.580
well if we want to by there we get you we saw the Android homescreen them but here is an app takes a

204
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:15.740
little while to adjust the orientation change.

205
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.550
Let's put it back up

206
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.160
the right way and there we go.

207
00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:29.250
So congratulations you've run your first Android app in the emulator and it doesn't look reasonably

208
00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.540
like was predicted.

209
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:38.810
In the preview that we saw down there.

210
00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:47.110
One final thing to notice is that down at the bottom here we've got loads and loads of logos or information

211
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.470
about things that have happened without app.

212
00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:54.160
This is a very useful area to be getting into when we start building apps and looking for errors or

213
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.910
making sure that our apps are running as we think they are.

214
00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:03.250
But for now really it just tells us that our app is up and running.

215
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.050
So there we go.

216
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:07.330
That's your whirlwind introduction to Android studio.

217
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:12.500
Hopefully you now feel reasonably comfortable with how the software works and in particular the relationship

218
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.560
between these two core files.

219
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:24.230
The SML layout file and the main activity Java code in the next few videos will be focusing on the layout

220
00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:29.830
and we'll be adding some different widgets to our apps and then customizing them starting with the text

221
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.660
view in the next video.

222
00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:32.330
See them.
