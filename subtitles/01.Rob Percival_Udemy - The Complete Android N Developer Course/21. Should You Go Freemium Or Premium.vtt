OK let's discuss should Jugo freemium or premium.

2
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.350
Did you ever notice that most apps in the app stores are free today.

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.890
As for a very strategic reason I assure you.

4
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.070
Trust me all developers want to charge something for all their hard work.

5
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.560
But today it's not the way to go.

6
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:32.620
It is because the app stores make it much easier to promote free apps whereas paid apps never quite

7
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.610
end up ranking well in the App Store search.

8
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:42.470
And most consumers never see the majority of these type of apps Unfortunately they are simply lost in

9
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.100
the sea of millions of apps.

10
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:53.240
I strongly advise you to always make your app free to download especially at launch.

11
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.660
This will only serve to help make your app much more aggressive in the App Store search.

12
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:05.890
Now once you are doing well in the App Store search and receiving a multitude of downloads you should

13
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.270
have in-app purchases as well as some sort of advertising to help monetize your app.

14
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.160
Ok I'll see you in the next lecture.
