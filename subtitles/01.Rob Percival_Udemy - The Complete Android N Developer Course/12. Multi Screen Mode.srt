00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:07,590
One of the big new features added in Android New up is multi window support and this allows your apps

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,080
to run side by side with other apps and even share information with them.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,230
So in this video we're going to see how to enable that in your apps and customize the user experience.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,800
For example setting default and minimum widths for your apps in a split screen mode.

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:31,830
So let's jump right him over to Android studios start a new project and we'll call it a split screen

6
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,240
demo.

7
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:41,830
Next and he will switch to Android 7.

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,320
You don't need a minimum SDK of Android 7 here if you want to support other devices then you can do.

9
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:53,190
And if it is not running Android 7 then any attempt at doing the split screen mode will just fail but

10
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,160
will go for Android 7.

11
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:04,250
The purposes of this demo and then our usual empty activity with main activity here we go.

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:13,660
So we begin in the Android manifest file where we set the attributes that allow us to use the split

13
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:22,670
screen modes and the first one is resizable activity and will set that to be true.

14
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,300
So this will allow your app to use the multi window mode.

15
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:36,920
There's also another mode we can activate within the activity itself called Picture in Picture So if

16
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,530
we enable that as well.

17
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,760
That's ideally used for something like watching a video and then you can have that video appear over

18
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,550
the top of for example a web page.

19
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,960
So once you've been able to both of those you can of course just choose one but you can have picture

20
00:01:50,960 --> 00:02:00,800
in picture without resizable activity being true in the documentation for multi window support it gives

21
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:12,780
the option to add layout instructions here in as well where we can do things like Android default height

22
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,810
and then give it a default height of for example 500 pixels.

23
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,330
We can also set the gravity if we want that to work differently to usual

24
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,120
in split screen mode and we can set

25
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,830
the minimum height and the minimum width to say 300 pixels.

26
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,470
So I'm actually getting a message here saying that the layout element is not allowed here.

27
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,100
So I suspect this has not been officially added yet but you should definitely try that out if you want

28
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,780
to specify the full height of gravity or minimum weight or height.

29
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,660
All right so now we've enabled multi window mode.

30
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:11,530
There are a few things that we can do in code as well so we can call the method is in multi window mode

31
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:20,610
to find out if we're in multi window mode.

32
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,700
We are in

33
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,530
multi window mode so if you want your app to behave differently in multi window mode then you can use

34
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,300
this boolean to detect which measure in and act accordingly.

35
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,470
You can do the same thing for it in picture in picture mode.

36
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,540
So if you are showing video there you might want to reduce the video controls for example.

37
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,890
We can also use the on multi window changed method.

38
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:08,150
And this will be called whenever the mood changes so you can then call one of these to see whether we've

39
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:15,020
gone into or out of multi window mode or into or out of picture in picture mode.

40
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,090
Has Changed.

41
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,240
All right.

42
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,740
So that's pretty much all there is to it.

43
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,450
Actually quite easy to activate in order to test it out.

44
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:41,940
We will need a new DVD and or a virtual device because we'll need one fast running Android and so I'll

45
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:49,130
download the 60 bit version of nigger there and this will then just download and install and enable

46
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,190
us to use that in our virtual device.

47
00:04:52,670 --> 00:05:04,090
And then again I finish and then most select system image next and finish

48
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,580
and then we'll press play to launch that virtual device.

49
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:19,470
And when it's ready will run up on that emulator and TV again we're up and running.

50
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:26,930
So let's now run our app on the new Android 7 device.

51
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,530
And here we go.

52
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:39,010
So to activate our split screen mode we long press on the square but man you can see it turns into a

53
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:47,680
split screen symbol and then we can select from our recent app so I've just used the gallery then if

54
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,600
you haven't used any recent apps then nothing will appear there.

55
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,440
So you just need to use something else like the gallery or the browser.

56
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,010
So if we tap a map

57
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:06,640
simple as that we've now enabled split screen mode with another app we can obviously get rid of split

58
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,500
screen right if we want to just by dragging down from the center.

59
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:11,970
That again

60
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:22,340
that will move us back into a normal full screen mode.

61
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:28,510
All right so that's how you enable and manage multi window mode on your apps.

62
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,790
I hope you enjoy that and in a good way of integrating it into your latest app.
