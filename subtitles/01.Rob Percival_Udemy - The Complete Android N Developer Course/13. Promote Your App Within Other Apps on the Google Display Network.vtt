Now let's talk about promoting your app within other apps on the Google Display network the Google Display

2
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:18.520
network includes over two million publishers sites as well as AdMob 650000 plus active apps

3
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:29.300
promoting apps within other apps is a great way to expand the reach of your campaign outside of the

4
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.880
search network.

5
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:38.300
Since apps are part of the display network you'll need to create a campaign targeting the mobile apps

6
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.730
option within the display network campaign type.

7
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:51.020
You can then choose which types of device models operating systems and carriers you want your ads to

8
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.310
show on.

9
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.980
Once you create your first AD group you'll have to choose which apps you want your app to show in.

10
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:07.850
You can select all available apps only particular app categories or individual apps.

11
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:16.270
These ads will use the same app promotion and which you use for campaigns targeting the search network.

12
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:24.440
You also have the option to use image ads if you choose to use an image and you'll need to have image

13
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:37.160
sizes that are supported by mobile which are the following 320 by 50 or 320 by 480 or 480 by 32 or for

14
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:47.860
80 by 320 or 768 by 10:24 and 10:24 by 768.

15
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.460
