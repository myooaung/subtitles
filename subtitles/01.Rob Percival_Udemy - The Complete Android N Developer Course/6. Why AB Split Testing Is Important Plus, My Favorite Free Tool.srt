A B split testing is a technique.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:11,420
Many people use to see whether version A is better and converting into a download.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:19,110
In our case for an app developer in comparison to Version B you're basically comparing how version A

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,200
does against version B.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:29,680
For example let's say Version A of your app icon has a red border and version B has a blue border through

6
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,180
split testing.

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:38,660
You see the red border converted in to 10 more downloads then version B's blue border.

8
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:47,730
You can do this with everything such as your apt description screen shots video previews names call

9
00:00:47,730 --> 00:01:00,000
to actions colors sizes pricing landing pages headlines a set or the bottom line here is you want to

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,540
test everything so you can increase your downloads and social engagement.

11
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,410
Please no.

12
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:16,860
While testing versions and be your only changing one thing at a time it's also best to split your traffic

13
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,350
to both designs.

14
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:25,900
So 50 percent see version a 50 percent C version be best.

15
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:34,180
Nest is a company that allows you to perform A B split testing for free but you can always upgrade to

16
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,900
allow more apps to be tested.

17
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:45,390
They quote a five point eight percent increase in instillations due to a B splitting.

18
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,290
Anyway take a look at it.

19
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:54,440
It's very necessary you do this to increase your installs and social engagement.

20
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:00,390
