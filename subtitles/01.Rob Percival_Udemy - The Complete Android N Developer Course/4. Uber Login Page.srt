1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:07,350
Now that we've got out into the app set up on pass server it's time to create our logon screen and just

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,960
for variety's sake I'm going to do something a little differently this time with Uber or at least our

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,980
version of Uber.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,580
There's no actual need for a user name and password.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,600
We could consider it more or less a one time use app at least the ridable will come along and access

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,790
the app and then request a new bar and the driver will come and pick them up.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,800
There's no actual need for a username and password there.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,170
Obviously in the real app it is required for things like taking payments and remembering past locations

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:42,570
but to show you that you can have a social app using a cloud service without a log in.

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,440
I thought I'd show you how to do that here.

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,220
So this is the logon page.

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,930
I'd like you to recreate or make something better.

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,570
And we've got our logo at the top there.

14
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,680
And Driver This uses a switch to choose between right and driver.

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:10,260
And then when the user clicks get started it's at the moment just logs were directing as driver or rider.

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:19,040
It also uses the past server anonymous logging which works in a very very similar way to the logging

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,920
that we saw in the instagram section.

18
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,600
So I think you'll be able to figure that out.

19
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,980
But if not of course just follow along with me.

20
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,390
So best of luck if you go here because well

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,500
OK.

22
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,510
As always.

23
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:47,150
Well I'm going to begin by jumping over to Firefox and just quickly getting the uber logo to work with

24
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:50,550
say.

25
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,900
Just search for Uber Lego

26
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,490
for that nice white one that's a reasonable size for us.

27
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,620
Goes without saying that you shouldn't use the overlay.

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:11,370
In any real apps but it's fine if you're just testing things out.

29
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,680
So call it bulgur

30
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:22,360
and then we'll jump back over the Android studio and create a new

31
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,660
drawable directory.

32
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:36,850
And then back over to find our Windows Explorer to find the logo that you've downloaded.

33
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:44,520
So looks like it's lost the extensions so we'll just pop up here and go on the end there and then command

34
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,900
control Control-C to select it over to drawable command or control vi to pasted in.

35
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,950
All right.

36
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,440
Now I have main layout

37
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:09,280
and then we'll get rid of our text VI and we'll build our layout.

38
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,580
So start from the top with our image via

39
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:27,220
And then as we're in 2.2 will automatically pop up with a resource search and then we'll add you back

40
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,960
just like that and again change the height

41
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,350
teepees.

42
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,790
Yeah that was great.

43
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:46,010
OK then we'll bring in our switch to choose between

44
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,260
a driver and a writer.

45
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,330
And let's zoom in a little here.

46
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,350
So I'm going to get rid of the text there.

47
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,810
So I'm going to use two text fields because it's not exactly as if we're switching something on or off.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,560
We're just choosing between two options.

49
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,970
So let's bring in a text view to the right there

50
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,640
and we'll just make sure it's nicely vertically centered every game.

51
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,310
So this is going to be

52
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:35,800
the drive the option and then we'll have another text.

53
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,730
To the left again let's drag it around.

54
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,520
And this is going to be

55
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,170
rider option.

56
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:04,480
Now in order to get those perfectly aligned it would likely be worth having a quick look at the XtremIO

57
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,550
and you can see here we've got a 12 pixel margin to the left of this one and a 14 pixel there.

58
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:24,030
So if I update that to 14 on both sides then we should be nice and symmetrical.

59
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,290
Great.

60
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,370
And then we just need a button

61
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,890
to

62
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,390
allow the user to get started.

63
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,730
So will give this and click method of get started.

64
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,780
And they only use your own interface element we're actually interested in is the switch here.

65
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,260
So I'll call it.

66
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,670
Use a type switch.

67
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,210
There we go.

68
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,200
All right so that's out loud.

69
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:17,020
Let's jump over to Main activity and we're going to want to be doing everything when that button is

70
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,870
clicked.

71
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:33,540
So we'll create a method called get started which will be called by a view button which we'll call you

72
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,610
and find out before we do our test run.

73
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,350
We'll just see if we can get the value of that switch.

74
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,860
So let's create a switch variable

75
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,970
which will link to this switch.

76
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,130
So we'll call it use a type switch.

77
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,220
And this is going to be I switch

78
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:10,340
we'll find it via its ID card or id or use the type switch.

79
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:13,920
And finance.

80
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:27,270
I'll just log switch Valley and the switch value is going to be use a type switch and then we want is

81
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,620
checked

82
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,370
and that's going to need to be converted to a string.

83
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:46,160
So let's Android Judaea suggest that for us and one other small thing as I mentioned I would like to

84
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:51,680
hide the action bar to give this more of a full screen feel.

85
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,700
So let's very quickly do that.

86
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,270
It's actually very easy to do.

87
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:05,600
What we do is get the support action bar and height it

88
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,780
so let's have a look.

89
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,680
We should now have

90
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,380
this lay out.

91
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,530
So our switch in the middle and then

92
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,970
rider and drive are nicely aligned either side of it.

93
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,730
I'll get started button on our logo.

94
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,750
And there we go.

95
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,810
So let's just check

96
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,250
currently the switch value is false.

97
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:45,180
We switch it on it becomes Churi etc..

98
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,890
And you notice the action bar was hidden there sort of got a nice full screen app.

99
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:56,880
The only thing is I think it's a little bit too dense.

100
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,220
So I'm just going to stretch things out a bit.

101
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:09,300
I'm not too worried about design in this course but it's a little bit too scrunched up for my liking.

102
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:16,930
So let's change this to 150 deep.

103
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,050
It's a bit of a big a logo.

104
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:30,530
And then let's move things down a little so it will change the margin top to here to 50 driver and right

105
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,550
we'll leave the same.

106
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,300
And then the margin top here will have 50 as well.

107
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:43,070
Might be slightly too much.

108
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:49,360
We'll make it 40 and 40 and we can live with that.

109
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:56,030
Exham So now we need to do the work on pass to set up our user.

110
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,640
As I mentioned we're going to be using anonymous users this time.

111
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:04,120
So let's start by checking to see whether or not the users logged in

112
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:13,350
so we use past user don't get current user if that's no

113
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,120
more try and lock the user in.

114
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:27,990
And we do this using pass anonymous utilities so utilities don't logon

115
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,780
and this is going to have I log in callback as it's anonymous.

116
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,360
We're not sending any details so we'll just do a check to see

117
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,040
if he is no

118
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,430
more log

119
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,130
in five anonymous logon successful

120
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,230
else log

121
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,870
anonymous log in fails.

122
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,440
So let's just check that out.

123
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,430
Ads it's an anonymous slogan.

124
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:28,220
Obviously we're not sending any details and Logan is essentially the same as signing up as well.

125
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,320
So we'll still be saving the users details on our device until they log out.

126
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:38,480
So we won't lose the information about whether they're a driver or rider or whatever their latest ride

127
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:46,050
is but we just saved the use of the hassle of entering a username and password.

128
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,390
So let's get a monitor up and running.

129
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,430
And there we go.

130
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,860
You can see Anonymous Logan successful.

131
00:11:53,530 --> 00:12:04,510
And then just jump over to our data browser and for fresh that we should now see a use of there as well.

132
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:13,150
It's also probably worth switching off automatic user here because we are using anonymous user now which

133
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:21,810
is slightly different to automatic user and also get rid of that code saving the example object.

134
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,770
We don't need that happening every time

135
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,390
OK.

136
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,020
There we go.

137
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:35,900
So here's our user with a randomly generated user name.

138
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:42,870
All right so we are nearly done for this video we just need to save the settings of whether the user

139
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,080
is going to be a rider or a driver.

140
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:50,310
So that will be stored when they get started.

141
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:54,160
Button is pressed.

142
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:06,660
So let's take our past user get the current user and then put and I'll call it rider or driver.

143
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:21,570
And then we want to set it to a driver if the switch is true to the right and the rider.

144
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,370
If it's not

145
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,870
so let's set a string variable

146
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:38,780
use a type to be right by default.

147
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,100
And then if

148
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,170
use a type switch it is checked

149
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,950
then will change.

150
00:13:52,970 --> 00:14:04,970
They use a type 2 driver and then here them we'll just put the user type there.

151
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:12,130
And then of course we're now ready to redirect to the next pager our app which we don't have yet.

152
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,010
So for now I'll just log

153
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,110
in

154
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,820
redirecting as

155
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,970
and then we'll but they use of type in there as well.

156
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,090
And we do also just want a check down here.

157
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,850
If we do have a current user

158
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:46,320
if they've already set up whether they're a rider or driver we don't want to ask them again.

159
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:53,190
So let's check to see if past user

160
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:03,850
get current user don't get and then rider or driver

161
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,760
if that's not now if it's right or driver

162
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:24,320
then we'll do the same thing say in FE and then redirecting as

163
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:39,810
time has passed use a don't get current user don't get rider or driver.

164
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:46,740
So in the next video one of the first things we'll do is create the new activity and will we direct

165
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:53,570
appropriately so the writers will need to be directed to a different activity to the drivers.

166
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,200
OK.

167
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,620
See that in action.

168
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,090
And there we go.

169
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,890
So I just bring up the log so we logged in successfully

170
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:16,630
and then if we click that we're redirecting as writer or redirecting as driver Exham.

171
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:21,220
So that's as far as we're going to go in this video we've got our logon screen all set up in the next

172
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:28,030
video will begin with the right activity which will essentially be a map showing the right location

173
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,000
and giving them the option to call and Oupa.
