1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,680
The final thing we need to learn about before making our notes app.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:10,590
And a very useful technique in general is how to create an alert or kind of pop up window over the existing

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,040
app screen and that's fairly easy today.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:23,680
So we're going to do it with a new project which will be an alert demo usual options.

5
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,340
And here we go.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:34,350
So hungry working in main activity Java and we'll create alert in the uncreate method.

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:41,020
So it's fairly straightforward to set up an alert.

8
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,790
We use a new alert dialog builder

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,800
I'll go for the Android version.

10
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:01,920
The context is this i.e. the main activity and then we set all the options.

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,260
So we might start by setting the icon

12
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:18,860
and we'll use Android resources toward drawable dot and then if we use I see you can see there's a whole

13
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,940
range of icons there depending on what

14
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,470
you're last for.

15
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,440
I'll go for the dialog alert.

16
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,400
So this is just sort of telling them that there is something important to do.

17
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,070
Then we'll set the title of the alert.

18
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,740
So this is going to be one of those confirmation Alas that says Are you sure you want to do this and

19
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,200
then OK or Cancel.

20
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,190
So I set the title to.

21
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,320
Are you sure.

22
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,640
And then we'll set the message.

23
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,250
So this is a bit more information underneath the title.

24
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,740
I'll send that to you definitely want to do this

25
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:11,040
and then we'll set the positive button to have a text of.

26
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,100
Yes.

27
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,690
And then we're going to set an on click listener for this button.

28
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,570
I need to do something when the button is pressed.

29
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,710
This will be a new dialog.

30
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:32,560
Interface and see on click listener is predicted for us there.

31
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:39,430
So when the item is clicked for now we'll do a test

32
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:51,850
saying it's done of course nothing is actually done but that's where we would write code to do whatever

33
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,560
it is that the user has confirmed.

34
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,250
They want us to do.

35
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,510
And then we'll set a negative button.

36
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,200
Which will just say no and we're not going to do anything when the no button is pressed.

37
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,570
So I'm not going to have an on click listener for the negative button.

38
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,460
And then show who we are.

39
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:23,970
I do need to add in no just to say I don't want anything to happen when the no button is pressed.

40
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,870
Other than the dialogue to go away.

41
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,710
All right.

42
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,690
So let's give that a try.

43
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,020
And see what our alert looks like.

44
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,030
And here we go.

45
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:44,170
So there's a nice little pop up and you can see everything else is now darker and clicking elsewhere

46
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,010
makes the alert go away.

47
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,490
And then which is run that again.

48
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:57,500
See what happens when I click the Yes button actually clicking no.

49
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,430
Just make the alert disappear.

50
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,430
And here we go so that we want to do this.

51
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,600
Yes.

52
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,340
And you can see a nice menu.

53
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,420
It's done fantastic So that's how we do alerts.

54
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,980
I'm going to set you a quick challenge now to combine the menu adding skills.

55
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:22,790
The alert dialog build up knowledge and permanent storage going to create a simple language preferences

56
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,040
app which looks like this.

57
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:31,220
So when we first open the app we see an alert dialog asking us what language we'd like.

58
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,070
And then the purpose of the app is really just to save the user's language preference.

59
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:46,490
So if we choose for example Spanish then that is saved permanently and you can see selected there and

60
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:53,590
or just proved to ourselves that that is indeed saved permanently by closing down the app and opening

61
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,480
it up from the app drawer.

62
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,700
It is at the top.

63
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,610
And you can see Spanish has been saved.

64
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:08,370
So we've used the dialog and permanent storage but we've also incorporated the menu.

65
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:13,910
And now if we want to change our language we just tap on a new language and that updates there.

66
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:23,350
And once again just to prove to ourselves it is saving permanently if we open up the app again.

67
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,510
Then it saves that users preference.

68
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,590
So it combines everything we've learned so far in this section.

69
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Time for you to build it for the video and if you go.

70
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,420
Best of luck.

71
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,390
All right.

72
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:50,550
I read that one well I'm going to start by beginning a new project

73
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,240
I'll call it language preferences and all the usual settings.

74
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:09,320
LÃº wise it's going to be very very simple the only item in the

75
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:19,680
main screen of the app will be the text view saying what language we have selected.

76
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:31,560
So first off when the app is run for the first time we want to show an alert to the user to pick a language.

77
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:38,270
So that's one of those in we'll create a new alert dialog builder

78
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,430
around the main activity.

79
00:06:50,570 --> 00:07:05,180
And we'll set the icon that we'll use Android or drawable Heisey and I'll go for Speak Now just for

80
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,220
a bit of variety.

81
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,340
We're talking about language

82
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:25,900
so we'll set the title to choose a language and then we'll set the message to which language would you

83
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,570
like.

84
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:33,590
I do realize it's not ideal to ask the user to choose a language in a particular language.

85
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:40,630
So you might want to add say a Spanish translation here but I'll leave it in English.

86
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:50,130
Keep things simple and then set the positive button which is just the right button to English

87
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,000
and we'll have a new.

88
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:02,990
Let's not and we're going to want to set the language to English here.

89
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:11,030
I think it would be useful to have a method to do that so that we're not duplicating code when we set

90
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,060
it to either English or Spanish.

91
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:27,840
So let's have a method called Set Language which will require a string called language.

92
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:41,140
And for now here we'll just set language to English and then similarly We'll set the negative button

93
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,290
to Spanish with.

94
00:08:47,520 --> 00:09:06,410
I don't like Lessner which will simply set the language to Spanish and then we'll show how a dialogue.

95
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,920
OK so what we want to happen on the set language front.

96
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:16,730
Well two things really we want to save the language permanently and then display that on the text view

97
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,040
in the app.

98
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:18,840
So first of

99
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,530
all use shared preferences

100
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,650
you're familiar with this now.

101
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:47,100
So I put in the package name and context DOT made private and then shared preferences at.

102
00:09:48,760 --> 00:10:00,360
Put string language and we want to set it to the language that has been set.

103
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:00,950
There we go.

104
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,360
So now with saved that permanently.

105
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,910
Next we want to just customize our layout very slightly.

106
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,790
I'll do that in the text VI again for a bit of variety.

107
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,670
So we'll have to set an ID for our text free.

108
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,360
I'll just call it

109
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:33,410
text free and initially I'll have it be empty.

110
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:46,180
And then over in my activity here we'll create a text field called Text VI which is going to be a text

111
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:59,130
view which we get from fine view by id thought Id text V and then will set our text view.

112
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,240
To have a value of

113
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,650
language.

114
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,820
Great.

115
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:15,770
Now I'll just run that to save time later.

116
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,170
You may have noticed the one issue we're going to have is that we don't want this dialog to pop up if

117
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:24,170
they've already set their language so

118
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:33,530
let's restore this from shared preferences and see if there's a value and we'll only display the alert

119
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,580
dialog if there isn't one.

120
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:42,090
So I could create a whole new shared preferences but that seems a little wasteful.

121
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,000
So what L.D.

122
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,880
is create the variable outside

123
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,220
the two methods.

124
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,900
And then I'll set it up in

125
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:07,600
on create and then we'll only need to set it up once

126
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,530
so then we'll create a string

127
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,020
language

128
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:28,000
and this will be equal to the shared preferences get string and the string we want to get is language

129
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:34,890
and the value if there isn't any value set will just be an empty string.

130
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,090
So then we'll test to see if

131
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,850
language is an empty string.

132
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,460
And if it is we'll to supply the dialogue.

133
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,170
All right.

134
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,370
So that should now behave as we want.

135
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,560
Except it won't display the menu part yes.

136
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,050
But let's take a look.

137
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,550
And here we go.

138
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,670
So we have the alert.

139
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:19,750
Excellent English and English is selected prelim.

140
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:26,420
Now one thing I have noticed is if the language isn't empty we should add

141
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,660
the code to update the text.

142
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:41,890
So again let's to avoid duplicating code will define the text view up there.

143
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,270
And then we'll set it up

144
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:57,330
in the create method so it will be accessible from anywhere.

145
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,020
And then

146
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:12,420
we'll just set the text of the text view to the language.

147
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,370
So now if we run the app again you should display the selected language

148
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,110
when the app starts and there we go.

149
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,990
No dialogue this time.

150
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,640
Just the user's preference.

151
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,230
Super.

152
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,450
So now the app is working as we want.

153
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:39,350
Except we want to have the option for the user to change the language later on via the menu.

154
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,410
So let's add in

155
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,020
directory

156
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:58,100
every go and then create a new menu file and call it something else if you like but I'll stick with

157
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:58,730
main menu

158
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:11,520
and then we want to add an item with a title of

159
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,430
English.

160
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,440
Whoops ideally spelled right.

161
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,620
And an ID

162
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,960
of English.

163
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,480
And then

164
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,930
copy and paste that

165
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,770
to give a Spanish option

166
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,480
great.

167
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,850
So now let's just add in

168
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:04,900
our own create options menu code which will require all menu inflator

169
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:20,770
which will call menu inflator and will create it using get menu inflator and then menu inflator inflates.

170
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:30,010
And we want to get the menu using our top menu top main menu and we want to associate that with this

171
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,940
menu.

172
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,540
And finally on options item selected

173
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,880
we want to run that code but not return it.

174
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,330
And then this time or use an if else statement just for variety's sake.

175
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,460
You're very welcome to use the switch is probably a bit neater.

176
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:08,140
So if item darte get item ID is equal to our DOT ID dot English.

177
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:22,890
Then we want to set the language to English.

178
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,530
And that was a capital A

179
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:36,490
and then else if item does get to my day is equal to our ID taught Spanish

180
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,510
will set the language

181
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:50,630
to Spanish this time again for variety's sake.

182
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,420
Return true for this app.

183
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,920
We're not testing what is returns that really doesn't matter.

184
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,310
It's neater in many ways to just return True but if you.

185
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:03,820
You could always return true return true and then return false.

186
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:09,410
If we get to the end of the method right so let's take a look.

187
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:18,350
We should now be able to update the preference with the menu and that of course will be saved permanently.

188
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,330
Here we go.

189
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:26,870
So we've got our menu tap on it will select Spanish.

190
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,150
That's been updated.

191
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,340
That looks good.

192
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:39,730
So let's use a double click to shut it down and this time I'm going to run it from the Android app draw.

193
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,850
So it will scroll down to find language preferences.

194
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:50,010
There it is and you can see the preference has been site wonderful.

195
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,340
So I hope you manage that but combined everything that we've learned in the last three videos they're

196
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,120
now going to build our first big app of this section and that is our notetaking app.
