00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.670
So in the first of these extras we're going to see how you can use Bluetooth with your Android apps

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.280
Bluetooth if you haven't come across it is a very widely used technology to connect phones to phones

3
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.740
and increasingly phones to other things.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.280
So if you want to check it out check out Bluetooth dot com and it's particularly becoming popular with

5
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.730
things like smart homes and smart devices and wearable devices to connect all your devices together.

6
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.910
That's a really useful technology to be able to work with.

7
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.860
And we're going to see how to do everything that you'll need with Bluetooth right here.

8
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:47.340
So let's go into Android studio and create a new project we'll call it Bluetooth demo all the usual

9
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.300
settings.

10
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.230
And finish.

11
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.800
All right.

12
00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:02.250
The main anticlimax of this video I'll warn you in advance is that you can't use Bluetooth at all on

13
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.330
the simulator or the emulator.

14
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.640
So we're not going to be able to actually actively test this.

15
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.800
And for me to show you it's finally working but I am going to create a completely working Bluetooth

16
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.830
app which then you can run on your Android phone and get it working exactly as it is here.

17
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.290
So we'll see all the code but we won't be able to actually test it and see it in action.

18
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.630
All right.

19
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.470
So the first thing that we need to work with Bluetooth is our Bluetooth adapter variable

20
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.220
and we normally call that B-A for obvious reasons.

21
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.410
So we create our Bluetooth adapter variable and that allows us to work with bleaters in the same way

22
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.610
that we use a location manager to work with location.

23
00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.690
OK.

24
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.120
Now the first thing we're going to need to do is check whether the user has bluetooth turned on and

25
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.570
if they don't then attempt to turn it on.

26
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:17.580
So B.A our Bluetooth adapter has a nice method built in called is enabled.

27
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.670
You can see a couple of the other methods that you might want to use later on as well.

28
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.930
And we can use that that's just Boullion so we can test that and say if

29
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.340
it's enabled

30
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.900
then we might do a quick toast to tell the user that it's already on or because we're testing here to

31
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.520
tell us.

32
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.390
So let's do that's

33
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.920
the application context and something like Bluetooth is on

34
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.790
length long.

35
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.580
Sure.

36
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.430
Now you know we've got an error there.

37
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:15.960
That's because we haven't enabled the Bluetooth permission in the manifest but you can see it's just

38
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.260
done that for us now.

39
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.160
And there it is.

40
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.160
OK.

41
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.800
So now we've checked to see if Bluetooth is on if it's not.

42
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.610
We're going to try and turn it on and we actually do that with an intent because we're going beyond

43
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.590
the bounds of this individual app here.

44
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.710
So it will create an intent

45
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.370
which is a new intent and this time we're heading to the bluetooth adapter.

46
00:03:51.770 --> 00:04:00.400
And again loads of different options that you might want to use if you're working with Bluetooth but

47
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.920
the one we want is action request enable.

48
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:12.660
So that will attempt to enable Bluetooth and then we'll stop that activity.

49
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.570
So that will attempt to enable the Bluetooth will then do another check to see if

50
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.500
Bluetooth enabled.

51
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.160
And once again we'll make a toast

52
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.010
and just to clarify the difference we'll say Bluetooth has now been turned on.

53
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.980
So that's a very simple check to see if Bluetooth is on and if it's not attempt to turn it on and then

54
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.510
test again to see if they Tempur successful it could be that there's a problem with bluetooth on the

55
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.750
user's phone or the phone doesn't even have Bluetooth.

56
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:58.390
So you should never assume that Bluetooth is working just because you've requested the adapter to be

57
00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.100
enabled.

58
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.800
OK.

59
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:13.970
We're now going to set up a few different options and to do that we'll have some buttons in SML lÃº file.

60
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.310
So let's get rid of hello world and bring in a few buttons.

61
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.200
So we'll have first off

62
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.220
turn Bluetooth off.

63
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:46.550
Them we'll have another button which looks for discoverable devices.

64
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:59.910
So if you've worked with Bluetooth you've probably done this process of searching for your new earphones

65
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.370
on smartwatch or whatever it is

66
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.600
finding discoverable to discoverable devices.

67
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.580
So we'll see in a minute how to do that.

68
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.640
And then we'll add our third and final button.

69
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:17.190
See

70
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:26.920
a few pad devices.

71
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:38.150
So these are going to be the devices which are already paired with the phone.

72
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.540
And finally we'll just add a list view to allow.

73
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.400
They paired devices to be displayed

74
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.830
we get

75
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.930
that pad devices list.

76
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.510
OK.

77
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:11.260
So once we finished the code for this app you should be able to use this to turn Bluetooth off find

78
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.570
discoverable devices and to view Pead devices as well.

79
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.710
OK.

80
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:25.010
So let's just set up some methods for each of these.

81
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:33.160
First of all turn Bluetooth off and I'm going to do this one by one.

82
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:42.030
So I jump back over to main activity and then create a method.

83
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.780
Turn Bluetooth off of course it's going to be called by the button view

84
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.700
and turning Bluetooth off is actually really really simple.

85
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:58.650
It's B.A dot disable.

86
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.110
Simple as that.

87
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:07.820
And we're going to need to add Bluetooth admin to our Android manifest for that to work as well.

88
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:14.470
So we need the permission to be able to control Bluetooth and then I'll just add a toast

89
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.660
to confirm that.

90
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:25.950
And we should probably do another check just to make sure that it worked.

91
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.810
So if it's still enabled

92
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:47.640
we'll add a toast saying Bluetooth could not be disabled otherwise.

93
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.410
Bluetooth turned off

94
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.460
OK.

95
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:02.820
So that's how you turn off Bluetooth finding discoverable devices.

96
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.280
So it's an online click that's

97
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:23.410
and then will write the code over in main activity say public voyde find discoverable devices called

98
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.300
by V.

99
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:33.840
Now this will actually jump to a different intent again so we'll create an intent.

100
00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:45.130
I which is going to be a new intent and once again we're using Bluetooth adapter and this time we're

101
00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:51.470
looking for action request discoverable.

102
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:55.950
There we go and this will then jump to this screen.

103
00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.900
Again you've probably seen before if you've worked with Android devices and Bluetooth or even Iowa has

104
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.360
it works in a very similar way.

105
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:07.420
This will take you to a screen which will show you the devices which are in a discoverable mode so your

106
00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.820
smart watch or your headphones or whatever.

107
00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.300
And then it will give you an opportunity to pair with them as well.

108
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.820
So you don't need to manage the pairing yourself.

109
00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.790
That's done by the Android operating system.

110
00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:29.000
And then all we need to do there is study activity so that then finds that discoverable devices our

111
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.810
final job is to view the Pead devices.

112
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.030
And this will tell us whether we've been successful with.

113
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:51.220
If we were trying to find and pay with a specific device so we're now viewing pad devices

114
00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.760
that make method for that

115
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.440
and this one is a little more complicated.

116
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.760
We're going to need a set

117
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:17.220
which is very similar to a list it's subtly different and you can have a quick google to see what the

118
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.950
difference is between I set and a list are.

119
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.320
But essentially you can think of it just like a list.

120
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.700
And actually we're going to convert it to an array list in a minute as well.

121
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:35.230
So we'll call our set pad devices and we get that from Bluetooth adapter.

122
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.460
Don't get bonded devices.

123
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:46.170
So bonded is the word that we use in our code as opposed to pad.

124
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:54.670
And then if we want to display those on the table on the history we just need to set up the list.

125
00:11:54.690 --> 00:12:00.160
So that's what it's ideas.

126
00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:01.530
So it will create a list.

127
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.090
We could pad devices list view

128
00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:12.020
this is going to be a list you should pay a capital V

129
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:22.430
fine view by ID card or ID dopehead devices list view.

130
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:29.040
And then we want to use an array adapter to display our information on the list view.

131
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:33.840
We can't do a direct display the information in the set on the list.

132
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:39.100
So we need to convert the set into an array adapter and array lists or

133
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:54.180
so I'll call this pad devices they list and this is going to be a new

134
00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:02.530
array list and then we're going to loop through Pead devices that we've got here and just add them to

135
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:03.660
the list.

136
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:08.260
So we're just essentially converting the set into an array list so that we can use an array adapter

137
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:13.320
to display the information on the list view.

138
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:14.490
So we're going to use

139
00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:25.910
a for loop and we're looking for Bluetooth devices.

140
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.750
So each of these is going to be a bluetooth device and

141
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:43.600
we'll call them Bluetooth device and we're going to get them from our pad devices set.

142
00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.240
So we've done that before.

143
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:51.380
Yes and we're getting this error because we haven't specified the type of data that we want to have

144
00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.700
an hour set.

145
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:58.730
If we just specify that to bluetooth device because we know that that's what's going to be returned

146
00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:06.330
by this get bonded devices method so that should be fine then for each of these devices we want to get

147
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.830
the name and add it to the array list.

148
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:22.620
So if we take our devices array list and add we want to add Bluetooth device darte and I just want to

149
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:30.180
show you some of the information that you can get about these Bluetooth devices Bluetooth class address

150
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:38.160
type et cetera pairing confirmation set pin all sorts of things that you can do with those devices.

151
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:45.760
And the one that we want to do is get the name.

152
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:51.080
So that's going to add the name of the device to how Pead devices are released.

153
00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:57.010
And then we create our array adapter.

154
00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.010
This has been done before.

155
00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.580
I'll call it a read up to.

156
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:16.340
And this is a new adapter using this and familiar Android lay out simple list item one.

157
00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:18.280
And we're getting it from

158
00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.100
pad devices.

159
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:29.630
Frailest.

160
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.620
And then finally we'll take our list view

161
00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:42.350
and set the adapter.

162
00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.740
There we go.

163
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:50.520
So I won't even bother running the app because as I say it won't do anything because we can't run that

164
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:55.890
on the simulator but if you download it from the next lecture or even better write it yourself then

165
00:15:56.190 --> 00:16:03.570
you'll be able to work with at least the basic function of Bluetooth when you run it on a real device.

166
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.850
