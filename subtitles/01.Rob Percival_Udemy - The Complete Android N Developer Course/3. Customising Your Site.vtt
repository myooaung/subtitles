00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:08.100
So so far we've installed WordPress on our Web site and we've also installed the apps theme and we've

2
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.090
got a pretty blank web site that we need to start customizing and putting some content into.

3
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.380
So let's go back over to managed themes and you may have noticed before this customized button here.

4
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.040
So let's start there and add some content of our own.

5
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.650
So first off we can change the site title and the tag line.

6
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.300
We've already done that so I'm going to leave that as is.

7
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.830
You can also upload a site icon.

8
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.750
So if you've got an app like home which you will have if you've made a live app then just upload it

9
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.440
there and that will appear in the browser just there which always looks nice.

10
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.850
We can also add in some menus so I'm not actually going to add a menu here because we don't need one.

11
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.010
But if you want to add several pages on your site then adding a menu there is obviously a great place

12
00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.780
to start.

13
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.230
We can also set whether the front page displays a static page or our latest posts.

14
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.870
We definitely want a static page because we're not creating a blog here we're creating just a static

15
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:20.500
site so we've only got one so I'm going to choose the sample page.

16
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.490
Now we've got some sample content there.

17
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.850
We can edit that later on.

18
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.650
OK.

19
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.620
So I made some basic changes there.

20
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.810
Let's just update that and do a quick refresh just to see that that's actually worked on our live site.

21
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.100
And there it is.

22
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.110
You can see we've got the new content as well.

23
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.990
Now talking about content this theme actually comes with some default content that we can use which

24
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.570
will get us set up much quicker.

25
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.260
So I go back to your apps theme dot zip file and double click on it to open it up and then take a look

26
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.300
inside.

27
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.500
And these are all the files that make up our theme.

28
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:08.050
But I'm particularly interested in here the sample data dot XML file that we've mentioned SML earlier

29
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.880
in the course.

30
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:17.740
It's a form of data storage and so this file just contains the basic data for the theme which allows

31
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.840
us to add in some aspects of the demo here.

32
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:35.230
So we add that by going back to WordPress and then we go down to tools and import.

33
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.770
And this allows to us to import the sample data.

34
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:47.130
We want some WordPress data so I click on WordPress that would require you to install the word press

35
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.650
in Porter plug in but that's pretty straightforward.

36
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.710
Just click the install button and then activate and run importer and that will activate the plug in

37
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.770
and allow us to select our import file.

38
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:11.900
So let's choose the one that we mentioned a moment ago sample data SML and then open that up and click

39
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:20.320
upload file and import and here we can choose to assign the post to an existing user.

40
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.610
We might as well do that.

41
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.020
It doesn't really make much difference but we don't really want this apps admin user created so we'll

42
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.700
just assign them to the user that we created when we set up the site and we want to download an import

43
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:44.620
file attachments as well which should download any images that go with the SML data that we can all

44
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.400
them that's have a refresh now and see how our site looks.

45
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.000
Ha.

46
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.300
Quite a bit better.

47
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.870
So you can see now we've got our screen shot him.

48
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.220
We've also got this content here.

49
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.650
And you can see everything actually rotates nicely.

50
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.590
As I roll my mouse over these images it updates on the fine that.

51
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.350
And with any luck Yep a rotating menu works as well.

52
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.850
So it's a really quite nice interactive site that we've got here.

53
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.610
And we managed to put that together in about 10 minutes which is not too bad.

54
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.240
Obviously we're going to want to customize this content.

55
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.790
So let's get that done.

56
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:41.690
If we get back over to appearance you see there's a theme options link that which is where we can customize

57
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.940
the various options of the theme.

58
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.420
So app name.

59
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.760
I'm just going to put my awesome app and just to see where this is all going to go.

60
00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.390
If I now refresh this page you can see my awesome app is there.

61
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:08.450
Now that's a little bit large So I think I'm going to make that just my app.

62
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.400
So as you're changing this it's a good idea to save the options and then just to refresh that we get

63
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:20.130
that looks fine then obviously we can change the description here.

64
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:33.020
Tell the people why you is right and let's save that and refresh as we get

65
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.900
download link then.

66
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.850
So this is where you would give a link to your app on Google Play.

67
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.230
So I'm just going to find

68
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:53.620
any old app let's just click apps and oh the very hungry caterpillar that's always fun.

69
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.910
So let's assume that this is your app.

70
00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.630
And then we just select that long link at the top there.

71
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.160
Copy it to the clipboard and then pasted in there.

72
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.540
And then we save options and refresh.

73
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:19.240
And now when we click the download button it'll jump to what is not our app but of course if you put

74
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.800
the correct download link in and it will jump to your app OK.

75
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.260
And the last option there is to change the copyright.

76
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.610
So I'll just change that to 2015.

77
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:34.570
Well Percival

78
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:45.390
and then let's refresh that and he said resize the and also when they say that you can see all the way

79
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.880
to the bottom every time.

80
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:54.900
So that's change that Pam wonderful got a few more options as well.

81
00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:02.050
So we can change the color of the site say we've got this pink here is our main theme and we're kind

82
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.790
of kind of pale pink which is that text color I think.

83
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.640
So the link color.

84
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.590
I'm going to leave them as they are.

85
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:15.030
But if you want to play around with them you can just use the color picker there to change them.

86
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.290
Similarly you can upload an image to form the background of the site.

87
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.540
I think it actually looks pretty good as it is.

88
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.350
So I'm going to leave it.

89
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.450
But if you've got a nice big image you want to use as the background.

90
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.370
You can use that and you can see we've got a call to action phrase here.

91
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.770
Get your free download of apps today.

92
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.850
So that's customized that with the Download button and the name of your app.

93
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.090
So I'm going to leave that there.

94
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:56.020
But if you get rid of that you'll see that that disappears and you might want that in your site.

95
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.140
We'll leave that up to you.

96
00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.340
And you've got a few basic fonts to choose from as well.

97
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.300
That's like a quick experiment and see what condiment looks like.

98
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:06.860
Oh yeah.

99
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.750
Quite nice.

100
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.020
All right.

101
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.300
I'll leave it like that.

102
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:11.690
OK.

103
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.030
So this is a free thing you're fairly limited with what options are available to you.

104
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:20.900
But if you want to have more options then find another fame.

105
00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:25.830
As I say quick google for Wordpress themes will give you a huge amount of choice and they're usually

106
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:30.260
around 30 40 dollars for a really good thing with loads of options.

107
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:32.770
All right.

108
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.730
So now we've changed all the theme options.

109
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.260
We want to start editing the content.

110
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.780
So working my way down.

111
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:44.840
I'll start with this slide here and show you how to edit that.

112
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.410
You can see that now we've installed the theme.

113
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:54.540
We've got a slide option appeared on the menu on the left and you can see very simply this is where

114
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.970
all the content for the slider is saved.

115
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.260
So if we click edit on that clean and simple

116
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.610
we can just change that to something like.

117
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.440
This app is really great.

118
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.490
Just try it.

119
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:18.030
Obviously you put something better than that and then you can also upload an image of your own that

120
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.620
I'm just going to update that and then we'll see that reflected there.

121
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.030
There it is.

122
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.490
So that's how you edit the menu.

123
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.380
And that will also edit the screen shots here as well.

124
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.940
So I'm going to keep those as they are.

125
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:41.910
But you might want to upload some screenshots of your app there and then they'll appear in the phone

126
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:50.890
up here as well as in the slider underneath OK.

127
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:56.870
So that's how you change that content that the content underneath this part here.

128
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.100
We can actually edit as well.

129
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:05.070
Now when we uploaded the content I believe it's created a post for us.

130
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.850
So let's have a quick look at the apps WordPress theme.

131
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.270
There it is.

132
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:22.880
So if we just edit that we should see all of the content that we go on the main apps website here.

133
00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.190
So it's all just there for us.

134
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:34.480
And you can edit it right there and you can upload a proper image as well as we saw in the previous

135
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:34.950
video.

136
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:41.470
You could export a nice fancy reflect the image right from Android studio with a screenshot of your

137
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:42.390
app on it.

138
00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:47.500
And definitely we want to obviously get rid of this iPhone picture and replace it with something on

139
00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.840
Android.

140
00:10:48.970 --> 00:11:02.590
So to change that we just need to go back to appearance and customize and you'll remember we changed

141
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:06.840
the static front page to the sample page.

142
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:15.670
So let's change that to your latest posts and that will then show a post rather than a page and because

143
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:20.710
the data is stored in a post that makes life easier for us we could copy that over to a page if we want

144
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:21.250
to.

145
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.890
But it's already there.

146
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.250
So the only issue now is we've got this welcome to WordPress.

147
00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.480
This is your first post appearing there as well.

148
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.650
Let's check to say it does appear on the main site.

149
00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:35.260
We don't want that there.

150
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:46.560
So let's go back over to WordPress and our dashboard and then we'll delete that default post that was

151
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:54.320
created for us if we go back to all posts and then we'll delete.

152
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.300
Hello world.

153
00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.010
We'll put it in the bin.

154
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.680
And now we've just got the one now.

155
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.170
So if we refresh that

156
00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:15.510
we've now lost that bit there and we've now got all the content that we could possibly want.

157
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:16.990
And that's it.

158
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:22.950
So in around 20 minutes we've installed Wordpress and we've created our great looking thing.

159
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:28.940
And we know how to customize it completely to contain our content so all that really would remain here

160
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:34.110
it would be to obviously update the text to tell the user about your app rather than the generic app

161
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.550
and update the images so that they're sharing preferably an Android phone.

162
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.780
But if your phone is available for both then it's not too bad.

163
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:47.850
Having an iPhone there as well and dating it so that your screen shots appear rather than these default

164
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.920
