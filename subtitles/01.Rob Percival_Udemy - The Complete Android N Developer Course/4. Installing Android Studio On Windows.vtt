Android studio is the one piece of software that you need from this course.

2
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.790
It's made by Google and it includes both a development environment and a simulator so that you can actually

3
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.160
see the results of your apps that you've been building right there on your machine.

4
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.880
It's easier than ever to install and doesn't require any extra software to run unlike previous versions

5
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.790
of Android studio.

6
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:31.370
So to get it just go to developer on Android dot com forth slash studio and that will take you to this

7
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:39.500
page where you can click the nice big green download Android studio button so agreed to the terms and

8
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.710
conditions and then click to download.

9
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.470
You can save the downloaded file wherever you like.

10
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.940
I'll just say that here in my downloads folder.

11
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.120
Now it's a pretty big file so depending on your internet speed it might take a little while to download.

12
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.110
So go make yourself a cup of tea and come back when it's done and that's now finished downloading.

13
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.380
So I'm going to find it in my downloads folder and double click on the file that's been downloaded.

14
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.010
This will then run the installation process for you and it should do everything that you need to set

15
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.840
up Android studio.

16
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.670
OK.

17
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.240
So that's now completed.

18
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.830
So we clicked next and then start Android studio

19
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.990
on the scene that you don't have a previous version of your studio if you do just select that first

20
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.210
option and it will import all of your settings from that version.

21
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.570
And then we begin with the wizard that will take us through the setup process to just click next.

22
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.950
And I'd go for the standard option and the default options that will be setting up our virtual devices

23
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.950
ourselves later on so we can leave that unchecked and then click Finish and then we go through the process

24
00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.640
of downloading and installing each of those and then we get now that downloading and set up is completed

25
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.360
and we're welcome to Android studio and ready to start building apps.

26
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.050
Which is exactly what we'll be doing in the next video.
