00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:08,580
All right let's talk about expert app pricing strategies here choosing the right business model plays

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,410
a big part in your app success journey.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,840
There are several models paid fleetly free free with ads.

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,090
And lastly freemium.

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:30,060
The last free with in-app purchases is said to be the most profitable if you choose to go the paid route.

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:37,500
You can always start out free to build up ratings and reviews and then test the waters and say 50 percent

7
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:44,810
off this week only for air launch or particular holiday or Black Friday here in the USA.

8
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:52,970
For those who choose the paid model there are a few circumstances when you can go down to this route

9
00:00:53,370 --> 00:01:00,360
and they are if you have an extremely unique one of a kind that a huge following such as on YouTube

10
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:08,040
or Facebook Twitter or any other social media outlet or when you just dont have an app purchase strategy

11
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,850
viable for your app.

12
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:20,070
The going rate is 99 cents or a dollar ninety nine and 299 for paid apps for both Apple and Android.

13
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:29,010
But it can range anything higher will be a problem unless its a super dynamically unique app that doesnt

14
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,600
have any free or non-free competition.

15
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,190
Obviously games that have hundreds working on it.

16
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,560
That took a year or more to build.

17
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,780
Can ask for a 999 purchase and its from a well-established company.

18
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,370
So even if you choose to go paid.

19
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:57,000
I always start out the first week free to get much needed downloads and reviews to boost your rankings

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,050
and success.

21
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:07,830
Always schedule any price changes to coordinate with your own promotion activities or holidays or special

22
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,260
dates.

23
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:15,600
Always consider temporary price cuts to boost downloads which helps increase your downloads in the hopes

24
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,060
to increase your ranking in reviews.

25
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:28,080
You must do market research on apps in your category to discover the best pricing practices and always

26
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:36,330
offer your users a good deal and that keep it on the low side because asking for that extra dollar may

27
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,480
cost you a few negative reviews that will do more harm than good.

28
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,530
And I'll see you in the next lecture.
