1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:11,670
OK then why well I'm of course going to start with a new project called it people counter and we'll

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,270
be creating it for where devices with a blank where activity

3
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:31,450
and every game I'm going to begin with the round activity and create out lay out that and I'm actually

4
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:41,960
going to keep the halo real world pattern but I'm going to change the text initially to the number zero.

5
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,800
And let's see if we can find a nice big

6
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,550
suitable textile and a quite big enough.

7
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:03,580
I don't think so let's go into full details and make Kerrin text size

8
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,640
twentieths pay.

9
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,740
So I'm going to change that to 40 Yes.

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,220
There we go.

11
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,670
And then I want to add in two buttons.

12
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,800
So we'll have a reset button at the top.

13
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:42,830
And we'll be if your properties to change the ID that back to reset button and the text to reset and

14
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,570
the on click method to reset as well.

15
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,880
And then the other element I want to add in is a button.

16
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,510
This one is going to be in the center and the bottom of the screen and this is going to be the one to

17
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,040
increment the count up.

18
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:11,930
So call it plus one button on click is going to be plus 1 and for the text I would just use plus one

19
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,610
like that.

20
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,620
OK.

21
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,930
So that's the layout for the round activity.

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,030
I'm going to copy

23
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:32,200
those three items in the text VI and then paste them into

24
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:42,060
the rectangular layout but then if we have a look they won't look quite right because of this vertical

25
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,610
layout that we have the linear layout.

26
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,470
So I'm going to change that to a relative layout

27
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,770
and get rid of the orientation.

28
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,360
And then let's have another look and you can see that looks much better.

29
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,980
So now what we said at the top and plus one at the bottom and the number in the middle

30
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,700
OK.

31
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:21,450
So now I have two main activity dog job and in fact we don't need to do anything here.

32
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:30,870
In the on lay out inflata listener everything's going to be in our own methods.

33
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:37,050
So let's create first the plus one method so public void plus one

34
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:47,390
will be called by a view.

35
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,090
And we're going to need a counter variable.

36
00:03:52,470 --> 00:04:02,430
So I'll just call that counter which is initially 0 and plus 1.

37
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:10,720
Well that's going to add one to the counter and then we're going to want to update the label and text

38
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,130
to be

39
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,700
and set the text to counter.

40
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,270
But we're going to need to convert to a string.

41
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:37,360
Count that we get and then

42
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,010
we've got reset

43
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:59,730
which will simply set the counter back to zero and then take out X-Fi And once again set the text to

44
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,230
counter.

45
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,160
I could really just put zero in there as well.

46
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:13,800
And just before we run that we will need to set the integers to strings or integer dot to string

47
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:27,280
for each of those.

48
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,370
And there we go.

49
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:35,010
So we'll run that on the round watch fast and then we'll check that it still looks good and works on

50
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,160
the rectangular watch.

51
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:42,040
Obviously this is a relatively simple app compared to the sort of thing that we're used to building.

52
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,460
But the point is that we can build pretty much anything we want on the watch.

53
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,510
We could also build on the phones or all of the skills and techniques that you've learned so far in

54
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:56,340
the course you'll be able to apply to Android Wear as well.

55
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,630
So let's take a look.

56
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:07,610
Plus one excellence I can count as many people as I like them and then reset sets it back to zero.

57
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,710
So very very simple let's just have a quick check.

58
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:19,750
I'll stop that and run it on the square which emulates.

59
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,620
And here we go.

60
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,580
So again it looks good.

61
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,430
A quick check of functionality and wake it together.

62
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,910
Fantastic So I hope you enjoyed that one.

63
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,940
It should have been fairly straightforward for you in the next few videos.

64
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:38,090
We're going to dive into some of the more specific features starting with cons and then looking at lists

65
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,260
voice input and notifications.

66
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,980
So lots to learn.

67
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,780
I'll see you at.

68
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,290
Working with cards in the next video.
