00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:09.770
OK let's talk about increasing social app engagement strategies hear from the experts.

2
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.380
Oh isn't done quite yet.

3
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.140
What I would like to talk to you about now is your social app engagement.

4
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.860
What do I mean by that.

5
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.170
I want you to picture in your mind.

6
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.030
You just downloaded and installed an app onto your device.

7
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:35.570
It happens to be one of your favorite time killer at the moment now in the App Store sees all and knows

8
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:43.970
all it can tell when you install the app or even how fast it was deleted off your device.

9
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.440
It can tell how often you visit your app and how many minutes you spend with it.

10
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.780
All of this information gets fed back to the app store in question and goes through there a logarithm

11
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.260
for ranking ones app for that particular key word.

12
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:10.430
So let's say your game app is similar to another app that someone else has both of you have the same

13
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:20.060
key word in your app title the same keywords and use of the same keywords in both of your descriptions.

14
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:29.270
Now your competition has more positive reviews hence more people are playing the game map in terms of

15
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.450
minutes or hours.

16
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:38.150
That right there is enough for your competition's app to rank higher than yours.

17
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.200
It's all about the social engagement of your app.

18
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.570
If your app is having crashes or problems your customers are going to delete your app which will lower

19
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:58.340
your rankings for sure and quite possibly lower them even more by leaving poor reviews.

20
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:07.940
The app store takes and collects all this data and comes and comes to how to rank your app against another's

21
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.800
app.

22
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.960
That's how it all works.

23
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.240
Very important to listen carefully to all the feedback you're getting and make those changes in the

24
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.680
next update as fast as possible.

25
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.290
Social signals are your reviews that you receive for your app.

26
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:36.750
Therefore frequency as well as the quality of your reviews get calculated into your apps rank as well.

27
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:46.510
Apple and Google app stores probably won't ever admit to these social signals and app engagement but

28
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.720
is well known in private circles.

29
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.180
It does exist though.

30
00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:00.750
One of my favorite insider tips to increase your social engagement is if your app is a game.

31
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.130
Make sure you have a daily gift every 24 hours to dispense out.

32
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:14.800
This alone will increase your social engagement through the roof ensuring your fans keep coming back

33
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.860
day after day.

34
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:25.630
Now you can offer in-game currency useful items or perhaps a much needed power up or spin the wheel

35
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.520
and when something the player needs to further himself in the game.

36
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:38.140
Perhaps you can use a scratch lottery ticket system offer a free life by having the user watch a video.

37
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:46.770
Let them win something if they match while scratching off 3 or 6 scratch stretchable lottery tickets.

38
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.780
This is a very powerful tool to help increase your daily downloads.

39
00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:01.320
Many games are now incorporating this because they know it lores their fan base back every single day

40
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.680
which helps their game increase in the appstore rankings.

41
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.930
OK I'll see you in the next lecture.
