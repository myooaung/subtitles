00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.280
So as I mentioned at the end of the previous video there are a couple of slight issues relating to the

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.140
keyboard with our logon app and they're worth knowing how to work with.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:17.670
So first off you can see as we're entering the username pressing the enter key essentially moves us

4
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.290
to the password field which is great.

5
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.250
That's what we want.

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.610
But then pressing it again doesn't actually do anything it doesn't attempt the sign up process.

7
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.570
So we're going to make it so pressing that key initiate the sign up or the log in process.

8
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.020
And secondly we're going to enable the user to shut down the keyboard just by tapping elsewhere on the

9
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.400
screen.

10
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.320
And that should just make it up a little bit more friendly to use particularly with people with small

11
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.690
screen sizes.

12
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:58.050
So let's do the first thing first we need a on key listener in our app to listen for the press of the

13
00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.740
key.

14
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.290
And we're going to do that in the on create method and to do that will need to be able to access the

15
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.510
password added text.

16
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.940
So rather than create it twice

17
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.550
just in fact get rid of it from the sign up method.

18
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.970
Find it up there and then set it up in the create method.

19
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.180
And then it will be accessible anywhere.

20
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:53.520
And now we want to take password edit text and set on key listener using this as our context i.e. the

21
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.030
main activity.

22
00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:03.160
Now you can say we've got an error there because we need the on key listener implemented in main activity.

23
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.120
So let's do that and that will create the on key method for us as well.

24
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.490
So it's just another way of doing what we did with on click before so you can see that the main activity

25
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.880
now implements on the listener as well.

26
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.430
So this method will be called every time a key is pressed in the password.

27
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.250
Edit text.

28
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:39.530
And we want to check for that key being the enter key and we can do that using the integer i which will

29
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.590
represent the code of the key that was pressed and we want to see if that's equal to a

30
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.110
key event dot.

31
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.980
CONAN You can see we've got key codes for all the different keys then and we are interested in the enter

32
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.900
key so search.

33
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:09.490
Essentially we're testing there to see if the enter key has been pressed and if it has then we're going

34
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.130
to implement the Sign-Up method.

35
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.080
Now sign up requires a view which is normally the button but it can be any view.

36
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.340
So I'm just going to use the password there because it's not used anywhere.

37
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.670
Well it doesn't matter which few we use.

38
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.290
All right.

39
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.460
So let's give that a try.

40
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:39.380
It should not be the case that when we press enter in the password field it will attempt the sign up

41
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.740
or log in process.

42
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.840
So let's you enter and enter and you can see it's gone through the process already

43
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:05.920
That's try logging in or signing up with a new username and password pressing the enter key that should

44
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.440
have been successful.

45
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.230
Now interestingly we've got an account already exists for that username which it didn't set the sign

46
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.690
up with actually successful.

47
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:22.890
But what's going on there is it's actually submitting the form twice because this own key method is

48
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.380
called not only when a key is pressed but when it's lifted up as well.

49
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.740
So this is essentially being called twice.

50
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:40.950
So to get around that to stop that happening twice We're going to check to see if the key event was

51
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.950
a pressed down.

52
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.700
We can do that using get action.

53
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:54.970
And we want to see if that's equal See care and Dot action down.

54
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.430
So that's an extra little bit that we need to check for to make sure not only that the ticket is being

55
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.240
pressed but it's actually being pressed down rather than released.

56
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:14.930
So let's not give that a try and to answer and that definitely seemed to just happen once.

57
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:22.670
Let's try and sign up with an eye and an eye so you can see that was successful.

58
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.450
But it didn't bring up the message.

59
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.050
And if we do that again it will say counter-weight exists for this username.

60
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.990
So if it's only happening once as we would like.

61
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.520
Great.

62
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.370
So that's the first challenge.

63
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.500
Now I want to make it so that wherever we click on the screen apart from him one of the text fields

64
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:50.200
the keyboard is shut down and we can do that using our own cluelessness.

65
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.560
So we'll need to add a couple of ideas or at least just check for IDs.

66
00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:02.440
So we'll need first of an I.D. for the relative lay out because that represents the backgrounds if they

67
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:11.320
click over there for example they will need to have the relative lay out to have a name like Lessner.

68
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:19.920
So I'll call this background relative lay out and we also need to get the logo and have a way to refer

69
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.620
to that so cool that logo.

70
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:35.140
Image for you that we can.

71
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:41.700
So next we need to add on listeners just like we did over here to the logo in the background.

72
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.470
So let's start with the relative lay out

73
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:59.560
which we add in the same way we do any other user interface element.

74
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:06.430
So we want a relative layout going to find it by its ID card or ID.

75
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.870
Background relative layout.

76
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.950
And similarly the image vi

77
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.860
like image view.

78
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:31.960
This is going to be an image vi from find view of pie ID order of ID start logo image view and then

79
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:40.290
we just set the own recklessness for both of values background relative lay out doors set on click listener

80
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:52.080
managed by this and logo image we set on kids Lisner managed by this as well.

81
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.330
Great.

82
00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:02.900
So now those two user interface elements are going to call the on unclick method as well.

83
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:09.450
Now it's up to you whether you want for example the button and the change sign up mode text view to

84
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:10.880
hide the keyboard.

85
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:19.180
But I'm going say not include those more just include the background and the logo.

86
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:21.510
So let's check for both of those.

87
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:34.920
So we're checking for a view to get ID to our ID background relative layout or if you don't get ID is

88
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:40.620
equal to ID dot logo image view.

89
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:47.070
So those are the case we want to hide the keyboard which is a slightly fiddly thing today but it's only

90
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:49.210
a couple of lines.

91
00:08:49.500 --> 00:09:00.260
So we create a new in put method manager which allows us to manage the method of input I'll call it

92
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.710
input method manager.

93
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:13.100
And this is going to be cast as an input method manager and we're going to get it from the system service

94
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.370
input method.

95
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.750
Service.

96
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:30.800
So that just gets the keyboard for us and then we use input method manager Hyde soft input from window

97
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:43.980
and you can see we need a window token and some flags for settings and we want to use the current window.

98
00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:54.200
So we use get current focus get window token to represent the current window and we don't need any special

99
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.620
settings so we just put a zero there.

100
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.150
And I think I've got to write it up as well.

101
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.930
OK.

102
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.810
So essentially those two lines together shut down the keyboard.

103
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:15.600
If it's up and this will now mean that if we tap on the background or on that logo at the top that it

104
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.480
will close down the keyboard for us.

105
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.540
So let's take a look.

106
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.280
OK let's give this a try.

107
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:31.680
Type in the box brings up the keyboard tapping elsewhere gets rid of it and that will work wherever

108
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.350
we are in terms of added texts.

109
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.910
So feel free to use this one as your starting point for your log in projects.

110
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:48.630
We've now got more advanced keyboard control which just makes the app usage a little bit smoother especially

111
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.590
for those on smaller screens.

112
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.970
OK so now we're going to go back to the main flow of our Instagram app and we're going to start building

113
00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.490
the third screen that the user will see after they've logged in.

114
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.460
And that is the user least.
