1
00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:01.120
All right.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.290
So now you know how to work with buttons and to run some code when that button is clicked.

3
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.340
We're going to allow the user to enter some data and then we're going to get that data in our code and

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.460
do something with it.

5
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.820
In this case display it in the locks.

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.490
So we'll start by adding in our text field.

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.560
So as we saw before we can have various different types of textfield which will bring up different keyboards

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.860
depending on the type of text that we're expecting in that text field.

9
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.000
But I'll just go for a plain text so drag that in.

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.670
I'm going to send it again and put it.

11
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.520
Oh that's gopher slap bang in the middle of the screen and you can see by default it's pretty NEVER

12
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.000
which isn't going to be great for the user entering data.

13
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.340
And that's because we've set the default which is set to wrap the content.

14
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.240
And because it's a textfield it doesn't have any content yet.

15
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.850
So let's change the width to fill parent.

16
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.700
And now it all looks good.

17
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.340
There is one property that I'd like to show you for text fields that's pretty useful.

18
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.820
And that's the hint just here.

19
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.530
And that's where we can do something like

20
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:26.940
maybe use the text enter your name and then see how that interact.

21
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.160
You can see it displays as a hint for the user.

22
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:38.430
But the great thing is when the user taps on the text field then that enter your name text will disappear.

23
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.080
And they'll be able to just enter their name.

24
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.010
They would have to manually delete the text which is already there which would be a pretty bad user

25
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.780
experience.

26
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:56.470
So let's just start typing and you can see that text disappears and actually if we get rid of that then

27
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.910
the hint comes back again.

28
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.100
So that's working well as you can see however on my particular device here.

29
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.170
The center of the screen is where the button is.

30
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.350
So that's a warning to you that allow it can look perfectly good on the simulator it won't necessarily

31
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.760
look good on the user's device.

32
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:24.340
So let's change our text field so that it's actually aligned beneath the button and we can do that just

33
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:33.620
by dragging it around and so now it's aligned below the bottom rather than

34
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.690
behind the button or center.

35
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.210
And you can see that that now looks a lot better.

36
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.420
Great.

37
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.300
So now what we want to do is when the button is pressed.

38
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:58.610
Rather than just saying button pressed in the lugs it also gives us the content of whatever the user

39
00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.540
has entered there.

40
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.450
And that will allow us to do all sorts of powerful things like asking for a username and password asking

41
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.030
for some content to post a tweet or send an email or anything you might do to type in to your phone.

42
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.340
So just before we write that code we're going to need to give the text field an ID.

43
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.480
So I got that just by double clicking on it to double click on the text field and you can see it's already

44
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.970
got a default ID of edits text which is the official name for a text filled with an Android development.

45
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:39.020
I'm going to call it my textfield just to get something a little bit unique in there but you can call

46
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:45.550
it whatever you like as long as it has an ID and that saved great.

47
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:46.490
So now

48
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.860
within our click function code we need to get the contents of that text field and we do that by essentially

49
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.270
creating a variable that represents that text field and allows us to get the content from it.

50
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.380
So as you noticed a moment ago the text field is of a type of edit text.

51
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:22.030
So we're going to create an edit text variable using old enter again to add the added text class and

52
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.840
just like we created a view with a capital V here.

53
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.710
We're creating an edit text with a capital E at the beginning there.

54
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.940
And I'm going to call it my text field.

55
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.700
The variable i used here doesn't have to be the same as the one that I used for the ID but it kind of

56
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.020
makes sense to keep those matching up.

57
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.310
And then we're going to set this equal to.

58
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.700
And now we want to find that textfield.

59
00:04:51.980 --> 00:05:02.460
So we use find view by ID but just press enter there to use the auto product to get that method to find

60
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:11.290
view by id and then all four resources dot ID to get a list of all of the Ids.

61
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:22.560
And then I called it my textfield so that then will search through all the IDs and find the one with

62
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.240
an ID of my text field.

63
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:31.590
So we're almost there but you can see we've got an error and that's because this find the view by id

64
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.940
finds a view but we don't want to view.

65
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:45.120
We want an edit text so we have to convert this view into an edit text and we do that by putting edit

66
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:53.240
text in brackets before our find view by id command.

67
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.560
So let's just summarize what's going on there again.

68
00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:01.230
We're creating an edit text variable using that first command.

69
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:10.970
And it's called My text field and then we're using the Find view by id method to find our view to find

70
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.540
our text field.

71
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:20.630
And we're finding it by its ID using resources or our DOT ID dot and then the ID that we set which was

72
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.720
my text field.

73
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:30.860
And then finally we're converting that from a view to an edit text by putting edit text in parentheses

74
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.790
before the command.

75
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.560
Phew.

76
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.780
So that was quite a lot of them as always we're diving quite deep quite quickly here.

77
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.540
But feel free to go back and listen to that explanation again.

78
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.790
But at the same time also don't worry too much if everything is not completely clear.

79
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.700
We will be looking at this and Java in general in much more detail in the next section.

80
00:06:53.740 --> 00:07:00.650
So I'm now going to change the Loek command to Loga and I'll leave it as info.

81
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:07.840
But this time I want to get the contents of the edit text of the text field.

82
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:22.890
So instead of having that string saying button pressed I'm going to use my text field dot and then I

83
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.400
want to get the text from that text field.

84
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:36.290
So I use the command get text and last of all I want to convert that to a string so that I can display

85
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.110
it in the logs.

86
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:45.000
A string is just a collection of characters just like info or the button pressed that we had before.

87
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:56.470
So that's in we're now creating a variable to link to our added text using find view by id and then

88
00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.420
we're logging under the info tag.

89
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:06.100
My text field get text and 2 strings so we're accessing the text field we're getting the text and we're

90
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.100
converting it to a string.

91
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.490
Phew.

92
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.530
Let's give it a go.

93
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.640
So now I'll put my name in there.

94
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:22.400
I can use the keyboard or type with the software keyboard which is very handy.

95
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.990
And then I'm going to click the button and there we go.

96
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:28.800
That's what we're after.

97
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.670
So we've got info and.

98
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:39.880
And if I wanted to only see that result I could just look for info in the search box then.

99
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:40.690
There we go.

100
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.080
So we're getting closer and closer to true interactivity here.

101
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:49.930
We can now get some information from the user rather than just letting them press a button.

102
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.530
Ok time for you to do something now.

103
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.580
And the app that I want you to create looks like this.

104
00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.950
So it's pretty simple.

105
00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.120
It's essentially a logon page for our app.

106
00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:07.760
So it asks for a username and password.

107
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:16.650
Notice the password has a password type meaning that it displays dots rather than the letters themselves.

108
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:25.340
And then when you click log in the username and password will be displayed in the logs.

109
00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.060
So that's what we're going for a whole new app.

110
00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.080
Best of luck.

111
00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:29.750
Go for it.

112
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:40.490
All right.

113
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.570
BABYLON Well here we go then I'm going to start a new project.

114
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.560
So file new project and this is going to be

115
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:57.030
textfield demo again.

116
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:04.680
Those will all be the defaults and we'll start with an empty activity and leave the activity names as

117
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.760
the default.

118
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:14.880
So as a reminder our aim here is to have to edit texts to text fields one for user name and one for

119
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.230
a password.

120
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:27.660
And then when we press the button both the user name and the password will be displayed in the Lokes.

121
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:28.760
So here we go.

122
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:37.230
I'm going to start by getting to activity main Daltex L.

123
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:38.920
Now you may have seen this message before.

124
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:44.330
Usually it just means that your product is still starting up still being created so they will get it

125
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.960
now looks great.

126
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.550
I'm going to start

127
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.310
by creating my text field so I'm going to get rid of my Hellewell message.

128
00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:10.810
And then we'll have a plain text which I'll just make a little down from the top and I'll change the

129
00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:17.280
width to fill parents and I'll give it a hint.

130
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:21.490
Use a name

131
00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:34.490
and I'll give it an ID of use a name edit text that's exactly what it is.

132
00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:41.560
Ok now I'm going to add a password and bonus marks if you did this.

133
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:48.330
We'll set the password to have a type of password

134
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.720
and the again will fail.

135
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.080
The parents

136
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.430
will change the hint to password.

137
00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:13.570
And change the ID to password and it text.

138
00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:19.900
And I'm going to capitalize that this time because now it's the second word in the name.

139
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.300
Great.

140
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:23.570
OK.

141
00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.400
Now we just need a button

142
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.800
I'm going to drag that in underneath

143
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.920
and I'll change the text.

144
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.200
See logging

145
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:43.700
there we go.

146
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.770
And I'm going to just click run

147
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.240
so I can run it more quickly later.

148
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:55.750
And then while that's compiling I'm going to write my code in main activity.

149
00:12:59.450 --> 00:12:59.810
Right.

150
00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.070
So hopefully you're reasonably comfortable with this now.

151
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.960
We're going to write our code in the main activity class but not in the uncreate method.

152
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:19.650
And we're going to create a public void and

153
00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:30.500
I'm going to call it Logan collect and as I type that I think I remember that I didn't actually add

154
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:36.530
an on click the button which obviously is very important so I'll select a button

155
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:44.280
and then go down an ad in logon click

156
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:47.880
on click

157
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:55.390
OK and log in clicked of course.

158
00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:59.280
It's called by a view that is the button.

159
00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:02.020
So it will create a value to represent that.

160
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:06.130
Not that we actually use it then our use.

161
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:11.120
Enter to add the view class code.

162
00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:18.650
Now I need to get the content of my username and password edit texts.

163
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:31.490
So let's create an edit text using edit text with a capital E to represent my user name at a text and

164
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:35.040
then we're going to use find a view by idea again.

165
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:43.860
And we're going to look in resources dot IDs dot and then I call it something like use and I added text.

166
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.010
There it is.

167
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:48.880
Always use the auto prediction there.

168
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:54.800
Otherwise there's a good chance that your select one or miss type the ID or something and everything

169
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.710
will go horribly wrong.

170
00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:02.400
And of course this returns a view I want it to be an added text.

171
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:08.040
So I put edit text with a capital G in front of it in parentheses.

172
00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:09.980
Excellent.

173
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.110
So now we've got our user name at that text.

174
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.710
Now we just need out password added text

175
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:27.970
so this time I know I'm going to need to turn it into an edit text so I'll add that in first and then

176
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:29.370
find view by ID.

177
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:34.750
And I want results is ID dot password it.

178
00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:35.220
Text

179
00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.090
C-PAP.

180
00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.540
So now I've got those to edit texts.

181
00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.700
I just need to display their values in the logs.

182
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:58.450
So as you logged on I would enter again to add the log class to the import section up here you can see

183
00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.760
we've now got logs we've got view and we've got added text as well.

184
00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:10.590
So I'll use a name as the tag this time and then to get the contents of the username.

185
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:20.040
I use a name added text dot text dot to string and then a semi-colon

186
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.720
and then exactly the same thing for the password.

187
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:39.820
But this time we're going to use password edit text get text dot to string and that's it.

188
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:45.630
Let's see it in action.

189
00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:52.110
So now we should find that when we click the logon button we see the username and password that the

190
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.480
user has entered.

191
00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.930
In the logs.

192
00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:00.230
So here we go.

193
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:09.070
I'll just use Rob as my username and password as my password and you can see that that comes up in dolt's

194
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:14.460
because we selected the password at it text type right thing.

195
00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:15.090
Click log in.

196
00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.170
And there we go.

197
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.020
Just as desired.

198
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:22.260
Username Rob password password.

199
00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:23.700
Excellent.

200
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.340
So were very nearly then out.

201
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:28.980
We've got two of the three crucial steps to true interaction.

202
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:36.410
We can run some code using a button press and we can get some data from the user using edit text.

203
00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:41.370
The last piece of the puzzle is to display some data to the user which we're going to do with something

204
00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.470
called a toast in the next video.

205
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.300
See you there.
