00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:08,310
OK I'd like to discuss expert app screenshots strategies and with a favorite screenshot tool of mine

2
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:17,240
apps screenshots are just as important in the visual description of your app as your app icon.

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:25,430
Believe it or not for those not lucky enough to be featured or noted under new noteworthy then it's

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,060
your screen shots that your user will look at first.

5
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:36,750
After finding you in the app search results the user will base their decision on your first screenshot.

6
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:46,770
99 percent of the time the other 4 screenshots still need to be eye candy and matter but the first is

7
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,040
by far the most important here.

8
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,600
Please get a video.

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,500
No more than 1 minute long showcasing your app and have it next to your app store screen captures.

10
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,880
The video helps to get you more downloads.

11
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:08,410
Notice all the top apps have a video for their potential customers to click on and view.

12
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,620
Why is that.

13
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,950
Well people always love and prefer watching video over static pictures.

14
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:22,980
Screenshots are very important as far as the real estate goes along with your app icon.

15
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:31,460
Now with that being said you need to grab the attention of the potential user first and foremost.

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,400
Then you need to address what exactly makes your app different from your competition.

17
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,220
What makes it stand out in other words.

18
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:49,830
Lastly I want you to include a bonus or a coupon code to give them an incentive to want to download

19
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,750
your app.

20
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,750
That's like your call to action which you always need to do.

21
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,540
Now here are some tips for both Apple and Android.

22
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:09,570
I want you to localize your screen shots then try to add an explanation arrow or tips etc..

23
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:16,180
Always keep it clear and simple though and show what a user can do inside your app.

24
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,030
Highlight your most popular and most needed features here.

25
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,920
Don't bother showcasing splash pages here.

26
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,630
Show the inside of your app.

27
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:39,050
Also convince users that your app is exactly what you're looking for and always split Hastur apps screenshots.

28
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:45,490
