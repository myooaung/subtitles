1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,250
All right it's now time to finally start building our Instagram up and we're going to begin with the

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,230
log in and sign up screen which will look like this.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,370
So it's pretty straightforward in terms of layout.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,830
We've got our Instagram logo at the top.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,390
We've got usernames and passwords filled with nice hints to tell the user what today.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,730
And then we have a sign up button to run the process.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:30,600
I've also added a text view which will switch between Sign up and log in Moat's.

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,410
So it's a nice easy way to display two different modes on one screen.

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,430
And the way it works is the way you would expect if we enter a user name

10
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:49,620
and maybe we don't enter a password then it tells us that the username and password are required.

11
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:58,850
If we do enter a password and attempt to sign up then from now it just looks Sign-Up successful.

12
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,970
So it doesn't go onto a second screen or anything we'll do that later on.

13
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:09,730
But if we try and do something it Arrhenius like sign up with a user name that already exists it will

14
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,780
tell us the message directly from Pos.

15
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:21,400
Similarly with logging in I can log in using a correct username and password and that will give me a

16
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:30,850
logon successful message but if I try and use an incorrect one then I get a message saying invalid username

17
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,700
and password and that's returned directly from pass.

18
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,100
So that's what we're trying to do.

19
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,940
All the knowledge that you need.

20
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,020
We have already covered.

21
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:44,670
So best of luck time to pause the video and give it a shot go for it.

22
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,750
All right.

23
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:07,700
Well I'll begin over an activity maybe direct them out and I'll start by grabbing a nice image to pop

24
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,860
at the top them.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,470
So as always the warning when you're using Google Images If you're just making an app for fun that's

26
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,260
fine.

27
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,490
But if you're using the image in a real app

28
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:30,320
make sure you have the rights to say so so I'm just going to grab the Instagram logo and pick one that

29
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,950
I think will work.

30
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,810
Well have a look.

31
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,510
This one Greg

32
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,220
a thousand by 4 6 4 which is about right.

33
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,930
So save image as.

34
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,350
And I'll just put it that

35
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,110
on the desktop

36
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:06,920
and then find it in find the old Windows Explorer if your windows and just before I add it I'm going

37
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:15,200
to remove the underscore and the hyphen as they can cause problems.

38
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:23,240
Android studio so I'll just call it Instagram logo top PMG and then command control C to copy it and

39
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,410
then back over to Android studio.

40
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:33,940
And if we don't have a drawable folder there we need to add one control click new directory or right

41
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:44,240
click new directory on Windows and then we'll call it drawable and then control or command V to paste

42
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,140
our Instagram logo image in.

43
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,300
Great.

44
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,990
Now we're going to delete our text you.

45
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:58,290
And we're going to drag in an image for you in the usual way.

46
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:05,540
And because we're now running Android studio 2.2 it's going to automatically request an image.

47
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,480
So just start typing Instagram and there it is

48
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,670
so click OK and there we go.

49
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:20,580
So let's just adjust this slightly.

50
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:34,440
So let's just change out with too much parent and then our height or try changing it to say 50 piece

51
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,330
ok maybe a little more 70 deep.

52
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:49,550
We're not really worried about layout here it's the log in and sign up the way I'm most focused on.

53
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,380
OK.

54
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,250
So that will do.

55
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,370
Now let's bring in

56
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,060
our text field.

57
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,420
So we'll start with a plain text one for the username

58
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:10,830
game

59
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,540
I will put the instructions right in there into your user.

60
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,700
And we don't want a default value every day.

61
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,160
And then same for password

62
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:45,150
yeah we'll keep it as text password and enter your password.

63
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,310
OK.

64
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,680
And then finally we'll need a button

65
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,660
which will initially say

66
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:11,300
Sign-Up.

67
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,070
All right.

68
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,330
So that will do for our layout.

69
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:27,290
Now we'll just need to set some IDs so this will be a user name and it's text update that everywhere

70
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:27,950
in

71
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,400
password and it text

72
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,810
update that everywhere and then sign up

73
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:54,670
button with an on click of sign.

74
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,350
All right.

75
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,860
So that all looks good.

76
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,570
Now let's go back over to Main activity and write out code.

77
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:06,530
So essentially we want to run all our code when the sun button is tapped and we want to attempt to sign

78
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,380
the user up using pass.

79
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,620
So let's have a go.

80
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,470
We'll get rid of the code we had before.

81
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,950
And then we'll create a method

82
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,590
which I just remind myself what it was called

83
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,210
Sign up

84
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:43,160
and this of course will be called by a view that is the button which will just call.

85
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:50,150
So we'll need to get the username and password values from the added text Sam

86
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,090
so that's defined dies.

87
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,170
So use a name and it text

88
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,480
and this is going to be an added text.

89
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:15,390
Found by its ID and the ideas Oh Id dot use and I'm at it text

90
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:25,960
and the same for the password at it text.

91
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,510
This is going to be an added text.

92
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:36,640
Find it by its ID ID dot password and it text.

93
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,050
So I'll start by doing a quick check to see if either of those will be blank.

94
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,610
So if

95
00:08:46,660 --> 00:09:00,060
use an added text doc get text doc to string is equal say an empty string or

96
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,610
password at it text.

97
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:13,610
Don't get text dot to string is empty.

98
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,090
Then we'll do a toast

99
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:27,950
username and password required.

100
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,490
If that's not the case then we'll attempt to sign the user up

101
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:42,810
so we'll create a new parse user called up she's going to be a new person on

102
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:00,530
them will set the user name to use a name and it text don't get text dot to string will set the password

103
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:17,970
to password and it text or get text to string then we'll take you to and sign them up in the background

104
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:26,400
with a new sign up Colback and then we'll check to see if

105
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,980
our error is null and if it is for now we'll just log

106
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,530
Sign-Up

107
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,710
successful

108
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:49,540
and if it's not we'll let the user know so toast

109
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,050
creates a new taste.

110
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:04,780
And I'm just going to display the message from the past exception so let's see how we might do that.

111
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,500
So we don't want quite the two string.

112
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:12,380
We saw that before and that gives us a bunch of extra bits of data that we probably don't want to display

113
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,190
to the user.

114
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:19,340
But if we look here I get a message that looks like a very relevant thing.

115
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:25,670
So let's try that out and see if that works.

116
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:35,900
All right so now we should have a working Sign-Up up system that checks for the existence of a username

117
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,000
and password.

118
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:43,760
And if these are entered both then it attempts to sign the user up and if that fails then it will display

119
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,390
a message to the user.

120
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,850
All right let's have a look.

121
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,400
And here we go.

122
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:57,460
So first off let's test what happens if I try and sign up.

123
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,220
And interestingly we get this error here.

124
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,020
The user name cannot be missing or blank.

125
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,780
And I thought I'd leave that error in because it's a very common one that if you want to check a string

126
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,380
is equal to a number string in Java.

127
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,140
You should use match's.

128
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,780
So we use dot matches and then the empty string

129
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,990
just like that.

130
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,810
So if you try to use the double equals that does work in some circumstances.

131
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,800
But here we need to use dot matches and then the empty string.

132
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,010
So let's try that again.

133
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:48,340
Sign up and now we get a username and password are required.

134
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:54,920
So now let's put in a new username and a new password.

135
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:04,290
And click sign up and then let's have a quick look in the logs.

136
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,110
Sign up successful that looks promising.

137
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,340
So now we jump over to the Firefox and have a quick refresh.

138
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,830
We should have a new user.

139
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:21,600
There we go with the right user name in our user class and then we can actually do a test for an error

140
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,830
just by clicking sign up again because now there should already be a user with that username.

141
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,720
Excellent.

142
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,270
So we get a nice error message as well.

143
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,650
Great.

144
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,350
So now sign up system is working fine.

145
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,390
We just need to add the facility to log in as well.

146
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:51,090
And the way I'm going to do that is to add the facility to change this from a sign up form to a log

147
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,210
in form.

148
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:57,240
Now we could do that via a button but then having two buttons that do such different things but looks

149
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,570
similar would be a bit strange.

150
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:08,620
So what I'm going to do is bring in a text view just to the right of the sign up button.

151
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,420
Just scroll around.

152
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,670
There we go like that.

153
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:29,350
And this text FYI is going to have an ID of change sign up mode.

154
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,540
Textfield and the text

155
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:42,160
is going to be or logon

156
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,480
and irrigations is going to move it slightly to the right a little bit away from the button.

157
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,170
You can see it's nicely positioned relative to the button.

158
00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:00,100
The other thing I'm going to do is just change its color a little so it looks like something that you

159
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,640
might click rather than just some text

160
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:15,270
they click on the three dots color and I'll go for that dark blue there.

161
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:17,630
That would get

162
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:27,360
and then get rid of the properties and just copy the ID because only need that.

163
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,820
So we have made a text view interactive before.

164
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:38,020
But if you don't remember how to do it don't worry we do it using the general on click method and to

165
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:55,500
use that we need to implement few dot on click listener and we can now use the general on click method

166
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,830
and this method will now be called when ever there is a tap anywhere on the screen.

167
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,520
And we want to check.

168
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,220
You can see this is going to be called by a view.

169
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,880
We want to check to see if the view was the

170
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:23,990
or logon text view so we can do that by looking at the ID of the view that was tapped.

171
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:35,540
So if you don't get I.D. and see if that's equal to the resources ID thoughts change sign up text textfield

172
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,140
and Finnell let's just log

173
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,690
on the app info

174
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,840
change sign up mode.

175
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:57,610
So just to be sure that that connection is a wired up correctly and that this method is being called.

176
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:06,570
And then just before we run that in the uncreate method we need to add an on click listener to our text

177
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,290
view.

178
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:16,030
So let's create a text view which will call change sign up text me.

179
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:26,560
And this is going to be a text view using find VBIED resources dot ID to change sign up mode text.

180
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:37,680
And then we're going to change sunnat mode text VI and we're going to set an on click listener and the

181
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:46,500
listener is just this I need this activity because this has got this on click method within it.

182
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,790
OK so now we've applied our own click listener to our change sign up mode.

183
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:59,720
Text me and we are checking just to be very sure.

184
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:06,800
Even though the text is the only thing with an on click listener we are still verifying that it is indeed

185
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,470
the text view that's been tapped.

186
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:17,550
So let's have a let.

187
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:26,420
Once this is up and running we're going to change our code so that when the text is tapped it changes

188
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:32,120
sign up to log in and we're going to have a boolean to essentially store the state of the app to tell

189
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,110
us whether we're in sign mode or logging mode.

190
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,220
For now though let's just tap check that that's working.

191
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:44,500
And it is wonderful OK.

192
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,840
So now we'll need our Boullion.

193
00:18:48,840 --> 00:19:02,480
As I mentioned So let's create a boolean variable and I'll call it sign up mode active and initially

194
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,050
we'll set it to be true.

195
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:16,440
OK so now we'll check to see if it's on up mode active is true.

196
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:24,500
In fact we could make that even neater and just use sign mode active itself as it is a billion.

197
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,510
So if it is we want to do a few things

198
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:36,910
first we'll change the sign up button text to logon.

199
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:43,650
So the ID is sign up button.

200
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,530
So let's get that.

201
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:54,710
So we're going to need a button called Sign up button which is going to be a button using find view

202
00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:02,920
by id and then the idea is to ID dot sign up button.

203
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,050
And in fact we're going to need that either way.

204
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,700
So I'm going to define that out here.

205
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:16,860
And while we're defining things we're also going to need this change sign made.

206
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,500
Text V.

207
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:31,380
So actually what alday is o define it out here so we can access it from both locations.

208
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:38,460
And then if the sun is active if we want to change to logon mode.

209
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:46,150
So first we'll set sign up mode active to volts then we'll take our sign up button

210
00:20:49,400 --> 00:21:06,320
and set the text to logon and then we'll change our change sun mode text V and we'll set the text for

211
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,450
that too.

212
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,150
All comma

213
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,460
Sign-Up.

214
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:19,150
So there's three commands combined should changes from sign up mode to logging mode

215
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,850
and if Sun mode is not active then we need to do essentially the opposite of those three.

216
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:34,710
So switch from logging mode to sign up mode so sign up mode active becomes true again

217
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:47,780
when you sign up for the text of the sign up button and or Colmer log in for the text view.

218
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,700
All right.

219
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,250
So let's just check that that that works.

220
00:21:53,490 --> 00:22:00,720
And once we've done that we've only got one thing left to do and that is change our sign up method to

221
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:08,330
check to see whether we're in sign mode or logging mode and sign up or log accordingly.

222
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,300
And here we go.

223
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:13,530
So let's give it a try top day or log in and there we go.

224
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,360
So you can see that switch is nicely for the user.

225
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,450
Now let's do our check over here.

226
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,490
So we're going to want to check for the presence of a user name and password.

227
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:35,160
Either way there's only here that we want to see if we're in Sign-Up mode or not and if we are

228
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:45,800
we'll run our sign up process or if not we'll now write out log in code.

229
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:56,720
So hopefully you remember this past user dot log in in background and then we'll start with the username

230
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:09,690
so that username and it text don't get text talk to stream then the password so password at text doc

231
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:15,370
get text to string and then call back.

232
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,600
So I knew Logan Colback

233
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,160
he would go.

234
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:30,070
So again I'm going to check for the existence of

235
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,910
a user.

236
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,600
And for now

237
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,850
we'll just log log and successful

238
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:58,180
and if that's not the case then we'll do the same as before.

239
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:07,750
So I sent the message of the exception.

240
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,160
All right.

241
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,330
So let's have a look.

242
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:18,630
We should now have a complete sign up or log in system using past server.

243
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:19,640
All right.

244
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,370
So let's try out a Logan first try a blank one.

245
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,040
Excellent.

246
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,050
That is good.

247
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,140
Then we'll try one that won't work.

248
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,450
Log in and a valid username password.

249
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,830
Brilliant.

250
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,310
And now I have to try and remember

251
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,370
what I said.

252
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,520
For my username and password log in.

253
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,320
So it looks like that's worked.

254
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,010
Let's have a look.

255
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,610
In successful.

256
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,360
Wonderful.

257
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,300
So you now have I sign up and logon system that could be used for absolutely any app.

258
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:05,190
So feel free to use this as a basis for any app that you're making that requires a sign up or logging.

259
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:11,690
OK we're now going to divert slightly from our Instagram app and just improve this log in and sign up

260
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,840
set up in a couple of ways.

261
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:20,450
So first I'd like the user to be able to remove this keyboard when they tap elsewhere on the screen

262
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,990
just in case this keyboard hides the logon button.

263
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,320
That means that they wouldn't be able to log in.

264
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:33,920
And secondly I'm going to make it so that when we tap the tick button there it actually attempts the

265
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,630
log in process.

266
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,350
There's more of a natural flow for a log in an app.

267
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,320
We'll see how to do both of those things in the next video.
