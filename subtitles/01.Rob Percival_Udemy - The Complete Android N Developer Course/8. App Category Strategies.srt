Let's talk about app category strategies the app category may be less important than your title or description

2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,170
but that doesn't mean you can pass over it.

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:19,840
Please note that Apple will review your app and check to make sure you choose the best category that

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,340
really matches your app.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,230
If not it will be rejected.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:33,340
Sometimes the choice isn't very obvious so you can add your app to two categories so cycle through all

7
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,010
the different categories and choose the one that really fits your app the best.

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,640
If you're choosing two categories for your app compare the apps that are in the top five of both of

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:53,080
them and choose the group that has less competition and make that your primary category.

10
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,560
OK I'll see you in the next lecture.
