WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.660
So the last thing we need to learn about before we build our newsreader app is how to display web content

2
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:14.810
within our apps and we do that using something called a web tv which does exactly what you might expect.

3
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.040
And allows us to display Web sites and other HVM L based content right there within our apps.

4
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.090
So here we go.

5
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:35.690
I'm going to start by creating our wepe in the usual way in our layout so I'm going to scroll down and

6
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.760
find on the containers.

7
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.890
Wepe So let's get rid of the text the

8
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.280
dragging out where you make it full width and height.

9
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.510
I'll give it an idea of where you and that's all the set up that we need.

10
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.370
Or just run it so that we can run it quickly later on.

11
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.110
And then we set up our Wehby in the on create method.

12
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.420
So we'll begin by finding it in the usual way by its ID.

13
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.780
So we'll create a variable called Wehby and we'll find that by its ID

14
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.640
resources ID dot wepe

15
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.540
and we need to cast that see

16
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.220
a web view as well.

17
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.070
And I think I need to capitalize that.

18
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.600
And you capitalized that one as well just to keep everything up to scratch and there's a couple of settings

19
00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:00.870
that we need to customize and the first one I'd recommend doing pretty much every time it's using where

20
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.570
you get settings and then you can see there's a whole range of settings.

21
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.230
Depending on what you're going to be doing with your web view that you might want to adjust that the

22
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.250
one that I'd always choose unless you specifically don't need it is set.

23
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:25.960
Javascript enabled and I would set that true simply because javascript is so widely used on the web

24
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.380
if you don't do this it's likely that any Web sites that you display will display properly.

25
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.830
Of course if you're doing something particularly security conscious so you want to particularly control

26
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.090
what the user is doing then you might not want to do that but in the general case where you just want

27
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.650
to display websites like in our newsreader app then I would turn javascript on and the other setting

28
00:02:47.650 --> 00:03:01.030
that will add is set web view client and will set this as a new web view client.

29
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.090
And this is because on a number of phones if you don't do this then instead of actually displaying it

30
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.690
in your web view it will jump to the devices default browser and display the web site instead.

31
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.910
Which is almost certainly not what you want if you're creating a wepe all rights.

32
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.770
So then we just need to load a r rl

33
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.950
and that can be any you are all you want.

34
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:38.850
So let's go for BWB to Google dot com and that will then load that you are well into that with you.

35
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.590
We're not quite done yet though because we need to ask for a permission here.

36
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.960
And that permission is the internet permission.

37
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.380
So Android permission to Internet

38
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.840
obviously without that we're not going to be able to display very much of interest.

39
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.590
OK.

40
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.790
So that's all there is to it.

41
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.690
With added out the wave it set javascript enabled.

42
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.120
We've said it as the web client and we've loaded a u r l in it.

43
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.760
So then let's have a look and then we get it.

44
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:25.650
So there's our web with the Google web site displayed it and we can obviously interact with that in

45
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.040
the usual way.

46
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:36.180
One other thing to show you is that as well as loading external you are or else you can also load HVM

47
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.050
l content using load data.

48
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:48.910
So if you know any HDMI you should be able to come up with a basic HDMI web page might look something

49
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.740
like this.

50
00:04:50.770 --> 00:05:00.100
So we define bit of HD m l l tag then begin to define the body of the page.

51
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:10.050
We can do a simple each one Hedda which will say hi there closed the header then start a paragraph

52
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:23.310
saying this is my web site played the paragraph plays the body and then and now its HTML page.

53
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.610
Within it to add a couple of extra variables.

54
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:34.650
The first is the type of data that we're loading in this is IGT M-L data.

55
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:43.560
So we use text slash HGL and then we enter the character encoding that we're using and we're going to

56
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:52.650
use just the different character encoding which is UTF 8 that we get.

57
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.180
So this can be useful in several situations especially if you are a web developer and you want to display

58
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.490
a certain amount of web content to the user that you might want to load data like this.

59
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.970
It's worth noting as well that you can build complete apps in this way using the web view as the basis

60
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:15.500
for the whole lab and then the app itself is written in HCM LCS s and Javascript.

61
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.780
I talk about how to do that in my complete web developer course but we're not going to go into that

62
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:20.180
now.

63
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.830
We don't need it because we can build apps natively.

64
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.950
And they were gay.

65
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.330
So there's now HCM l content which could display anything we like.

66
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.680
All right.

67
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.730
So that's all we need to know about web use.

68
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:39.540
Of course they are going to be what we will use to display our news content to our users in the news

69
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.010
re the app that we're going to build in the next video.
