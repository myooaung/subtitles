00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.340
OK let's talk about ways to getting free press coverage strategy here.

2
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.030
Let's be brutally honest here.

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.860
Bloggers will probably not want to write a review for your app since that's all they do.

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.640
And if your game or app isn't unique you have a better shot at winning the lottery.

5
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.870
So here's a way around all this.

6
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.280
Just come right out and ask if it would be OK to guest post.

7
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:40.090
Instead therefore you would write a guest article with your link to your website or AppStore you are

8
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.010
l.

9
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.980
This way you're getting free traffic and downloads this way.

10
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.060
Now please make sure this blog is involving your apps niche.

11
00:00:52.080 --> 00:01:00.120
Obviously you want the content of your guest article to be similar or relevant to the blogging question

12
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.880
that's important.

13
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:10.020
You should keep posting on several of these high ranking or high page ranking blogs once a month should

14
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.400
be fine.

15
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.630
This will help with your SBO as well.

16
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.500
Stay away from the low traffic or the low page rank blogs as they will wind up hurting your page rank.

17
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.910
This one isn't for everybody but I thought I would throw it in any way you can receive free press coverage

18
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.940
by speaking at events.

19
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.130
Many do this but I know many don't like speaking in front of strangers.

20
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:45.240
Next strategy tip would be to contact just a medium size bloggers and app review sites and stay away

21
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.480
from the big ones as they will not be as hungry as the medium sized ones.

22
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:59.730
Now once you get a medium sized publication or blogger or app reviewers site to do a piece on you then

23
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:08.010
contact the smaller app reviews sites and bloggers as they will be more eager to do a piece on you as

24
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.080
you refer them to your medium size posted review article.

25
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.260
Does that make sense.

26
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:23.580
Lastly you want to come up with at least four or five email subject lines and test them out on your

27
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.270
friends and family first before you start to split.

28
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.100
Test them to see which one gets the higher open rate.

29
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.590
That's important.

30
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:42.180
Also see lecture 2 0 3 on which two words you must use in your email subject line to help increase your

31
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.060
open rates here.

32
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.840
OK I'll see you in the next lecture.
