1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,010
So in this extra we're going to see how to create local notifications.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,540
So you're probably all familiar with notifications appear at the top of the screen somewhere and the

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,330
user can pull them from the top of the screen to Action them in some way.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,260
They're really useful and a great way to get users back to your app and to give them some useful information

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,560
at a useful time.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,470
So let's jump right in and see how we do it.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,730
So with the usual settings

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:43,120
anti-rape I'm going to be working entirely in our main activity file here and entirely and on create

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:43,960
as well.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,080
So this is going to be a very simple app that does nothing but create a notification for the user.

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,180
And then you can integrate that into your apps and create notifications whenever you like.

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,720
So we start off by creating our notification.

13
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,930
Simple as that.

14
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:11,840
And I'll call it notification and we use a new notification builder

15
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,730
and we do it within the application context.

16
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,890
And then we just set all the options that we want.

17
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:33,510
Just like we've done for several other builders over the previous videos and I'm going to set.

18
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:41,090
You can see we can set all sorts of options that I'm just going to set the basic ones.

19
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,730
So we'll start with content title

20
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:57,460
I'll have something in hand like that and then we'll have the content text

21
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,340
where you get a bit more detail.

22
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,380
You get the idea.

23
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:16,480
I'll set a small icon so this will be the icon that appears in the notification tool at the top of the

24
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,100
screen and you can use any image that you like for for this

25
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:30,270
then we're going to set the content intent and you can see this is a new class that we haven't come

26
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,770
across before called pending intent.

27
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,910
So essentially this is the way that we tell our notification what to do if someone taps on it.

28
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:46,620
So let's take a brief break from our notifications and create our pending Instead we'll call it pending

29
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,160
intent.

30
00:04:48,850 --> 00:05:00,410
And we create it using pending intent don't get activity and then we give it a few variables.

31
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,470
First the application context.

32
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:13,530
Next we give it an ID number which is just a way for us to verify which intent or which notification

33
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,770
was tapped on.

34
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,950
So I'm just going to go for one and then we need an intent to actually run.

35
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,660
And finally there are some various Options settings that we can have at the very end that I'm not going

36
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,210
to put through so we'll just put it right.

37
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,520
So let's create this intense

38
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,440
so for us this is just going to be a new intent

39
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:49,910
which is going to happen within the application context and it's just going to jump to main activity.

40
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:50,960
So what we used to

41
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,160
there we go.

42
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,220
So now we've created our pending intent which really just links to our intent.

43
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:06,470
And you can imagine here you might want to add some various variables for the intent so that we know

44
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:13,540
and then we could check when the main activity class is run and that any of those variables were present.

45
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:19,340
And if so then do something like display that particular e-mail that the user tapped on or something

46
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,480
like that.

47
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:26,780
But now we can add our pending intent to our content intent.

48
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:32,970
So that means that when they use the taps on the content of this notification that means they the pending

49
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,240
in time will be run and the pending intent really.

50
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,830
As far as we're concerned just returns this I.D. and runs.

51
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:44,660
The intent here which opens the main activity class

52
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,420
OK we can have some buttons as well.

53
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,800
And for those we need to give an image.

54
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:04,770
So I'm just going to use I built him one from Android or drawable and then you could use any one of

55
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,630
these.

56
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:15,270
So I'll just use the chapt on them and then we give it the name of the we want to appear on the button

57
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,650
and then we give it another pending intent.

58
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,260
So in my case I'm just going to use the same pending intent as before.

59
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,410
But you'd probably want to set up a different pending intent either connected to a different intent

60
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,000
or that has a different ID or something like that so that you could tell that the users pressed the

61
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,960
chat button rather than just tapped on the notification.

62
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,120
You can add a couple of more actions there if you like but the final setting that I'm going to add is

63
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:50,810
the icon and we do that with set small icon.

64
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:56,090
And again I'll just pick a more or less random icon

65
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,230
that go for the app.

66
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,130
I come back

67
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,580
and finally then we build it.

68
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,190
So now we've got our notification.

69
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:21,880
We need to do is display it and we do that using the notification manager.

70
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,970
So we'll create one of those.

71
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:37,400
And this is going to be cast to a notification manager but we'll get it from the system service as we've

72
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,750
used a couple of times before.

73
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,600
And then we want the notification service

74
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:54,220
and then we simply display the notification so notification manager to notify.

75
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,930
And again we've got an ID number.

76
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:57,810
I'll just put a one again.

77
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:06,340
It doesn't need to be the same as that ID but just some number that allows you to refer to it or identify

78
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,610
it later on.

79
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:14,950
And then the name the notification that we want to display and that's it.

80
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,370
So let's run that.

81
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:25,240
We should now find that as soon as it runs we get a notification in the notification bar telling me

82
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,130
that my lunch is ready.

83
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,000
Let's take a look.

84
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,060
You can see it already actually.

85
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,480
So that's a little Android.

86
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:44,140
And if we come down you can see we get lunches ready getting cold.

87
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:49,530
And we can tap that button to chat and if we tap it it'll go straight back into our notifications demo.

88
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:59,760
Just like that we can all say swipe down to remove the notification

89
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,860
like that just in the usual way.

90
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,230
So that's it.

91
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,240
Simple as that.

92
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,780
Obviously you can then program your app to create these notifications whenever you want but this is

93
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:20,830
your basic code which will allow you to create a local notification and allow the user to do some actions

94
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:25,960
depending on how they might want to respond to that notification in the next lecture.

95
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:32,290
We'll see how to do remote notifications using pass which you can integrate into your social apps like

96
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,360
chat apps et cetera.

97
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,260
So you're then.
