1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,200
All right we're pretty close now.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:09,870
So we can obviously see the user list and follow and unfollow individuals and we can also post tweets

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,260
using the tweet dialogue that we've created.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:18,790
So our final challenge is to allow users to view their Twitter feed.

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:27,040
All of the posts of the people that they're following so will need a new activity to do that.

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:35,660
They will go for a good old empty activity and give it a better name this time.

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,650
So I'll call it feed.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,210
And again this is going to have a fairly simple lay out.

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,390
We're just going to use a list of the

10
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,950
and this one are called feed list.

11
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,480
But this time we're actually going to use both the item and the sub item for the first time.

12
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,030
So we're going to have the item being the tweet and then the sub item being the person who did the tweeting.

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,220
So let's see how we do that.

14
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,310
It is something we haven't done before so we'll create

15
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,290
our list view and that's feed a list fee

16
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,200
and it's a list fee.

17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:44,440
Finding it by its id our ID don't feed you.

18
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,590
And now the data for our list you can't just be a simple frailest this time because we're having two

19
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:56,660
pieces of information by the content of the tweet and the user name of the person who wrote it.

20
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:11,230
So for that we're going to use a list of maps and our map is going to map a string to another string.

21
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:34,210
And I'll call this tweet data and this will be a new list again of maps mapping strings to strings.

22
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,870
So we have seen maps before.

23
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,420
They're like dictionaries in other languages and essentially they allow you to link a particular word.

24
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,140
In this case or string to another string.

25
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:50,930
So to set this up let's create a simple loop that will create five tweets for us so that we can see

26
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,700
how it works before we connect it to our past server.

27
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,880
So we'll start with an.

28
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:07,740
I less them one will keep going as long as is less than or equal to 5 increment each time.

29
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:23,600
And then for each one we'll create a map string to string which will be our tweet info.

30
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,820
This will be a new Ashmit

31
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,370
again string to string

32
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:44,010
and then we just add our data so tweet info to put and then we'll have the content of the tweet will

33
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,410
be

34
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:55,600
tweet the content and then just to differentiate between them will include the I.

35
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,900
When you talk about that to a string.

36
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:04,770
Say it to Joe at 2 string

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:28,990
I and then similarly for the use of we'll put the user name and that will be user plus integer to string.

38
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:37,350
So that should give us five tweets and then we're going to combine them all into tweet data.

39
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:47,140
So tweet data dart add and then we're going to add tweet info.

40
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,330
There we go.

41
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:57,660
So tweet data now contains five maps which themselves contain some content and a username that we need

42
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,440
to attach them to our list view.

43
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,470
And this time we're not going to use an array adapter.

44
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:11,580
We're going to use a slightly more complicated but ironically named simple adapter which is fairly simple

45
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,120
but it's more complicated than an array adapter.

46
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,270
So let's call it simple adapter and we set it up in much the same way as before.

47
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,880
So a new simple adapter using this as the context.

48
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,520
And then we use our list as you can see there.

49
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:36,330
So that's going to be our tweaked data and then we get the lay out.

50
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:43,260
So we're used to using Android to lay out a simple list item one

51
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:52,650
but this time we're going to use simple list items too because it allows us to have two different bits

52
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:58,310
of text and then we're going to create an array

53
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:08,260
of strings which is going to contain the names of the objects.

54
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,220
So the content and user name

55
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,260
so that will tell our code where it can access the variables that we want.

56
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:27,390
And then finally we say where we want those two bits of information to go through the content and the

57
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:35,730
user name and we want them to go in the default place i.e. we want the first one to be where item 1

58
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,980
is that and then the second to be where sup.

59
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,690
Item 1 is.

60
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,880
So we create an array

61
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,030
of integers

62
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:56,800
and this is going to be two integers which are essentially the IDs of the locations where we want the

63
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:03,500
tweet content and the user name to go and the IDs of these different options.

64
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:18,230
I that there are Android ID text 1 and Android that are not ID text to

65
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,960
few.

66
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,110
So a rather epic line to set up our simple adapter but hopefully that will make sense.

67
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:37,970
Then all that remains is to take a list view and set the adapter to a simple adaptive.

68
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,660
All right.

69
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,350
So now we should have those two bits of information for each row of our table.

70
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:52,420
Of course we will need to actually get to that location of our app so I'm going to add it to the menu.

71
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,630
I'll play the log out button

72
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,030
so it will have an ID

73
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,120
of

74
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:19,710
the feed and a title of your feet.

75
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:32,070
And then back over to main activity to activity actually and in the Options menu

76
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:45,870
will look to see if I don't get to my data that's the ID of the menu item that's been tapped his ID

77
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:53,500
dot few feet and we just want to jump to that new field activity.

78
00:08:53,690 --> 00:09:04,590
So intent intent is new intent with the application context and feed dot clus

79
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,750
and then start activity

80
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,850
with that intent.

81
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,250
There we go.

82
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,880
So let's take a look.

83
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:24,730
We should now find that we've got this extra menu item that will jump us to our feet and show us on

84
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:32,110
a list view by the content and user name of these five tweets that we've just generated using our that.

85
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:38,510
And if that works all that remains is connecting this up to a Passover query so we actually get the

86
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,760
tweets live from the server.

87
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,490
And here we go.

88
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,010
So let's tap on the menu.

89
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,100
And your feet.

90
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,270
And there we go.

91
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,760
You can see it's created this list that we wanted with the tweet content and then the user underneath

92
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,670
superb.

93
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:10,190
So now all that remains is to change this code to actually get the data from our past server.

94
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:19,010
So we'll do that of course with I-PASS query and this is going to be on pass objects I'll call it query

95
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:32,610
and it's going to be I pass query get query on the tweet Clauss.

96
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:38,180
Now you'll be aware that we only have one tweet so far and that was done by me so we don't want to display

97
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,920
that.

98
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,440
So let's just add a few random tweets

99
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,950
so we will do one by one way around.

100
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,310
So we'll have a high data tweet from Tony

101
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,770
we'll have a tweet from Ralphy

102
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:20,780
saying I like digger's.

103
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:29,580
And then we'll have another one from Tommy just to show that we want to order them by date not by use

104
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,000
of they

105
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:42,560
saying well fitted OK so we should get the most recent at the top so we want what's for dinner.

106
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,160
And then I like digger's and then hide at the bottom.

107
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,490
Of course you could Oriole's different if you like but that's what I'm going to go for.

108
00:11:51,200 --> 00:12:01,850
Say Let's write our query and we want to find where the user name is anything that we are currently

109
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,550
following so we can use

110
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:15,460
the method where contained in and then we're looking for where the user name is contained in the list

111
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,000
of people that our user is following.

112
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:31,440
So that's Parsees dot get Karen user don't get a list and then is following

113
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:45,020
that we want to order it by the date which if you'll remember that given an automatic date creates it

114
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,730
out.

115
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,140
So I'll use that

116
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,580
and then we just set the number that we want and I'll go for 20

117
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:04,510
like that.

118
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,020
All right.

119
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:12,290
Then we run our query I find them background with a new find Colback

120
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:19,590
and then as usual we'll check to see if he is no.

121
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,140
And then if we have some objects

122
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:38,400
and if that's the case we'll loop through the.

123
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:39,880
So for

124
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:50,930
past objects which I'll call tweet in objects.

125
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,390
So for each of those we want to create our tweet data here.

126
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,680
So I'm going to copy this down

127
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,760
because this is more or less what we want to do.

128
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:11,540
Harringay but we only want to create that list once.

129
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:16,920
So let's start by creating that and we don't need that for loop anymore because we're leafing through

130
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,160
all of the tweets on our past server.

131
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,710
So we still want to create the tweet info map each time.

132
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:33,840
And then the content this time is going to be tweets don't get string.

133
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,960
And then the string lets just check what it is it's tweaked

134
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:52,620
and then the user name is Tweet don't get string and use it I there we go.

135
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,080
And then we want to add that to tweet data.

136
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:00,220
And then when we're done we'll create our simple adapter

137
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:11,120
and then we'll update our feed list view and we may just need to update this.

138
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:11,810
T.

139
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,920
Feed this as we're inside a closure here.

140
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:30,160
And the field view I think we need to change to be a final so we can access it in that location as well.

141
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,730
All right let's take a look.

142
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:41,200
So remember if all is working we should see what's for dinner at the top by me and then I like digger's

143
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,120
by Ralphy and then hide that by Tommy as well.

144
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,830
Let's take a look.

145
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,150
And here we go.

146
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,490
So let's jump over to your feet.

147
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,860
And there we go.

148
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,370
That is exactly what we wanted in the right order.

149
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:10,700
I only saw one slight change that I forgot to set the name for the title of the activity so let's just

150
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,950
do that to your feet.

151
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,770
There we go.

152
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:22,440
And of course these are just press back to go back to their user list if they want to exit.

153
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,390
So that takes us to the end of our Twitter app.

154
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,680
I hope you enjoyed making this one.

155
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,750
And as always that you made a good portion of it yourself in the next section.

156
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:36,930
We're going to build a related but different in functionality app and that is a whatsapp clone where

157
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,240
you can message individuals directly.

158
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,720
For now I would take a quick break have a cup of tea and I'll see you at the beginning of the next section.
