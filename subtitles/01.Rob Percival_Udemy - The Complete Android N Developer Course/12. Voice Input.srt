1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:07,660
Of course one of the major difficulties when working with watch or small screen size based apps is input.

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,740
And so if you want your users to be able to input some text into your watch app you're probably going

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,080
to want to use voice.

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,260
And that's actually pretty easy to set up and I'll show you how to do that.

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:27,600
Now say call this voice my usual settings.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,820
The downside as is often the case of working on the emulator is that we won't actually be able to see

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:40,300
this in action but we can confirm that it will work and I'll show you how it would work on a real device.

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,530
OK so we do everything in main activity of Java and I'm not even going to be working with the layout

9
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:01,950
at all here so I'm just going to put everything in the on create method.

10
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,060
So if you've been paying attention so far you can probably imagine that if we want to go over and get

11
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:15,210
some data from speech input we're going to do that with an intent say let's create how you feel intent.

12
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:26,550
This is going to be a new intent and it's a recognize the intent and we want action recognize speech.

13
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,030
A few others that you might be interested in there but recognize speech is what we're working with here.

14
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,920
And then we need to put

15
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,760
an option in there.

16
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:49,410
And that is recognize the intent it extra language model.

17
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,840
And what we're trying to do here is just get free form text.

18
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:03,360
So I'm going to use recognizer intense thoughts language model for you form and you can see there's

19
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,460
a few other options that you might want to use the web search in some situations.

20
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,170
The free form is what we're going for here.

21
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:23,620
Then we start the activity for a result and the activity we want to start is high.

22
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:30,690
And then as we've seen before we give an integer which will then be returned by the speech recognizer

23
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,990
so that we can confirm which activity has come back to us.

24
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,760
How do we get the results then.

25
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:43,120
Well we use on activity result and it is that first one.

26
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,640
We've used this before.

27
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,910
You may remember when we're getting images from the user's photo feed for example.

28
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,690
So we do a very similar check so we check for Everquest code.

29
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,960
I can spell it right.

30
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,630
Being the same as the one that we sent in the first place.

31
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:12,130
And we checked that the result code is ok.

32
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:22,220
Then we get the results from Data is data available up here.

33
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,980
And that's actually in the form of a list of strings.

34
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,780
So we'll call that results.

35
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,670
And we get that from data using get string array list extra.

36
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:47,710
And we want to get recognize the intent start extra results

37
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,100
so that will give us an array of strings.

38
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,750
The only one we're actually interested in is the first one

39
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,000
so we call this text

40
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:09,980
this is going to be results don't get and then zero.

41
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,430
And that's it.

42
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,830
You can then do something with text such as displayed on the screen or use it in a text message or whatever

43
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,270
you like

44
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:31,620
and that's it super simple as I say we can actually use this on the simulator but we will see at the

45
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:39,340
very least that it does redirect to a screen to start recording the text to speech.

46
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:46,170
And then you can see it's got the Speak Now screen and it's waiting for me to speak which sadly it's

47
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,190
not going to pick up.

48
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,230
It doesn't use you or your local microphone to do that.

49
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:56,250
But if we were on a real device here then once we finish speaking it would jump back to our app and

50
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,600
we'd get the results right there.

51
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,140
So that's all it is.

52
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:05,700
That's all you need to do to integrate speech recognition into your Android where apps.
