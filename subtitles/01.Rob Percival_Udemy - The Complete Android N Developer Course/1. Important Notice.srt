1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,700
Care I'd like to discuss quickly.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:11,680
Important Notice before we get started all recommended links and or graphics can easily be found in

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,900
PTF format for that lecture.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,820
However not all lectures will have external links or graphics.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:28,800
Therefore if a lecturer has no PTF then that lecture had no recommended links or graphics for it.

6
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:36,620
All the external links found inside this course are extremely relevant to each lecturer that has them.

7
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:44,200
But that being said some of the external links you will obviously need to sign up to access their services

8
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,560
many of which offer free trials.

9
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,340
Some are paid.

10
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,780
I felt it prudent to explain this to you up front.

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,810
So things are crystal clear between us.

12
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,760
There are no affiliate links involved inside the main course material.

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:07,990
However I will disclose here that there will be one affiliate link only found in my bonus section.

14
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:13,610
At the very end of the main course and the link will always be marked as an affiliate.

15
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,220
Next to the link.

16
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:22,180
The small fee that is paid to me will always go towards my favorite charities such as feeding the homeless

17
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,640
children and seniors worldwide.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,940
All these companies are very relevant in helping you my students succeed in this type of business.

19
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:40,720
I've included also a table of contents for you to quickly find and locate a topic you wish to refresh

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,440
your memory as well since this course is quite extensive and constantly growing.

21
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,490
That's all.

22
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,020
And I'll see you in the next lecture.
