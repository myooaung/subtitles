1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,070
In the previous video we saw how to add a map to your app.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,550
And we had a quick look at the code that made the map work.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,940
In this video we'll be taking that further and we'll see not only how to customize the starting point

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:18,390
zoom level and markers on the app but also how to add different sorts of maps such as ones involving

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,680
satellite imagery.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,700
So let's get cracking.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:28,210
We're doing all our coding here in the maps activity java file which we looked at in the previous video

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:38,130
and we're going to start by creating a new location to send to our map on.

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,810
Now you may not know the latitude and longitude of any particular location so I'd recommend jumping

10
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:51,520
over to Google Maps and searching for whatever you want to choose as your starting location.

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,410
I'm going to go for Mt. Everest.

12
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,570
Why not.

13
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:05,930
And in fact right there in the you are l you can see the latitude and longitude if they're not displayed

14
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:12,200
in the U R L for some reason you can see them by control clicking on the market clicking what's here

15
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,890
and you'll see the latitude and longitude right there.

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,650
So I'm going to grab those and copy them into my app

17
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,060
get rid of the minus as well.

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,070
And paste them in there and I should really give that

19
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,370
a new variable name.

20
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:50,810
So call that Everest and then to add a marker in that particular location.

21
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:57,020
We use map at marker and then we create some new upmarket options.

22
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:06,660
That is a position which is now going to be Everest and a new title

23
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,110
which makes a bit more sense.

24
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:22,000
I mount everest Similarly we now want to move the camera to our new location so we'll just change that

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,520
variable name to Everest.

26
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,890
So very simple to create a new marker and zoom in on a new location.

27
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,610
Let's test that out.

28
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,920
We should be able to do it with instant starts and there we go.

29
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:43,090
So we're now centered on Mt. Everest because the mark there that if we tap on we get our Mt. Everest

30
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,130
label Sipa we can do a lot more than that.

31
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:53,880
First off we can customize the icon for our marker if we want to and we do that by notice we've got

32
00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:00,790
new marker corruption's and a full stop and then position and full stop and title if we add another

33
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,950
full stop.

34
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:11,590
We can add for example an icon and then describe I can We need a bitmap descriptor

35
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,780
factory

36
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,320
and then we can choose a range of options that we can even pick an image from a file.

37
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:31,860
But I'm going to stick with the default marker and then pick a color and we get the color from bitmap

38
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:39,330
district factory and then you can see you've got a whole range there Azura the top blue sign Green et

39
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,190
cetera et cetera.

40
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,030
I'm going to go for orange.

41
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,390
So more code than you might think but actually fairly easy to change the color of the icon if you want

42
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,910
to.

43
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,900
Let's just see that action.

44
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:54,820
And there we go.

45
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,220
So now we've got a nice orange marker.

46
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,130
What do you want to be more zoomed in than this.

47
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:05,320
They were quite zoomed out of them and we can't really see where Everest is at least on a local scale.

48
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:16,430
But we do that by replacing New London with new flat line zoom.

49
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,890
You can see we've got a few other options that we can use bounds if we want to to specify that the top

50
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:26,620
left in the bottom right locations of the map but normally we're going to want something like new Laughland

51
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:33,640
zoom and then for the lat long we can use Everest and then the zoom level.

52
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:42,610
Let's start at something like 15 and you can see that that gives us a fairly zoomed in view.

53
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:48,970
In fact the number varies from 1 to 20 with one being completely zoomed out.

54
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:54,950
So you to see more or less the whole world and then 20 has zoomed in as Google Maps goes.

55
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:01,390
So you actually seeing buildings if you're zooming into a part of the world where Google has that level

56
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:09,790
of imagery that we get so we're now zoomed out as can be with our map.

57
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,740
All right so let's reset that as somewhere in the middle say 10.

58
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:19,510
And now for our final bit of customization We'll see how we can convert the map from just a plain map

59
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,820
to containing satellite imagery as well.

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:33,110
So we do that using Map dot and then set map type in fact have a quick look there at all the options

61
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:38,130
that you can set if you really want to get specific with your map.

62
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:45,100
We'll look at set map type and then we can just put an integer in there.

63
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,810
But better to choose one of the options here.

64
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,880
And then we've got a hybrid type non normal satellite or terrain.

65
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,130
So I'm going to go for a hybrid and then let's have a look.

66
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,150
We should now see basic roads and countries as well as

67
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,410
satellite imagery.

68
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,000
And there we go.

69
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,490
It's pretty impressive.

70
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,320
Wonderful.

71
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,620
So that's as far as I think we'll need to go with Google Maps for now.

72
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,100
We will definitely be returning to it shortly but we're going to take a brief diversion into something

73
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,090
that so much connected with maps and that is getting the users location.
