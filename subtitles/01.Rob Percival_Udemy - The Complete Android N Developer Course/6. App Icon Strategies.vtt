00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.750
OK I like to discuss app icon strategies.

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.400
Experts always say you only get one shot to make a great first impression.

3
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:18.110
Your icon is the first thing that will draw users attention to your app.

4
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.870
Screw this chance up and it'll be much harder uphill battle for you.

5
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:33.020
Most successful app developers have this in common use simple graphics incorporate bright colors one

6
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.400
or two colors at the most and use unique shapes.

7
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:50.390
Apple uses icon required 2048 by 2048 pixels and 57 by 57 pixels for mobile devices.

8
00:00:50.390 --> 00:01:02.990
The iPad is twenty forty eight pixels wide by 15 36 pixels tall whereas Google Play store uses 512 by

9
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:10.380
512 pixels and mobile devices forty eight forty eight pixels.

10
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:19.550
Now Google now allows you to AVI split test your app icons and screen shots in real time.

11
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.710
It's super important to always split test everything especially your app icon here.

12
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:35.270
I know one situation where they changed just their app icon and experienced over a 200 percent increase

13
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.530
in downloads overnight.

14
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.440
You just never really know what's going to be a hit with your targeted users.

15
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:52.880
That's why I want you to have several app icons created and then split tested to see which app icon

16
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.070
is going to deliver the most downloads and reigns supreme.

17
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.470
All right here's some tips for both Apple and Android.

18
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:11.170
Try to make it stand out such as a 3D border or a character that blocks some part of the border.

19
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.420
Apple rounds the borders automatically.

20
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.780
Therefore you don't have to around the edges here.

21
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.490
Think of something simple that sums up your app.

22
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.690
Use colors that make it pop out.

23
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.450
Go with one or two colors at the most here.

24
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.550
Always make it consistent with your app design.

25
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.980
Don't forget about details here.

26
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.930
Users will see a small icon but it also has to look great when scaled as well.

27
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.680
Please keep trends in mind here.

28
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.020
You don't have to follow them rigidly but they are trends for a reason.

29
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.720
Also always remember it's not just for an app store.

30
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.650
It will also be displayed on your user's phones or tablets.

31
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.540
Try and give them something they will love to see on theirs.

32
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:12.770
Never use words they won't be visible on a tiny icon anyway so avoid text here.

33
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.360
Never use a photo try an illustration.

34
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:23.180
Instead I want you to be creative yet simple here.

35
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:31.550
Test your app icon on different wallpapers to see how it stands out to simulate how it will look like

36
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.610
against different wallpapers one might have on their device.

37
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.750
Test your app icon on a solid background color first and not gradient.

38
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.970
And lastly split test your app icons.

39
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.450
I can't stress that enough.

40
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.080
OK I'll see you in the next lecture.
