Congratulations on making it to Section 16 of the complete Android and develop of course here we're

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,550
going to be building our final big app of course which is going to be a clone of the very very popular

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,250
messaging system what's.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:19,980
So is going to allow users to send messages directly to each other and then view the whole stream of

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,390
messages right there within the app.

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,550
Messaging Apps are some of the most popular apps around and although the market is quite competitive

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,190
if you can come up with a special feature or Inish you can start building users extremely quickly.

8
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,480
So as always as you're building the what's at play.

9
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:41,240
Be thinking about how you might make this into a real app that you could then get on Google Play and

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,780
start building the next big thing in messaging.

11
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,160
So enjoy this section and I'll see you at the beginning of the next and final section.
