1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,340
Now that we've seen a little more about how Android layout works and we've seen the relationship between

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:13,680
the design view here and the text SML behind it we're in a position to see how we can do more to manipulate

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,640
the objects on our screen.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:22,350
The views we're going to start by looking at a fading animation which is actually pretty straightforward

5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,990
doesn't make this a little bit more interesting.

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,090
I'm going to get a couple of images of my favorite cartoon characters.

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:35,430
I suggest you get a couple of images that interest you as well so I've got Miss Simpson here on Wikipedia

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,900
and I'm just going to control click or right click and save image as and then just pop in there on the

9
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:54,710
desktop and the same thing with Bart click on him and save the image as

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,790
I.

11
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,420
You might be wondering why we've got two images that we're working on.

12
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,660
Well that will become clear in the exercise at the end of this video.

13
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,510
So let's create a new app

14
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:26,630
so a new project I'll call it animations all the different options and finish we get.

15
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,200
As this is being created for me.

16
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,160
Can you remember how we add an image to our app.

17
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:48,480
Well the easiest way is to find the image either in find out if you're on a Mac or explore if you're

18
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,940
on Windows.

19
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:56,130
I'm going to just remind them to two very straightforward file names.

20
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,010
So just Bart and Homer.

21
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:05,060
And then I'm going to select both of them and command C or Control-C if you are windows to copy them

22
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:17,270
and then we go into the drawable folder and command VI or control vi to paste them in so that Bart and

23
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:23,960
Homer that switch over to our design view and then we'll get rid of our

24
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,630
Hello World text VI and I'm going to create a full screen image of Bart.

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,110
To start off with.

26
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,700
So I redid that with an image view.

27
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:45,100
And so now we compare a bit more attention to what we can see there.

28
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,220
So I want it to be the exact top left

29
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,560
which is not one thing today.

30
00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:06,820
So I'll just drag it in where I can and change the width to match parent and the height to match parent

31
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,860
as well.

32
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,560
And then you can see we've got top left on the alignment which looks good.

33
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:19,680
And if we just have a quick look at the text of our layout there's the code for our image.

34
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,110
And that all looks pretty positive.

35
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:29,760
So we've got aligned at the apparent top apparent left and parents start and there's no padding or margins

36
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,170
there despite what it implied when we dropped it in.

37
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,050
So that's exactly where we want it.

38
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,110
That's great.

39
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,530
And then we want to set the image here.

40
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,950
So if we scroll down

41
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:52,930
it's the SIRC remember that we're interested in so the source and we should be able to click the little

42
00:03:52,930 --> 00:04:00,340
button there and then scroll down inside the durable folder down at the bottom should be Bart and Homer

43
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,170
that we get.

44
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,110
So we'll start off with Bart and there is wonderful.

45
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,730
Now you may have noticed as you've been messing around with your images that we have an on click property

46
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:18,010
here with images as well as buttons so you don't have to have a button to be able to click it.

47
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:28,080
So I'm going to assign the fade method to our Picture of Bhartiya.

48
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,020
So when we tap out the fade method it's going to be called.

49
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,080
Which means of course we have to go and create the fade method.

50
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,530
So let's do that.

51
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,200
We're hopefully pretty familiar with this now.

52
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,370
So public accessible from anywhere.

53
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,480
BOYD It's not returning anything.

54
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:55,440
And the name of the method is Faid it's going to be called by a view once again this is going to be

55
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,870
an image for you this time but that doesn't really make any difference to how code is recalled by View.

56
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,140
And we'll call the view view and let's import

57
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:18,150
Android to view a view to allow that.

58
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:24,810
So all that we want to happen is for the image to fade out essentially when we tap it.

59
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:31,260
So first of all we have to get the image just like we did with the added text fields before.

60
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,460
So let's just double click.

61
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,030
Get an idea of image view.

62
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:44,050
I think I'm going to change that to something a bit more specific so I call it Bart every day.

63
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:51,370
And then previously when we wanted to get a view we used text at it because that was the type of view

64
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:57,490
that we were getting but this time we're getting an image you start typing image view with a capital

65
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:02,820
I capital I remember because it's like class there go.

66
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,170
And again I'll call it Bart.

67
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:14,200
And to get this we're going to find view by ID.

68
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,710
And as we've seen before it's resources to ID.

69
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,360
And then the name of the ID which is bought.

70
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,620
So now we've got the image view.

71
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,720
But we've got it as a view.

72
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,780
We want it has an image view.

73
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,400
So we just put image view in parentheses beforehand.

74
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,750
There we go.

75
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,250
So now we've got a variable bot which is equal to our image.

76
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,510
And we just want to fight it out.

77
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,720
How do we do them.

78
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:51,140
Well we take boat and we're going to call the animate method.

79
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:51,730
There it is.

80
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,190
It's what you might anticipate we might want to use.

81
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,510
And all you have to do with the animate method is tell the compiler what you want to change and how

82
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,600
long you want to allow for the change to happen.

83
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,960
So let's say we want to fade the image out.

84
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,220
What we want to actually change is the alpha.

85
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:17,140
So I think we've come across Alpha briefly before but if you haven't seen it before Alpha is a number

86
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:21,600
generally from 0 to 1 which represents how transparent the image is.

87
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,090
So an alpha value of zero says that the image is invisible.

88
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,280
And Alpha value of one says it's completely visible.

89
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,230
So at the moment it has an alpha value of 1.

90
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,850
We want to change it to an alpha value of zero.

91
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,620
There we get.

92
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,430
And now you notice that we've got something here this expects a float value.

93
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,430
Now 0 will automatically be converted to a float.

94
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:53,060
But it's better to just specify that we want zero as a float.

95
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,430
And that's the conventional way of doing it even if you don't put that F in here.

96
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,160
That will work but it won't work with certain other numbers.

97
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:10,030
If for example you tried putting 0.5 in that wouldn't work you have to put 0.5 f to be clear that it's

98
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,650
a float that we want to put in here.

99
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,250
So 0.5 by default is a double.

100
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,310
We want to make it into a float.

101
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,560
So we use 0.5 half.

102
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:27,520
So generally we just put an F in every time just to make it clear that we want a flight and then we

103
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,320
set the duration

104
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,360
so set duration.

105
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,980
And then this is the number of milliseconds so thousandths of a second.

106
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:47,990
So if you wanted it to last two seconds for example then you would put in 2000 that we get and that's

107
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,790
it.

108
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,200
Semi-colon and that's everything we need.

109
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:57,040
So we take the variable part which is equal to our image view and we want to animate it.

110
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,590
We want to set the Alpha to zero which is basically making it invisible.

111
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,640
And we want that to happen over the course of two seconds or 2000 milliseconds.

112
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,520
That's it.

113
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,600
Let's have a look.

114
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,510
So now if we run this we should find that we get our body image nice and large.

115
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,600
And then when we tap on the body image we fight it out.

116
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,750
Let's take a look.

117
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,740
So there is there.

118
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:32,440
But if we now tap on him can see it slowly fades away over two seconds.

119
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,550
Fantastic.

120
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,080
So that's how you do fades.

121
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,880
And this is going to be the basis of pretty much all the animations that we do.

122
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:43,990
And we'll run through a lot of different types of animations pretty quickly in the next video.

123
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,450
For now.

124
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,660
I've got a challenge for you.

125
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,780
And it's not a completely straightforward one.

126
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:54,010
What I want you to do is change the function of this app so instead of just Bart fading out we've got

127
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,450
Bart fading into Homer.

128
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,720
So initially when you load the app you just see Bart just like now.

129
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,390
But then when you tap on him he fades out and Homer fades in.

130
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:10,630
This is known as a crossfade and is a really nice way to transition from one view to another.

131
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,480
So not straight forward but hopefully you can figure it out.

132
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:13,930
Best of luck

133
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:23,950
OK.

134
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:35,760
Did you manage I so the way I would do it is bring in a second image view which is going to be our home

135
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:47,040
image and will align at the top left and again will change the width to match parent and same with the

136
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,990
height.

137
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,190
So there we go.

138
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:54,350
And this time the SIRC the source is going to be home

139
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:06,330
Silis just laid him so scrolling down inside the terrible section there is wonderful.

140
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,260
OK.

141
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,260
Great.

142
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:14,240
So now we can see him on top of Bart there because that nice transparent images which is not what we

143
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,540
want.

144
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,190
We want Homer to not be visible at the beginning.

145
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:26,080
So what we can do a scroll up here and set the alpha for Homer to be zero.

146
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,570
There we go.

147
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,770
So now Homer disappears and you can have a nice little play there as well if you want to see what its

148
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,190
like with a Alpher of note point five.

149
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,270
Then you get this kind of semi visible humor there.

150
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,180
So that's that's what alpha values between 0 1 looked like.

151
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,230
But for now we want an alpha of zero for every game.

152
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,060
Let's just have a quick look and see what that looks in the XML.

153
00:11:54,090 --> 00:12:03,930
So here's our Hoba code and you can see it's very similar to the bar code except we've got Alpha is

154
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,670
equal to zero G at the bottom.

155
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:10,450
So you could have done this just by adding that code at the bottom if you wanted.

156
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:15,360
So I'm going to change the ID this time using the ex-MIL because why not.

157
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:24,830
And all I do is change that to Homer there and everything else is the same as before.

158
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,110
So back over to design view.

159
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,510
And then over to our java file.

160
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:38,050
So we still want Bart to fade out in exactly the same way he did before but this time we want Homer

161
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,430
to fade in.

162
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,000
So we need to get home.

163
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:51,210
So we use the same code as before but this time we're going to call our variable Hyma and the ID of

164
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,170
the objects that we're looking for is also a.

165
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:05,890
And then this line fade home in is going to be very similar to the BART line say Herma and then animate

166
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:15,460
this time of course we're going to set the Alpha to one and we'll do it over the same duration say 2000

167
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,700
milliseconds or two seconds.

168
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,450
And that's it.

169
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,240
Let's just have a look.

170
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,170
Run it on the wall already running emulator and there it is.

171
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:40,790
So now we tap on bots and slightly airily.

172
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,080
He transitions nicely into how you met him.

173
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,550
So that's how we do a crossfade obviously tapping again doesn't do anything.

174
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,040
A nice extra challenge that I went through with you but might be to tap on Homer to get him to transition

175
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,510
back into Bart and then go back and forth.

176
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,730
That's fairly straightforward really.

177
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:05,970
It's just creating another method which would fade Homer out and bought back in and assigning that to

178
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,270
the homer image.

179
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,640
All right.

180
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,310
So that's fading transitions.

181
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,880
We're going to look at a lot more different types of transition.

182
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,910
All of which we can do within this animate method in the next video.
