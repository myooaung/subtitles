00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:10,380
Let's talk about app ratings now app ratings much like app reviews is another strong social proof indicator

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,510
for new users to drive them to want to download giraffe.

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,720
If your ratings were low it's going to suck to be quite honest.

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:27,420
You can never force your users to want to rate your app but it can never hurt to ask them though so

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,430
please do the following.

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:38,190
Always ask your buddies or mates for a few five star reviews to get started and give you a much needed

7
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,560
push.

8
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,230
Hire someone for a few bucks to give you a five star rating.

9
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,960
Find my highly recommended place in my bonus section at the end of this course.

10
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,240
This is black hat so use with caution.

11
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:04,410
Make it easy for unhappy users to contact you before they leave negative ratings or reviews offer upgrades

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:13,740
and promo codes for five star reviews display a pop up asking for a review from people who use your

13
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,420
app often.

14
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,410
This can however annoy people if done too much.

15
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,890
So be careful on the timing.

16
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,460
OK I'll see you in the next lecture.
