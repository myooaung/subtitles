OK let's talk about expert app localizations strategies what I mean by Apple localization is your app

2
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,950
listing in the App Store is appearing all over the world.

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,850
Not everybody reads or understands English.

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:23,600
So if you want to be able to sell your apps say in China or Brazil which are two extremely big markets

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:30,980
China being the largest consumer of apps in the world you need to translate all your app elements into

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,230
whichever languages you decide to target.

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,980
You definitely need to translate your method data such as app title description and keywords.

8
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:50,430
Your app will also need notifications and any instructions or text to be translated as well.

9
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:57,530
You do this correctly and I've seen people's apps go from the cellar up to the top 10 in their category

10
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,660
inside of a few days.

11
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:08,130
You can find an inexpensive translators link in my bonus section one found at the end of this course.

12
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,600
So make sure to check it out.

13
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:18,620
Don't use any free translating software online as it always has errors in it and it winds up making

14
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:24,570
you look bad in the end and it will hurt your downloads when it doesn't have to.

15
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:32,870
Just by doing this you can double triple or even quadruple your downloads each and every day.

16
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:41,450
Important point here is if you're going to do this then do it right and it will pay off big time.

17
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:50,900
I like a company called El Loco Dotcom for my localization means it's worth the money to hire a human

18
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,480
translator here.

19
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:58,850
