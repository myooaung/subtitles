1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,940
Hey,

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,280
guys,

3
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:01,810
In this video,

4
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:07,230
we're going to be looking at deploying our registration application on Hiroko and also

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,000
setting up remote my SQL database.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,910
Before I go any further,

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,740
I think it's worth stating that my machine actually crashed.

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,660
So the machine that was being used for all of the tea tourism pointed at this point

9
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,240
actually died sometime this week on.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,790
So I had to recover another machine and also all of the court that was being done in the

11
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:29,850
previous tutorials.

12
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,670
Onda,

13
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,920
thankfully get up,

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,620
rescued me.

15
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,730
So I was able to go on,

16
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:34,350
get up,

17
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,640
flew in the database.

18
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:35,940
Sorry,

19
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:43,060
the files back to my machine on provisional new machine with all of the court and all of

20
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,450
the tools that were being used.

21
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,620
And so this is the new machine that were on.

22
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,590
So if there was never a compelling reason for you to use source control than let that guide

23
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,560
the advantages to using it now in this video,

24
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,100
we're going to be on heroic.

25
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,350
Also,

26
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,310
if you don't have a ah heh Rogo account,

27
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:03,020
you can always check my earlier video setting up a free heroic or cones and then that

28
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,740
should get you up to speed with getting a heroic account,

29
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,120
and then you can follow the rest of the steps as we go along.

30
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,080
For those of you who already have a heroic or cones,

31
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,920
this would be a return trip to your Haruko.

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,780
And you would notice here that there some zed signs,

33
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,970
which indicates sleeping beside my previously reported deployed ups and you probably have

34
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:25,710
them also.

35
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,580
So the thing is,

36
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,700
when an up because they're under free plan and up tends to go to sleep,

37
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,020
Perico puts them to sleep because where they're free,

38
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,610
Andi,

39
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,660
they weren't necessarily in use.

40
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,030
So if I attempts toe navigate to my PHP,

41
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,950
that's trying Primer Dash Trev up.

42
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,880
It's going to take a while to come up on.

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,150
That's because it was asleep.

44
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,950
So what had to happen is the dino itself had toe reawaken.

45
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,880
And when I refreshed the PG notice that it's no a week,

46
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,340
all right,

47
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,810
so that's going to happen if you realize that you're trying to never get to your up and it

48
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,490
takes a while,

49
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:04,310
it's because because there's limited to no traffic coming to that application off the

50
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,970
Dino's get kind of deep revision until they're requested on.

51
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,110
Then they would awaken and serve the content.

52
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,500
All right,

53
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,420
So I'm just letting you guys know that that is why you would see those visits anyhow.

54
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,270
Or mission today is to deploy our new applications.

55
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,050
I go to new create a new up on,

56
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:28,790
then we're calling this one attendance cash register.

57
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,580
Remember,

58
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,600
you don't have to have the kind of the same name as being here is an example.

59
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,170
Already have attendance that's register as an up on Hiroko.

60
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,260
So they're telling me I can't do this one.

61
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,920
Someone to call this one.

62
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,840
PHP dash attendance.

63
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,030
I bet nobody has that name out there.

64
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,630
There we go.

65
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,640
So you can always copy this name and just put something else in there to make it unique to

66
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,160
your situation on.

67
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,620
Then once you're done with that,

68
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,590
you can go ahead and click.

69
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,550
Create up.

70
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,470
No.

71
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,670
With our up created,

72
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:03,600
we can go ahead and scroll down to deployment method where we can just click connect to get

73
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,040
up.

74
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,410
I'm already logged in to get up in my brother.

75
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,020
So it's knows it's me.

76
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,760
If not,

77
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,960
then you might need to put in your get tub credentials.

78
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,300
And then once that is done and you're connected,

79
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,220
you can just go ahead and search for the report.

80
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,450
And I believe that my report was called Tendons are search on.

81
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,110
There we go and then I connect and then once I connect,

82
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:30,000
I know have the option to automatically deploy or manually deploy someone to choose manual

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,040
deployment.

84
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,670
Andi,

85
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,550
I think I explained the reasons for that.

86
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,700
In a previous video on DSO,

87
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,750
I go ahead and click Deploy Branch and then give it a few moments while it runs its magic

88
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,560
on.

89
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,890
Once that is done,

90
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,680
we will see something coming up deployed to Hiroko with a green tick and then I can go

91
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,640
ahead and click view,

92
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,480
which were then load my page.

93
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,740
But then look at this.

94
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:58,860
If you do or call our index speed should have a form Andi or View attendee should have a

95
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,890
table off.

96
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,660
All the persons would have filled out that farm.

97
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,790
Neither is loading on.

98
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,670
The reason for that is if you go back to our chord in visual studio.

99
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,030
If you look at our index page,

100
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,970
we see that it is calling Khan.

101
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:18,580
And if we look inside of far can file Khan is actually trying to connect to our local host

102
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,130
database on our machine.

103
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:20,690
Well,

104
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,830
this I p really means local toe water,

105
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,840
A machine it's on.

106
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,040
So that means if I put it on your machine and you I didn't have this database than it would

107
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,810
have been an error.

108
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,190
So likewise,

109
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,640
there is no database,

110
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,750
local toe Hiroko that hoses any off the connection details being aligned here.

111
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:45,550
So all we need to do is set up a database that heroic who can see across the Internet and

112
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,640
can quell these problems so heroic Oh,

113
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,070
actually allows you to add a database.

114
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,190
Ah,

115
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,190
it'll be a server off sorts.

116
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:00,930
You can go to configure Adan's on Look for clear db my SQL The don't sides of clear db my

117
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,890
SQL is that even though it say's free here,

118
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,890
you have to provide your credit card information on then actually,

119
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,550
provisioning the database isn't really free.

120
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,270
The database hosting itself is not free,

121
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,180
so we're not going to take that route.

122
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,660
But instead we're going to look for an alternative.

123
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,080
Andi,

124
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,350
I actually found a website recently on it is re morte,

125
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,740
my SQL dot com on day actually offer free my ask your postings.

126
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,220
Ofcourse,

127
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,830
free comes with limitations.

128
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:35,180
But for the purpose of getting through this video and showing you how you deploy a fully

129
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,790
functional,

130
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:40,340
data driven application to the Internet and specifically Hiroko,

131
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,230
then we will use it if we're doing it.

132
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,750
To see Pinelli would be a much easier ordeal.

133
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,340
But because off Hiroko and the cost constraints,

134
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,730
I just want to keep this video as cost free and effective as possible off course.

135
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,840
If you're going to production,

136
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:01,040
then you could proceed with clearly be keep everything more homogeneous on more stable by

137
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,570
just having everything inside.

138
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,220
Heroic cool.

139
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,980
So in remote my school dot com,

140
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,220
we can go ahead and click Log in.

141
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,030
Which off course will ask you to create an account or I'll again say can go ahead and

142
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,430
fellow this basic later and create an account.

143
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,470
Another tool you're probably going toe want is my SQL were pinch,

144
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:28,640
which is it's a desktop application that allows it to manage remote my SQL databases and

145
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,560
the relevance off my using the word remote is that peach FEMA admin manages the local

146
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,750
databases that are local to your zump installation.

147
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,330
When you have workbench,

148
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,810
he can connect to that one.

149
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,750
Or it can connect one across the room or across the Internet on considering that we're

150
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:51,370
actually going to be setting up this room or to my SQL that which is across the Internet

151
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,130
and we need a tool that can actually connect across the Internet.

152
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:59,030
And so my SQL weren't Binge is a wonderful tool for that.

153
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,200
So you can go ahead and go full of this girl,

154
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,110
which is in the resource is for this video.

155
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:10,050
And you can just navigate their and click download and have that installed on your machine

156
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:10,050
.

157
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,140
No,

158
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,120
I've been created our remote,

159
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,820
my SQL database account.

160
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,870
What we want to do is go over to databases in the stash sport view on then.

161
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,170
Well,

162
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,520
we can't just let me get through all these advertisements and go ahead and click.

163
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,890
Create new database.

164
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,790
They go,

165
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,350
dear.

166
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:34,060
They would then show some information showing us boats are created.

167
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,330
Database the user name the database user name the database name.

168
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:38,820
Sorry.

169
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,890
The password.

170
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,270
The server on the port.

171
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,850
So with that information,

172
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,970
we can go over to our workbench,

173
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,950
and I'm sure you've installed it by the time you get here and then we can click this

174
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,370
possible.

175
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,640
But now I have two cards here because I had work pins installed before.

176
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,370
But if you didn't,

177
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,240
then you probably end up with one card and that's fine.

178
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,180
But then we want to create another one.

179
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,230
So we went to go to the plus sign on.

180
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:07,250
Then we can call this one remote SQL.

181
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,340
So that's just a connection name so that when we see it,

182
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,590
we know what it is for.

183
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,080
On then the host name would be what they call the server.

184
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,050
So you see remote my SQL love calm,

185
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:25,940
which we can just copy from the website and paste inside off workbench.

186
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,420
Off course,

187
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,370
we don't want any species to come up,

188
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,220
so we can just remove any space is at a space before my are on.

189
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:38,150
Then we go back and the user name is this block off text someone to copy that.

190
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:45,490
Go over on going to pay us that in the user name on then our password is that block of text

191
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:45,490
.

192
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,440
So I'm just going to go ahead and repeat that procedure.

193
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,370
But for pastor graft is a store involved.

194
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,760
Give it the password.

195
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,280
Click OK on,

196
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,090
then the final.

197
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,570
Actually the database name,

198
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,720
Which is that name we copy that is it defaults,

199
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,350
Kira,

200
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,510
we can test the connection.

201
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:11,320
And having done that when we see this messaging successfully made my school connection that

202
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,200
we know that we're actually connecting toe remorse.

203
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,440
My SQL Not because it's called remorse,

204
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,230
my SQL,

205
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,760
but remote means it's not on your machine.

206
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,910
It's not local to you.

207
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,030
So it's on the internet and we're connecting to it.

208
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,720
Successful star click OK,

209
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,710
and then click.

210
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:31,900
Okey on then I see my remote s your connection here can double ticket on.

211
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,150
Then this will grant me access to their servers.

212
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,470
No one you're connected.

213
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:43,610
Then you'll see the database that left and you see an empty square window on.

214
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,600
Then you may see this Mitchell message tables could not be fetched.

215
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,200
I'm not entirely sure why,

216
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,580
but if you re first you see that it's remains connected and they try to fit on.

217
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,600
The state can be fish.

218
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,350
But that's fine.

219
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,070
That's off little consequence.

220
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,020
What we're about to do,

221
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,770
you know what we want to do is migrate our database.

222
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,460
So we had our database in our development machine.

223
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,090
I know.

224
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,700
We need to put it over into the production machine.

225
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:15,720
So what we need to do is find our database and we know that we built it using my sorry PHP

226
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,440
my admin.

227
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,090
So we go ahead and go to local speech.

228
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,400
FEMA admin on.

229
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,460
Then you will see a 10.

230
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,220
Ddb,

231
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:22,760
remember?

232
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,840
Had to rebuild my database so I won't have the data that you guys have.

233
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,040
So when I migrate,

234
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,320
man,

235
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,160
it's still going to be an empty database.

236
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,770
You guys are going to have your data,

237
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,650
but it's to see him set off steps.

238
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:39,250
Next we after clicking the DB we goto export.

239
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:46,860
This was then launch of it a window asking us a bunch of stuff about templates.

240
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,490
We don't have to go through all of that.

241
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,270
We can just go ahead and click former.

242
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:56,170
So under the four months you see sq A so we can leave that because I want to do is export

243
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,780
our tables and their contents on sq a file so I can go ahead and click goal,

244
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:08,400
and then that will actually give me on sq a file which I can open up in any editor.

245
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,260
So I went to my downloads folder by default.

246
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,100
I'm just going to right click it and open it up in no part prosperous because I don't want

247
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,140
to open it up in any heavy software.

248
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,400
So once it's in no part cluster second,

249
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,670
just copy its select all control.

250
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,810
See to copy on.

251
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,760
Then I go in tow workbench.

252
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,190
And in this antiquity window,

253
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,750
I pieced on.

254
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,500
Then once I've pasted,

255
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,680
I can actually no just click the execute,

256
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,970
which is this lightning bolts looking icon here in the toolbar on.

257
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,250
Then this will run a set off commands.

258
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:46,970
So,

259
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:47,630
like I said,

260
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,000
I have no data in mind.

261
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,860
So I Your your query,

262
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,280
your query file that is generated is going to look a bit differently from mine.

263
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,660
But essentially,

264
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,090
the net effect should be the same.

265
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:05,910
And then once that has run and you only see green ticks below in that that what I have a

266
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:10,130
few pero files here airlines here.

267
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:10,930
But that's fine.

268
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,280
Those are related to the fact that the tables could not be finished.

269
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:20,050
But once I refresh the schema or to this right and left inside.

270
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,190
Then I see my two tables lifts that.

271
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,350
So even though it says tables could not be finished,

272
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,070
I still get my tables.

273
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,220
And if you had contents than you would have gotten contents.

274
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,800
So that's step one.

275
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,120
Know that we have replicated or data beast or more to my SQL server.

276
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,900
What we want to do is go back to our visual studio cord.

277
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,570
Andi,

278
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,090
open up.

279
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:47,970
Our con dot PHP file on actually changed all these values relative to this new database.

280
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,110
So what I'm going to do is take a copy off all of this.

281
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,690
Since that has all of the connection data,

282
00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:02,520
I'm going to comment out the development parts and I'm going to put the noticed in

283
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:09,100
development connection on.

284
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:16,590
Then I'm going to put in another comment down here and see remote it abi's connection.

285
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,620
All right,

286
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,170
so that means whenever I'm ready to work on my local machine,

287
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:27,010
I can just un comment this and come in this part on vice versus in this situation because

288
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,680
we want toe work remotely,

289
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,070
want to deploy remotely.

290
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:36,010
I'm going toe change out these values so host would be and we can just go back to remote.

291
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,620
My Eskil dot com on reuse these values.

292
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,130
So server is the same as host,

293
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,120
so it's remote.

294
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,010
My ask UAL not this I p address anymore,

295
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:45,650
but remote.

296
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:53,590
My school dot com database would be this block off text no longer attendance TB.

297
00:13:53,590 --> 00:14:01,030
The user name would be that block off text andare pastors.

298
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,360
You know what?

299
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,570
We have a password this time.

300
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:02,900
First,

301
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,480
we didn't have a password,

302
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,910
and I said that I would be fine for development,

303
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,550
But for security purposes,

304
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,970
they always give us a password when we're going remote.

305
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,320
Now,

306
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,390
another cool thing about this is that no,

307
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,900
that I set up our Moz database on.

308
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,510
I have it here on my local development.

309
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:21,840
You know,

310
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,420
in my local government file,

311
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:29,900
I can actually collaborate even easy more easily with my colleagues because the database is

312
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,250
no longer isolated to my machine.

313
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:37,580
So I did see the remote database would be on a machine that is not your computer.

314
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,250
Because if all of your working on this project,

315
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,260
then it will be hired for everybody to be able to pitch in for database changes.

316
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,440
If the database is only on your computer However,

317
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,260
if it is at a remote or a central place that everybody has equal opportunity to connect to

318
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:53,260
,

319
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,890
then it's easier for everybody toe work with the database.

320
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,910
So by deploying your database toe some remote server,

321
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:06,170
whether it's across the Internet or maybe it's on a network where you are at your school or

322
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:06,560
your work,

323
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,020
please,

324
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,990
if it's on a network machine there.

325
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:15,670
The fact is that everybody can use these connection details and have visibility on this

326
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,770
same database,

327
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,210
the same data that everybody's seeing on Dwork even more seamlessly.

328
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,240
Now,

329
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,720
just to drive for my point,

330
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,090
I'm actually going to navigate my local host applications.

331
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,940
I'm just going to go over to my brother,

332
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,800
go to Loca host on Goto.

333
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,650
It is attendance.

334
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:42,940
And then when this index fire Lord's properly realised that the connections are working,

335
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,160
everything is in order.

336
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,170
You notice I don't have any air of expertise because my data bases empty.

337
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:48,740
All right,

338
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:55,510
But remember that we had set up this drop down list to actually read from the database,

339
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,390
so I need to go back into my database and refill this table with the different areas off

340
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,570
expertise that are available for selection on then would see them.

341
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,620
But the point is nowhere connecting to our database.

342
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,930
If I view attendees,

343
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,120
there's nothing there.

344
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,180
But that's because once again,

345
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,430
my data bases empty.

346
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:17,550
If you did this and you will never you migrated all of your data and all of the objects,

347
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,370
then you're going to be having an entirely different experience from me on Do you will be

348
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,250
seeing all off your attendees,

349
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,100
so I'm quickly going to quickly just put in all of the specialties.

350
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,550
So where bench allows me to just click on the table on day?

351
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,920
You know,

352
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,140
this icon that launches a select query from the database on,

353
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,470
Then they give me an editor.

354
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:48,210
So I'm going to put in Web administrator on the database administrator on I.

355
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:48,750
I'm sorry.

356
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,330
I'm not remembering the other ones,

357
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,730
So I'm just going to put networking engineer Andi.

358
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,500
I believe the other one was other.

359
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,120
I know that I've entered all of those values.

360
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,380
I can just go ahead and click.

361
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,420
Apply to the lower right corner on.

362
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,820
That would actually generate an insert into statement per value,

363
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:13,700
which I can click apply on that gets executed on all of these are no in my specialty stable

364
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:13,700
.

365
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:19,270
So when I go back to my form and I refresh and it connects to this database,

366
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,170
then you'll see that all of what I just put in,

367
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:26,900
including the new one networking engineer all off them are no being pulled.

368
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:33,170
So it is successfully connecting from my local host toe the remote server that we just set

369
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:33,650
up.

370
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,780
And so the expectation is that once I deploy this to Hiroko,

371
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:42,990
he will be looking at the same data beast that I just set up in my local development.

372
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,920
So we're going to go ahead and redeploy someone to go to get hub on.

373
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,800
I'm going to push the changes and hear all the changes get Toby showing Arsala machines

374
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,410
that we just made in our con file.

375
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,810
So I'm going to come into master,

376
00:17:54,810 --> 00:18:02,010
and I'm going to see added remote my SQL connection details on.

377
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,070
Then I'm going to commit that to master on,

378
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,020
then push.

379
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,570
And once that push has been deemed successful,

380
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,710
I can go back to my up in Hiroko Goto overview.

381
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,110
No,

382
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,390
Sorry.

383
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,660
Deploy my bad on,

384
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:21,950
then go ahead and deploy branch once that branches deployed successfully.

385
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,720
Then I will click view on.

386
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,430
The expectation is that our farm lords Onda we can see that a query is being done

387
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:33,280
successfully and I'm going to put in the first attendee.

388
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,490
So this is my actual up here on the Internet.

389
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:42,210
So this would have been Reno presented to the user for the first registrants.

390
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:49,330
So I'm going to register first for my I T conference on my deeds off birth is actually the

391
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,400
28th but then the year is wrong.

392
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,010
Well,

393
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,820
we leave the year on then I am a Web administrator,

394
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,720
more or less.

395
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:07,420
My email address is indeed that on my contact number is not fully accurate.

396
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,730
But we work with that,

397
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,370
and then I click Summit on.

398
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,370
Then we're seeing that the operation has been completed and those are my details.

399
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:19,500
If I go to view attendees and we remember that we did a select Scurry to get back these

400
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,450
details so it's reading directly from idea to based.

401
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,780
And if I go back to work,

402
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,670
Ben's just to verify if I look in their 10 de table on die,

403
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,670
click this icon here that will launch all of data in there on the slate quarry.

404
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:38,040
Then I see that my application is really talking to my remote database Somewhere in the

405
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,280
Internet on that is all you would go about deploying an application to our more database

406
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,750
and to Hiroko No.

407
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,510
Once again,

408
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:51,550
it is ideal in ah real production situation that we keep everything inside off.

409
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,090
Hiroko.

410
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,820
It's easier to maintain is easy to manage on.

411
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,680
It's easier toe.

412
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,160
Well,

413
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,090
everything disconnects better.

414
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:03,660
But then we see here that we're hosting in Herro co hosting our coding heroic about hosting

415
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,810
our database on remote.

416
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:12,650
My SQL dot com on this concept could have been applied basically with any remote hosting

417
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,060
agents,

418
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,450
So everything doesn't have to be one place.

419
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,390
The database can be one place and the court another place,

420
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,140
but we know how to connect them.

421
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,010
Once we have the cart,

422
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:27,310
connection details are so I I'm challenging you.

423
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,520
Just repeat these steps,

424
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,930
deploy our application on If you run into any difficulty along the way,

425
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,150
feel free to let me know,

426
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,350
and I'll be glad to help.

427
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,610
Thanks for watching
