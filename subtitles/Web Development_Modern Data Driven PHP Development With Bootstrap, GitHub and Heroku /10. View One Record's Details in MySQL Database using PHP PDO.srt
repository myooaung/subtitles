1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,380
Hey guys,

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:01,990
In this video,

3
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:07,470
we will be looking at putting in functionality that allows us to view one records details

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,060
at a time.

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,130
In our previous video,

6
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,910
we will have configured this speed.

7
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,700
This is on screen here by the name of view record thought ph.

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,650
B On the purpose of this page was the list all of the records currently in or databases or

9
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:22,960
at least the attendees table.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,810
Now the task up ahead is toe alot us to be able to click on one record and view only

11
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,210
details related to this record.

12
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,520
To do this,

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,210
we will be building a new page,

14
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:40,540
and we will call it view dot PHP on the sole purpose of you is to receive on I Devalue,

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,950
as printed here in this I D column,

16
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:49,980
or the unique identified from the database on Bring Back the Record with all the details.

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,280
For that I d.

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,660
So back in our project,

19
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,460
we go ahead and build and create a new file on.

20
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:04,400
We call this on view dot PHP as usual to maintain consistency,

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,730
we need to make reference to over header and footer soldiers copy these blocks from an

22
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:15,750
existing page on at the header on the footer cord.

23
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,760
Then,

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,620
having done that,

25
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,830
we would just rename the title view record.

26
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,730
So we have you records,

27
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,910
which is bringing back all of them in a tabular form in viewer accord.

28
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,870
We intend to only see one record at the time,

29
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,840
so I'm going to just remove this court reference that is calling.

30
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,530
Get attendees because they're going to need a new function to get one record everything

31
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:40,700
else.

32
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:40,970
Canada,

33
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:46,240
me and as you still need the header and we still mean require over database connection.

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,420
Next,

35
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,360
I'm going to go ahead and go back to our view record speech on I'm going to add an

36
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,820
additional column so this one will be called actions,

37
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,170
some adding an additional table hitter on I'm going to call it.

38
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,830
Actions on actions were for this video.

39
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,340
We will be putting one button there,

40
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,000
but eventually we'll want to put in functionality to see the view,

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,380
the details that we're about to do but also edit and delete per roll.

42
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,150
So we have the column that say's actions,

43
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,770
but then we're going to modify our role cord,

44
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:29,870
and we're going to add a new column to be added with each row for each record,

45
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,320
some just opening and closing the TV on.

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,640
Then in this space,

47
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,720
what we want to do is print on anchor tag that has a sole purpose off navigating to view

48
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,950
dot PHP on passing in our query string with the I D value.

49
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,320
Now all of that was a mouthful sake and just pay attention and I'll go over it again.

50
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:59,140
So first we start with an anchor talk and I'm just going to open and fills my ankle tag on

51
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,840
and meet the riff B E full tour.

52
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,550
And they were going to see view start PHP on.

53
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,800
I'm just interrupt the text of you,

54
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,770
and then I'm going to want my uncle tired to look so sort of like a button.

55
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,130
So I'm going to put on my boots,

56
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:20,850
start classes,

57
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,480
someone to say,

58
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,190
class equals how we're going to use Bt and for the button on.

59
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:31,720
I wanted to be a blue button somewhere to say primary now,

60
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,380
As it stands,

61
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:37,200
what would happen is that it's going to generate for each rule that we would have seen

62
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,880
before.

63
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,400
No,

64
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,850
we're supposed to have another column on that column is going to have a link called view.

65
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,730
So if I refresh the page after making all those changes and sieving,

66
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,160
then we see exactly that.

67
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,390
No,

68
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,820
we have an actions column,

69
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,000
and we have a button that says View.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,470
And if we click on view,

71
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,380
it navigates.

72
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,240
The are newly created view pitch.

73
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,170
The problem here is that everyone off them is seeing just view dot PHP view dot PHP so all

74
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,980
of them would never get to the same space,

75
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,120
which is fine up to some extent.

76
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,550
But what we really want,

77
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:15,350
his ability that toe print out all of these leaders on that articular page.

78
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:22,180
Now the scenario is that it's because you have a small table working with with only 56

79
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,600
feels it's fine.

80
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,110
But if we weren't printing out,

81
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,520
see the person's date of birth in this list on baby,

82
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,900
we're ensuring their contacts number In this list,

83
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,330
you would have to go to view details to see the rest off their profile.

84
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,470
Then that is where this view page really comes into play.

85
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,450
So just to drive home the context,

86
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:45,760
I'm I'm going to remove the e mail address contacts,

87
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,390
number on the date off birth from the listing.

88
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,950
So when we goto our view,

89
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:59,510
records stable to view all who are have listed that they're going to attend always sees

90
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,220
their first name,

91
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,050
their last name and their specialty,

92
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,930
and then we'll get the option to view more details.

93
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,600
So I'm just going to remove the table headers on that.

94
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,880
I'm going to remove the corresponding table columns that would have come up for each of

95
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,680
those records.

96
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,950
All right,

97
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,650
so having done that,

98
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,350
we see that we have fewer columns than we had before on.

99
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,300
But the expectation is that when we treat view,

100
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,600
we see the person's full profile,

101
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,070
just like when,

102
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,570
when they would have completed the registration on,

103
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,850
they would see that bit off information being presented.

104
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,810
So what I'm going to do is borrow the cord that would have given that representation so

105
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,660
that coal was on the success speech where we can have created like that little card with

106
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,880
their information,

107
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,870
some distant will borrow all off this HTML here on,

108
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,950
I'm going to put it on my view page.

109
00:05:54,950 --> 00:06:01,280
So at the end of the day,

110
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:08,510
what we need to do is make sure that the corresponding values per well for the print coat

111
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,930
off the person's details.

112
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,850
We need to make sure that we're fitting the values for contact,

113
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,160
number,

114
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,500
email,

115
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:13,960
address,

116
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,050
date of birth and everything else.

117
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,950
Now that we've done the client side stuff,

118
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,080
the interfere stuff.

119
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,110
To some extent,

120
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,360
what we're going to do is also get our hands dirty on.

121
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,560
Go into our fraud dot PHP,

122
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,410
which is where we're storing all of for database related functionality on.

123
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,800
Then I'm going to create a new function on.

124
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,620
I'm going to call it public function,

125
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,250
get attendee details,

126
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:51,120
and then this one is going to take a parameter called I D on just for so I like to group my

127
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,480
court.

128
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,590
I like to group all the cool that's related.

129
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,510
So we have inserted and these appear.

130
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,960
We have get attendees here,

131
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,490
so I'm just going to write this one here above the get specialties because I like to see

132
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,350
where all the related functions are.

133
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,680
Now that we have set up the skeleton for our function,

134
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,400
the court is going to look similar to the function above it.

135
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,310
Forget all attendees where we have a variable called SQL And in this variable we're putting

136
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:27,130
in the quarry where we say select star from attendee The stable name Where on then we need

137
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,480
to pass in that previous holder.

138
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,270
So we're going to say attendee,

139
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,400
underscore idea because that's a name of Porpora.

140
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:41,310
Murky column is equal to that place holder i d And then having done that,

141
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,150
we're going to prepare the statement.

142
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,230
So next we prepare it.

143
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:53,480
So I'm going to say STM t is equal to on we call on our object.

144
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,210
This points to DB points to our narrow Onda.

145
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:03,590
We call our function prepare and passed in our SQL statements.

146
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,650
And then after that,

147
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,310
what we need to do is bind the perms.

148
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,770
So we call back or object s TMT,

149
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,940
and then we call the function in that one that's called Bind,

150
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,950
Haram.

151
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:21,910
So I hope you guys see that this is really just a pattern.

152
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,190
If you've done it before,

153
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,340
which we did already,

154
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,950
then it's pretty much the same pattern every time you need to do it afterwards.

155
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:35,450
So we're passing in over i d placeholder on binding it to the value that came in through

156
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,330
our parameter on then after all that is said and done,

157
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,630
we want to store the results.

158
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,550
Someone to say result is equal toe ste mt on.

159
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,890
Then we execute.

160
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,610
So just to review this,

161
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,530
we have our SQL statement,

162
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,880
which is getting all the columns.

163
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,380
So select star from use.

164
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:06,320
Get me all the columns from this table where the attendee id's equal to some place holder,

165
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,250
which we would have kind of defined before.

166
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,170
No on.

167
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:16,540
We should have an idea store those placeholders are for And then after it prepares that

168
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,150
statement,

169
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,630
we bind this placeholder toe.

170
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,050
Water of value came in in the parameter.

171
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:29,650
Now the expectation is that the value coming in from this parameter should much the i d for

172
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,250
the column that we wish the view.

173
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:37,700
So if it is that we wish the View Column five or roll number five or the record with idee

174
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,490
five.

175
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,600
When I click view,

176
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,340
we expect that it should invoke this phone shown call passing five,

177
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:52,080
then running this select worry to get the attendee record with i D five on,

178
00:09:52,080 --> 00:10:00,030
then return it toe result on then the end result is that we need to return whatever comes

179
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:09,720
bark in this object so know that we have the SQL and the the heavy lifting pH B part out of

180
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,240
the way.

181
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,860
The next thing we want to do is go back to view records on make sure that our view link

182
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,540
actually sends over that idea.

183
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,310
So what we're about to do is use what we call a query strip.

184
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,480
No,

185
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,960
we would have looked at Cory Strings earlier when we looked at how they get function works

186
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,780
for forms.

187
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:34,940
Remember that they get from show would have passed a whole bunch of things in the URL on

188
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,200
those variables,

189
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,540
we could have gotten the values associated with those durables using over get super

190
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,070
variable.

191
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:42,910
So the thing is,

192
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,770
you can actually create your own query string.

193
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,980
So in this situation,

194
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,260
we have HR equals view dot PHP.

195
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,420
What I'm going to do is create a question by using the question mark on,

196
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,900
then creating a variable names.

197
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,340
Someone's going to call it I d on.

198
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:04,830
Then I'm going to say this I d needs to be equal toe some value.

199
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:11,000
So the value that it needs to be equal to is whatever the attendee idea is for the rule

200
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,020
that is being printed.

201
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:16,020
Remember that this is a per roll for parole cord.

202
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,430
All right,

203
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,850
so for each room that's it generates.

204
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,890
Or Prince Old this attendee i d column on the first in the last name and the name.

205
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:31,140
I wanted to give me an anchor tag that is going to navigate to the view page on passing the

206
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,910
query string variable i d.

207
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,140
With the value that is,

208
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,660
Well,

209
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:43,250
phone here in attendee i d So I need to make sure that in after the i d equals portion,

210
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,830
the next thing that comes out of that should have the same value as what would have been

211
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,300
printed in the number column for that rule.

212
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,580
So I can actually just t this speech feed block that is echoing that value.

213
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:00,790
Copy it and place it right here inside off the quotation marks.

214
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,920
So once again,

215
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:08,670
this is going to generate a link on the HF is going to be viewed dot PHP on we're creating

216
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,770
our own query string.

217
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,250
So I'm seeing question Mark and then some very big names so you could call this anything

218
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:14,560
you want.

219
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,990
If you'll feel more comfortable seeing attendee underscore,

220
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,600
I d there.

221
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,320
That's fine.

222
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,610
Just to remember that that is the variable name that you need to look for on the next side

223
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:22,610
.

224
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,970
So I'm calling it I d on that.

225
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:30,290
I'm saying that it should be equal to and that I'm just going to put in my PHP block

226
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,760
because I can stick those almost anywhere on,

227
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,190
then echo the value that is actually coming back for that role.

228
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,040
So the same value that is printed out still left,

229
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,410
that is visible to the user.

230
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,160
If you decide to keep it there,

231
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,990
you could take it off.

232
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:43,940
It doesn't really matter.

233
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:48,450
But whatever that value is should be upended.

234
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:53,830
Toe the u R L Once this on Qatar is generated.

235
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,610
All right,

236
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,350
so let's test that theory.

237
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,410
I'm went to me.

238
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:03,780
Those changes See those changes Refresh the speech on then if you hover over the button and

239
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,930
he looked at the bottom left corner off my screen,

240
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:12,440
you see local host sensitive in slash view that Ph B ID equals two.

241
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,150
So notice that this one says to this number is,

242
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,520
too.

243
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,970
If I go down to the one that says nine noticed that I d number in the URL is not If that is

244
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,590
too small for you to see,

245
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:28,860
I just inspect elements that we can see it more clearly and you see view dot PHP ideas.

246
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,160
Nine.

247
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,220
So it is very relative on pearl.

248
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,570
It's going to have a different value.

249
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:41,380
So this one is five on so on and so forth are so know that we have the idea being passed

250
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:48,570
into the view dot PHP page we no need toe retrofit our view dot PHP page Teoh,

251
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,650
run the query on,

252
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:57,100
then get all the values that are coming back on by extension print them now back on our

253
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,660
view page,

254
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,080
Understand?

255
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,320
To modify this comments,

256
00:13:59,320 --> 00:13:59,780
understand?

257
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,300
To see,

258
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,570
get a 10 d by idea.

259
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,790
All right,

260
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,140
so that we know exactly what we're doing on.

261
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,060
Then I'm going to start off by saying if he is set.

262
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,320
So this is a nice function that allows us to check if they,

263
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,580
if some variable exists on,

264
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,810
is usually used when moving between pages and use really use when you have Cory strings.

265
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,920
We would have looked at it when we were doing our success,

266
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,810
not PHP,

267
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,360
where we said if he set submits then do something right.

268
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,630
So it's the same concept.

269
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,270
So in this case,

270
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:40,760
I want to check if the get variable has some subscript by the name off i d.

271
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,550
So if he set get I d meaning.

272
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,540
If this subscript exists in this variable,

273
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,270
right,

274
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,350
that's what that's a saying.

275
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,640
Then we want to take some form of action else.

276
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,530
We want to take another course of action.

277
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,850
So if it's there,

278
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,950
then we want to proceed to print all the persons details.

279
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,220
So if not,

280
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,340
I want to just read that,

281
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,070
if not,

282
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,500
scenario first.

283
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:03,920
Sorry.

284
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,050
I'm just going to echo so I can just equal to the screen.

285
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,570
Uh,

286
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,190
possibly an each one Tug that as an error.

287
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,630
Someone to see,

288
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,250
please check details on.

289
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,340
Try again.

290
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,560
So we're giving them an error message that Okay,

291
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,100
maybe you got here by accident.

292
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:28,900
So that's that's what the person should get if they just typed in view dot PHP because the

293
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,250
i d.

294
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,350
Doesn't exist.

295
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,840
So it's wrong.

296
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,500
All right,

297
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,160
on.

298
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,620
I'm going to put in the text.

299
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,190
Sorry.

300
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,830
The cross for danger.

301
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,340
Text someone to single course for that part.

302
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,970
So bigger and text to see you got here incorrectly.

303
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:48,960
Now,

304
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,670
if the I d value does exist than what we want to do is call on our crowd.

305
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,670
Object,

306
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,000
Andi.

307
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,350
Well,

308
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,810
firstly,

309
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,720
we need a variable.

310
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,250
So we're going to see the results.

311
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,970
Are are something Is he going to be equal?

312
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:11,590
Toe crowed and they were going to call our get attendee Another school back here and make

313
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,570
sure directing the function properly says,

314
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,160
get attendee details Understand?

315
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,080
To copy this.

316
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,990
Get attendee details on.

317
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:23,520
I'm going to put in the get superhero by personally,

318
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,250
I delight in it.

319
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,950
I like putting the variables.

320
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,760
Sorry,

321
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,850
the super very providers in another room.

322
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,390
So I'm going to declare a variable I d on.

323
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,640
Then I'm going to meet this.

324
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,530
I'd be equal to whatever value is coming over.

325
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:40,350
So it's going to be equal to a lot of our values in the super variable here on then.

326
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,530
I'm going to use that variable in my form.

327
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,270
Sean calls.

328
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,060
I think this looks a bit neater.

329
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,340
You would work either way,

330
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,330
but this is just me opining on horror.

331
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:55,330
Think it should look so now that we've done all of that and we have results,

332
00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:00,060
what happens that results is no or Ari or are variable,

333
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,670
that is,

334
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,150
honoree,

335
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,970
that has all of the values.

336
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,840
First name,

337
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,450
last name and specialty.

338
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:10,200
So I took the court from the previous page where we were posting that data.

339
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,590
No,

340
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:15,560
I'm actually going to replace that post with the result variable.

341
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,680
So this was a Skopje NPS score.

342
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,150
You don't have to write the post than right result.

343
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:21,670
Instead,

344
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,260
I'm just telling you that no,

345
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:23,590
instead,

346
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:30,790
off using the post were using results because results is hosing the data coming from the

347
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,660
database.

348
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,520
It's understand to go ahead and replaced all the posts here.

349
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
But we're still echoing on.

350
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,330
We're still interacting with each value viol.

351
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,890
It's it's subscript name.

352
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,990
So now that we've done all of this,

353
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,080
we're going to go back to our page and look on.

354
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,910
That is what we get on.

355
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,710
That is what we should be getting because I left out a step.

356
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,160
So just work with me.

357
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,440
No,

358
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:03,560
we have crowd that PHP on ditz in that there's an error online 46.

359
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:10,930
If I go back to the crowd file and look at Lyon 46 I did indeed miss a step so what I

360
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:14,070
should have said here was result.

361
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,630
So we had result is equal to execute on.

362
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,450
If we did that,

363
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,560
that's all we started off with.

364
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,270
Then we would have gotten nothing coming back.

365
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:26,650
All right,

366
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:34,280
So what we need to do is actually take this result equals take Take that part off the court

367
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,680
coat on.

368
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:43,130
Then what we're going to do is create another line in Lyon actually lying 46 and the result

369
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,900
is equal to on.

370
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,390
We're going to see ste empty.

371
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,460
Andi,

372
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,950
call the phone son called fits.

373
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,090
All right,

374
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,720
so I'm going to explain it.

375
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,530
So what would have happened is that all of this would have executed or quarry on.

376
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,670
That's all fine and dandy.

377
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:07,520
But then because you only want back one role really and truly were taking just this one

378
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,950
record where the ID's equals that we have to use this function called Fitch,

379
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,710
which is actually just going to give us that one thing.

380
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,040
So that's that's one thing,

381
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,450
toe.

382
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,650
Remember,

383
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,480
when it is,

384
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,450
you're using video.

385
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,850
So when you're looking at multiple than just doing execute,

386
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,660
that's perfectly fine.

387
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:30,800
But otherwise you want to see Fitch and you put Fetch,

388
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,320
you fetch the record in tow one variable,

389
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,390
and you return that variable on,

390
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,020
then in the view part.

391
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,540
Well,

392
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,660
whatever is fetched and put in tow on returned by.

393
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,530
This function is put into this variable,

394
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,060
and then we use that variable throat.

395
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,560
So when I go back and I refresh,

396
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,450
I'm now seeing at least some data about some other Ariz.

397
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:57,550
And these arrows are because they're saying that we have an undefined index in the view.

398
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:01,400
Because while I'm talking about specialty and talking about you,

399
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,340
b and so on,

400
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,000
remember that these are database.

401
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,480
So this is the old post cold where we're looking at the feels from the farm coming over?

402
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,250
No,

403
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,820
I'm using the same court in the view part,

404
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,660
but for the view page,

405
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,440
we need to use the data BCE related names.

406
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,050
Seconal.

407
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,050
Just go back to PHP my admin and refresh myself.

408
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:26,580
And that is date off birth and email address and contact number on.

409
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,760
Then we have the specialty.

410
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,010
I d situation here.

411
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,220
So let me just go ahead and change all the birth,

412
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,920
the managers and contact number.

413
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,500
All right,

414
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,140
So I change those old so results bit off birth email address contacts number on.

415
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,010
Then I refreshed my page and I see here that at least those are fixed.

416
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,350
But I still have that error on specialty.

417
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:48,160
So recall that with specialty because it's in another table.

418
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,470
What we're really going to see when we select star from that 10 detail is just the i d.

419
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:58,520
So we need to do an inner join on our quarry that were passing up.

420
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,320
So I'm just going to kind off copy.

421
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,490
This was done in the above one for all attendees.

422
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,660
That is the same quarry.

423
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:13,370
But the inner join always has to come before the were are so in SQL we always do inner joy

424
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,380
anywhere is almost always the last thing to come up.

425
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,530
So let me just go through the change.

426
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:18,930
I mean,

427
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:21,420
select star from attendee on,

428
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,040
We give attendee and a list.

429
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:32,040
I'm calling it a and then we see inner join specialties with an alias off s on both tables

430
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,650
in that speciality idea and it's not special.

431
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,710
The idea is that this is what the two tables have in common.

432
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,620
That's a nice way to look up when how to energy in tables.

433
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,140
What do the two have in common?

434
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,950
What they have in common is especially I d column on.

435
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:53,220
Then we say we're or attendee I d is equal to or boned our place older.

436
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,080
So then I go back to view on then I know that well,

437
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,920
when the whole inner join is done,

438
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,850
the value is really going to be called the name on Just to recap.

439
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,410
If we go to the specialty stable,

440
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,070
we see name.

441
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:13,870
So I'm listening to quickly do that SQL statement here so that we can see exactly what

442
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:17,560
happens so that we're not too confused.

443
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,600
So I'm just going to copy out this SQL statement on in PHP My admin.

444
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,180
I just went to the SQL tub.

445
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:29,090
I went to replace all that was in there with our SQL statement except on which actually

446
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,540
give this a value and I'm going to give it the value five on.

447
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,360
Then when I say go,

448
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,830
we see the full record coming back.

449
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,350
So that is what that rule looks like.

450
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:44,250
We see attendee i d the first name last name date of birth which ran those zeros.

451
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,060
Email address contacts,

452
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,110
number the specialty i d in the attendees table.

453
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:55,750
The special The idea in the specialty table on the name being name off the specialty.

454
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,120
So if we wanted name to be printed,

455
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:03,420
then we have to make reference to name in our courts are going back to the view pH I'm

456
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,820
making reference the results with subscript name.

457
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,890
So after doing all of those changes,

458
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,940
I can no well,

459
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,480
back to my view record.

460
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:19,200
And if I refresh once more than I see the correct value being printed right there No,

461
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,940
I just noticed that I was slight misalignment with my foot or my footers appearing inside

462
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,730
of this card.

463
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,570
That should happen.

464
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,140
More than likely I don't have on there we go.

465
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,320
So in my view page,

466
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,940
I copied it over only.

467
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,390
So if you're experiencing that,

468
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:34,990
you can speak.

469
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,380
Sit with me on.

470
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,760
Do we just close this Dave properly on?

471
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Then I re first on the order is restored.

472
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,710
So let's just review all that we did.

473
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:52,060
We modified our attendees age or view it in the speech where we're printing out every

474
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,180
single attendee that has registered to date on.

475
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,870
We put on off on action.

476
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,850
But that allows us to view the details on that specific attendee.

477
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:06,370
This view button is really just on Uncle Todd.

478
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:06,980
Firstly,

479
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:14,410
on DIT is linking to our view dot PHP page on it is passing over a Cory string in the URL

480
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,690
called I D.

481
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,380
So when we click it,

482
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:23,070
the expectation is that we're looking to see if I d came over in this query string on If it

483
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:23,260
did,

484
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:29,790
we get the value run on SQL statements that looks similar to this and bring back the

485
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:35,050
resulting data on then print it back to the screen.

486
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:35,910
No,

487
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:42,810
we did put some chord in to see if the I d value was not in your A something else should

488
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:43,210
happen.

489
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:50,060
What we did was to see Prince the error soul I'm going to remove.

490
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,440
So if we look in the euro seaview dot PHP and the query string,

491
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,450
if I remove just the query string and leave you dot PHP and print,

492
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,330
then we see our error message coming.

493
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,550
Please check details and dragging on all of this.

494
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,820
Arum Well,

495
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,050
everything that it's trying to buy into it can't buy into.

496
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:07,840
So actually,

497
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,590
as a last act,

498
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,050
am goingto flipper on this if statement,

499
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:16,100
so I'm going to see if not is set.

500
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,920
Meaning if he said if this doesn't exist,

501
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,230
right.

502
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,690
So when you put not too,

503
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,880
you're doing the negative.

504
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,510
So if not you said he set that,

505
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:31,120
then I want to a cool these statements.

506
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,530
All right,

507
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,510
so I'm checking for the negative First else.

508
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:37,820
Meaning otherwise that it is there.

509
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:45,160
So if not is that means those if the get i d super if they get idea in the Super Variable

510
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,720
does not exist.

511
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,270
Then we echo this error message else.

512
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,360
We want to do all of this,

513
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:00,280
and I'm going to actually move this disclosing breeze.

514
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:09,000
And I'm going to end this whole if block after this devious printed someone to go after

515
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,520
this def on,

516
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,210
then I'm going to start a PHP block,

517
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,380
and I want to say PHP on close.

518
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,660
The brace on then close appears to be block.

519
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,670
Know what this is going to do is actually just say,

520
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,820
if the get i d doesn't exist,

521
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,710
just prints the era message.

522
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,350
Otherwise,

523
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,610
if it exists,

524
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,310
which is what we're hoping for,

525
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,720
meaning it's in the URL.

526
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,750
Then we get the value and we get the results,

527
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,590
Andi,

528
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,370
In the same if block because it hasn't closed it all off.

529
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:45,720
This HTML will be rendered on everything.

530
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,050
Up until this closing,

531
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,140
um,

532
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,610
breeze will be done.

533
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,210
So if you look,

534
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:55,680
I'm clicking this Bridgestone here and it's gonna highlighting the breeze up here so these

535
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,840
braces are connected.

536
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,160
So when I refresh this speech,

537
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,290
if the girl isn't is empty,

538
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,770
then we're just going to see the era message.

539
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:11,940
We're not going to see any other nasty messages about anything not existing are are missing

540
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,220
or anything like that on.

541
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,430
Then If I put about the query string so I say ideas five,

542
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,160
then we get back.

543
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,510
Oh,

544
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,510
are red card now?

545
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:24,810
I encourage you to player on with the speed you can customize.

546
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,460
You make it into a profile page,

547
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,190
whatever it is,

548
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,840
put some more issues elements in their Andi.

549
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,610
If you had more details to the database and I have,

550
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,280
then you would have off more full details Page and I do.

551
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,780
But essentially the concept for me is the same.

552
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,940
You pass in.

553
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,660
The idea is a query string.

554
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,580
You get the value,

555
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,050
your in your query and then you print out your results,

556
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,070
I will be found.

557
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,360
This Listen valuable.

558
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,280
Andi,

559
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:54,180
these just remember to have fun as you modify this and customize it's to your liking.
