1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,860
Hey,

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,160
guys,

3
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:01,790
In this video,

4
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:07,790
we will be looking at how we go about adding functionality to delete records from or

5
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:08,580
application.

6
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,980
The objective of this video is to ensure that we have a button beside or view and edit

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,920
buttons that say is delete on unclean.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,100
It will proceed to remove whatever rule was selected.

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,650
Now the first teams I'm going to make is,

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,290
in my view,

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,360
records that PHP pH where I'm going to add another link,

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:36,480
which will go under my actions column some distant to duplicate my edit button on.

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,730
Then I'm going to change the text to see defeat on.

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,750
I'm also going to change it to Bt and Danger,

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,170
which give me a red button,

16
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:46,940
all right,

17
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,880
and then for my eight year,

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,000
if I will have delete that PHP.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,310
So after making that change and refreshing I know,

20
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:55,490
see,

21
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,130
that's have a red button on recall that all of them are printing,

22
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,040
wrote the attendee i d.

23
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:07,470
For the rule based on the iteration off that while loop so each off them would have the

24
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:13,300
same idea value At the end of the difference is that they're navigating the different pages

25
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:13,300
.

26
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,330
Now we can see that we have.

27
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:15,450
Ah,

28
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,690
spam record here.

29
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,010
Record number nine.

30
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,160
This person.

31
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,110
This This is not a person as far as this information would indicate.

32
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,650
So this is my target role for this operation.

33
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,320
By the end off this video,

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,400
I should be able to press the lead and remove this rule from the records.

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,670
So since our Borden is targeting a page called the Lead PH.

36
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,080
B,

37
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,170
we do what we have learned to Dubai.

38
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:40,540
No,

39
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,800
and go ahead and create a new file call.

40
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:50,720
It deletes dot GHB on then in this file where we'll just copy the most essential things

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,610
which are really just the require for the Devi connection.

42
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,860
So really and truly there two ways to handle delete.

43
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,040
Some people actually do a prompt.

44
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,730
Some people navigate to a page showing all the details of the record,

45
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:08,030
their bloated little and ask you once again if you're sure you want to delete on some

46
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:14,270
people want to click delete then that they just run the command and refers to a page on the

47
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,560
deletion would have happened.

48
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,420
So we're entity.

49
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,560
That third option,

50
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,060
Andi,

51
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:24,790
I challenge you to put in functionality that would actually have delete Load a page that

52
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,840
shows all the details off the record about to be deleted on,

53
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,900
then have another button that once it's clicked,

54
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,240
it will actually action that delete Kinton.

55
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,190
How you get that donors to use a form because on submit,

56
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:44,300
you could go to a post page where you actually get the i d and proceed to delete.

57
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,630
But for no,

58
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,170
I am just going to proceed with the simple my third,

59
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,350
where I'm just going to have my PHP block.

60
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,530
Andi,

61
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,380
I'm going to require my connection to the detail BCE on.

62
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:04,630
Then I'm going to check if the get variable exists.

63
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,310
So if it doesn't exist to remember,

64
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,740
we check for the negative.

65
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,410
So that's actually according pattern.

66
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,410
We check for the negative first,

67
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:17,970
take some action on the action on quantity or moment mixed up my braces here.

68
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:18,600
Action.

69
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,600
I'm going to take if the i d.

70
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,020
Sorry if I d doesn't exist in the get parameter.

71
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,830
I'm just going to print error on Remember that this is going to be part of our final

72
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,830
touches where we're going to create some construct that is more consistent with the error

73
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,050
message that we don't have to keep on typing it over and over.

74
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,410
But otherwise,

75
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,470
if it does exist,

76
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,740
so that's else,

77
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:49,560
then I'm going to get that idea value and place it inside off a variable called I D.

78
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,530
Then what would be nice is to call the crowd function that will remove the record on,

79
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,150
then redirect to our list.

80
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,220
So I did some comments here so that as it puts in the cool,

81
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,790
we know exactly what's happening.

82
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,270
But the point is that when it hits this speech,

83
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,030
we just want to get the i d.

84
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:12,790
Run the court to delete it from the database and then redirect wants that operation was

85
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,630
successful.

86
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,710
So we need a function in our crowd up in our crowd class that handles deleting.

87
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,840
So we have insert,

88
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,350
we have edit on.

89
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,210
We have some gets so on.

90
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:24,850
Anything gets,

91
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm going to put the delete,

92
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,060
so I'm just going to write up the public function.

93
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,660
Delete attendee on this function is taking a parameter called I d Onda.

94
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,920
We will be Skelly be doing very,

95
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,060
very similar things.

96
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,900
Once again,

97
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,370
you see that all the patterns kind of repeat themselves.

98
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:49,130
So we're declaring an SQL statement where we're going to see elite from on the table.

99
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:58,840
Name is attendee were attendee underscore idea is equal toe are place holder i d After we

100
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,480
write up or SQL statements,

101
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,030
you know that we need to prepare its understand to copy that copy and paste,

102
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,740
so don't have to re type on that.

103
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,670
I'm going to do the same with the binding off the I d parameter.

104
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:16,120
So most of those things we're doing our in over get attend the details,

105
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,570
Right?

106
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:24,540
So these stop three or these two in addition toe the execute on,

107
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,850
then we can return our results.

108
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,940
All right,

109
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,260
so well,

110
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,440
we didn't wouldn't be clear results,

111
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,430
So we really don't even need toe return anything at that point,

112
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,720
we'll could just return True.

113
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,130
So once again,

114
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,270
it's always a good idea to have our try catch.

115
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,440
So I haven't been very consistent with that,

116
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,990
but in our finishing touches,

117
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,300
we will definitely tighten up on those things.

118
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:56,110
But for no I'll just say try on do all of what we just outlined the snow on.

119
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,330
Then once that is done,

120
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,040
we return true on.

121
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,170
Then I'm just going to borrow the catch freeze from another function on.

122
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:12,390
We want to tear up the same operation to catch any zero that may occur in between while

123
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,240
we're turning falls.

124
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:21,360
So then I can see back on my delete page that we want to call or should objects?

125
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,760
Well,

126
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,630
we want to assign the results.

127
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:35,600
The all come off our form shown call toe the delete attendee function in our fraud objects

128
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:35,600
.

129
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,580
So I pass in the i d parameter as we got it from the gets on.

130
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:53,580
Then we see if result Then we redirect So redirection is hitter Onda we open and close

131
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,860
parentheses And then inside of this report a text which has location,

132
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:06,990
colon and view records that PHP because you want to redirect toe our list stuff reports.

133
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,570
So if if results are successful,

134
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,100
then we want to do that else.

135
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,670
We want a print,

136
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,850
that generic aero message.

137
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,270
All right,

138
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,730
so let us try this operation.

139
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,800
The point once again is that once it hits the speech,

140
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,780
it's going to connect to the database.

141
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,510
Get the well check if there is a value coming over in the quarry string.

142
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,280
If not,

143
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,130
then he's going to print an error on.

144
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,980
Then we're going to see if there is a value.

145
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,050
We want that value.

146
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,170
Then you want to call the delete function on.

147
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:47,580
Then we want to redirect The view requires once that's done so it would almost be

148
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,370
transparent to the user is complete.

149
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:58,130
And the page should refresh toe after this operation happens rather quickly so we can just

150
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,800
go back over here.

151
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,250
I would just look with three fresh and they were targeting this rule.

152
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,100
So let's see,

153
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,550
before court works,

154
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,260
we pressed.

155
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,440
Delete Andi,

156
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,180
I have a spelling error here,

157
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:17,690
so I'm going to go back into my crowed function on and I have attendee with one t in my SQL

158
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,320
statement.

159
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,480
So that was the error.

160
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,320
Someone to try again on notice.

161
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,220
All the your looks.

162
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,150
It is the lead.

163
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,710
PHP i d is nine,

164
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,490
but I'm going to go back and I'm going to start over some clicking.

165
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,940
Delete on.

166
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,680
There we go.

167
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,820
It's removed.

168
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,250
So it didn't prompt it didn't show the details off the record once again,

169
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,330
That's that The simplest,

170
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:43,850
quickest way to delete a record on off course deletes are not reversible.

171
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:50,090
So if we wanted a least putting a prompt because sometimes users me miss click.

172
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,100
They think they're clicking at it and treat delete.

173
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,860
But we don't want to just remove it upon an accidental click.

174
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:02,400
We can actually just use JavaScript and insert a quick prompt into the peace without when

175
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:02,960
it's clicked.

176
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,220
There is bare prompt,

177
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,580
a default prompt so,

178
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:06,970
you know,

179
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,910
confirmed the quick action.

180
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,440
So back in our court,

181
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,960
back in the view records page,

182
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,700
I'm going to edit the uncle Time for the delete on.

183
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:22,160
I'm going to add a JavaScript function called on Click on the value that will be assigned

184
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,140
to this will be returned and then confirm.

185
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,650
So this is,

186
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:26,860
ah,

187
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:34,410
javascript function called confirm where you actually pass in some text here.

188
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,370
That would be like a promise they be something like,

189
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:43,280
Are you sure you want to delete this record?

190
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,910
All right,

191
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,430
so the expectation is that when they click this link,

192
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,260
they're going to be prompted through some beef,

193
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,220
all of javascript.

194
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,410
So this is almost built into the browser,

195
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,320
writes Amy,

196
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,380
look different from Brazil,

197
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:56,680
bro's.

198
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,270
Or but the fact is that on click,

199
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,810
it will show the confirmation prompt.

200
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,080
Are you sure you want to delete this record on.

201
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,410
It won't go any further until the difficulty.

202
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,340
If they could cancer,

203
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:14,110
then the operation is The quick operation is canceled so it would not navigate to the next

204
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:14,650
page.

205
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,170
All right,

206
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,630
so we can test that.

207
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,210
I'm going to refresh after making that change on.

208
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,320
Then I'm going toe accidentally.

209
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,860
Click the lead beside Mary Poppins on Look at that,

210
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,480
it's asking.

211
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,990
Are you sure you want to delete this?

212
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,390
Reports.

213
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,210
I can always cancel on cancer the operation.

214
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,610
And if I click okey,

215
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,470
then Miri's required would be deleted.

216
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,080
And ironically,

217
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:41,900
deleting records is pretty much the easiest and quickest thing you can do on recovering

218
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,200
from.

219
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,290
It is probably the most tedious and time consuming procedure,

220
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:52,920
but that's it for this video on That is So you go about completing your crowed operations.

221
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,760
We did creates.

222
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,440
We did read.

223
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,690
We did updates on this one is delete
