1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,550
Hey,

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:01,940
guys,

3
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:07,270
welcome to this video where we will be applying some finishing touches to our application

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,930
meeting will be cleaning up some cold,

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:14,160
cleaning up some off the visual elements and just look handsome little key concepts that

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,100
could help us be a bit more modular.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,220
So I'll get straight into it.

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,690
And the first time thing that we want to do is to add more,

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,610
try catches toe our code.

10
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:29,210
We would have had some functions where we didn't put in all the track catches.

11
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,200
So I'm just going to go into my crowd,

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,710
file my crowd class and you notice that some functions tried and caught exception.

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,190
Others didn't.

14
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,920
And so what I'm going to do is just wrap each one inside off a track at someone to start

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,150
with,

16
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,350
get a Cindy's and remember that all we need is a word.

17
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,660
Try on then,

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,120
Considering that we already have tries and catches all over the place,

19
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,800
we're really just trying to catch the same type of exception,

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,940
which is the PDO exception.

21
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,350
Second,

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:05,100
just really write the word try and copy and peace to catch on just weeks my Indian t shun

23
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,510
on.

24
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,530
I want to do it for this one function.

25
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,750
So I challenge you to go ahead and do it for the other cell,

26
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,470
completely others off screen,

27
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,010
and then we can reconvene.

28
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,020
All right,

29
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,240
so that I would have completed it.

30
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:17,890
Andi,

31
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,630
every function has that try catch?

32
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:20,880
No,

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,550
some of them me returned.

34
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,110
Mixed results.

35
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,740
Meaning you're returning results as well.

36
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,630
Results from a query on,

37
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,920
then in the catch here,

38
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,680
returning fall.

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,170
So the thing is,

40
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:34,700
because PSV soul kiss Orwell type insensitive,

41
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,950
rather or loosely typed,

42
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,190
it doesn't really matter.

43
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,310
So if I checked if results,

44
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,680
that would actually return a true on,

45
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,190
def,

46
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,730
I'm returning false than it would literally return force.

47
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:52,220
They can still kind of use that The fact that it's not returning the same data type,

48
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,100
right?

49
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,850
Um,

50
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,090
but on the other side,

51
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,620
you can actually check the variable.

52
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,210
So if the variable has data and it's not returning anything negative,

53
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,620
then it would be a true regardless off the content on,

54
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,170
Well,

55
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,550
the function would return falls either way.

56
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,130
Now that's the first and possibly the easiest thing that we have to do.

57
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:17,840
The next thing that I want us to look at is setting up success and aero messages so we can

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,500
go to our success that Ph b ah file.

59
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,510
And here we would see where we were echoing a success message versus a failure message.

60
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,870
No,

61
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:35,100
What I would want to do is actually just kind of have a generic arrow message on the

62
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,900
generic success,

63
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,310
Mrs.

64
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,780
So without being toe specific.

65
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,010
Because then based on the page,

66
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,500
you're going to have to re type this every time.

67
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,060
On we saw that we can off ran into a little blood,

68
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,850
our got lease,

69
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,680
and we just started echoing arrow instead off echoing actual error messages.

70
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,960
So what I'm going to do is create and includes while filing the includes folders are click

71
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,400
on the ankles folder on.

72
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,920
I'm going to call this one error that PHP on.

73
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,760
I'm also just going to create another file.

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,050
Same time success,

75
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:10,840
well,

76
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,480
success message.

77
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,050
So let me qualify it as message because I already have a file called Success,

78
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,930
Not Petri.

79
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,780
So success message that PHP on.

80
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:28,550
I'm just going to right click on error on Rename it to error message dot PHP.

81
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:34,830
Now these two will just have on each dinner block where I'm just printing.

82
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,280
Well,

83
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,830
I'm actually going to go to Bootstrap.

84
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,640
And instead of using the H one tags by themselves,

85
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,750
I'm actually going to prints on alert.

86
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,090
So both sharp has alerts component on this is what they look like.

87
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,910
So I want our green alert whenever it's a success and,

88
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,430
ah,

89
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,930
red alert whenever it is on error.

90
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,260
So I can just copy their code and I look for the one that's a success.

91
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,380
So by no hope,

92
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,230
where are comfortable?

93
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,390
The fact that most things in bootstrap that are green are success.

94
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,550
The color The naming is pretty much consistent across all the controls.

95
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,120
But I'm just going to take this thief class.

96
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,510
Place it inside my success message that PHP file on.

97
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,290
I'm just going to reward this,

98
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,160
Andi,

99
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,960
if I want,

100
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,540
I can probably make it on each one,

101
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,650
but I'll just leave it a Leave it as default.

102
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,780
So success messages going to just give a generic success to say operation has been

103
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,650
completed.

104
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,510
Andi,

105
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,160
I'm going to see an error message.

106
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,350
I just use this one to danger.

107
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,960
So it's the same alert constructs just with danger.

108
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,480
Instead,

109
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,220
on the error message will say operation and confident error.

110
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,830
Please retry.

111
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,220
All right,

112
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,030
so you can put your own messages.

113
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,050
But the fact is you want some level of consistency instead off.

114
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:53,890
I mean,

115
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,120
if you want custom messages per screen,

116
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,700
that's fine.

117
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,560
That's totally fine.

118
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,410
I'm not saying it's wrong or bad.

119
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:05,410
I'm just modifying my own so that I don't have toe continues to be typing all these things

120
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:05,410
.

121
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:11,690
So what I'm going to do is when I would have printed an error,

122
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,680
actually,

123
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:20,090
just include the file that gives me that are a message.

124
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,070
So right here,

125
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,260
I'll just include Andi,

126
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:33,850
I would say includes which is a folder slash error message dot PHP.

127
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,620
All right,

128
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,590
So the expectation is that if I navigate to this speech and this is the edit page,

129
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,670
if I never get to this speech on,

130
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,610
there is no I d.

131
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,420
I would have printed an error.

132
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,280
But instead,

133
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,180
what I expect to see is the error message well,

134
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,720
coming up as an alert.

135
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,150
So let's test that theory.

136
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,050
So if I go to my page and I click on the edit,

137
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,300
then the expectations that we see the formed it,

138
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,770
it's Mary Poppins is record.

139
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,240
But then the Aramis.

140
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,540
It should come up if there is no I d parameter meaning somebody just went up here and type

141
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,850
in the URL to the edit page but did not put in the query string.

142
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,650
So when I do that and press enter,

143
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:24,440
then I see my ERA message coming up on This is what we would have embedded in our page

144
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,040
through our includes.

145
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,710
So what I'm going to do is go through each file that would have printed an error on where I

146
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,840
would have had an error message.

147
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,550
I'm going to replace it with my include.

148
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,960
So then off making these changes,

149
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,870
I would have made the change to edit edit post op,

150
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,230
Ph.

151
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,910
B View,

152
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:45,320
Ph.

153
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,560
B even myself,

154
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,540
says speech,

155
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:53,920
where I had been printing error viewer record with No other one was skipped on delete.

156
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,290
All right,

157
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:59,760
so all of those pages would have been updated on in the same way that ended this for the

158
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,160
error.

159
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,600
I just do that for the success message file,

160
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,840
so I just go back to well,

161
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,850
wherever I would have had success and I would have had success being printed on this screen

162
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,670
where you have been registered.

163
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:18,080
So just replace this with success message on anywhere else.

164
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,480
You would have been printing a message to say something was successful.

165
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,050
You can go ahead and just include that file.

166
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:32,010
The next thing I want to do is to prevent people from actually navigating to this speech

167
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,630
without the presence off the choir strings.

168
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,340
So one way to do that would just be to say,

169
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,510
if there is no choir string.

170
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,730
If I d doesn't take this,

171
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:44,140
this redirect back toe some page that everybody would see.

172
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,150
So if they tried toe type in edit dot PHP by itself,

173
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,230
then it checks.

174
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:49,580
It sees.

175
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,420
There's no question,

176
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,970
and it just re navigates toe.

177
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,220
At least view records,

178
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:53,910
a PHP.

179
00:07:53,910 --> 00:08:00,850
So an easy way to accomplish that would be to go to our page like Edit on did in this part

180
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,390
where well,

181
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:05,160
we just change Toto print the error message.

182
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:11,030
But I could easily just say header on inside of that.

183
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,990
We just put the location colon on,

184
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,930
save you.

185
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:22,330
Records start PHP are So what this would do is if there is a navigation attempts to this

186
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:22,700
page,

187
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,450
which is our edit page on the header.

188
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,000
Well,

189
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,950
the under idea is not in the query stream.

190
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,190
Then it just redirects.

191
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:32,560
All right,

192
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,650
So we could actually do that for,

193
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,630
you know,

194
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,600
for the edits.

195
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,170
Who could do that for a post Anywhere that you're concerned that people should not end up

196
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:48,320
without having the cart informations under that for they header Andi Well,

197
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,590
for delete.

198
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:55,130
So somebody tries to go to the lead page to the lead page without putting in the query

199
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:55,750
string.

200
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,950
Then we will just redirect.

201
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:59,760
All right,

202
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,820
So those modifications have been easy enough.

203
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:08,920
Another one that I would want to do is put some space between my felt navigation bar and

204
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,210
the content that comes immediately after.

205
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:15,640
So you'd have seen with the error message that it was actually seemingly attached to the

206
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,160
nut bar,

207
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,180
which I don't want,

208
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,550
So I want a little space there,

209
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,700
So I'm just going to go to my header file on.

210
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,130
What I'll do is at the bottom off the nav bar.

211
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,240
I'll just put a PR chug right.

212
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,160
Remember that this is rendering on a per page and it's rendering the top part off the issue

213
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,310
Mill contents or enough bar on.

214
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,650
Then I wanted to also render a space all the time.

215
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,830
So what's going to happen is that when I navigate between these pages,

216
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,050
we know CS space,

217
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:50,750
so the table is no longer seemingly attached to enough bar.

218
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:59,290
I would have said that good website design would have all speak every page reachable from

219
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,410
every other peach.

220
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,670
So in other words,

221
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,190
if I go to the details speed,

222
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:08,980
I should be either be able to go back to the listing page or to any other page on DSO.

223
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:14,410
What I'm going to do is add buttons here that would actually allow me toe head back to the

224
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:19,410
list or edit this record or delete this record from this view.

225
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,950
So I'm going to go to view dot PHP on.

226
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,690
Then we will modify over html toe,

227
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,600
reflect what we require.

228
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,730
So in my view,

229
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,060
Ph.

230
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,090
B page at the end off that card,

231
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,910
I wanted three buns to be printed,

232
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:42,660
so I'm I'm just going to bar these three buttons here from view records on what they are.

233
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:42,860
Well,

234
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,710
one is back to least one is any 23 leads.

235
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,550
I'm just going to borrow them on me.

236
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,480
The changes accordingly Go back to view,

237
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,880
piece them underneath.

238
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,830
Or maybe I can.

239
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:58,870
I'll place them under the dif so we have the card and then we have the three buttons asking

240
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,780
you which direction you wish to go.

241
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:05,750
So the 1st 1 I'm going to see this one should be back to list.

242
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:11,620
And I'm going to meet that one BT and in four.

243
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,630
So it's a light blue like a teal.

244
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,020
All right,

245
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,410
so this one would say about two list,

246
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,700
which means that the H ref should be view records,

247
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,500
not Ph.

248
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:30,600
B on viewer cars does not require any form off idee query string on so we can remove all of

249
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,580
that from the eight riff on.

250
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,960
We just have the button to go back to list.

251
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,320
Next we have the edit button on de everything else can hear me in the same except I'm using

252
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,890
the variable results in this speech toe represent any off those values.

253
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:52,580
So I'm going to just change this are to result so without changing the Alami explains.

254
00:11:52,580 --> 00:12:00,510
So I'm printing on Uncle Tug on the trip is reddit dot PHP on I'm passing in the quarry

255
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:00,980
stream,

256
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:06,720
just like I would have done from the view record speech passing a query string on the value

257
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,740
for the i.

258
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,350
D.

259
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,830
Variably inside of that query string is going to be that 10 d I d.

260
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:17,810
Now the reason I changed it from our t the word result is I copied the button.

261
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:24,770
From here on in the viewer records file are is the designated variable.

262
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,390
However,

263
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,580
in our view file,

264
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:31,580
we see that we're using the variable results everywhere we're referencing a value.

265
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:37,390
So I'm just going to make sure that I'm echoing results with the subscript attendee I d

266
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,730
into that query string area on.

267
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,950
Then I'm going to repeat this feat for the delete,

268
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:49,560
which is right below on some echoing result.

269
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,170
Attendee i e no.

270
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,280
When I refreshed my page,

271
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,660
I see my three buttons And if I hover,

272
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,450
I see that this one goes back to viewer cars.

273
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,970
This one goes to edit on this one from's for a delete.

274
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:01,380
Andi,

275
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,770
I'm just going to add a br tag in between.

276
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,940
So one br tag after the div so that it's not,

277
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,300
you know,

278
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,140
attached.

279
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,820
All right,

280
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,470
so there we go.

281
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,130
So these are action buttons so if we click view,

282
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,070
we can always go back to the list.

283
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,040
I click view again.

284
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,560
I can go straight to the edit If I go back to the list and notice are edit.

285
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,140
Page doesn't have a button to go back to the list.

286
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,600
It only has something to save changes we may not want to see.

287
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,640
It changes all the time.

288
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,660
Probably just clicked it to see if it worked.

289
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,330
I don't know.

290
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:34,830
I want to go back to the list so you can feel free to add that back to list button.

291
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,400
So the edit record just the same.

292
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,410
Andi,

293
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:42,900
if we go back to view and I pressed the lead that is going to promise me and ask me if I'm

294
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,360
sure if I click OK,

295
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,150
then we would have removed Mary from over database.

296
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:52,380
The last thing I want to look at is form validation.

297
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:52,820
No,

298
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,430
we didn't put much,

299
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,320
if any validation in tow.

300
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,860
Our form,

301
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:02,100
the validation that would probably be there is based on the input types that we would have

302
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:02,680
selected.

303
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,260
So if I go to my index speech,

304
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,010
which is my registration form page,

305
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,890
I well,

306
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:14,800
I did not enforce which values would be required.

307
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,280
So I can actually using HTML five just right in.

308
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:26,680
The attribute required on what this will do is actually force the browser to see that that

309
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,750
field is required.

310
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,080
So if I click submit,

311
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,940
it will prompt me to say,

312
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,920
please follow this field because it is required so I can go further.

313
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,520
If it is not,

314
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,340
Phil does.

315
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:37,770
All right.

316
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:42,940
So that's the easiest way to enforce some form of validation and informs.

317
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,300
I'm just going to be the first name on the last name required Onda.

318
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:47,900
Well,

319
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,760
this one is kind of implied because of value is always going to be present instead of for

320
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,850
select but at least an email address.

321
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,370
So we need at least your first name.

322
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,280
Your last name of specialty and any military you don't need your phone number on.

323
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,710
Those are the required fields for this form.

324
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:10,140
So if I had put required in all of these places Onda save and then refresh when I tried to

325
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,700
submit,

326
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,080
Okay,

327
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,150
first name is required.

328
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,190
I tried to submit again.

329
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:13,370
No,

330
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,050
it was on to second the last name on.

331
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:21,340
Then I tried to submit again and email address is also required on I'm just going to go

332
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,630
ahead and fill in this person's data.

333
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,470
Andi,

334
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:30,410
meet them a part of a system just to make sure that we didn't break anything in our cord to

335
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,770
submit on.

336
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,340
There it is.

337
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,360
So operation has been completed on mere waters has been added.

338
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,250
Now there is another level off form validation,

339
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,370
which is services.

340
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,930
What we're doing here is client side validation.

341
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:49,980
But there is also service at validation where we can actually scrutinize the values a bit

342
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,550
more.

343
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,370
Andi,

344
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:56,310
conduct all operations right there would have done what you call a self posting.

345
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,280
Meaning instead,

346
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,910
off posting toe a different page,

347
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:06,340
we would have posted to the same page that the forms information is being submitted from on

348
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:06,340
.

349
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,450
Then we would have carried out all off operations in that same page.

350
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:10,920
However,

351
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,290
I won't go through that for this exercise,

352
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:13,920
at least,

353
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,290
right?

354
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:14,560
No.

355
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,120
You should be proficient enough to build a form on build out.
